Skimming of spilled crude resumed in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday after the first hurricane of the Atlantic season forced the Coast Guard and BP to halt cleanup efforts for two days .
Rough seas and high winds from Hurricane Alex brought all surface skimming , controlled burns of oil patches on the water and spraying of chemical dispersants to a standstill .
On Friday , skimmers were back at work along the shoreline and the Coast Guard was able to make a helicopter surveillance flight to assess the impact from the storm .
The spill began April 20 , when BP's Macondo well blew out in mile - deep water , destroying the Deepwater Horizon Drilling rig and killing 11 workers .
As the cleanup resumed Friday , BP and government officials were trying to decide whether to replace the lower marine riser package cap that has been collecting oil from the well since June 3 with a cap that might collect more , but also would increase flow into the gulf during installation .
Officials probably will make that decision at the end of next week , after a new vessel is in place to double the rate of oil collection , retired Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , who is heading the government 's response to the spill , said Friday .
Replacing the cap could boost collection capacity further , from 53,000 to 80,000 barrels per day , Allen said .
But it would unleash torrents of oil for as long as it takes to remove a stub of riser pipe at the wellhead and to bolt another cap on top , he said .
The Discoverer Enterprise , which is connected directly to that riser , would be unable to catch any crude during the recapping process .
But two other vessels capturing oil - the Helix Producer and the Q4000 - would keep working .
" So it would n't be a complete , unmitigated release , " Allen said .
" But all of this is being weighed very , very carefully . "
Replacing the cap is the latest in a string of proposals to capture more of the oil from a gusher that scientists say is spewing 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day .
Before this week 's hurricane , about 20,000 barrels of oil were being skimmed or burned off daily , Coast Guard Rear Adm .
Paul Zukunft said in a briefing .
To date , 28.2 million gallons of oily water has been skimmed from the Gulf surface .
The Coast Guard said the U.S. Navy will provide 25 additional skimmers and 35 tow boats to help in the effort .
The Deepwater Horizon Unified Command plans to increase the number of skimmers available to a target of 750 by mid-July and more by the beginning of August .

It can only be accessed via a disc mounting tool .
Image caption Calcium supplements are commonly taken by older people at risk of fracture
Calcium supplements taken by many older people could be increasing their risk of a heart attack , research shows .
The study , in the British Medical Journal , said people who took supplements were 30 % more likely to have a heart attack .
Data from 11 trials also suggested the medicines were not very effective at preventing bone fractures .
Almost 3 m people in the UK are thought to have osteoporosis and many take calcium pills to prevent fractures .
The study recommends doctors review their use of calcium supplements for managing osteoporosis .
The National Osteoporosis Society said most people should be able to get enough calcium through their diets , rather than reaching for the medicine cabinet .
The researchers said those who had a diet naturally high in calcium were at no increased danger .
' Limited benefit '
In all 12,000 people aged over 40 took part in the trials of calcium supplements of 500 mg or more a day .
It is a balance of risks - people should consider the risks involved and how they apply to their own circumstances and discuss the matter with their GP Dr Alison Avenell , Study author
The risk of heart attack was seen across men and women , was independent of age and the type of supplement given .
A small increased risk of death was seen in the study but was not statistically significant , the researchers said .
The reason for the increased risk of heart attack is not clear but it is thought the extra calcium circulating in the blood could lead to a hardening of the arteries .
Calcium in the diet is safe and the Food Standards Agency recommends adults have 700 mg of calcium a day from milk , cheese and green , leafy vegetables .
Dr Alison Avenell , from the University of Aberdeen which did the research with colleagues in New Zealand and the US , said the evidence suggests calcium supplements only have a limited benefit in preventing fractures , especially when compared to other treatments available .
" It is a balance of risks - people should consider the risks involved and how they apply to their own circumstances and discuss the matter with their GP , " she said .
She added the results did not necessarily apply to younger people with conditions for which they take calcium .
Judy O'Sullivan , senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said the results should be interpreted with caution because the trials did not set out to look at the risk of heart attack .
" However , the research should not be completely ignored , " she said .
" Any new guidelines on the prevention of fractures in those most vulnerable to them should take this type of analysis into account . "
Dr Claire Bowring , of the National Osteoporosis Society , said : " We 've always recommended that people should aim to get the calcium they need from their diet to help build stronger bones .
" If you get all of the calcium that you need from your diet and adequate vitamin D from exposure to sunshine , then a supplement will not be necessary . "
She said there were still questions to be answered about the treatment of osteoporosis but advised people taking calcium supplements to talk to their GP , especially if they have a heart condition .
- 2007.01.15 - Tip Jar
It seems that Low End Mac has taken on something of a keyboardobsession in the last year or so .
It started with a few articlesabout the Matias Tactile Pro keyboard ( Has ' the Best Keyboard Apple Ever Made ' BeenResurrected ? ) , then moved to afew articles looking back at older keyboards , notably the Apple Extended , Extended II , and the Northgate OmniKey .
My laptop articles have often focused on the relative meritsand / or weaknesses of laptop keyboards , including the good ( MacBook , PowerBook , ThinkPad ) , the horrible ( Dell ) , and everything inbetween .
The one constant , however , is that the keyboard is thepart of your computer that you touch the most , and , strangely , it 'sthe part that most buyers pay the least amount of attention to .
It 's not a matter of Mac vs. PC or how many function keys youwant , but of build quality and switch type .
There are many types ofkeyboard mechanisms , but all keyboards sold in the last 20 or soyears use either an Alps Switch , a buckling spring , scissor , orsoft dome to get their feel , along with a membrane switch toregister the keypress .
Clearly the most important thing that any keyboard does isregisters the letters that you type , but how it feels in thatprocess can make the difference between fast and accurate typingand slow and sloppy gibberish generation .
After reading Charles W. Moore ' scolumns for years , I know that he prefers keyboards with a softtouch .
In his case , it 's due to a medical condition , although hemay very well have subjective reasons for that preference aswell .
I prefer a heavy , clicky keyboard .
Clearly , Mr. Moore and Iprobably wo n't find happiness typing on the same keyboard , thoughstrangely two models are on both of our lists of the best keyboardsever made : the WallStreetPowerBook and the PowerBook1400 .
I like those two keyboards because of the precise mechanicalfeel and the distinct feel when the key bottoms .
These are softkeyboards , but they 're also made with high - quality scissormechanisms that are precise and have no slop .
Slop equals typographical errors , and typographical errors equalwasted time and effort .
A soft keyboard also influences how thetypist 's hands must rest ( on or off the keys ) and what sort ofresistance is felt when entering a keypress .
Most of us can adapt quite easily to a soft or firmkeyboard .
A ThinkPad 's keyboard has a much longer key travel and muchhigher effort than the keys on a PowerBook 1400 or WallStreet .
Thefeel is totally different , but it's also my absolute favoritelaptop keyboard ever , with the MacBook a close second ( shorttravel , but firm action ) .
Firm action may hurt the fingers of some typists , but I find itreduces fatigue as I can rest my fingers on the next key that I 'lltype rather than maintaining tension by holding my fingers abovethe keyboard .
The IBM Model M Keyboard
Which brings me to my favorite keyboard , one that has seenupwards of ten computers ( both PC and Mac , sometimes both with aKVM switch ) , 21 years , and millions of words .
It is the famousIBM Model Mkeyboard , in my case one of the earliest PS / 2 models made inlate 1986 .
MyModel M was n't pretty , with all sorts of dust inside and the keyscovered in crud , but it worked great and is still the fastest andmost accurate keyboard that I 've ever used .
Over the holidays Ifollowed the care and feeding advice over at clickykeyboards.com , and nowmy Model M looks shiny and new again .
So happy was I that I went back to clickykeyboards and ordered abrand - new , unopened 1995 Model M to use at the office , replacing afairly new and quite nice Microsoft wireless keyboard .
With the Model M , I type faster than on other keyboards - much faster .
My personal best on a laptop was 50 words perminute on my old 12 " PowerBook .
I 'vehit about the same speed on my various ThinkPads , MacBooks , andToshibas , but the 12 " PowerBook was , in my opinion , the fastestlaptop keyboard .
I just took a typing test using my old Model M and hit 64 wordsper minute - and I had fewer typos in the process .
There 's justsomething right about the design ; I really can't describe it otherthan saying that my finger always presses hard enough and never toohard on a Model M - are two of the many reasons for typos on lesserkeyboards .
Of course you still have to hit the right key , but even thatseems easier on this most magical of keyboards .
The new one I justbought cost almost $ 70 for something made well over a decade ago , and I consider it a bargain .
Buckling Springs
Whatmakes the IBM Model M so good ?
It 's all in the spring - bucklingsprings , to be precise .
A buckling spring is a mechanism thatcarries tension until enough force is applied to " buckle " thespring , at which point it collapses and the key can travel down , producing an audible click when it does .
What makes these keyboards so sound so distinctive ( and so loud ) is that the spring makes another distinct click when tension isrelease and the spring pops back into its original shape .
Ineffect , you get two fairly loud clicks every time a key is pressed , making you sound twice as fast as you really are - not to mentionannoying anyone in a nearby cubicle .
So noisy are these that IBM had to offer a " quiet " model ( nobuckling spring ) for libraries and such .
Of course , while noisy and intrusive to your neighbors , there 'sone very good reason why the buckling spring keyboard remained inproduction for so many years and why it 's something of a specialtyitem today .
Those switches are very expensive compared to the cheaprubber domes in use today , and it's those switches that give thiskeyboard its legendary feel ( and make it too expensive for this ageof made - in - China mass - production ) .
A Modern Model M with USB
You can still buy a brand - new Model M , and not only unsold oldones like mine , but a brand - new current production model .
Unicomp still makes new Model Ms , only they call it a customizer .
This is your only option if youwant Windows keys ( a huge convenience for use on a Mac ) andnative USB support .
IBM and later Lexmark Model M keyboards all endin either a PS / 2 connector , which can be adapted to USB , or theeven older AT connector , which can also be adapted but is moredifficult to deal with .
Many of the old keyboards also were madefor point - of - sale terminals and cannot , to my knowledge , be used ona modern computer of any platform .
Still , whether you get a new one from Unicomp or a used orunsold IBM , it 's definitely worth the effort if you like a firmkeypress .
Unicomp offers a wide variety of styles , includingcolored ( including black ) keyboards ; keyboards with built - intrackballs , pointing sticks or both ; and your choice of USB or PS / 2 and Windows keys or no Windows keys .
A plain black one with USB and Windows keys will be the best fitfor most Mac and PC users these days .
Other Great Keyboards
Are there other great keyboards out there ?
Clearly , the Northgate and Apple ' boards mentioned in previous articles allappear worthy of consideration , and by the sound of it so does the Matias Tactile Pro .
I used to use an Apple Extended Keyboard II back in the day andremember it fondly .
In fact , it was the only keyboard other than myold IBM Model M that I 've ever hooked up to one of my desktopcomputers .
I prefer the feel ( but not the sound ) of the Model M tothe Extended II , but both are clearly high quality keyboards withexcellent feel and very fast action .
It really is a sad thing to look at the keyboards that come withmost computers these days .
Whether you buy the cheapest $ 200 e Machines or the fanciest , highest spec Mac Pro , you 're getting a plastic keyboardof dubious quality .
Apple 's keyboards are crumb magnets , and mostPC keyboards are so flimsy that they wo n't support the weight ofthose crumbs .
An old Model M , Extended II , or OmniKey may be justwhat your Mac or PC needs .
One thing is certain :
If you generate a lot of text , you owe ityourself to get a decent keyboard .
When I took a three day trip last month and had a writingproject due , I brought my Model M in my luggage .
My current ToshibaPortegé has a comparatively good keyboard for a laptop - good enough that I 've used it to generate copious prose - but giventhe choice , I 'll take my 20 - year - old IBM Model M any day of theweek .
Editor 's note : I 'm a huge fan of the discontinued Logitech Cordless EliteDuo , which is far better than any recent Apple keyboard and hasgreat drivers for OS X .
I simply can't work with any Applekeyboard made in the past several years - they 're just too mushy .dk
Most iPhone users love AT&T
A fan in Tokyo shows off his new iPhone 4 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite a very vocal group of detractors , the vast majority of iPhone users love AT&T .
That 's the key finding in a survey released this week by Yankee Group , which reports that 73 % of iPhone users are very satisfied with AT&T 's service .
That rating compares favorably to how non-iPhone smartphone users feel about AT&T , and even to how non-iPhone users feel about other wireless providers .
The satisfaction rate of AT&T subscribers as a whole is 68 % , and only 69 % of smartphone users say they are satisfied with their mobile provider , Yankee Group found .
The results are surprising , given the pounding AT&T has taken in the media and on the blogosphere about its service - related issues with the iPhone .
On CNNMoney 's recent stories " AT&T and Apple 's marriage made in hell , " and " AT&T : The most hated company in iPhone land , " reader comments were overwhelmingly negative toward the wireless network .
AT&T 's recent iPad- related security glitch and mishandling of the iPhone 4 launch likely did n't do much to help its reputation .
Plus , iPhone owners pay AT&T nearly $ 12 a month more for service than the average smartphone user .
Tech analysts like to point out the ways in which AT&T is a drag on the iPhone .
Gartner Research Director Carolina Milanesi said last month that AT&T 's network has " limited the iPhone experience . "
And Drake Johnstone , an analyst with Davenport & Co. , forecasted that poor experiences with AT&T would drive as many as 40 % of iPhone customers to Verizon once that network gets the iPhone .
So what explains Yankee Group 's conclusion that iPhone users ' love AT&T ?
" Consumers transfer the high gloss of their Apple iPhone experience to AT&T , " says Carl Howe , Yankee Group analyst and author of the study .
" The iPhone creates a halo effect that rubs off . "
In other words , iPhone customers ' praise for their network may be a result of the famous " reality distortion field " that surrounds Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) CEO Steve Jobs and his company 's products .
But AT&T says its network really is n't as bad as many people think .
It 's a perception problem , not a service problem , in the company 's eyes .
" There 's a gap between what people hear about us and what their experience is with us .
We think that gap is beginning to close , " says Mark Siegel , an AT&T spokesman .
" It does n't mean we 're perfect ; we still have work to do .
But that 's no surprise to us , because we have a great network . "
AT&T's ' problem ' that everyone wants
Meanwhile , AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) continues to reap the rewards of being the country 's exclusive iPhone provider .
Despite heavy data demands that drive up AT&T 's cost of servicing each customer , users still make the wireless company $ 50 more per customer each year than other providers get from their smartphone subscribers , according to Yankee Group .
That 's because a higher percentage of iPhone customers buy pricey , top - tier service plans to satisfy their mobile download demands .
The iPhone will be worth $ 1.8 billion in sales to AT&T this year , and will generate $ 9 billion in revenue for the provider over the next five years , the study estimates .
Yankee Group says that 's $ 750 million more each year than AT&T would be taking in if it had a different flagship smartphone .
The iPhone is also the gift that keeps on giving : 77 % of iPhone owners say they 'll buy another iPhone , compared to 20 % of smartphone customers who say they 'll buy an Android phone .
( See correction below )
" Our analysis explains why AT&T has bent over backward to keep its exclusive distribution deal with Apple as long as possible , " Howe says .
" Verizon has been regretting turning away Apple for the last three years . "
Correction :
An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that 20 % of Android customers say they 'll buy another Android phone .
The survey actually revealed that 20 % of all smartphone customers say they 'll buy an Android phone .
A tiny bit of uncertainty has been cleared away thanks to good old Twitter , where T - Mobile has made July 15 ( aka , today ! ) the official launch date for its Galaxy S derivative , the Vibrant .
The original Tweet seems to have disappeared into the ether apart from that screenshot above , but T - Mo has reiterated the statement in subsequent missives , telling its followers that the Vibrant will be on sale today .
We imagine the typical $ 199.99 price point will remain unaltered , so all you 'll really need to do now is decide whether this is the Super AMOLED handset for you , or whether you can wait the extra few days until Sprint et al intro their offerings .
Decisions , decisions .

Mother - influenced fashion is the basis of a new book , photographer Jeannette Montgomery Barron 's lovely paeon to her own late mother , a ladylike fashion - lover who in later years suffered from Alzheimer's .
As the Washington Post 's Robin Givhan says ,
The fur coat , with her mother 's name " Ellie M. " embroidered in the lining , is spread out on the green grass .
The princess lines of the coat swing out jauntily .
That lush lawn emphasizes that the choice of fur by a woman who lived in Atlanta had little to do with practicality and everything to do with style and desire .
A single gold slingback looks suspended in midair .
It 's angled downward as if a photographer captured a ghost in the middle of a pirouette .
The gold brocade pattern of an Yves Saint Laurent coat competes with the gold and pine green print wallpaper in the background .
It is a cacophonous image of indulgence .
You can practically hear " Ellie M. " walking into a party , the swish - swish of her coat as it brushed against her legs .

This inheritance of style , the conjuring of prior generations through a garment , is also a staple of Vogue 's remembering first - persons , in which writers reminisce fondly about raiding their mothers ' closets .
In her book I love Your Style , Amanda Brooks showcases designer fashions from generations past - a surrealist cape , a diamond bracelet , a Dior original .
And an interview with the HuffPO , fashion blogger Garance Doré reveals ,
During the ' 70s and ' 80s , [ my mother ] was really very stylish .
She would travel and go to The Palace , a discothèque in Paris .
She was wearing crazy things and she was a little bit rebellious .
She would wear Thierry Mugler , and you could n't really wear that in the little city where she lived [ in Corsica ] , but she did n't care .
She was doing it .

In a recent photo contest , the Sartorialist ( Doré 's partner , incidentally ) called for stylish family pictures and the response was enormous : generations of dapper folk in Schiaparelli and Chanel or ingenious homemade masterpieces , gallivanting around the world in high style .
I briefly thought about submitting a picture .
I dutifully looked through the photo - albums my aunt had helpfully uploaded and scanned through hundreds of pictures .
And there was nary a one .
Clearly , " style " was not a priority for any member of my family ever — be it in Europe , Arkansas , the South Bronx or a depression - era Washington D.C.
My grandparents seem to have been wholly disinterested in the New Look .
Their parents totally missed the memo about at - home dressmaking .
And as for the 70s , when everyone 's mom was supposed to be the epitome of Me-Decade glam , well , I guess my mom was busy doing something else .
( Although the great - great aunt pictured above looks undeniably awesome . )
I mean no disrespect to my mother when I say this ; she'd be the first to say — not without a certain pride — that she could care less about clothes .
And it 's also not to say that , in these pictures , she does n't look beautiful because she does ( and , as she 's quick to point out , when her three gay roommates dressed her , she looked perfectly stylish and was never once turned away from Studio 54 , thank you very much . )
And let me add that even were her closet a cache of vintage Halston , it 's not like I could wear it : she 's more than three inches taller than I and with none of the curves .
There are associations , of course - her " dress sweats , " or the controversial linen jumper she wore winter and summer until , one weekend when she was out of town , my dad and brother bundled into the car and drove it two states away , then denied all knowledge of its whereabouts .
But I can't say any of them are of the style - inheritance varietal , and it must also be said that I looked positively bizarre for the years she dressed me in a series of oversized flannel sacks .
" Well , you have the books , " she said matter - of - factly when I jokingly brought it up .
" And you 're welcome to the dress sweats . "

COLUMBIA , Mo. – Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States .
The amount of stress and anxiety a person experiences is a major factor in cardiovascular disease .
For the past three decades experts have vacillated in their recommendations concerning the amount and intensity of exercise required to alleviate stress and anxiety .
Recently , most experts have agreed that a moderate to low amount of regular exercise can ease personal tension and stress .
However , a new study by researchers at the University of Missouri - Columbia shows that a relatively high - intensity exercise is superior in reducing stress and anxiety that may lead to heart disease .
Moreover , the researchers found that high - intensity exercise especially benefits women .
“ Conventional wisdom says that exercising for 30 minutes at a moderate exercise intensity is more effective in reducing anxiety than either a low or high intensity dose , ” said Richard Cox , professor of educational and counseling psychology and leader of the study .
“ This conclusion , however , is deceptively simple because reductions in anxiety are not always observed immediately following a high intensity bout of exercise . ”
In the study , female participants , ages 18 to 20 and 35 to 45 , completed three experimental sessions .
Each session started with a test to determine the anxiety level of the participant .
Following the test , the women either did not exercise ( control condition ) or exercised at a moderate or high - intensity level for 33 minutes .
After the session , Cox measured anxiety levels at 5 , 30 , 60 and 90 minutes post - exercise .
Although all three exercise conditions , including the control condition , showed a decline in anxiety over time , Cox found the high - intensity level experienced the sharpest decline .
Cox said the intensity of exercise conditions did not differ in anxiety levels at baseline or immediately after exercise , but a difference favoring the high intensity level emerged at 30 , 60 and 90 minutes post - exercise .
Results also showed that when the iron status of the women was taken into consideration , the beneficial effect of high - intensity exercise was greater for the older women .
“ This is a relationship that needs to be further explored , ” Cox said .
“ It appears to suggest that after controlling for iron status , the beneficial effects of exercise on anxiety may only apply to older women and not to younger women . ”
Cox believes this study , which is scheduled for publication in the Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport , will prove beneficial to medical practitioners in the fight against heart disease .

This had nothing to do with the so - called  Trickle Down theory .
This was  Gush Up . 
In Bush / Obama economics , the richest and biggest that had lost billions through bad investments , or were in danger of going bust , had to be rescued .
If the Über - Rich were n’t saved , there would be nothing left to trickle down to the population below .
By government decree , those taxpayers who had never felt any trickle to begin with , now had to finance the failed financiers .
If taxpayers found themselves unable to understand the thinking behind  Gush Up ,  it was not surprising .
Why should it make sense ?
Nothing else did .
The entire financial system had been hijacked by bandits .
It was criminal from beginning to end .
For example , in a 2008 interview , hedge fund executive Kyle Bass , who runs Hayman Advisors , described the deceit that was camouflaged by its own complexity as a billion - dollar fraud ,  so complex that The [ Wall Street ] Journal could n’t even write about it .
That ’s how complex it is .
It would take teams of lawyers reading indentures , complex flow charts .
And then people would look at you with cross-eyes , even if you understood it all .
They ’d go like ,  Yeah , well , I do n’t see it .’
The experts engineering the schemes were baffled by the complexity of their creations , and yet insisted upon being bailed out of something that they themselves did n’t understand .
The implicit rationale was that only those Harvard , Princeton and Yale MBAs , Ph.Ds. and LL .
Ds. were qualified to pull the levers of power on Wall Street and in Washington .
Only they — who had devised the derivative , and conjured up the synthetic credit default swap , and invented the enhanced structured investment vehicle — were equipped to deal with the complexities of contemporary business and finance .
Thus , those who did n’t know nevertheless insisted they knew best .
The Bigs had to be saved .

Thus , when they warned that if the too big to fail were allowed to fail the world financial system would collapse , their conclusions went unchallenged .
No evidence was provided , no proof was needed , and no explanation was tendered .
Harvard , Princeton , Yale the White Shoe Boyz had spoken .
They who invented the too big to fail were too big to question . 
Yet note , as economic conditions declined worldwide , many blamed the crisis on the intrinsic nature of capitalism .
But it was n’t capitalism that failed — it was human nature that was flawed .
Capitalism had been corrupted and perverted by the Bigs who , in collusion with the government and faced with the consequences of their own criminal greed , betrayed the system that had enriched them .

The very essence of functioning capitalism that by definition is  the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market ,  was violated and destroyed .
Not only was there no hard evidence demonstrating that saving the too big to fails  was necessary to save the economy , the rescue plans themselves violated the most cherished tenets of capitalism , which hold that :
Failures should be allowed to fail .
The best will succeed .
Competition is healthy .
Market voids created by failures will be filled by competitors .
No individual , business , institution , nation or empire is too - big - to - fail .
Had true capitalism been allowed to function unimpeded , the bloated , over - extended , inefficient and gluttonous firms and industries would have failed .
There would have been hardships and losses but , finally rid of its financial tapeworms , the purged system could be restored to health .
No ism  or ology  — regardless of purity of intent or moral foundation — is immune to corruption and abuse .
While capitalism itself is being blamed for the excesses that brought on financial chaos , prior to the most recent gambling binge , in tandem with the blanket dismantling of safeguards and the overt takeover of Washington by Wall Street , capitalism was responsible for creating one of the world ’s most successful and universally admired societies .

Businesses can and should take a key role in stemming biodiversity loss around the world , a report concludes .
The latest report from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( Teeb ) project argues that many sectors have a stake in protecting nature .
A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) finds that in some nations , more than half of CEOs see nature loss as a challenge to business growth .
The UN - backed Teeb project presents its latest results in London on Tuesday .
The first Global Business of Biodiversity symposium , held at the Excel Centre in London 's Docklands , will hear that about half of European and US consumers say they would stop buying products from companies that disregard biodiversity concerns .
Businesses need to start thinking about ecosystems as an extension of their asset base ... and appreciating the value they deliver Jon Williams , PwC
" Better accounting of business impacts on biodiversity , both positive and negative , is essential to spur change in business investment and operations , " said Joshua Bishop , chief economist of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and co-ordinator of the Teeb for Business report .
" Smart business leaders realise that integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in their value chains can generate substantial cost savings and new revenues , as well as improved business reputation and license to operate . "
Mining for positives
Among the " smart companies " to be discussed at the symposium is Rio Tinto , a mining conglomerate whose reputation ( like others in the field ) has been criticised on environmental and human rights grounds .
In 2004 , the company adopted a " Net Positive Impact " ( NPI ) commitment on biodiversity .
What is biodiversity ?
UN defines biodiversity as " the variability among living organisms from all sources including , inter alia , terrestrial , marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part ; this includes diversity within species , between species and of ecosystems "
Considered to provide value to humanity in four ways :
Provisioning - providing timber , fish , etc
Regulating - disposing of pollutants , regulating rainfall
Cultural - sacred sites , tourism , enjoyment of countryside
Supporting - maintaining soils and plant growth
This sees it working with environment organisations to protect important areas from direct mining impacts and putting funds into conservation to " offset " damage caused .
Another is the agribusiness giant Syngenta , which recently launched Operation Pollinator , a scheme to restore important bee habitat .
The scheme is seen as a potential contribution to curbing the ongoing bee decline in Europe and North America .
One recent study put the global value of insect pollinators at $ 189bn per year - a classical example of the kind of " ecosystem service " that nature provides for free , and that humans would have to pay to replace if the natural system broke down .
Items in the credit column including protection from storms , habitat for young fish , and carbon storage .
Teeb has calculated the annual value of forest loss around the world at $ 2 - 5 trillion .
Plants and machinery
Teeb , and the UN Environment Programme to which it is affiliated , argue that this kind of analysis makes nature protection a good investment for businesses .
Consumer opinion could be another factor .
A recent Ipsos survey found that in countries possessing high levels of biodiversity , awareness of biodiversity decline was correspondingly high , rising to 90 % in Brazil .
Among business leaders , the PwC survey found that more than half of CEOs in Latin America see declines in biodiversity as a challenge to growth .
Image caption China 's floods partly stemmed from over - use of forests by industry
But the figure drops to 20 % in Western Europe , and just 15 % in the UK .
And only two of the world 's largest 100 companies see biodiversity and ecosystem loss as a strategic issue .
" Businesses need to start thinking about ecosystems as an extension of their asset base , part of their plant and machinery , and appreciating the value they deliver , " said Jon Williams , PwC 's partner for sustainability and climate change .
Teeb 's leader , Deutsche Bank economist Pavan Sukhdev , believes companies will find it easier to invest in biodiversity protection once a mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation ( Redd ) becomes established through the UN climate convention .
Many countries favour a variant called Redd - Plus where issues such as biodiversity and forest peoples ' rights would be protected .
" We can move to a stage where big companies and countries are able to say ' we 're meeting 20 % of our emissions targets ' or whatever it might be through investing in green carbon , " he told BBC News .
" Then we can look at other issues , such as the forest 's water storage function for local people , for example .
" So it wo n't be a market in the classical sense but it will be a mechanism , and companies investing would be able to see whether their investments bring about things such as an improvement in water availability or an increase in the tiger population or whatever it might be . "
Teeb will produce its final report for October 's meeting of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( CBD ) in Japan , which will see governments examining the reasons why they have failed to live up to their 2002 pledge to curb nature loss by 2010 .
This is not Governor Blanco ’s Louisiana .
Since Katrina , the state has reformed and refitted its ability to respond to disasters to the point that it has become a national role model in many respects .
It starts with the Gov. Bobby Jindal .
Everyday , Jindal convenes a meeting of the State Unified Command Group which manages the entire state response .
Both BP and the Coast Guard brief .
Jindal asks the tough questions .
If he does n’t get the right answers , people know it .
He sets the tone for everything — and the tone is “ make things happen people . ”
After Katrina , the state established a separate cabinet level position for emergency preparedness and homeland security .
That was a smart move — it has been the backbone of the current response .
One of the state ’s initiatives was to create an Internet - based system called “ Web EOC ” to task and track all emergency response requests .
Without that system getting crews and skimmers to the right clean - up spots , there would have been chaos .
The Louisiana National Guard has over 1,000 soldiers deployed for the response .
That is in addition to troops on missions in Europe , Haiti , and Afghanistan .
About one - third of the Louisiana military force is somewhere other than home .
For the oil spill response , the Guard is the lynchpin between the local Parish officials and the Coast Guard , BP , and the private contractors .
Some of the most innovative ideas on how to deal with the spill have come from the state ’s citizen soldiers .
Most of all , it ’s the people of Louisiana who are the real heroes down here .
They have rolled up their sleeves and are fighting back .
They know this is different than dealing with hurricanes ; it is far worse .
A hurricane may destroy things — but those things can be rebuilt .
If the state ’s wetlands are poisoned , it will affect generations .
So the people of Louisiana are willing to do whatever is necessary to take the fight to the spill and stop the oil before it makes land .
They are also fighting Washington — on everything from the red tape that is slowing the clean - up to the drilling moratorium that is killing jobs .
And like all heroes from the time of Odysseus , their reward will probably be just more adversity .
All of the assets and people that are helping in the clean - up are just targets for the next Hurricane .
When the next storm turns their way , the first thing responders , from the parish presidents to the National Guard , will have to do is get all of these assets out of the hurricane ’s path .
And then they will have to turn right around and assist the people of the state in dealing with the storm .
Washington should give them more help and less red tape .

Leaders of the US Presbyterian Church today backed a revised proposal calling for the United States to end all aid to Israel unless the Israeli government halts expansion of settlements in the occupied territories .
The 172 - page proposal is actually a considerable step back on a number of issues , however , removing calls for divestment from Israeli companies and removing a comparison of Israel ’s occupation of the Palestinian territories to apartheid in South Africa .
The statement also adds repeated declarations that the church supports Israel ’s “ right to exist ” as an exclusively Jewish state .
Previously the church had called for a “ one state solution ” in which Christians , Jews and Muslims all had equal rights , something Israel has condemned as unacceptable .
A previous statement in 2004 had provoked the ire of pro-Israel groups , and a public condemnation from a number of Congressmen who claimed the Presbyterian Church was “ jeopardizing the existence of the State of Israel ” and calling for the Department of Commerce to take action against them .
The Presbyterian Church of the United States is one of the largest Reformed denominations in the US , and has between 2 - 3 million members .
To Solve Our Problems on the Road : Lose the Drivers
Suppose you were polishing the hood of your car and accidentally summoned up a transportation genie from the depths of your transmission .
What would your three wishes be ?
( Guys : assume this is a genie who looks more like Shaq than Barbara Eden . )
How about :
Cure congestion .
Allow cars to race at 65 mph down the Jersey Turnpike or the 405 at the height of rush hour , with no new blacktop or tolling necessary .
Increase safety .
Even with those higher speeds , cut fatal accidents way down .
And achieve this even with lots more dangerous behavior , like in - vehicle texting , drunk driving , Big Mac eating , YouTube watching , and the always - addictive computer solitaire .
Improve mobility for the transportation - deprived members of our society : the young , the elderly , and the disabled .
Are these developments in the realm of fantasy ?
Happily , no .
In fact , a technological suite is progressing which will allow us to enjoy all three simultaneously , meaning you can save your wishes for Middle East peace , tomorrow ’s lottery numbers , or cursing the Miami Heat .
The miracle innovation is self - driving , robotic cars .
Urban planner ( or , as he fancies himself , “ antiplanner ” ) Randal O’Toole has a nice chapter on this looming development in his recent , informative and provocative book Gridlock .
( More on the interesting and controversial O’Toole coming up . )
Driverless cars may seem the stuff of science fiction .
Futurist Norman Bel Geddes predicted we ’d have them in a couple of decades – in 1940 .
They ’re not here yet , but , hey , in 1940 nobody believed wristwatches that let us talk to each other on TV would make it out of the Dick Tracy comic strip , and today they are basically reality .
So are computer systems which know where we are and can direct us to where we are going anywhere in the country , which certainly would have seemed fantastic just a few decades ago .
At the moment , robot cars are not the subject of much public scrutiny or debate .
However , that should change given that important technological innovations are not just feasible but are currently being deployed on the roads .
As you may know , some new Lexuses and Toyotas parallel park themselves , a great boon to all except residents of New York and San Francisco , where there are never any curb spaces to begin with .
The problem of cars navigating in more complex urban situations is orders of magnitude more difficult , but a solution is on the horizon – in 2007 , in the DARPA Challenge several robot cars successfully negotiated a demanding 60 mile urban course .
Many of you might be disturbed by the safety implications .
It is probably safe to assume that robot cars will not rise up against their masters and enslave us all , but any PC user undoubtedly has concerns about computer crashes leading to real ones .
This certainly must be taken seriously , but , after all , new cars are loaded with microprocessors that control things like your fuel injection and transmission , and which function so flawlessly that you do n’t even know they ’re there .
And the next time you ’re on a plane , consider how you ’re placing your life in the hands of a computer ( the autopilot , which even basically lands the plane in bad weather ) without giving it a second thought .
Moreover , we have to consider the shortcomings of the auto control devices computers would replace – us .
Human beings are admirably adapted for replicating our genes : it ’s doubtful any computer could look as good as we do on the dance floor .
But we are poorly adapted for driving cars , which move at speeds far above what humans ever achieved prior to 1800 .
Thus more than half of the fatal accidents in America — which claim 40,000 lives a year – are due to driver error .
When perfected , computers would be so far superior to us – in terms of reaction time , consistency , perception , focus , etc. – that the safety benefits of self - driving cars would greatly outweigh any new safety concerns .
At this point , computers are enhancing safety , not undermining it .
A growing number of high - end new cars feature “ adaptive cruise control , ” which utilizes radar ( more technologically advanced , but costing between $ 1000 and $ 3000 ) or lasers ( less effective , but much cheaper at $ 400 - $ 600 ) to judge the distance to the car in front of you , automatically cutting speed when you are getting too close for comfort .
Volkswagen , Raytheon and other companies are also developing anti-collision radar systems .
Another innovation that has become reality ( thanks to automakers like Nissan , Toyota and Honda ) is the “ lane keep assist system . ”
Here cars sense the position of the lane markers and resist efforts by the car to drift unless a lane change is signaled .
Because drivers will pay for it , these innovations are focused on safety .
But equally importantly , driverless car technology holds the seeds of congestion relief .
Humans can judge that the car in front of them is slowing down ( its brake lights flash and the car is growing ) , but we are poor judges of how quickly it is slowing down .
Thus , to err on the side of safety , we have to overapply the brake .
This creates a chain reaction when the same behavior gets replicated by driver after driver down the line .
Traffic thus slows far more than necessary .
Slow reaction times and poor perception also mean that we have to leave an unnecessarily large amount of distance between us and the car in front of us .
With a system in which cars cooperate and inform each other ( and perhaps the road ) about their intentions instantaneously , they can start and stop relatively simultaneously .
Moreover , cars can be packed much more tightly together .
The outcome : a freeway lane can hold between three and four times more cars than are currently accommodated .
And those cars can move at high speeds .
Xi Jou of the University of Minnesota has estimated that congestion relief will start to bite when as few as 20 percent of the cars on the road have adaptive cruise control .
Finally , driverless cars hold the potential for revolutionizing the lives of those who are currently deprived by our auto-centric transportation system .
A 14 - year - old would be freed to go to school or the mall without an onerous and time - wasting journey by an adult , and a 90 - year - old would no longer have to face an agonizing decision about giving up her license .
Despite the fact that we are making real progress – in 2008 , General Motors announced it was planning a driverless car that could be on the road by 2018 – the difficulty of an automated traffic system is , of course , in the implementation .
Many of the regulatory , logistical , financial and technical problems involved are quite vexing .
They will require political will .
More coming up on what we can be doing to put this issue on society ’s radar screen .

MOSCOW  Militants attacked a hydroelectric power plant in Russia ’s restive North Caucasus region on Wednesday , killing two guards before setting off several bombs that forced the facility to be shut down , Russian investigators said .
Between three and five armed men raided the plant , a small station in the southern Russian region of Kabardino - Balkaria , around 5:30 a.m. local time , the investigators said .
They said the attackers shot the two guards , then broke into the engine room of the plant , the Baksanskaya station .
“ Unknown men in masks broke into the power plant , broke down a closed door , then tied up the employees , ” Valery Shigenov , the plant ’s director , told Russian television .
Two of the employees were injured and had to be hospitalized .
The militants then set and detonated at least four bombs , which destroyed three generators , but failed to cause a breach in the dam , officials said .
A fire caused by the explosions had been extinguished by midday , and no power failures were reported in the region .
We can tell you from personal experience that collecting 1:18 scale ( or 18 times smaller than the real thing ) model cars is a fun hobby .
They ’re just big enough for lots of detail , yet small enough to not take up a massive amount of shelf space .
Plus , they ’re fairly affordable ( handbuilt wonders from the likes of CMC and Exoto excluded ) .
In fact , we ca n’t think of a single model that ’s worth anywhere near the kind of coin its fullsize counterpart is …
Apparently , that factoid annoyed Munich , Germany ’s Robert Gulpen and Liverpool , England ’s Stuart Hughes enough that they decided to craft a trio of 1:18 scale Bugatti Veyrons … out of solid gold .
Almost everything visible is made out of 24 karat gold or platinum , and some of the bits that are n’t visible are hiding behind the 7.2 karats worth of diamonds found in the front grille and elsewhere .
But just in case the bling - intensive construction was n’t enough to impress you , note that these babies are just like most conventional diecast 1:18 autos in that they feature opening doors , hood , trunk and working steering .
Unlike the replicas you can occasionally find at Target or Costco , however , these Bugs will set you back more than $ 20 .
In fact , they ’ll set you back approximately $ 2.9 million .
Yes , Virginia , that ’s about double the cost of a new real one .
When you consider the fact that you and a passenger can actually fit inside a real one and drive it somewhere , it becomes even more of a bargain .
Then again , the replica does n’t need any gas ( the real one does , and lots of it ) , it wo n’t take up an entire garage space , and it might come in handy when the dollar reaches a 1:1 exchange rate with the yen .
If only those of us who are n’t loaded could be faced with these kinds of dilemmas …

We can't say we 've heard of Augen before , but the company certainly sparked our interest ( and that of Kmart circular readers ) this weekend with its $ 149.99 7 - inch Android tablet .
Oh yes , you heard right shoppers -- the small Florida - based shop is bringing an Android 2.1 tablet with WiFi , 2GB of storage and 256MB of RAM to a store near you for just 150 buckaroos .
And according to an Augen spokesperson , it will have access to the Android " Market App Store . "
That sounds pretty awesome for the pricetag , but we -- along with a number of readers we 've heard from -- have n't been able to locate the 7 - inch tablet at any Kmart retail location just yet .
( Yes , we even spent a lovely ten minutes on hold with our local store while they checked the inventory . )
We 're told by Augen that the device should be hitting shelves later this week , though the company was unsure it would ever land on Kmart 's online store .
In addition to the 7 - inch tablet , Augen has also released its $ 89 TheBook e-reader with a similar 7 - inch LCD .
It does n't run Android , but you can check out an in - depth look at its Linux OS in The eReader 's video review after the break .
We 'll be keeping an ear to the ground on the availability of the tablet and will be trying to get one in our hands to confirm the preloaded Market , but let us know in the comments if you 've had any luck yourselves .
[ Thanks , Matthew ] :
We 've been hearing from a bunch of readers that many Kmarts are giving out " rainchecks " and that they will be calling customers when the Augen tablet arrives later this week .
Yep , Kmart 's updated its blog with info on the " rainchecks . "
Rdearth53 got his very own tablet !

We 're still tracking one down !
BT and TalkTalk want a judicial review of the Digital Economy Act , saying the controversial new law could infringe " basic rights and freedoms , " reports the BBC .
The act – which proposes to disconnect persistent illegal filesharers from the internet – was passed into law in the April wash - up period before parliament was dissolved .
Both BT and TalkTalk are understood to want the high court to clarify whether the act conflicts with existing EU regulation .
Ofcom has said plans to disconnect people from the internet would not come into force until next year .
Concerns over " basic rights and freedoms " to access the web are made worse by the manner in which the act was passed into law , BT and TalkTalk say .
The act was " rushed through " parliament with " insufficient scrutiny " , claim the internet service providers .
After two hours of debate in the House of Commons , the bill was given royal assent – the vote in the government 's favour by 189 votes to 47 .
Nick Clegg , leader of the Liberal Democrats , said at the time : " We did our best to prevent the digital economy bill being rushed through at the last moment .
It badly needed more debate and amendment . "
" This is exactly what we and 20,000 supporters warned their MPs , " said Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group .
" The Act was rushed through and is already working extremely badly .
It threatens basic rights and large chunks need to be repealed . "
At present , the act applies to ISPs with more than 400,000 customers – putting larger companies at a commercial disadvantage , says TalkTalk .
Andrew Heaney , executive director of TalkTalk , told the BBC : " It means we could have huge swathes of customers moving to smaller ISPs to avoid detection [ from copyright owners ] . "
Heaney said the act could be in contravention of EU privacy and electronic communications directives , as well as an e-commerce directive stating that ISPs are " mere conduits " of content and should not be held responsible for traffic on their services .
The coalition government , of which Clegg is deputy prime minister , told the BBC it has no plans to backtrack on the act : " The Digital Economy Act sets out to protect our creative economy from the continued threat of online copyright infringement , which industry estimates costs the creative industries , including creators , £ 400 m per year .
We believe measures are consistent with EU legislation and that there are enough safeguards in place to protect the rights of consumers and ISPs and will continute to work on implementing them . "
Charles Dunstone , chairman of TalkTalk , told The Times : " The Digital Economy Act 's measures will cost the UK hundreds of millions and many people believe they are unfair , unwarranted and wo n't work .
Innocent broadband customers will suffer and citizens will have their privacy invaded . "
Gavin Patterson , chief executive of BT Retail , said : " We feel we have no choice .
We have to do this for our customers . "
Ofcom declined to comment .
This is Blackbird , it 's a wind - powered car designed by an aerodynamicist to end a longstanding internet debate , namely , ' Can you go downwind faster than the wind ? '
Using high - tech designs and precise instrumentation , Blackbird proves you can .
Advertisement
Directly Downwind Faster Than The Wind ( DDWFTTW ) is a favorite topic of debate across the nerdverse for the combination non-existent answer and apparently conflicting nature of the question .
" Wind only goes X - speed , how can you go faster ?
If you go faster do n't you violate the law of conservation of energy ? "
That 's usually the way the discussion goes .
When aerodynamicist Rick Cavallaro at Thin Air Designs heard about the debate causing nerd - rage all over the internet he decided to see if he could prove the naysayers wrong .
Along with a group from San Jose State University Aerodynamics department , Rick designed a vehicle to put the debate to rest , it 's called Blackbird and although it 's weird looking , it works .
What Rick knew was there was plenty of power in the wind , but while harnessing it with a sail seems efficient it 's actually not .
A good deal of the wind spills over the sides , a sail has no way to store energy other than the inertia built up in the craft it 's attached to and it can be complicated to steer .
Instead , Blackbird has a propeller designed and optimized to capture and convert wind to mechanical power .
The prop allows for the same conversion of wind force to craft inertia but adds a degree of energy storage in the spinning propeller , that 's not to say there 's any kind of energy storage other than that .
The blade is mechanically linked to the axle through fixed gearing and there 's no on - board energy stored when the vehicle is stationary .
It 's mounted to a load - cell - instrumented hub at the top of a steel A - frame and drives a geared axle which drives the vehicle .
Advertisement
The frame is a steel skeleton reinforced with carbon - fiber strands , covered in shaped foam which is then covered in fiberglass .
Wheels are actually heavy duty Velocity Dyad 27 " tandem bike rims only mounted to custom - machined racing go - kart wheels to act as hubs and provide better side loading and lower rolling resistance .
Differential action around a corner is provided by a re-purposed 3/ 4 " ratchet drives mounted inside the hubs ( very clever and cheap ) .
After some tweaks to the mechanics following a prop hub breakage the team wrapped things up with a full aerodynamics package and painted it all black then folded the thing up like wind - powered origami and headed for the New Jerusalem runway in Tracy , California for testing .
With the machine instrumented with GPS and wind speed and direction collecting equipment the first runs returned speeds of up to 38.47 miles per hour , which is 2.85 times the average wind speed of 13.5 miles per hour .
Pretty neat .
Rick and his team are still refining the machine and hope to push for higher speeds , but they 've proved beyond the shadow of a doubt you can drive down wind faster than the wind .
Take another look at the picture at the lead of the story , the streamer on the instrument mast is pointing backwards .

A new dental therapy could repair damaged nerves inside teeth , making root canals a thing of the past .
And it 's all done with an ultrathin layer of nanofilm .
Advertisement
Currently , there 's only one way for dentists to deal with infection or inflammation inside teeth , and anyone who has had a root canal can tell you it 's not much fun .
Root canals are the only way to deal with damage to the pulp , which is the soft tissue inside teeth that houses nerve endings and blood vessels , and they " solve " the problem by essentially killing the tooth .
It 's a costly , painful procedure that does n't actually cure the pain so much as permanently deaden it .
Needless to say , dentists have been looking for a better way .
The nano - sized film contains a substance called alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone , or alpha-MSH , which is known for its ability to fight inflammation .
A team of European scientists placed the alpha-MSH - coated film onto fibroblasts , the primary kind of cell in dental pulp .
The film significantly reduced inflammation on the fibroblasts , and it even promoted new fibroblasts to start growing .
Dentists believe this could be the breakthrough they 've been waiting for that will allow them to revitalize other damaged teeth , avoiding the need to ever do a root canal .
Advertisement
Still , are we the only ones that see what 's really going on here ?
This nano - revitalization probably will cost just as much as a root canal , and here 's the kicker : once your tooth is back to normal , what 's to stop it from getting infected all over again ?
If dentists play their cards right , they 're going to go from performing a few dozen root canals every year to a few hundred anti-root - canals .
Not that I 'm irrationally distrustful of dentists or anything ...

Policy Guidance - Access to High School Students and Information on Students by Military Recruiters
October 9 , 2002
Q. What are the recent changes made by Congress concerning military recruitment of high school students ?
A.Congress has passed two major pieces of legislation that generally require local educational agencies ( LEAs ) receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( ESEA ) 1 to give military recruiters the same access to secondary school students as they provide to postsecondary institutions or to prospective employers .
LEAs are also generally required to provide students ' names , addresses , and telephone listings to military recruiters , when requested .
Q. Where are these statutory requirements found ?
A . These requirements are contained in § 9528 of the ESEA ( 20 U.S.C. § 7908 ) , as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( P.L. No. 107-110 ) , the education bill Congress recently passed .
These requirements are also contained in 10 U.S.C. § 503 , as amended by § 544 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 ( P.L. No. 107-107 ) , the legislation that provides funding for the nation 's armed forces in fiscal year 2002 .
Q. What is the effective date for these military recruiter access requirements ?
A . While there are differences in the effective date provisions for 10 U.S.C. § 503 and § 9528 of the ESEA , both provisions apply to all LEAs receiving ESEA funds by not later than July 1 , 2002 .
Q. What are the requirements of § 9528 of the ESEA ?
A.Each LEA that receives funds under the ESEA must comply with a request by a military recruiter or an institution of higher education for secondary students ' names , addresses , and telephone numbers , unless a parent has " opted out " of providing such information .
( See below for additional information . )
Section 9528 also requires LEAs that receive funds under the ESEA to provide military recruiters the same access to secondary school students as they generally provide to postsecondary institutions or prospective employers .
For example , if the school has a policy of allowing postsecondary institutions or prospective employers to come on school property to provide information to students about educational or professional opportunities , it must afford the same access to military recruiters .
Q. Under § 9528 of the ESEA , what notification must LEAs provide to parents before disclosing names , addresses , and telephone numbers of secondary students to military recruiters and officials of institutions of higher education ?
A. Under FERPA , an LEA must provide notice to parents of the types of student information that it releases publicly .
This type of student information , commonly referred to as " directory information , " includes such items as names , addresses , and telephone numbers and is information generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed .
The notice must include an explanation of a parent 's right to request that the information not be disclosed without prior written consent .
Additionally , § 9528 requires that parents be notified that the school routinely discloses names , addresses , and telephone numbers to military recruiters upon request , subject to a parent 's request not to disclose such information without written consent .
A single notice provided through a mailing , student handbook , or other method that is reasonably calculated to inform parents of the above information is sufficient to satisfy the parental notification requirements of both FERPA and § 9528 .
The notification must advise the parent of how to opt out of the public , nonconsensual disclosure of directory information and the method and timeline within which to do so .
Q.If an LEA has not provided notice relating to " directory information , " may it release a student 's name , address , and telephone number when requested by a military recruiter ?
A.As noted above , an LEA may provide a single notice regarding both directory information and information disclosed to military recruiters .
If an LEA does not disclose " directory information " under FERPA , then it must still provide military recruiters access to secondary students ' names , addresses , and telephone listings .
In addition , the LEA must notify parents that they may opt out of this disclosure .
In other words , an LEA that does not disclose " directory information " must nonetheless provide a notice that it discloses information to military recruiters .
The notice must be reasonably calculated to inform parents .
Q. If a parent opts out of the public , nonconsensual disclosure of directory information ( or any subset of such information ) , must the three data elements be released to military recruiters upon their request ?
A. If a parent opts out of providing directory information to third parties , the opt - out relating to name , address , or telephone number applies to requests from military recruiters as well .
For example , if the opt - out states that telephone numbers will not be disclosed to the public , schools may not disclose telephone numbers to military recruiters .
Q.If the school does not list one or more of the three data elements ( e.g. , telephone number ) among its directory information , may it release that information to military recruiters ?
A. If a school does not designate one or more of the three items as " directory information " under FERPA , it still must provide all three items to military recruiters upon request .
Also , in that case , the school would have to send a separate notice to parents about the missing " directory information " item (s ) , noting an opportunity to opt out of disclosure of the information to military recruiters .
An easier method , of course , would be for the school to designate all three items - name , address , and telephone listing - as " directory information . "
Q. How are the requirements under § 9528 of the ESEA enforced ?
A.Schools that do not comply with § 9528 of the ESEA could jeopardize their receipt of ESEA funds .
Q.How does § 544 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 amend the former requirements under 10 U.S.C. § 503 ?
A.Section 544 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 revises Title 10 , Section 503 ( c ) in several important ways .
First , the recruiting provisions now apply only to LEAs ( including private secondary schools ) that receive funds under the ESEA .
Second , these provisions now require access by military recruiters to students , under certain conditions , and to secondary school students ' names , addresses , and telephone listings .
Third , as discussed earlier , they require LEAs to notify parents of their right to opt out of the disclosure of their children 's names , addresses , and telephone numbers and to comply with any such requests from the parents or the students .
Q.How are these requirements under 10 U.S.C. § 503 enforced ?
A. In addition to the potential for loss of funds under ESEA noted above for failure to comply with § 9528 of the ESEA , an LEA that denies a military recruiter access to the requested information on students after July 1 , 2002 , will be subject to specific interventions under 10 U.S.C. § 503 .
In this regard , the law requires that a senior military officer ( e.g. , Colonel or Navy Captain ) visit the LEA within 120 days .
If the access problem is not resolved with the LEA , the Department of Defense must notify the State Governor within 60 days .
Problems still unresolved after one year are reported to Congress if the Secretary of Defense determines that the LEA denies recruiting access to at least two of the armed forces ( Army , Navy , Marine Corps , etc. ) .
The expectation is that public officials will work with the LEA to resolve the problem .
Additionally , the Department of Defense has developed a national high school data base to document recruiter access .
Presently , 95 percent of the nation 's 22,000 secondary schools provide a degree of access to military recruiters that is consistent with current law .
Q . Are private schools subject to the military recruiter requirements ?
A.Private secondary schools that receive funds under the ESEA are subject to 10 U.S.C. § 503 .
However , private schools that maintain a religious objection to service in the Armed Forces that is verifiable through the corporate or other organizational documents or materials of that school are not required to comply with this law .
Q. Where can I get more information on the requirements of 10 U.S.C. § 503 ?
A. The Office of the Secretary of Defense may be contacted for copies of the statute , or questions relating to it .
Please contact the Accession Policy Directorate as follows :

Q. Where can I get more information on the requirements of § 9528 of the ESEA ?
A. The Family Policy Compliance Office ( FPCO ) in the Department of Education administers FERPA as well as § 9528 of the ESEA , as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 .
School officials with questions on this guidance , or FERPA , may contact the FPCO at FERPA@ED .

1 . If the LEA receives funds under the ESEA , all the secondary schools in that LEA are subject to the requirements in these laws .
At E3 , Nintendo mercilessly mocked the idea of wearing glasses to experience 3D .
The company 's newest handheld , the 3DS , gives you a brilliant 3D effect without requiring expensive or annoying glasses , and Nintendo seemed happy to point out that advantage .
It did n't help that the gathered press and bloggers left Nintendo 's event to go straight to Sony 's press conference ... where we were handed 3D glasses upon entrance .
Ouch .
Sony has responded to Nintendo 's dismissive tone , and the company seems oddly hurt by the attacks .
" I have hope that they have a broader perspective with 3D , " Sony 's Worldwide Studios Shuhei Yoshida told IGN .
" When you listen to what they are saying about the effect of 3D perspective to the games , they are saying the same message we are , but they do n't have to bash some small part of what the other company is doing . "
It 's a defensive tone , but make no mistake : the glasses are not a small part of what Sony is doing , if E3 is any indication .
The 3D gameplay of Killzone 3 , with the audience wearing those infernal glasses , was a centerpiece of the company 's presentation .
Gran Turismo 5 was shown in 3D , and many of the demos on the show floor used both 3D and the PlayStation Move to great effect .
Sony is pushing 3D in a big way , and right now the technology it uses requires glasses .
That is n't going to change any time soon .
Nintendo's advantage
Nintendo sells video games and video game hardware .
Outside of keeping their Hanafuda card production going for the sake of history , that 's all they do .
To put it lightly , they are very , very good at it .
Nintendo attacks every problem by looking at what is cost effective for both the company and consumer , and then it looks at how technology will enhance the games .
It 's a focused , profitable , tight business .
Sony works differently .
Count how many businesses it 's juggling : televisions , audio equipment , cameras , movies , music , video games ... the list goes on .
Sony is n't backing 3D with all it has because it 's the best thing for games ; it 's pushing the technology so the other parts of the company can sell you a new television , extra glasses , and Sony films in 3D on Blu-ray .
3D becoming an accepted way to consume content at home will help nearly every one of Sony 's core businesses , and the company sees gaming as a way to help that happen .
" I think as an industry we should preach this new perspective , from a very large cinema screen to a small portable , because that helps advancing the games and the game industry , " Yoshida continued .
" We 'd like to work together to promote 3D . "
But Nintendo does n't really care about 3D as something that is permanent or even necessary for gaming ; it is simply technology that works for the next generation of their portable gaming systems .
It 's attractive because Nintendo has a standard for its 3D : every system will have the same size screen and use the same technology , and the cost to the consumer should n't be much more than a standard DS .
Sony , on the other hand , wants you to buy a costly new television — although prices are sure to come down — and every member of your family will of course need glasses to realize the effect .
Nintendo's solution is self - contained , universal , and should be inexpensive .
Sony 's requires peripherals , will support different screens with evolving technology , and requires a significant investment .
Sony makes the mistake of assuming that Nintendo is interested in 3D when Nintendo is only interested in the 3DS .
We polled our readers in January about their own plans for 3D , and only 8 percent were looking forward to buying a 3D display .
Sixty - six percent said that they would get 3D when it came free with their televisions .
Sony hopes that by leveraging the full force of its different content divisions , it can bring those numbers up .
Nintendo , on the other hand , wants to sell you one sub -$ 200 piece of hardware and then a truckload of games .
It 's a piece of hardware , it should be noted , that enjoyed a three - hour wait and crushing lines at E3 ... exactly the experience the now - legendary Nintendo Wii found during its first E3 .
In the next few years , which technology do you think will find more general - interest welcome ?
Washington ( CNN ) --
The NAACP has passed a resolution that condemns what it feels is rampant racism in the Tea Party movement .
Members passed the measure on Tuesday at the organization 's 101st annual convention in Kansas City , Missouri .
Tea Party activists have swiftly denounced the action as unfounded and unfair .
The resolution pits the nation 's oldest civil rights organization , with its storied history of wins on behalf of racial justice , against a grassroots conservative movement that has won some recent political races and is flexing its muscle in Republican circles .
" We take no issue with the Tea Party .
We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy , " Ben Jealous , president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said in a statement .
" We take issue with the Tea Party 's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements .
The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no space for racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in their movement , " Jealous said .
Tea Party leaders reacted to the NAACP action with swift and angry derision .
" I am disinclined to take lectures on racial sensitivity from a group that insists on calling black people , ' Colored , ' " Mark Williams , national spokesman of the Tea Party Express , told CNN .
" The Tea Party [ movement ] is about the constitution of this country ...[ and ] ensuring equality for each and every individual human being . "
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a Tea Party favorite , said the charge from the NAACP is " false , appalling , and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand . "
" To be unjustly accused of association with what Reagan so aptly called that ' legacy of evil ' is a traumatizing experience , and one of which the honest , freedom - loving patriots of the Tea Party movement are truly undeserving , " she wrote in a posting on her Facebook page Tuesday night .
Palin responds to allegations of Tea Party racism
Palin said the only purpose of such an accusation is to dissuade Americans from joining the Tea Party , a movement she said is " motivated by love of country and all that is good and honest about our proud and diverse nation . "
But NAACP leaders feel there is ample evidence to prove Palin and others who deny there is racism in Tea Party are wrong .
Hilary Shelton , director of the NAACP 's Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy , laid out what the group feels is the proof during an interview with CNN .
" After observing Tea Party activities throughout the country -- which culminated with the outrageous and racist behavior of Tea Party activists during the historic congressional vote to pass into law comprehensive health care legislation -- the NAACP began more closely investigating the Tea Party .
Specifically as it was reported to us that Tea Party activists spat on [ Congressman ] John Lewis , a veteran civil rights activist and associate to Dr. Martin Luther King , and called Congressman Emanuel Cleaver the ' N - word ' and called [ Congressman ] Barney Frank ... one of the first openly gay members of Congress , the ' F - word , ' " Shelton said .
The NAACP also claims that Tea Party activists have engaged in racist behavior , for example , by waving signs that degrade African Americans and President Obama , in particular .
Also , the NAACP says , a number of Tea Party members think that issues of importance to African Americans get too much attention .
" Rather than talking about the real issues of these incidents that have happened ... [ activists ] wind up blaming the messenger , " Shelton said .
" It seems like its denial ... that allows them to focus on themselves . "
i Reporter says Tea Party must address issue of racism
Many Tea Party leaders have publicly denounced elements of prejudice .
During a May 6 interview on ABC's " The View , " Amy Kremer , chairman of the Tea Party Express , pointedly looked into the camera and told any prejudiced followers , " This is not a racist movement .
We do n't want you here .
Go away if that 's what you 're about .
We 're about the fiscal issues and about being American . "
Williams , the Tea Party Express spokesman , said , " We've had these people show up on the fringes of our group ... because we attract TV cameras .
What these people all universally learn , the racist groups included , is that they 're not welcome . "
Other Tea Party leaders also have publicly spoken out against racism in their movement .
While Shelton acknowledged the effort from " a few " leaders , she said the level of repudiation is not stopping displays of racism from many Tea Party followers .
" Not only are some elements of the Tea Party movement being resistant to that [ message of repudiation ] , but we 've seen some elements acting out , in some cases in a violently racist behavior .
And that is what we want to see stop , " Shelton said .
Shelton cited the movement 's loose - knit patchwork of small , local groups that might not toe the line of Tea Party leaders .
After school one day in May 2008 , Mr. Cohen ’s daughter , known in court papers as J. C. , videotaped friends at a cafe , egging them on as they laughed and made mean - spirited , sexual comments about another eighth - grade girl , C. C. , calling her “ ugly , ” “ spoiled , ” a “ brat ” and a “ slut . ” J. C. posted the video on YouTube .
The next day , the school suspended her for two days .
“ What incensed me , ” said Mr. Cohen , a music industry lawyer in Los Angeles , “ was that these people were going to suspend my daughter for something that happened outside of school . ”
On behalf of his daughter , he sued . [...]
Judge Wilson ruled in favor of the young videographer , because the disruption was only minimal : administrators dealt with the matter quietly and before lunch recess . [...]
The district had to pay J. C. ’s costs and lawyers ’ fees : $ 107,150.80 .
( NYT )
The lesson Mr. Cohen hopes his daughter learns from the case is about the limits on governmental intrusion .
“ A girl came to school who was upset by something she saw on the Internet , ” Mr. Cohen said in a telephone interview , “ and these people had in their mind that they were going to do something about it .
The school does n’t have that kind of power .
It ’s up to the parents to discipline their child . ”
He did chastise his daughter , saying , “ That was n’t a nice thing to do . ”
He describes her video as “ relentlessly juvenile , ” but not an example of cyberbullying , which he said he did not condone .
His daughter offered to remove it from YouTube .
But Mr. Cohen keeps it posted , he said , “ as a public service ” so viewers can see “ what kids get suspended for in Beverly Hills . ”
Imagine you just found out that your kid posted a nasty clip on YouTube belittling on of her peers .
What would you do ?
I mean most parents with a sense of ethos and civility ( which hopefully we want pass on to our children ) would do a lot of things , the first of which is take down the offensive video .
But not Evan .
When his daughter offered to take it down he decided it was better to leave the hurtful material up .
Not very surprising considering he's an record industry lawyer ...
It figures does n't it ?
I mean the apple did n't fall all that far from the tree here .
The daughter was a brat ( which one might write off to poor parenting ) and the father is an arrogant fuckhead who believes that online bullying is a personal right .
One would think that winning the case would be enough and that once he got his money he would take video down .
I mean what kind of person would leave up a demeaning message about a little girl the same age as his own daughter ?
Well this kind of guy : " Was n't a nice thing to do ? "
And that 's disciplining your child for bullying someone ?
You just demonstrated the failure of your own statement about parental responsibility .
I realize you 're a lawyer and ruining people 's lives is your business .
I realize you work for the record industry which is known to have no morals whatsoever .
I also realize that as a rich fucker you probably have very little whatsoever to do with your child 's upbringing , but your actions are deplorable .
Still , as you pointed out so blithely , this post is just " something on the internet " so I guess you can't get very upset about it after all .
heic1012 — Photo Release
Hubble snaps sharp image of cosmic concoction
A colourful star - forming region is featured in this stunning new NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope image of NGC 2467 .
Looking like a roiling cauldron of some exotic cosmic brew , huge clouds of gas and dust are sprinkled with bright blue hot young stars .
Strangely shaped dust clouds , resembling spilled liquids , are silhouetted against a colourful background of glowing gas in this newly released Hubble image .
The star - forming region NGC 2467 is a vast cloud of gas – mostly hydrogen – that serves as an incubator for new stars .
Some of these youthful stars have emerged from the dense clouds where they were born and now shine brightly , hot and blue in this picture , but many others remain hidden .
The full beauty of this object and hints of the astrophysical processes at work within it are revealed in this super - sharp image from Hubble .
Hot young stars that recently formed from the cloud are emitting fierce ultraviolet radiation that is causing the whole scene to glow while also sculpting the environment and gradually eroding the gas clouds .
Studies have shown that most of the radiation comes from the single hot and brilliant massive star just above the centre of the image .
Its fierce radiation has cleared the surrounding region and some of the next generation of stars are forming in the denser regions around the edge .
One of the most familiar star - forming regions is the Orion Nebula , which can be seen with the naked eye .
NGC 2467 is a similar but more distant example .
Such stellar nurseries can be seen out to considerable distances in the Universe , and their study is important in determining the distance and chemical composition of other galaxies .
Some galaxies contain huge star - forming regions , which may contain tens of thousands of stars .
Another dramatic example is the 30 Doradus region in the Large Magellanic Cloud .
NGC 2467 was discovered in the nineteenth century and lies in the southern constellation of Puppis , which represents the poop deck of Jason 's fabled ship Argo from Greek mythology .
NGC 2467 is thought to lie about 13 000 light - years from Earth .
The picture was created from images taken with the Wide Field Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys through three different filters ( F550 M , F660N and F658N , shown in blue , green and red respectively ) .
These data were taken in 2004 .

Image caption Condoms are the only real reversible contraceptive choice for men currently
While women can choose from over 10 methods of reversible contraception , men have few options : namely the condom , or the more extreme and often irreversible option of vasectomy .
This is despite decades of research , dozens of medical trials , and a range of methods that have been shown to work .
So what is holding back a reversible male contraceptive ?
The contraceptive pill was approved for contraceptive use 50 years ago , and in the following years , lent momentum to the women 's movement .
But now that women have been taking patches , pills , jabs and implants for so long , many are questioning whether it should be the turn of men .
Professor Richard Anderson , Professor of Clinical Reproductive Science at Edinburgh University , told Health Check on BBC World Service : " Women are increasingly recognising that to start using contraception perhaps as a teenager , right through to you 're 50 , interspersed with a few pregnancies , is a pretty bad deal , and it 's about time someone else stepped up to the mark . "
Reversible contraceptive
News stories about male ' pills ' regularly hit the headlines .
" The perennial thing is that it 's always five years away , and has been for a very long time " , says Richard Anderson .
While women are fertile for a short period of each month , from puberty to menopause , men produce millions of sperm every day , and can theoretically father a child from puberty until death .
There is a need for a contraception that is long - term and reversible Professor Sujoy K Guha , Expert in male contraception
" The main problem is to get that sperm count to zero , or very nearly zero , all the time .
And it has to be absolutely consistent , every day of the week , " explains Richard Anderson .
But , decades of research have shown that men's sperm production can be stopped with hormones , just like a woman 's fertility can be switched off by the pill or other hormonal contraceptives .
Furthermore , some imaginative non-hormonal methods have also been developed over the years .
Ultrasound has been shown to cause temporary male infertility , while Professor Sujoy K Guha , an Indian biomedic , invented RISUG ( Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance ) - a polymer that can be used as a reversible vasectomy .
200 Indian men have undergone the procedure in advanced clinical trials .
The vas deferens is injected with a small amount of the preparation .
Early results indicate that it can last for 10 years , and is reversible by injecting the vas with sodium bicarbonate .
This Indian solution to a burgeoning population has attracted attention from men from industrialised nations .
" Every few weeks we get people coming from the West .
A lot of them write to us , and a number of them even come and sit in our hospital , asking for the injection , " says Guha .
" So there is a need for a contraception that is long - term and reversible . "
But Guha 's product might be too efficient to make economic sense , as a man may only have it done once or twice in his lifetime .
Who profits ?
Elaine Lissner , Director of medical research programmes at the Parsemus Foundation and advocate for male contraception , explains : " This is a nightmare product for a pharmaceutical company .
For a pharmaceutical company , the ideal method is expensive and short - acting .
And for a man the ideal method is cheap and long - acting . "
Furthermore , why focus your efforts on medication for young , healthy people , when the most profitable drugs markets are those in the rapidly ageing industrialised world ?
Chemist Carl Djerassi , one of the female pill 's inventors , explains : " The countries that really make money and sell their drugs - Western Europe , Japan , North America , which are the three major markets .
They are getting older and older .
They 're interested in the diseases of an ageing population . "
And while profit might be small , the potential for legal payouts linked to a contraceptive 's use could be massive .
" There 's no question that if the male pill were around right now that there would be millions of men who would take it , and some of them would then be approaching 55 , 65 , 70 . "
And some may experience problems , like erectile dysfunction .
" They will blame it on the pill , " he said .
Pharmaceutical company Bayer Schering Pharma , who make many of the female contraceptives on the market , conducted trials into a male contraceptive in 2004 .
Their product was an implant with quarterly injections , but development was halted .
In a statement they said that they were " not convinced that this inconvenient regimen ( although efficient with a tolerable side effect profile ) would find sufficient market acceptance . "
" Compared with other pipeline assets , this project with non-ideal administration and questionable acceptance , could not be prioritised for going into Phase III despite a generally positive Phase II result . "
So , without pharmaceutical backing , will male birth control ever reach the market ?
Elaine Lissner says it may .
" It 's our governments and our non profit sector that are going to have to do this . "
The World Health Organisation , governments , and major donors are now backing research into new male contraceptives - with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently donating a significant sum towards the ultrasound method .
Schwarzenegger to speak at Bohemian Club conclave
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is scheduled to address a throng of rich and powerful men on Friday under the towering redwoods at the Bohemian Grove as the annual encampment along the Russian River in Monte Rio enters its final weekend .
No one other than Bohemian Club members and their guests will hear the governor 's speech , which is — like everything that transpires during the 17 - day midsummer enclave — done in absolute privacy .
Plutocrats and powerbrokers , including former presidents , annually flock to the 2,700 - acre wooded retreat where neither women , other than grove employees , nor outsiders of either gender are permitted .
" It 's a private gentleman 's club , " club spokesman Sam Singer said .
" People are coming to get away from the duties of daily life .
They do n't desire to be on the front page of The Press Democrat or The New York Times .
" In real life , they get there often enough , " he said .
The club has about 2,000 members .
Mixing their revelry and weird rituals with serious issues , the Bohemians hear from a series of speakers , this year including media mogul Rupert Murdoch , who discussed " the future of news " and former secretaries of state George Shultz and James Baker on international relations and terrorism threats .
The speakers list , including ex-President George H. W. Bush in 1995 and not -yet President Richard Nixon in 1967 , remains a well - guarded secret .
But on Thursday night , the club 's more artistically inclined members will go public , staging the 99th annual Monte Rio Variety
Show at the river community 's amphitheater , a fundraiser for three Monte Rio organizations .
The show and barbecue are open to the public and expected to beat last year 's record of more than $ 32,000 in proceeds , divided equally among the Monte Rio Fire Services Foundation , Monte Rio Elementary School Foundation and St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church .
" It 's huge , " said Michele McDonell , a show coordinator and church member , referring to the show 's $ 10,000 boost to her congregation .
A sellout is expected , but tickets may be available by telephone through Wednesday night at 865-2234 .
The entertainment lineup is not disclosed ahead of time , but the Bohemians " always guarantee a good show , " McDonell said .
Headliners last summer included country music singers Clint Black and Zac Brown , while Bob Weir and the Steve Miller Band have performed in the past .
British Petroleum and its subsidiaries have been the subject of roughly 8,000 reported incidents of spills , emissions and leaks of oil , chemicals and gases into the environment , according to a government database .
( download them here ) .
The National Response Center , which takes reports on oil spills , radiation leaks , chemical emissions and other environmental accidents , shows dozens of reports stemming from the April 20 explosion at British Petroleum 's Deepwater Horizon .
In addition to the crude oil flowing into the gulf , benzene , ethylbenzene , caustic soda solution and six other chemicals have been released into the water and air , according to incident reports submitted to the National Response Center .
The data shows more than 550 incidents in Mississippi Canyon , where the Deepwater Horizon platform is located .
BP facilities in Texas had the most episodes ( 2,629 ) followed by Louisiana ( 2,205 ) , which is bearing the brunt of the Deepwater Horizon disaster so far .
The records include reports of spills and gas releases at BP 's refineries , release of dangerous compounds from the company 's chemical operations , pipeline leaks , crude oil spills on the North Slope of Alaska , even jet fuel spills at airports from the company 's Air BP subsidiary .
Some of the episodes , like Deepwater Horizon , are environmental disasters , others are comparatively minor .
INTERACTIVE MAP : Incidents citing British Petroleum reported to National Response Center , 1990 - Present Source : National Response Center
Because the data is not standardized , finding all the Deepwater Horizon reports is difficult -- a text search yields 11 reports , but additional records can be found by searching for " Mississippi Canyon 252 , " the number of the well that exploded .
Many of the reports come from British Petroleum employees .
One received on May 7 , 2010 , at 8:50 a.m. , warned that the company was " conducting insitu - burning [ on - site burning ] of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill slicks in the Mississippi Canyon area in various blocks .
It is likely that the rq [ reportable quantity ] will be exceeded for benzene , ethylbenzene , nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide . "
The report goes on to note that " The unified command has made the decision to conduct insitu - burns in conjunction will oil spill response .
It is being conducted with regional response team approval .
Federal , state and local agencies have been notified and are involved with response . "
The National Reporting Center also has an 800 number for the public to report events , as well as a web - based reporting system .
The data , available from the National Response Center 's download page , covers reported incidents that are forwarded to the National Response Team , which consists of 16 federal agencies that have the responsibility for coordinating cleanup , investigating the incident if warranted , and assessing fines or penalties .
Data on which incidents resulted in fines or penalties is spread over those 16 agencies -- the Coast Guard , for example , uses a database called the Marine Information Safety and Law Enforcement System ( MISLE ) when it disposes of cases .
The Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group continues to search for resources and data for reporters and the public on the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Under the direction of Denise Faustman , MD , PhD , the Immunobiology Laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) has advanced the understanding of the role the human immune system plays in autoimmune diseases , cancer and transplantation .
From basic research into turning the immune system on to fight cancer to a Phase II clinical trial to reverse type 1 diabetes , the lab conducts and then translates basic research in applications that help patients .
Learning Disabilities was included in the 1975 authorization of the federal law Individual with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) after an organization of parents formed the first Association of Children with Learning Disabilities ( Heward , 2009 ) .
In the text , Exceptional Children : An Introduction to Special Education , 9th ed. , Heward claims since that time the number of children identified as learning disabled has tripled leading to an unending debate regarding the nature of what constitutes true a learning disability .
Finding the answers to what is a learning disability is can be a daunting task for the professional and parent .
What should be done to insure the student receives the best education possible when a parent suspects a child to have a learning disability ?
A common scenario might be the student is struggling in school , maybe refusing to do assigned work , perhaps does the work and constantly forgets to turn it in , or maybe the student is so disruptive in class the teacher is constantly calling home with ill reports .
As a parent you wonder what is happening .
How did your child go from a happy enthusiastic first grader to a disruptive , school skipping ninth grader ?
Larry Silver , M.D. and Ruth Spodak , Ph.D. answer these and other questions regarding what options are available for the student and what parents can legally ask for and obtain from public schools in an article found on LDonline .
What do you do if you Suspect That Your Child has a Learning Disability ?
( n.d. ) , gives parents step by step advice and notes the regulations associated with IDEA .
The first piece of advice Silver and Spodak offer is parents and teachers should never put the blame on the students .
Instead careful analysis as to the cause of the difficulty is warranted .
Ascertaining the epicenter of the student ’s learning difficulty requires assessment and or evaluation procedures .
Silver & Spodak ( 2007 ) discuss the type of assessment for educational issues , termed a “ psycho- educational ” evaluation .
When a broader range of brain function is suspected to be involved a “ neuro - psychological ” evaluation would be administered .
However , prior to any evaluation IDEA suggests a processed called Response to Intervention ( RTI ) be planned and implemented .
Primarily designed for grade school students this approach begins with the teacher trying additional strategies designed to help the student learn .
If the student does not make the necessary progress , the next step is to bring in another teacher specializing in the areas of deficit for the student .
After failing to be able to document progress using the first two strategies , an Individualized Education Plan ( IEP ) would be developed for the student .
Although the information provided is factual and somewhat helpful , the wary parent may still not know exactly what to do .
Silver & Spodak continue to offer step by step recommendations with the hope of assisting parents to make the effort to go and see the child ’s principal and explain concerns about the difficulty the child is having in school .
Following that meeting , the principal should hold a meeting with relevant special education professionals to discuss the concerns .
The group may or may not agree with the parents .
In this case Silver & Spodak cite two remaining options , ( 1 ) the parents can hire an outside professional to do the testing or ( 2 ) ask the school about an appeal process .
Parents opting to have the testing done by an outside party should give a copy of the results to the school for review .
Hypothesizing the school agrees testing is necessary a psycho-educational evaluation well most likely be done .
According to Silver & Spodak , this battery of testing will determine , “ your child ’s overall abilities , particularly learning style , information processing abilities , and academic skills ” ( p.2 ) .
Portions of the tests measure students academic skills in reading , written language and math .
The overall evaluation process may be a combination of informal and formal testing and students should be tested under timed and untimed circumstances .
Parents might expect to fill out interview questionnaires or surveys and the student may be pulled out of class or observed by professionals during class .
An occupational , speech or mental health therapist might be added to the assessment team .
Concluding the work of the evaluation process , a meeting will be held to go over the evaluation results .
Parents are often overwhelmed by the numbers or scoring information and presentation .
Silver & Spodak explain how the professional should sit down with the parents and make clear what the results mean as well as what strengths and weaknesses emerged .
Once the parents understand the areas which the child needs specialized instruction in and agree to services provided by the school district , another meeting will be called to determine the goals and action plan .
The plan of action depends on the scores from the testing criteria and how much assistance the team feels the student will need to be successful .
Silver & Spodak describe the 504 plan which emanates from a federal law basically designed to require employers to make the workplace accessible to persons with disabilities .
A Section of 504 Law is an anti-discriminatory policy law that relates to public schools because schools receive federal funding .
This law is more about accommodations and modification rather than specially designed instruction .
A 504 plan might include things like having the student sit at the front of the class , using a computer to produce written work , using a calculator to do math and receive additional time to finish tests or complete assignments .
The alternative plan is usually more detailed and as Silver & Spodak informs the plan requires the entire team meet , decide on appropriate goals and objectives including the time allotted for each service .
Additionally , defining where and when the services will take place must be stated .
This detailed information is put into a contract and signed by all parties .
The contract is called , “ Individualized Education Program . ”
According to Silver & Spodak , an IEP is generally designed to last for one year ’s time .
Over the course of the IEP year the professionals and parents should monitor the student ’s progress .
At the end of the contract year the team must have already met and decided on revisions to the initial document .
The public schools system struggles to comply with federal regulations regarding the protections of the rights of students with disabilities defined under IDEA .
One reason submitted is the seemingly explosion of students qualifying for special educations services as Learning Disabled as mentioned by Heward ( 2009 ) .
Parents have a struggle of their own when they suspect a beloved child to be learning disabled .
As Silver and Spovak revealed , often the child is deemed lazy or labeled a troublemaker .
Many loose hope by high school and dropout ( Heward , 2009 ) .
Silver and Spovak address these issues for parent in this article , What do you do if you suspect that your child has a learning disability ? , giving parents concrete and useful information regarding what to do first which is not make the difficulties worse by blaming the child and going to the authority of the school .
This is the principle to begin to take productive action on behalf of your child .
As mentioned the school personnel and parent may not always agree , however , the safeguards of appeal or out of school testing are available .
Once the process has completed , form initial concern to IEP or 504 plan the process repeats with ongoing support for the child with a learning disability .

According to research firm NPD Group , digital sales for PC gaming have risen quite a bit and are now closing in on retail sales .
We can safely say that Steam has played a huge part in the recent turn of events .
The reports from NPD group reveal that full - game PC digital download purchases reached 21.3 million in the U.S. during 2009 , slightly fewer than 23.5 million in retail box sales during the same period .
According to these numbers 48 percent of unit sales for PC games last year were digital downloads , and accounted for 36 percent of dollar sales , according to NPD Group estimates .
Although there was a rise in digital sales the overall PC gaming market did n’t grow by that much which has led to a 23 % drop in Retail game sales in the US to $ 538 million for 2009 .
NPD also released charts of the top digital retailers based on estimated unit sales and we already know who topped the sales charts for digital downloads .
Unfortunately actual sales figure for each site is not available as it would be interesting to know how much does steam account for in number of total digital downloads across all sites .
The charts have been divided into two separate categories – frontline ( retailers that sell digital games that may or may not be offered at traditional retail ) and casual game sites ( smaller casual games with try before you buy options and other payment methods ) :

Distracted driving
Learner 's permit holders and drivers under 18 are not allowed to use cell phones while driving .
This includes stops .
School bus operators are not allowed to use cell phones while driving .
School crossing zones are " No Phone Zones . "
Dallas , Austin , Galveston , El Paso , Missouri City and Stephenville have all enacted these distracted driving laws with minor variations .
seems like an easy problem to solve when you hear it , but you wonder , why is it still such a persistent problem ?
In Texas , to remedy distracted driving , several laws have been approved to counter this .
Two new laws have been enacted : one that bans teens from using mobile phones and text messaging devices and the other one prohibiting the use of cellphones in school zones .
In Missouri City , the first of June marked the start of the distracted driving ban .
The city has even posted traffic signs that state , " No Texts , Emails or Apps While Driving . "
In El Paso , the ban has been in effect since the first of May .
Though texting / cell phone use while driving is prohibited , hands - free devices are still allowed to use .
Galveston has started even earlier , with the ban being in effect since the fourteenth of January .
Fines go up to $ 500 .
As of yet , Texas lawmakers are still considering to give these laws an " O.K. " for Houston .

Scientists sent to help clean up oil spill to get minimum wage
July 8 , 2010
A dozen California scientists currently working on the major BP oil spill in the Gulf are scheduled to have their pay slashed to the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour by order of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
[ Capitol Weekly ]
The scientists are employed by California ’s Office of Spill Prevention and Response , making them state employees and subject to the governor ’s recent order to slash state salaries during the current budget negotiations .
The team of scientists are on duty in the Gulf–by order of the governor .
State controller John Chiang , a Democrat , is still refusing to comply with the governor ’s mandate , claiming his computer system is too outdated to manage a paycut for 200,000 employees .
The California scientists are spending 18 - hour days , combing the Louisiana shorelines for slick black birds and mapping out the plumes of billowing oil .
They are responsible for assessing the magnitude of damage done to the environment and its wildlife .
Several of the scientists already work two jobs to make ends meet .
They may not be able to continue their work in the Gulf without overtime or regular pay .
Under the governor ’s order , they will come home to find their checks depleted to a fifth of their usual pay rate , according to workers ’ estimates .
“ Gov. Schwarzenegger had no problem taking credit for ordering dozens of scientists to work long hours in support of the Gulf oil spill cleanup , ” said one observer .
“ They will be saddened to hear that they may come back to a minimum wage paycheck . ”

He was 54 .

Hamas Sends Patients to Israel Hamas sends up to 100 patients a month to Ichilov hospital alone .
Hospital treats patients from hostile Arab countries as well .
Maayana Miskin ,
Israel news photo Ayoub Kara talks to patients in Ichilov Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv treats up to 100 patients a month from Gaza , and often Hamas takes the role of middleman between Gaza residents and the Israeli hospital , Ichilov Director Professor Gabi Barabash said Thursday .
Barabash spoke to Deputy Minister Ayoub Kara , a resident of the Druze village of Dalyat El Carmel near Haifa , who was touring the hospital and viewing its care for foreign Arab patients .
In addition to caring for patients from Gaza , the Ichilov staff treats many citizens of foreign Arab countries , including those that have no diplomatic ties with Israel .
They all receive dedicated care , and the relatives who accompany them are provided with free food and a place to stay , Barabash said .
Kara praised the hospital 's care at the end of the tour .
Ichilov treats all of its patients equally , he said , but it is not the only one , and hospitals throughout the country send hundreds of people home to Gaza in good health each month after they arrived in Israel suffering from serious ailments .
He condemned Hamas for benefiting from the arrangement while giving nothing in return .
“ The time has come for Hamas to give us something small in return , ” he said , “ to release a single son of ours , who has been held for four years with no medical care , in exchange for the hundreds of people whose lives Israel saves every month . ”
Kara called on Arab countries to take action : “ I call on those Arab countries that are aware of how much we give them when it comes to medicine to call for Gilad Shalit 's release as well . ”
Shalit 's release would “ make the peace talks much more meaningful , ” he added .

By Jurgen Klinsmann
World Cup - winning striker , former Germany coach and BBC pundit
Germany have impressed everyone with their attacking displays en route to the semi-finals of this World Cup .
But it is only six years ago that , like England this summer , they were returning home early from a major tournament and wondering what the future held .
Germany had to rebuild after the disaster of the 2004 European Championship in Portugal .
We did not win a game and failed to get out of our group .
I got the chance to decide on the direction we took when I agreed to take over as Germany coach that summer , with current manager Joachim Loew as my assistant .
' Jogi ' and I began the whole regeneration process by trying to give our national team an identity .
We eventually decided to go down an attack - minded route , passing the ball on the ground from the back to the front line as quickly as possible using dynamic football .
Klinsmann and Loew designed a new blueprint for German football From that , we created a style of play that this Germany team in South Africa now really lives and breathes .
Since 2004 , we have reached two World Cup semi-finals and the final of Euro 2008 .
Can England recover from their poor showing in South Africa as quickly as Germany did six years ago ?
Yes , but they cannot just copy the German style and expect that to succeed for them .
Every nation has its own culture and specific environment as well as its own footballing identity .
England have to develop their own vision and decide how they should play .
As I found , making that vision work is not an easy process .
It will take time and England 's results might not be positive while it takes effect .
England will also need the help of the Premier League .
Every club coach will have their own philosophy but I tried to work with those in the Bundesliga to build something together .
There are a lot of foreign players and managers in England but that should not make a difference .
You simply have to explain to them what the style of play is that you want to develop and be prepared to persevere .
When Jogi and I took over the German side , we made our plans very public and made it clear that we were trying to rebuild from the bottom up .
The German Football Association ( DFB ) helped us by putting a lot of pressure on all the first and second division teams in the Bundesliga to build academy programmes and ensure talented young players were coming through but we still had to decide on our playing style .
Whatever approach the England team decides on , everybody in the English game needs to sign up to it
Jurgen Klinsmann
To do that , we quizzed everyone we could .
We held workshops with German coaches and players , asking them to write down on flip charts three things : how they wanted to play , how they wanted to be seen to be playing by the rest of the world and how the German public wanted to see us playing .
If we could define all of that , we thought we could lay out how we wanted to work and then , from there , sort out the training and paperwork behind the scenes .
What we ended up with amounted to 10 or 12 bullet points laying out our proposals .
We then announced that it was our intention to play a fast - paced game , an attacking game and a proactive game .
That last term was something the Germans did not really like because they did not really understand what proactive meant .
We just told them it meant we did not react to what our opponents did , we played the way that was right for us .
Once we had done all that , we created a curriculum for German football and presented it to the Bundesliga and DFB boards .
At that point , I told them I did not have the time to implement the strategy at all levels because I only had two years to prepare for the World Cup , so I asked for Germany 's Under - 21 team to adopt it and that was it .
I brought in a former international team - mate of mine , Dieter Eilts , to run the under - 21s and said they had to play the same way as the senior team because they would be a feeder for it .
I was always looking long - term but I knew our plans would be measured by our success at the 2006 World Cup .
There was a lot of negative media at the start .
Everybody agreed German football had to change after 2004 but nobody actually wanted to adopt our proposals .
For example , we told the Bundesliga teams and coaches that their players needed to be fitter to play the kind of football we wanted to play .
Germany thrashed England 4 - 1 in the quarter - finals
That meant carrying out fitness tests every three months , which did not go down well with some clubs because I was able to prove that some of them were training their players properly and others were not .
I was basically doubted for the two years I was coach - and when we lost 4 - 1 to Italy in a friendly game three months before the 2006 World Cup , everybody wanted my blood !
We had another game three weeks later against the United States and we won that one 4 - 1 .
That victory saved my job and kept me in charge for the World Cup because the DFB had been ready to make a change .
They wanted the conservative approach again , not the revolution .
But I kept on being positive , explaining that this was how I wanted us to play .
I did not know if we would master it in time for the 2006 World Cup but we would give it a shot .
We had the players for four solid weeks before the tournament began and were able to get our thoughts across .
They agreed to train the way we wanted them to and do extra work .
Soon they started to believe in the system .
606 : DEBATE
Germany will prove to be the most influential team at this World Cup
djmolineux 49
That was crucial because , no matter what your job is , you need to identify yourself with the work that you are doing and be happy .
I was happy because , as a former striker , I liked the style we intended to play .
I could never coach a team that played defensive - minded football .
I also think the players understood that I was the one taking the risk and that if it did not work out the DFB would send me packing back to California !
We started well at the 2006 World Cup and the public began to feel that something special was going to happen .
In the second game , when we beat Poland with a last - minute goal , the whole nation embraced us and said " yeah , that 's our team and that 's how we want them to play " .
We lost in the semi-final against Italy but I was still very proud .
After that World Cup , I was burned out after two years of banging my head against a wall but I made it clear to the DFB that Jogi had to take over after me to continue the job we had started .
He has continued to develop that initial style of play and is enjoying success .
It has taken Germany six years to learn to play it properly - and it has developed along the way - but the players are completely comfortable with it now .
Germany 's style of play might work for England because , in a way , Germany now play a lot like a typical Premier League team , with the emphasis on pacy attacks .
But whatever approach the England team decides on - whether it is attacking or defensive , patient or high tempo - everybody in the English game needs to sign up to it .
After all , it is the players , coaches and clubs who will help to make it work .

The San Jose Sharks re-signed restricted free - agent forward Devin Setoguchi to a one - year deal , $ 1.8 - million US contract , general manager Doug Wilson announced Saturday .
Setoguchi , 23 , finished tied for fourth on the team with 20 goals , including a career - high four game - winning tallies .
He also recorded 36 points in 70 games .
Setoguchi was a reliable player in the post - season , helping the Sharks to the Western Conference final by scoring five goals and four assists .
The Sharks were beaten by the eventual Stanley Cup champs , the Chicago Blackhawks .
" We 're happy to have Devin under contract for next season , " said Wilson .
" He is an important part of our team and we are looking forward to his on - going growth as a player .
We have very high expectations for him . "
The six - foot , 200 - pound right - winger was selected by San Jose in the first round ( 8th overall ) of the 2005 NHL draft .
So far , circumstances have worked in Mr. Christie ’s favor .
The State Senate has a new president , Stephen M. Sweeney , who is seen as less liberal than his predecessor , Richard J. Codey , and more inclined to work with the governor .
The recession , rising taxes and New Jersey ’s perilous financial situation give persuasive power to the call to rein in government , and give Democrats who might disagree little room to maneuver .
“ I think the tough times have dictated straight talk and forceful moves , and that fits him quite well , ” said George Norcross III , a Democratic power broker from Camden County .
But lawmakers in both parties say the governor and his team  a mix of old Trenton hands and people who worked for him in the United States attorney ’s office  have been strategically smart as well as lucky .
Mr. Christie chose top aides , led by Richard Bagger , his chief of staff and a former legislator , who have been able to smooth private negotiations when people are battling in public .
From the start , the governor served notice that he saw the public employees ’ unions as a central part of the state ’s problems , and that he meant to take them on .
His first day in office , he signed an executive order , later struck down in court , to limit their ability to finance campaigns .
The first bills he signed limited spending on pensions and benefits .
He relished months of verbal sparring with the teachers ’ union , and analysts say he got the upper hand .
Mr. Christie said there was no plan to put the unions front and center , though some of his aides say privately that it was quite intentional .
But on controlling local government spending and taxes , he acknowledged that “ yes , absolutely , ” there was a political strategy to doing things in a particular order .
The governor ’s budget reduced school aid , leading to predictions that districts would raise property taxes .
He blamed the teachers ’ union for any increases and proposed capping property tax increases .
Now he is using that cap as leverage for a package of bills , which has met union opposition , to help towns and school districts control spending .
The governor even pointed to areas where he might , uncharacteristically , tread lightly rather than face fierce resistance , like banning the holding of two or more government jobs simultaneously , a common practice among legislators .

The High Court of Justice on Tuesday heard the conflicting requests of the petitioners and the state in the petition protesting the gender - separated bus lines operated by the Egged and Dan bus cooperatives and said it would hand down its ruling soon .
The petitioners , including the Israel Religious Action Center ( IRAC ) and five women , including author Naomi Ragen , asked the court to halt a pilot study currently being conducted by the Transportation Ministry , Egged and Dan , and to hand down its ruling without further delay .
Earlier this year , the High Court issued an interim injunction calling on the Transportation Ministry and the bus companies to operate the gender - separated buses in accordance with the recommendations of a special committee appointed to examine the issue .
The committee wrote that the arrangement had to be purely voluntary and no coercion could be applied .
Furthermore , there could be no indication that the buses were officially segregated .
Thus , there could be no signs to that effect and both men and women should be allowed to board the bus from the back .
Furthermore , no new segregated routes could be opened during the test period .
The pilot project was launched in April .
On Tuesday , the state informed the court of the results so far and asked that it be allowed to continue with the second half of the study , which was due to last until October .
During the hearing , the state ’s representative , Dana Briskman , said that on the basis of the pilot project findings , the transportation minister would tell the court whether he was prepared to permanently implement the recommendations of the special committee .
IRAC attorney Einat Horowitz told the court there was no reason to continue the experiment and urged the court to rule now in favor of adopting the committee ’s recommendations .
But attorney Ricky Shapira - Rosenberg , representing several religious women ’s organizations , argued that the committee recommendations were unacceptable because there could not be such a thing as a voluntary arrangement , especially since the list of segregated buses was determined in the first place by the rabbis of the community .
“ The fact is that the entire haredi community , men , women and children , have already been told to behave according to the ideas of their rabbis , ” she told the court .
“ Let ’s say we conduct a test to see whether it is possible to arrive at a truly voluntary arrangement .
“ If I were a haredi woman living among haredim , would I listen to what the transportation minister said [ i.e. that one may sit wherever one wants ] or would I listen to the rabbis ?
I cannot fathom the idea that a haredi woman would dare board one of those buses where , until today , she would be ridiculed [ if she sat on the men ’s side of the bus ] but now , because the transportation minister says the seating arrangement is voluntary , she would board the bus and sit wherever she wanted .
” At one point , when an attorney representing the haredi organization Betzedek was arguing that there are virtually no incidents of coercion on the segregated buses , a woman , who later identified herself as Batya Litman , interrupted the hearing and charged that the lawyer was not telling the truth .
“ I have been attacked several times , ” she said , before Justice Elyakim Rubinstein ordered her to sit down .
Later , she told The Jerusalem Post that she came from a haredi family but had turned secular .
She said she often traveled on segregated Egged bus lines 40 and 49A to visit her parents and a close friend in the Ramot and Kiryat Mattersdorf neighborhoods in Jerusalem .
“ I have been physically attacked more than once , ” she said .
Another woman told the Post that the reason there were not more complaints from nonharedim about their treatment on the segregated buses was because they stopped using them , since they knew how unpleasant it could be .
Trailer for South of the Border .
By Oliver Stone , Mark Weisbrot and Tariq Ali
[ The following letter was sent to The New York Times . ]
June 27 , 2010 -- South of the Border -- The New York Times ' Larry Rohter attacks our film , South of the Border , for “ mistakes , misstatements and missing details ” .
But a close examination of the details reveals that the mistakes , misstatements and missing details are his own , and that the film is factually accurate .
We will document this for each one of his attacks .
We then show that there is evidence of animus and conflict of interest , in his attempt to discredit the film .
Finally , we ask that you consider the many factual errors in Rohter ’s attacks , outlined below , and the pervasive evidence of animus and conflict of interest in his attempt to discredit the film ; and we ask that The New York Times publish a full correction for these numerous mistakes .
1 ) Accusing the film of “ misinformation ” , Rohter writes that , “ A flight from Caracas to La Paz , Bolivia , flies mostly over the Amazon , not the Andes ... ”
But the narration does not say that the flight is “ mostly ” over the Andes , just that it flies over the Andes , which is true .
( Source : Google Earth ) .
2 ) Also in the category of “ misinformation ” , Rohter writes “ the United States does not ‘ import more oil from Venezuela than any other OPEC nation , ’ a distinction that has belonged to Saudi Arabia during the period 2004 - 10 . ”
The quote cited by Rohter here was spoken in the film by an oil industry analyst , Phil Flynn , who appears for about 30 seconds in a clip from US broadcast TV .
It turns out that Rohter is mistaken , and Flynn is correct .
Flynn is speaking in April 2002 ( which is clear in the film ) , so it is wrong for Rohter to cite data from 2004 - 2010 .
If we look at data from 1997 - 2001 , which is the relevant data for Flynn ’s comment , Flynn is correct .
Venezuela leads all OPEC countries , including Saudi Arabia , for oil imports in the US over this period .
( Source : US Energy Information Agency for Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . )
3 ) Rohter tries to discredit the film ’s very brief description of the 1998 Venezuelan presidential race :
As South of the Border portrays it , Mr. Chávez ’s main opponent in his initial run for president in 1998 was “ a 6 - foot - 1 - inch blond former Miss Universe ” named Irene Sáez , and thus “ the contest becomes known as the Beauty and the Beast ” election .
But Mr. Chávez ’s main opponent then was not Ms. Sáez , who finished third , with less than 3 percent of the vote .
It was Henrique Salas Romer , a bland former state governor who won 40 percent of the vote .
Rohter ’s criticism is misleading .
The description of the presidential race in the film , cited by Rohter , is from Bart Jones , who was covering Venezuela for the Associated Press from Caracas at the time .
The description is accurate , despite the final results .
For most of the race , which began in 1997 , Irene Sáez was indeed Chavez ’s main opponent , and the contest was reported as “ Beauty and the Beast ” .
In the six months before the election , she began to fade and Salas Romer picked up support ; his 40 per cent showing was largely the result of a late decision of both COPEI and AD ( the two biggest political parties in Venezuela at the time , which had ruled the country for four decades ) to throw their support behind him .
( See , for example , this 2008 article from BBC , which describes the race as in the film , and does not even mention Salas Romer : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7767417.stm.)
Rohter ’s description makes it seem like Saéz was a minor candidate , which is absurd .
4 ) Rohter tries to frame the film ’s treatment of the 2002 coup in Venezuela as a “ conspiracy theory ” .
He writes :
Like Mr. Stone ’s take on the Kennedy assassination , this section of South of the Border hinges on the identity of a sniper or snipers who may or may not have been part of a larger conspiracy .
This description of the film is completely false .
The film makes no statement on the identity of the snipers nor does it present any theory of a “ larger conspiracy ” with any snipers .
Rather , the film makes two points about the coup : ( 1 ) That the Venezuelan media ( and this was repeated by US and other international media ) manipulated film footage to make it look as if a group of Chavez supporters with guns had shot the 19 people killed on the day of the coup .
This manipulation of the film footage is demonstrated very clearly in the film , and therefore does not “ [ rely ] heavily on the account of Gregory Wilpert ” as Rohter also falsely alleges .
The footage speaks for itself .
( 2 ) The United States government was involved in the coup ( see http://southoftheborderdoc.com/2002-venezuela-coup/ and below ) .
Ironically , it is Rohter who relies on conspiracy theories , citing one dubious account in particular that he argues we should have included in the film .
5 ) Rohter accuses us of “ bend[ing ] facts and omit[ ting ] information ” on Argentina , for allowing “ Mr. Kirchner and his successor — and wife — Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to claim that “ we began a different policy than before ” .
In reality , Mr. Kirchner ’s presidential predecessor , Eduardo Duhalde , and Mr. Duhalde ’s finance minister , Roberto Lavagna , were the architects of that policy shift and the subsequent economic recovery , which began while Mr. Kirchner was still the obscure governor of a small province in Patagonia .
This criticism is somewhat obscure and perhaps ridiculous .
The Kirchners were in the presidency for five out of the six years of Argentina ’s remarkable economic recovery , in which the economy grew by 63 per cent .
Some of the policies that allowed for that recovery began in 2002 , and others began in 2003 , and even later .
What exactly are the “ bent facts ” and “ omitted information ” here ?
6 ) Rohter tries to make an issue out of the fact that the logo of Human Rights Watch appears for a couple of seconds on the screen , during a discussion of Washington ’s double standards on human rights .
The film does n’t say or imply anything about HRW .
Most importantly , in his interview with Rohter , HRW ’s Americas director José Miguel Vivanco backs up exactly what the film does say , that there is a double standard in the US that focuses on allegations of human rights abuses in Venezuela while ignoring or downplaying far graver , far more numerous , and better substantiated allegations , about human rights abuses in Colombia : “ It ’s true that many of Chávez ’s fiercest critics in Washington have turned a blind eye to Colombia ’s appalling human rights record ” , says Vivanco .
7 ) Rohter attacks co-writer Tariq Ali for saying , “ The government [ of Bolivia ] decided to sell the water supply of Cochabamba to Bechtel , a US corporation . ”
Rohter writes : “ In reality , the government did not sell the water supply : it granted a consortium that included Bechtel a 40 - year management concession ... ”
Rohter is really reaching here .
“ Selling the water supply ” to private interests is a fair description of what happened here , about as good for practical purposes as “ granting a 40 - year management concession ” .
The companies got control over the city ’s water supply and the revenue that can be gained from selling it .
Rohter ’s animus and conflict of interest
We gave Rohter an enormous amount of factual information to back up the main points of the film .
He not only ignored the main points of the film , but in the quotes he selected for the article , he picked only quotes that were not fact related that could be used to illustrate what he considered the director ’s and co-authors ' bias .
This is not ethical journalism ; in fact it is questionable whether it is journalism at all .
For example , Rohter was presented with detailed and documentary evidence of the United States ’ involvement in the 2002 coup .
( See http://southoftheborderdoc.com/2002-venezuela-coup.)
This was a major point in the film , and was backed up in the film by testimony from then Washington Post foreign editor Scott Wilson , who covered the coup from Caracas .
In our conversations with Rohter , he simply dismissed all of this evidence out of hand , and nothing about it appears in the article .
Rohter should have disclosed his own conflict of interest in this review .
The film criticises the New York Times for its editorial board ’s endorsement of the military coup of April 11 , 2002 , against the democratically elected government of Venezuela , which was embarrassing to the Times .
Moreover , Rohter himself wrote an article on April 12 , 2002 , that went even further than the Times ’ endorsement of the coup :
Neither the overthrow of Mr. Chavez , a former army colonel , nor of Mr. Mahuad two years ago can be classified as a conventional Latin American military coup .
The armed forces did not actually take power on Thursday .
It was the ousted president ’s supporters who appear to have been responsible for deaths that numbered barely 12 rather than hundreds or thousands , and political rights and guarantees were restored rather than suspended .
– Larry Rohter , New York Times , April 12 , 2002
These allegations that the coup was not a coup – not only by Rohter — prompted a rebuttal by Rohter ’s colleague at the New York Times , Tim Weiner , who wrote a Sunday Week in Review piece two days later entitled “ A Coup By Any Other Name ” ( New York Times , April 14 , 2002 ) .
Unlike the NYT editorial board , which issued a grudging retraction of their pro-coup stance a few days later ( included in our film ) , Rohter seems to have clung to the right - wing fantasies about the coup .
It is not surprising that someone who supports the military overthrow of a democratically elected government would not like a documentary like this one , which celebrates the triumphs of electoral democracy in South America over the last decade .
But he should have at least informed his readers that the New York Times ’ was under fire in this documentary , and also about his own reporting : in 1999 and 2000 he covered Venezuela for the Times , writing numerous anti-Chavez news reports .
The media ’s biased and distorted reporting on Latin America is a major theme of the documentary , one which Rohter also conveniently ignores in is 1665 - word attempt to discredit the film .
We spent hours with Rohter over the course of two days and gave him all the information he asked for , even though his hostility was clear from the outset .
But he was determined to present his narrative of intrepid reporter exposing sloppy filmmaking .
The result is a very dishonest attempt to discredit the film by portraying it as factually inaccurate — using false and misleading statements , out - of - context , selective quotations from interviews with the director and writers , and ad hominem attacks .
The Times should apologise for having published it .

New York Times to Oliver Stone : It ’s CHA-vez , Not sha-VEZ
By Gregory Wilpert

It is truly amazing how a long - time Latin America correspondent who accuses Oliver Stone ’s recently released documentary South of the Border of “ mistakes , misstatements and missing details ” manages to get practically every single statement of his own wrong , misstated , or lacking in detail .
This is all the more amazing , considering that the filmmakers and I spoke to Rohter at length last week and provided him with the plenty of information to back up the film ’s points , which he chose to ignore .
So what makes mine any different ?
I did n't decide these matches – an all - knowing , face - recognizing , database - searching , algorithm - crunching computer did !

ROSITA BOLANDhit Sligo ’s Dunmoran Strand yesterday , for a journalistic assignment with a difference : the ‘ Dip in the Nip ’ charity swim
THE SECOND annual Dip in the Nip , in aid of the Irish Cancer Society , took place on Dunmoran Strand in Sligo yesterday morning .
Last year , 180 women took part , and € 56,000 was raised .
This year , the event was open to men too , and from early morning , more than 200 people made their way along the winding back roads from Ballysadare , following the pink balloons tied to signposts along the way .
I was one of them , driving there with just the tiniest level of trepidation .
Is it possible to report properly on an event where everyone gets naked without doing the same yourself ?
It might be , but I had decided I was going to join in anyway .
Just call it , oh dear , immersion journalism .
Dunmoran Strand is a glorious picture - postcard secluded beach ; long , curved and sandy .
Dippers , as participants are called , had received a text with location instructions the previous evening .
Last year , the dip was at Lissadell .
Dippers in dressing gowns and wrapped in towels mustered on the wind - swept beach before 11 am , women far outnumbering the men .
The men were at the far end of the strand , and male stragglers arriving late were heckled merrily by the women they had to pass in front of .
Who knew there were so many men called David Hasselhoff in Ireland ?
The women may have been going into the water , but that does n’t mean they were wearing nothing : feather boas , pink gloves , tiaras , pink hair ribbons and bows , and huge earrings were everywhere .
If you disregarded the beach beyond , it could have been a very large hen party .
Among those waiting for the signal to disrobe were friends Deirdre Gillan , Lorraine Harte from Sligo and Susan Graffin from Antrim .
They had raised more than € 1,600 between them .
“ I work in a flower shop .
I make a lot of wreaths , ” Harte explained .
“ I see the effects of cancer every day .
Every day , someone is being buried . ”
“ Everyone is Ireland knows someone who has been affected by cancer , ” Gillan stated .
“ We ’re doing this to raise money , and also because it ’s something you ’ll look back on in 50 years when you ’re in a nursing home , and you ’ll say : ‘ I did that ’ , ” Harte laughed .
Geraldine Daly from Boyle , Co Roscommon , was participating because her husband died two years ago of bowel cancer .
“ He was only 53 , ” she revealed quietly .
Everywhere , there were stories .
Maura Duignan from Leitrim , was doing the dip for the memory of her aunt , Vera Garvey , who died of breast cancer recently .
“ I ’ll have some natural buoyancy in the water , ” she said , smiling .
That would be because she was seven months pregnant .
One of the men present was Kevin Dorrian , from Fanad in Co Donegal .
By yesterday , he estimated he had raised € 1,500 .
He was there to honour his aunt , who was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago , and who has since died .
ONE OF THE LAST women to come down onto the beach was Carol Wilson .
She was slower than most of us , as she was on beribboned crutches due to a recent knee replacement .
Why was she there ?
“ I ’m doing this for my mother , ” she explained .
“ She has breast cancer , and today is her 90th birthday .
This is for her . ”
I ’m afraid I did n’t find out where the brave and spirited Carol was from , because Terry Wogan was counting us into the water live on air from his radio show in London at that point in our conversation .
Besides , I had left my notebook back down the beach with my sandals .
For the record , I felt more naked without the notebook than without my clothes .
On the count of three , everyone – women at one end and men at the other – flung aside their wraps and hurtled towards the surf .
Gasp .
I think it was cold in the water .
It must have been .
Is n’t it always , in the Atlantic ?
To be honest , I ca n’t really remember .
Perhaps I was simply numb .
The adrenaline propelled us all forwards anyway , despite the temperature .
It was definitely wet .
Once everyone was in – fully in , I ’ll have you know , no paddling – a spontaneous round of applause went up among us .
I do n’t know what it was like down the men ’s end , but I do know they all scarpered out of the water long before their hardier female counterparts , much to our entertainment .
Down our end , everyone was laughing .
And everyone was equal in the ocean , whether they were women with two breasts , women missing one breast or both , women with more of a stomach than they might like ; all united in their display of scars , stomachs , and proudly exposed imperfect bodies .
It was exhilarating , those shared moments of grace and pure fun ; a powerful and lovely collective carpe diem on Dunmoran Strand yesterday in Sligo .

There are growing fears that the dispute could lead to a major schism in world Jewry and the prime minister is facing a choice between further isolating his country or the possible collapse of his government .
Mr Netanyahu said this week that the proposed law could “ tear apart the Jewish people ” .
He has received tens of thousands of emails of protest from American Jews , who have been urged to contact him by their rabbis .
Bell , one of the poorest cities in Los Angeles County , pays its top officials some of the highest salaries in the nation , including nearly $ 800,000 annually for its city manager , according to documents reviewed by The Times .
In addition to the $ 787,637 salary of Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo , Bell pays Police Chief Randy Adams $ 457,000 a year , about 50 % more than Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck or Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and more than double New York City ’s police commissioner .
Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia makes $ 376,288 annually , more than most city managers .
Top officials have routinely received hefty annual raises in recent years .
Rizzo ’s contract calls for 12 % raises each July , the same as his top deputy , according to documents obtained under the California Public Records Act .
Rizzo , who has run Bell ’s day - to - day civic affairs since 1993 , was unapologetic about his salary .

“ If that ’s a number people choke on , maybe I ’m in the wrong business , ” he said .
“ I could go into private business and make that money .
This council has compensated me for the job I ’ve done . ”
Spaccia agreed , adding : “ I would have to argue you get what you pay for . ”
Bell Mayor Oscar Hernandez defended the salaries .
“ Our city is one of the best in the area .
That is the result of the city manager .
It ’s not because I say it .
It ’s because my community says it . ”
Hernandez and other council members said the city was near bankruptcy when Rizzo came aboard 17 years ago .
Since then , they said , he has put Bell on sound financial footing , with its general fund nearly tripling to about $ 15 million .

“ Our streets are cleaner , we have lovely parks , better lighting throughout the area , our community is better , ” Hernandez said .
“ These things just do n’t happen , they happen because he had a vision and made it happen . ”
Bell made headlines in recent weeks when the city of 37,000 agreed to take over operations of the neighboring city of Maywood , which fired most of its employees and disbanded its police department when it could not obtain insurance .
Located about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles , Bell has a population that is about 90 % Latino and 53 % foreign - born .
Its per capita income is about half that for the U.S .
Experts in city government said they were amazed at the salaries the city pays , particularly Rizzo’s .
“ I have not heard anything close to that number in terms of compensation or salary , ” said Dave Mora , West Coast regional director of the International City / County Management Assn. , and a retired city manager .
Advertisement
By comparison , Manhattan Beach , a far wealthier city with about 7,000 fewer people , paid its most recent city manager $ 257,484 a year .
The city manager of Long Beach , with a population close to 500,000 , earns $ 235,000 annually .
Los Angeles County Chief Executive William T Fujioka makes $ 338,458 .
The salaries do not appear to violate any laws , said Dave Demerjian , head of the Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s Public Integrity Division .
State law governs how much city council members can be paid , but not the amounts that council members decide to pay administrators , Demerjian said .
The district attorney is investigating Bell over the hefty compensation of its City Council members -- about $ 100,000 a year for part - time positions .
Normally , council members in a city the size of Bell would be paid about $ 400 a month , Demerjian said .
Advertisement
The council has increased its compensation by paying members for serving on a variety of city agencies , including the Community Redevelopment Agency , the Community Housing Authority , the Planning Commission , the Public Financing Authority , the Surplus Property Authority and the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority .
Demerjian said city records show each council member receives $ 7,873.25 per month for sitting on those boards
Records indicate that the boards of those agencies perform little work and that board meetings take place during council meetings , though the names of some of the agencies seldom appear .
In some years , the council would hold separate meetings for those agencies , and they would sometimes last no more than a minute .
On July 31 , 2006 , four agencies each met for one minute .
On March 3 , 2008 , the redevelopment agency meeting was called to order at 7:21 p.m. and adjourned at 7:22 p.m .

Councilman Luis Artiga , who was appointed to the council 15 months ago to fill an unexpired term , said he had no idea how much he would be paid .
When he received his first check , he thought it was “ a miracle from God . ”
Artiga , who is pastor of Bell Community Church , said he uses about half his salary to pay the church ’s mortgage .
Rizzo received his bachelor ’s degree from UC Berkeley and a master ’s in public administration from Cal State East Bay .
Council members hired Rizzo in 1993 from the High Desert city of Hesperia as interim chief administrative officer with a starting salary of $ 72,000 a year .
By September 2004 , he was being paid $ 300,000 a year .
Ten months later , his salary jumped 47 % to $ 442,000 .
Advertisement
His salary continued climbing $ 52,000 a year until July 1 , 2008 , when Rizzo received his usual salary increase and signed an addendum to his contract that gave him a 5 % raise in September and guaranteed 12 % increases each July .
His last raise was $ 84,389.76 .
Next July , he will receive a $ 94,516 pay hike .
Rizzo defended his salary and that of his staff and the council by saying they do n’t receive car or cellphone allowances and must pay their own way to out - of - town conferences .
However , according to their contracts , Rizzo , Spaccia and Adams can be reimbursed for their expenses .
Bell council members are also eligible for reimbursements as board members of several city commissions , according to city resolutions .
Advertisement
Adams , who said he spent $ 6,000 of his own money to buy furniture for his office , was hired after retiring as the police chief in Glendale .
His salary of $ 215,304 more than doubled when he took the job in Bell .
Spaccia was hired July 1 , 2003 , at $ 102,310 .
A year later , she was making $ 130,000 .
She currently earns $ 376,203 and gets the same 12 % annual increases as Rizzo .
Spaccia has been on leave since February while serving as acting city manager for Bell ’s troubled neighbor Maywood , with her salary being paid by Bell ’s taxpayers .
“ We have a neighbor in trouble , ” said Rizzo , a short heavy - set man with reddish - brown hair .
“ If your neighbor ’s yard is messed up , it brings down your property values .
Is it a unique situation ?
Definitely . ”

On top of his salary , Rizzo recently received an added boost -- the council voted to give him an extra week ’s vacation .
He now gets five weeks .

New set pics from the Atlanta filming of The Walking Dead reveal a version of one of the most memorable scenes from the comic .
Plus get your first look at the comic book character Glenn in the bloody , bloody flesh !
Advertisement
On Location Vacations has a collection of stills from on the set of The Walking Dead .
And even though they are pretty blurry , the scene the crew is recreating from the comic is unmistakable .
What you 're see here is the hero Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) , hatchet in hand , and his new - found friend Glenn , played by Steven Yeun ... spoilery details below :
Advertisement
The reason Rick and Glenn are covered in red is all their own doing .
The two fellas need to get inside Atlanta , which has been all but overrun with the undead .
Rick notices that while the zombies do n't seem too bright they never attack each other .
They soon realize it 's because they all stink , and the dead can smell their own .
So the only way to get into the city on foot without getting attacked by 1,000 of ex-citizens is to cover oneself with zombie blood and shamble in , quietly .
Because they are also attracted to noise .
What you 're seeing here is the quiet and smelly tip - toeing through hundreds of the undead , hoping not to get caught .

I showed you already in the past some photos of this wonderful town in the South of Germany , Freiburg .
Here is now my second part .
Beautiful street scenes at a nice and sunny summer day .
But , what doing if you are at a wonderful place but the weather is bad .
Coming back again , when the weather is better ?
Sometimes not an option .
In such a case I would replace the sky .
On a photo of a overcast day the colors are not so nice and the sky looks terrible .
One advantage of HDR is , that it is possible to get some of the colors back ( see here my approach ) .
It would be of course better to do it on a sunny day , but if that is not possible I would highly recommend to do HDR and hope to get more colors back in the post processing .
To replace a sky there are several methods out there ( One very easy way to do it is using the new edge refinement tool of Photoshop CS5 .
But this is not all the time perfect and you can get in trouble and maybe you do n’t have CS5 ) .
I personally prefer a combined method of blending and masking .
Here is my initial photo to demonstrate my procedure
First , I blend my HDR version with my best normal shot ( very often 66 % HDR / 33 % normal ) .
This gives the shot a more realistic looks .
You can see that I mask out the HDR shot where moving people are in the picture to eliminate ghosts .
To ensure a smoother blending of both shots in this areas .
I adjust the ground layer ( my normal shot ) to the lightness of the HDR shot by means of an adjustment layer .
My photoshop file :
Next , I clone out the wire in the sky ( fourth layer from the bottom ) .
The next layer is a general adjustment layer to increase the contrast .
The photo till now has a nice street scene but a boring sky .
Now start the really sky replacement .
Channel View :
To get a nice mask of the sky , I switch to the channel view and duplicate the blue channel .
Because an overcast sky is mainly grey or slightly blue , this channel is almost complete white in the sky and a good staring point for a sky mask .
In the next step , I need to make everything that is dark grey turn into black and everything that is very light turn into white .
I use for the the dodge and burn tool .
Apply the dodge tool to the highlight and brush over the fringes of the white sky makes every this that is lightly grey completely white .
Apply the burn tool to the shadows and brush over the houses and street scene to make everything that is dark grey pitch black .
The result is my layer mask 3 and will be my mask for the sky .
Final photoshop file :
I use this layer mask to my sky layer ( top layer in my photoshop document ) .
Here I could stop my tutorial for replacing the sky .
But very often this technique still results in some fringing around the houses , although the mask is almost perfect .
For better fringes I use a blending mode technique .
An overcast sky is usually lighter than a blue sky , thus if you use the “ darken ” blend mode for the sky , you get a perfect fit between houses and sky .
If this blend mode does n’t work perfectly , you can improve the result , if you just increase the lightness of the overcast sky ( second top layer ) .
Here is now the final photo .
I hope that blog entry was helpful for you .
Please let me know what you think .
Enclosed some further shots from Freiburg ( with replaced sky ) .

In Mr. King ’s view , the fight to organize workers and improve their wages and benefits is important , but it ’s part of a much broader effort to improve the lives of individuals and families throughout the country and beyond .
He is a believer in cooperative efforts and shared sacrifice , and is unabashedly idealistic as he outlines what can only be described as a new activism on labor ’s part .
He promised his members last month that the U.A.W. would be marching and campaigning and organizing  for jobs , for a moratorium on home foreclosures , for civil and human rights and against the mistreatment of immigrants , and for peace .
“ The Tea Party has been more vocal than we ’ve been , ” he said .
“ There is something wrong with that picture . ”
This is not the way that prominent leaders in any segment of our society have spoken for a long time .
The pragmatists and cynics , who have gotten a stranglehold on the culture , will scoff .
But the pragmatists and cynics , with their hubris and half - baked ideologies , have handed all the wealth of the nation to a favored few and left the rest of the society a ragged mess .
It ’s no accident that the great progressive successes of the labor movement , the civil rights movement , a variety of other social justice movements , and the emergence of a vast and thriving middle class all converged in the early post - World War II decades .
But the counterattack from the right , with its assaults on labor , its outlandishly regressive tax policies , its slavish devotion to corporate power and its divide - and - conquer strategies on racial and ethnic issues all combined to halt the remarkable advances of ordinary working people .
All you have to do now is look around at what the right has wrought .
Bob King has a vision that draws upon the lessons of that postwar period , starting with the basic right of workers to organize if they wish without being terrorized by employers .
It was the fact that workers were organized in the auto and other manufacturing industries that sparked the creation of a large middle class in America .
Those well - paying union jobs allowed working families to buy a home , to put their children through school , to build better lives .
The wages from those jobs fueled the consumer demand that powered America ’s economic success .
Even as he looks toward the future , Mr. King is trying to remind us of what went right in the past .
She 's deep into futurist Ray Kurzweil and loves Octavia Butler 's writing .
But her science fiction stories play out over itchy beats , under a James Brown cape .
io9 interviews the unclassifiable musician about her influences and dreams for the future .

Janelle Monae has gotten attention for being the rare mainstream artist who is clearly doing her own thing , drawing from influences as diverse as James Brown , psychedelia , punk , and Disney 's Fantasia .
Her albums tell the epic story of Cindy Mayweather , the Alpha Platinum 9000 , a droid optimized for rock performance , often cloned but never equaled .
Cindy is on the run , having fallen in love with the human millionaire Anthony Greendown – a pairing which , in Metropolis , is against the law .
There is a history of musicians working with futuristic themes — think David Bowie , P. Funk , Kool Keith / Dr. Octagon , or Nona Hendryx of LaBelle .
But Monae has tighter bonds to science fiction .
She did a concert in an episode of Stargate Universe , and has alluded to various science fiction authors who inspired her .
In an interview with io9 , she talked about some of her influences .
Her Metropolis draws on Fritz Lang's , and on his and Asimov 's concerns with the welfare of robots .
" The quote [ from Lang ] that I was really inspired by was ‘ the mediator between the mind and the hand is the heart , ' " says Monae .
" When I read that , I said , That 's me !
I like uniting people with the music we 're creating . "
Advertisement
Monae also identifies with Octavia Butler 's novels .
She explains :
Her work was first of all brilliantly written , and Wild Seed was the book that inspired me .
I loved the characters , and the morphing .
[ Anyanwu ] was just such a transformative character , and I look at myself as a transformative artist .
Just the fact that [ Butler ] defied race and gender … .
You appreciated her work for being a human being .
Talking about Ray Kurzweil 's futurist manifesto
The Singlularity is Near , it 's clear that Monae is not just a creator of speculative fiction as allegory , she 's a futurist .
Her music is n't dealing out what - ifs .
She 's actively trying to prepare us all for what 's to come .
Monae explains her vision of the future :
It 'll happen - there 'll be a point where the android 's brain will have mapped out that of a human's , and their knowledge will have surpassed that of ours .
And we wo n't be able to differentiate the speaking voice of an android from an actual human's .
I do believe that that will be true , because of the rapid speed of technology and nanotechnology advancing ….
I know that we will live in this world .
How will we all act ?
Will we teach our kids to fear the android ?
Will we treat the android inhumanely ?
Act superior ?
I want people to wrap their minds around that .
I think that we need a mediator , if we 're all gonna rewrite history , and not oppress the Other .
The Archandroid , Cindy , is the mediator , between the mind and the hand .
She 's the mediator between the haves and the have - nots , the oppressed and the oppressor .
She 's like the Archangel in the Bible , and what Neo represents to the Matrix .

In the lush song " Metropolis " ( from a hard - to - find demo album called " Audition " ) , Monae 's voiceover runs :
And it 's a common thought that wired folk can be sold and bought , that we have no feelings , no memories or minds ; that we 're bionic strumpets , only worth a dime .
To some it 's a surprise … when I hold your hand , they say , ‘ How can a wired thing understand ?
Love is too deep , too wide to feel . '

Here she 's romanced Asimov and Butler in just a few lines ; it 's simultaneously a love story , legal commentary , and echoes of African - American history .
Likewise the video for the electrifying song " Many Moons . "
The " short film , " as Monae bills it , is perhaps the most vivid picture we have yet of her Metropolis .
The scene : a droid sale , part fashion show , part slave auction , in which dozens of riding - gear - clad Cindy Mayweather clones strut for an audience including fanged " tech dandy " Chung Knox , Neon Valley crimelord Mousey , jealous Metropolis police commander 6ix Savage , and " punk prophets " ( Deep Cotton , musicians from the present and Monae 's collaborators ) .
Against this backdrop , Cindy does what she 's destined to do : rock out with a superhuman energy that ultimately short - circuits her .
The video ends with a quote from Cindy that evokes the Underground Railroad : " I imagined many moons in the sky , lighting the way to freedom . "
What about the equestrian outfits in Many Moons – is it a class statement ?
Echoes of the lawn - jockey aesthetic in Outkast 's video for " Hey Ya " ?
In other interviews , Monae has called the tuxedos she wears a " uniform , " likening it to those worn by her working - class parents .
" It 's really to pay homage to them , " she says .
" This is my job ; when you see me in this uniform , I 'm working .
This is n't a play thing for me . "

And the uniform is n't just about class ; it 's a gender thing , too :
I feel like I have a responsibility to my community and other young girls to help redefine what it looks like to be a woman .
I do n't believe in men's wear or women 's wear , I just like what I like .
And I think we should just be respected for being an individual ….
I 've been in Vogue , now , and different publications , which is cool , because I think that it just shows a different perspective of how women can dress .

This is what it boils down to – the eclectic musical influences , the focus on the android as Other , the " Ten Droid Commandments " pamphlet handed out at her concerts which encourages the audience to " abandon your expectations about art , race , gender , culture , and gravity . "
Monae is working with her collective , the Wondaland Arts Society , to carve out a space for us all to be brave enough to be ourselves .
The word " weirdo " shows up in many of her songs .
In " Faster : "
Am I a freak ?
Or just another little weirdo ?
Call me weak , or better yet – you can call me your hero , baby .
Advertisement
It also comes up in her history ; when she was 12 , she was in a band called The Weirdoz .
Monae is clear that she makes her artistic decisions to give others courage to break out of the norm .
She says :
That 's what I 've always been fighting for - making sure that people love themselves for who they are , and we do n't pick on people because we 're uncomfortable with ourselves , or who they are .
That 's been my message , from when I was young to now .
There are lots of young girls out there who are struggling with their identities … afraid of being discriminated against or teased .
I take risks and use my imagination so that other people will feel free and take risks .
That 's my hope .

Monae is coy on the subject of where Cindy will go in the next album , but she definitely has plans to tell more stories .
She says there are plans to make visuals for each of the songs on the Metropolis album ; she 's tweeted about plans to make a movie .
Also , negotiations are afoot to find a distributor for the graphic novel she has written with collaborator Chuck Lightning , illustrated by Chad Weatherford .
Meanwhile , she appears to be touring as hard as she can , taking her " emotion picture show " around the country with the following Droid Commandments warning to the audience :
Please be aware that children conceived during the show or within 48 hours thereafter may be born with wings .
The Wondaland Arts Society will not be held liable for this phenomenon or be held responsible for parenting or providing for your flying children .
A group of researchers hired by the U.S. Department of State found staggering levels of opium in Afghan children , some as young as 14 months old , who had been passively exposed by adult drug users in their homes .
In 25 % of homes where adult addicts lived , children tested showed signs of significant drug exposure , according to the researchers .
According to one of the researchers , the children exhibit the typical behavior of opium and heroin addicts .
If the drug is withdrawn , they go through a withdrawal process .
The results of the study should sound an alarm .
Not only were opium products found in indoor air samples , but their concentrations were also extremely high .
This suggests that , as with second - hand cigarette smoke , contaminated indoor air and surfaces pose a serious health risk to women ’s and children 's health .
The extent of health problems in children as a result of such exposure is not known .
What is known is that the number of Afghan drug users has increased from 920,000 in 2005 to over 1.5 million , according to Zalmai Afzali , the spokesman for the Ministry of Counter - Narcotics ( MCN ) in Afghanistan .
A quarter of those users are thought to be women and children .
Afzali stated that Afghanistan could become the world 's top drug - using nation per capita if current trends continue .
According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , no other country in the world produces as much heroin , opium and hashish as Afghanistan — a sad distinction for a country already ravaged by war .
This may explain why control efforts so far have been concentrated on poppy eradication and interdiction to stem exports , while less attention was paid to the rising domestic addiction problem , particularly in children .
Both American and Afghan counter narcotic officials have said that such widespread domestic drug addiction is a relatively new problem .
Among the factors leading to increased levels of drug use is the high unemployment rate throughout the country , the social upheaval provoked by this war and those that preceded it , as well as the return of refugees from Iran and Pakistan who became addicts while abroad .
In both those countries , the high number of opium - addicted children is also a serious problem , particularly among street children .
In Tehran , although the government has opened several shelters for street children , many more centers are still needed to take care of them .
According to some estimates , there are between 35,000 and 50,000 children in Tehran who are forced by their parents or other adults to live and beg in the streets or to work in sweatshops .
These children are subject to all kinds of abuse , and many among them end up in organized prostitution rings and become part of the sex trade .
They are transported to other countries where they are obliged to work as prostitutes , while others simply disappear .
The situation is equally serious in Pakistan , where in Karachi alone there are tens of thousands of children who are addicted , as drug trafficking prevails all over the city .
In Karachi , the main addiction is to hashish .
According to Rana Asif Habib , president of the Initiator Human Development Foundation ( IHDF ) , due to the increase in the number of street children , the street crime rate is also on the rise as children get involved in drug trafficking activities in the city .
Injecting drug users face the additional risk of HIV - infection through the sharing of contaminated syringes .
" Drug addiction and HIV / AIDS are , together , Afghanistan 's silent tsunami , " declared Tariq Suliman , director of the Nejat 's rehabilitation center to the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs .
There are about 40 treatment centers for addicts dispersed throughout the country , but most are small , poorly staffed and under - resourced .
For the first time ever , an international team including World Health Organization ( WHO ) officials and experts from Johns Hopkins University and the Medical University of Vienna have joined efforts to design a treatment regime for young children .
The United States and its allies have the resources to rapidly expand and adequately fund and resource such treatment and rehabilitation centers throughout the country .
Anything less will be yet another serious indictment of an occupation gone astray .
But that boys should suffer corporal punishment , though it be a received custom , and Chrysippus makes no objection to it , I by no means approve ; first , because it is a disgrace and a punishment for slaves , and in reality ( as will be evident if you imagine the age changed ) an affront ; secondly , because , if a boy 's disposition be so abject as not to be amended by reproof , he will be hardened , like the worst of slaves , even to stripes ; and lastly , because , if one who regularly exacts his tasks be with him , there will not be the least need of any such chastisement .
( Institutes of Rhetoric , 1.3.14 )
The children would also come to the public messes , and were taken there as though to schools of modesty .
The would listen to political discussions and would see amusements worthy of free men .
They themselves would learn to play and joke without rudeness , and not get angry when being joked at .
For it was thought to be a specifically [ Spartan ] virtue to put up with jokes , but if one found this intolerable , one could simply ask the jester to stop and he would comply .
( Lycurgus , 12 )
Be it enacted forever and for all future days :
If a son says to his father , " You are not my father , " he [ the father ] can cut off his [ the son's ] locks , make him a slave and sell him for money .
If a son say to his mother , " You are not my mother , " she can cut off his locks , turn him out of town , or ( at least ) drive him away from home , deprive him of citizenship and of inheritance , but his liberty he loses not .
If a father say to his son , " You are not my son , " the latter has to leave house and field and he loses everything .
If a mother says to her son , " You are not my son , " he shall leave house and furniture .
( A Collection of Mesopotamian Laws , 1 )
Then Athenalstan said , “ Whose child is this ? ”
“ A servant girl ’s in Norway , ” answered Huak .
“ King Herald said you should foster up her child . ”
King Athenalstan said , “ This lad ’s eyes are not those of a servant . ”
Huak answered “ The mother is a servant - girl .
She says King Herald is the father .
Now you have taken the lad on your knee , you must treat him just as he were you own son . ”
The king replied , “ Why should I foster up Harald ’s child , even if he were legitimate ?
Much less his servant - girl ’s child . ”
With one hand he reached for the sword that lay nearby , with the other , the child .
Then Huak said , “ You have taken King Harald ’s child on your knee as your foster - son .
You can slaughter him now if you want , but for all that you wo n’t be able to destroy all of King Harald ’s sons like that .
And from now on , everyone will say , as they have always done , that a man who fosters another ’s child is less noble than him . ”
( “ Noregs Tununga Tal ” , part of the Flateyjarbók . )
But as soon as a baby can recognize facial expressions and understand approval and disapproval , training should be begun so that he will do what he is told to do and stop when so ordered .
After a few years of this , punishment with the bamboo can be minimized , as parental strictness and dignity mingled with parental love will lead the boys and girls to a feeling of respect and caution and give rise to filial piety .
I have noticed about me that wherever there is love without training this result is never achieved .
Children eat , drink , speak , and act as they please .
Instead of needed prohibitions , they receive praise ; instead of urgent reprimands , they receive smiles .
Even when children are old enough to learn , such treatment is still regarded at the proper method .
Only after the child has formed proud and arrogant habits do they try to control him .
But one may whip the child to death , and he will still not be respectful , while the growing anger of the parents only increases his resentment .
After he grows up , such a child at last becomes nothing but a scoundrel .
( Household Instructions . )
Perhaps your parents or grandparents had different approaches to raising children than you are using in bringing up your own children .
These were n't necessarily bad means of parenting -- but different because they reflected cultural values that have changed over the generations .
Much has changed in the long human history of parenting .
And a lot has n't changed at all .
I think that you 'll see that as we explore how children were raised in five historical societies .
In theory , under the law and principle of patria potestas -- the power of the father -- the male head of household held absolute power over his children .
He could discipline them as he wished , or even kill them or sell them into slavery .
In practice , however , there were many formal and informal limitations to this practice .
Exposure at birth was common for unwanted children -- provided that it was the father who made the decision -- although this infanticide was legally considered murder during the last centuries of the western empire .
Valued children were given a bulla or bag of magical charms worn around the neck to protect them from harm .
Childhood lasted until about thirteen for girls , when they were married off , or fourteen for boys , when their medallion of childhood was replaced with the toga of adulthood .
Girls were educated in domestic skills at home , and sufficiently wealthy boys attended local schools .
Discipline could be harsh , but many Romans realized that the rod was counterproductive .
Quintilian , in a text on rhetoric and pedagogy , wrote :
In classical Greece , it was legal and fairly common to abort or expose unwanted babies .
Those that were kept and survived early infancy were nursed by mothers or wet nurses , commonly slaves devoted to the task .
Children were often given toys at sacred festivals , such as balls , miniature chariots , or dolls made from clay and rags .
Upon reaching adulthood , the children would dedicate their toys to various gods as a rite of passage .
Girls were kept at home until they married , but boys were able to go out and acquire an education -- a task that Greek intellectuals took very seriously .
Here ’s a passage from the works of Plutarch , a 1st Century A.D. Greek writer , about how Spartans tried to teach their boys ideas and manners by immersing them in the adult social world :
In some of the ancient Semitic cultures of Mesopotamia , babies were named for the emotional response of the family upon the child ’s birth .
Exposure was common , particularly for girls , but selling a child into slavery was rare and an act of financial desperation .
Children were nursed for two to three years , in part for the activity 's birth control effects on the mother .
Mothers sang incantations as lullabies to their children , fearing that the noise of their crying would irritate the gods .
Children played with miniature weapons and household implements as they role - played adult activities .
Sons were particularly valued and discipline was moderated , as one proverb expresses “ A poor man does not strike his son a single blow ; he treasures him forever . ”
( Proverbs from Ki-en - gir , 17 ) Nonetheless , the bonds of parent to child could be broken by a delinquent child , as one law states : Viking women gave birth only in the company of other women .
Laws against the exposure of newborns except in case of birth defects indicated that the practice was known , but not fully socially acceptable .
Again , girls were more likely to suffer this fate than boys .
Even before the Christian period , babies were sprinkled with water and given names in a public ceremony .
Finely crafted toys indicate that children were often deeply loved by their parents .
Girls were educated in the household arts , but boys typically learned farming and herding , except for the higher classes , who learned the arts of war .
It was common for children to be fostered by other families in order to strengthen bonds between different kinship groups .
Such children could be highly esteemed , as one runic inscription at Kirk Michael on the Isle of Man says “ It is better to leave a good foster son than a bad son . ”
Fostering another man ’s child could be an honor , or it could be an expression of dominance , as one Norse king expressed when he was presented with the child of another king :
In China of the imperial restoration ( 6th - 13th centuries A.D. ) , children were highly valued and parents used various treatments and practices to increase fertility .
Rearing was largely the responsibility of the mother , or in a wealthy family , nurses .
A father might throw a grand feast for his community to celebrate the birth of an heir on the third day after the child ’s birth and take the child into his arms for the first time .
After three months , fathers gave boys special , sacred names that were not spoken in public .
Children , even as adults , did not refer to their parents by their given names on pain of imprisonment under certain circumstances .
Rituals marked a formal entry into adulthood for children of both genders .
At fourteen , a girl ’s hair was pinned on top of her head by her mother and she given a new name signifying adulthood and eligibility for marriage .
Similarly , wealthy boys received a cap on their heads from their fathers in a ceremony before the spirits of the family ancestors , and took an adult name .
Approaches to discipline and character formation leading to this fulfilled adulthood were widely debated .
Some , such as the influential Yan Zhitui ( 531-591 ) , proposed a middle ground between harshness and laxity : Images : Flickr user David Paul Olmer used under Creative Commons license , leoncillo sabino used under Creative Commons license , Minnesota State University - Mankato , Flickr user ~ Duncan ~ used under Creative Commons license , and George Mason University , respectively .
NB : These are generalizations of diverse societies over long periods of time .
They should not be taken as universal statements of historical realities .

Facebook plans to announce it has reached a milestone 500 million users this week — but that does n’t mean the masses are happy customers .
The American Customer Satisfaction Index , developed by the University of Michigan ’s Business School , included Facebook in its regular survey of consumer satisfaction with companies .
The result : Facebook came out with one of the lowest ranks of any company measured by the Index – a 64 out of 100 .
That puts Facebook in the bottom 5 % of all private sector companies , and in the same range as the IRS tax e-filing system , airlines and cable companies .

It was recently asked “ Does the bit hurt my horse ? ” .
Although people might want to think otherwise , bits , and even bitless bridles do hurt horses .
The pain can vary from mild to more severe .
The mild pain can be simple pressure , and is generally not considered cruel .
If fitted incorrectly , or if the horse has a wolf tooth , a bit can cause more unnecessary pain and discomfort .
A rider with unsteady hands will cause more pain by jerking on the bit repeatedly .
Snaffles
The gentlest bit is the snaffle .
This is a bit without shanks , there are many kinds of snaffles , some more harsh than others .
The gentlest snaffle is not jointed and has a thick rubber mouth piece .
The more joints a snaffle has ( they often have only one joint ) and the thinner the mouth piece , the more severe the bit .
As well snaffles that have twists , ridges , and sharp edges , on the mouth piece will be severe .
photo source - the very gentle Mullen Snaffle , pictured above , with a far more severe snaffle , with twisted wire , pictured below .
photo source
Snaffles work by putting pressure on the mouth , lips , and against the jawbone .
In most cases these are the first bits horses are introduced to in training , Western horses then progress to the curb bit ( or some form of bitless bridle ) , while English horses ( particularly those used in Saddleseat or Dressage ) to on to the Double Bridle , or other form of bridle and bit combination .
A good deal of pleasure horses remain ridden only with a snaffle , while horse shows often require mature horses to be fully trained into the full bridle , and bits that go with them .
Horses that wear snaffles are trained for direct reining , a pull on the right rein leads them to turn to the right , a pull on the left rein leads them to turn left .
There are some indirect reining techniques as well .
author photo - showing the double bridle
In the double bridle , there is a tiny snaffle , known as the Bradoon , this is a very thin bit , used in combination with a curb type bit .
Curbs
The curb bit is traditionally thought of as a Western bit , but this is not correct .
It works by applying pressure on the jaws , and the high port puts pressure on the top of the mouth , it has leverage action which puts pressure on the top of the horses head ( the poll ) , and with a chain ( or leather strap ) underneath the jaw it puts pressure there as well .
The curb is by far , more severe than a normal snaffle , and if used incorrectly , or roughly , can cause undue pain and distress to a horse .
photo source - a typical western curb , in some cases the port ( middle section in the mouth ) is much higher .
The longer shanks from the mouth piece to the reins mean more leverage is created , thus a more severe bit .
The higher the port in the mouth , the more pressure it will put on the top of the mouth , thus being more severe .
Occasionally a curb will be jointed , in such a case it has no high port , but will have the nutcracker effect on the horses lips and side of their jaws , as in a regular snaffle .
Horses who wear curb bits are generally trained on the snaffle first , then move into the curb .
Once in the curb they are taught to respond to neck reining so pressure is not used on their mouth other than to keep the horses head in position , and often for speed control .
Curb bits are not for beginners , only a tiny amount of movement with the reins is needed for a horse to feel it in the mouth , and any harsh , or sudden , tugs will cause undue pain .
Horses in distress from curb bits will often open their mouths and try to raise their head to get away from the pain .
photo source
This horse is in pain and throwing his head to avoid it , you will note there is a " tie - down " on the horse so it cannot raise its head further .
Pelham
This is often considered an English style bit , using two sets of reins , but is not quite as severe as the double bridle , which uses the bradoon ( mentioned earlier ) and an English curb .
It is commonly used in polo , but really should be used by holding the reins in both hands .
As with the double bridle , there are two sets of reins , and a rider must hold these in a way that they can control each separately .
photo source - you will note there is a bit of a cheat here , a strap connects the two rings of the bit and only one rein leads from each side to the riders hands .
This bit is less severe than a curb , you will note the short shanks .
Below is a picture of this system in use on a polo pony , clearly the animal is showing signs of pain and distress .
photo source
Summary
There are more types of bits than have been mentioned , but we can see that bits do cause pain , in some form or another , and it is this pain that we use to control them .
There is no need to cause undue pain by using a bit incorrectly or by using too harsh a bit rather than better training .
If a person is looking to buy a horse , they should always check the bit being used on the horse to see how severe it is .
To be fair even bitless bridles work by inflicting pain , usually on the top of the horses head , or under the jaw .

A new version of identity - aggregation application Fring brings video calling to Android handsets , despite the company 's ever - lacking business model .
The new Fring client for Android has all the usual VoIP and messaging functions : aggregating identities from Skype , GoogleTalk and SIP - based telephony services , as well as ICQ , AIM and MS Messenger for instant messaging , but Android users can now also share the video - calling goodness with their iPhone and Symbian contacts .
That 's assuming their Android handset is up to it - Fring reckons its software will automatically check the available processing power with video calling only appearing if it 's actually possible .
But that should include the Nexus One , Motorola Droid and HTC Desire , as well as anything better .
Fring 's video calling service is integrated with Skype , so you should see ( and be seen by ) any Skype user , assuming you 've found a Wi-Fi or decent 3G connection and are n't paying by the byte .
Fring had promised more platforms would follow the addition of video to the Symbian version which was launched last November , so now Android users can discover how quickly the novelty of being able to see the person you 're calling wears off .
There are occasions when video calling makes sense , but they are few and far between and certainly not something for which users were ever prepared to pay .
Giving the service away might make it slightly more popular , but it still is n't going to make any money for Fring which is still searching for a revenue model . ®

They are among the true monsters of space - colossal stars whose size and brightness go well beyond what many scientists thought was even possible .
Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote Planets take longer to form than these stars take to live and die ” End Quote Prof Paul Crowther Sheffield University , UK
One of the objects , known simply as R136a1 , is the most massive ever found .
The star is seen to have a mass about 265 times that of our own Sun ; but the latest modelling work suggests at birth it could have been bigger , still .
Perhaps as much as 320 times that of the Sun , says Professor Paul Crowther from Sheffield University , UK .
" If it replaced the Sun in our Solar System , it would outshine [ it ] by as much as the Sun currently outshines the full Moon , " the astronomer told BBC News .
The stars were identified by Crowther 's team using a combination of new observations on the Very Large Telescope facility in Chile and data gathered previously with the Hubble Space Telescope .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The group studied the NGC 3603 and RMC 136a clusters - regions of space where thick clouds of gas and dust are collapsing into even denser clumps .
In these places , huge stars ignite to burn brief but brilliant lives before exploding as supernovas to seed the Universe with heavy elements .
NGC 3603 is relatively close in cosmic terms - just 22,000 light - years distant .
RMC 136a ( more often nicknamed R136 ) is slightly further away , and is sited within one of our neighbouring galaxies , the Large Magellanic Cloud , some 165,000 light - years away .
The team found several stars with surface temperatures over 40,000 degrees - more than seven times hotter than our Sun .
The research shows these young stellar objects to be unbelievably bright , truly massive and also extremely wide - perhaps 30 times the radius of our Sun in the case of R136a1 .
How big is big ?
Star comparisons
This artist 's impression ( L ) shows the relative sizes ( radius ) of young stars , from low mass " yellow dwarfs " such as our Sun , through " blue dwarf " stars that are eight times more massive than the Sun , to a 300 solar - mass star like R136a1 ( R ) .
There are a number of low - density giants that are known to have an even bigger radius than R136a1
Up close the stars would look a mess , however .
Unlike our Sun which appears as a defined disc on the sky , the giants identified by Professor Crowther and colleagues would be losing so much material through powerful winds from their puffed up atmospheres that they would have a fuzzy look about them .
One thing seems for sure - no planets would exist in orbit about them .
" Planets take longer to form than these stars take to live and die .
Even if there were planets , there would be no astronomers on them because the night sky would be almost as bright as the day in these clusters , " Professor Crowther joked .
Europe 's VLT facility is sited in Chile
" Some of these big stars are relatively close to each other , so even at ' night ' you 'd have another very bright star shining on you . "
Previously observed giants had been seen to get as big as 150 times the mass of our Sun .
The latest findings raise interesting questions about what the upper limits on size might be .
Ordinarily , there should come a point where the pressure from all the radiation emitted by a stellar behemoth pushes back against any further infall of gas and dust .
In other words , there ought to be a physical barrier to excessive star growth .
But Professor Crowther adds a second factor - that of resource .
There may not exist in today 's Universe places that have sufficient supplies of gas and dust to feed ever more massive stars .
However , the new observations do give a tantalising glimpse of what the very early Universe might have been like .
Many objects in the very first population of stars to shine shortly after the Big Bang are thought to have been monsters like R136a1 .
When these objects blew apart , their cataclysmic demise was so violent they may not have left behind a remnant core of material as is often the case following a supernova ; or even a black hole which is another common consequence , too .
Instead , these giants may simply have dumped all their contents back into space , dispersing heavy elements like iron equivalent to the mass of 10 of our Suns .
" The bigger picture to this research is that it gives us confidence that there were probably more of these really massive stars in much greater numbers early on in the Universe , " Professor Crowther told BBC News .
The new results appear in a paper in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
We ’ve all at one time or another ( often while fully absorbed in a particular cartoon ) asked ourselves , “ Man , I wonder just how much scratch that dude has ? ”
It seems cartoon characters and comic book folks seem to have vast and endless supplies of cash just lying around somewhere that they can and do use to support whatever it is that they do .
Sometimes this is true .
Take for example Velma from Scooby - Doo .
Her dad is pretty wealthy and has , apparently supplied the adolescent mystery solvers with their eponymous van and whatever green they need to assist them .
However , on the other side of the proverbial coin , Peter Parker had to fashion his own costume and build his own web - shooters from things he already had or out of bits from the chem lab he frequented at college .

Luckily ( I guess ) , robots have been refurbished by Mom , the chief share holder ( 99.7 % , in fact ) of MomCorp , a snarky old bat who , for all intents and purposes , is as cruel and snidely as one can possibly get , all the while dressing in the guise of a sweet ( think Paula Dean ) Southern Belle .
But at her heart : pure cold .
Cold as metal , one might say .
9 Mr. Krabs ( SpongeBob SquarePants ) Net Worth – 16 Billion ( possibly sand dollars )
Eugene H. Krabs is the owner of Bikini Bottom ’s premiere eatery , The Krusty Krab .
Under his employ are the sullen and morose Squidward , and the ridiculously outgoing and slightly insane titular character , SpongeBob .
As with every other member of Bikini Bottom ( save for Sandy the squirrel ) Mr. Krabs is a marine animal , specifically a crab , who just happens to have a likely - adopted daughter ; Pearl the sperm whale .
Anyway , Krabs is a skinflint of the highest order and has basically turned money into something almost alive ; always doing all he can to either save it or locate it .
Let ’s just say he ’d rather see his daughter wearing old rubber fisherman ’s boots than the latest fashion .
8 Daddy Warbucks ( Annie ) Net Worth – Between 27 and 36 Billion
Lieutenant General Oliver ‘ Daddy ’ Warbucks is the adoptive father of Little Orphan Annie .
He earned his wealth the old fashioned way : hard work and perseverance , as well as a little assistance from family money wisely invested after the passing of his parents .
He eventually grew to mob -nob and rub shoulders with the elite in both government and Hollywood even going so far as to become very close friends wit FDR .
It is not known , though assumed , that Warbucks played more than just a sideline roll in the election of Roosevelt .
7 Ozymandias ( Watchmen ) Net Worth – Between 5.4 and 50 Billion
Adrian Veidt is a sycophantic madman who just also happens to be a genius with a lopsided moral view on the world .
Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet , even capable of outsmarting Dr. Manhattan .
His combination of intelligence and highly advanced fighting skills makes him perhaps the most feared and dangerous of the mortal Crimebusters .
He was even able to catch a bullet fired at him .
Looking down on and scorning humanity is what Veidt does best .
6 Carter Pewterschmidt ( Family Guy ) Net Worth – Between 10 and 50 Billion
From Wikipedia : “ Billionaire industrialist , shipping mogul , and owner of U.S. Steel with investments in the timber industry ( though he later loses this and becomes owner of CNN and TNT , though this is contradicted in “ 420 ” ) .
His company in the episode Business Guy is named Pewterschmidt Industry , and he is also a member of a yacht club .
He is shown to be friends with other powerful people such as Michael Eisner and Bill Gates . ”
5 Tony Stark ( Iron Man ) Net Worth – Between 18 and 50 Billion
Anthony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and a sarcastic but personable Playboy through and through .
Unfortunately , he has a heart issue that , at one time could have resulted in his death .
At one time , Stark was kidnapped and held as a prisoner while his captors demanded he create a super - powerful weapon .
With Stark ’s health fading , he instead fashioned a nuclear mechanism for his heart and an entire suit of armor to go wit it .
He subsequently escaped and went on to become the hero , Iron Man that we all know today .
With unlimited wealth and a seemingly bottomless checkbook , Stark is able to not only rebuild his multi-million dollar suit as he sees fit , but also run Stark Industries .
4 Bruce Wayne ( Batman ) Net Worth – Between 20 and 50 Billion
Some say that the Batman is actually the persona , while Bruce Wayne is the alter ego .
However you look at it , Wayne has every means to his eventual and inevitable end : Batman .
Though Wayne Enterprises is technically largely a private institution , Bruce has given to many charities and the like throughout Gotham City .
But where did this bottomless fortune come from ?
Wayne ’s parents were very savvy investors and bought up a bunch of land long before Gotham became a bustling Metropolis , and when they were killed , Bruce inherited the money .
Fortunately for him this was the case , as Batman ’s many incarnations and ‘ rebuilds ’ cost quite a bit .
3 Richie Rich Net Worth – 25 Billion
Richie Rich is lucky enough to be referred to as ‘ The World ’s Richest Kid ’ .
He ’s an only child living with a pair of incredibly wealthy parents in a huge mansion in Richville – leading one to assume that they might actually own the town , too .
It is said that Richie owns two of everything that money can conceivably buy just in case one breaks .
Even though he is portrayed as one who might be slightly standoffish and jerky , Richie is , in fact , very charitable and kind .
2 Mr. Burns ( The Simpsons ) Net Worth – 26 Billion
From Wikipedia : “ Although originally conceived as a one - dimensional , recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons ’ lives and wreak some sort of havoc , C. Montgomery Burns ’ popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes .
He is a caricature of Corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power , inability to remember his employees ’ names ( including Homer ’s , despite frequent interactions ) and lack of concern for their safety and well - being .
Reflecting his extreme age , Burns is given to expressing dated humor , making references to pre-1950 popular culture , and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life . ”
1 Scrooge McDuck Net Worth – 34 Billion
I could go into a background here , but who really cares when the simple fact is : He SWIMS in his money .

And , while you might have been expecting that the Knighting of the Key Holders as Spielberg will write it ( or , Trusted Community Representatives , as they ’re actually , nerdily called ) would be some dramatic secret ceremony involving hooded robes and chanting , they were actually handed their keys in a plastic , tamper - proof evidence bag .

An attack of the grumps can make you communicate better , it is suggested In a bad mood ?
Do n't worry - according to research , it 's good for you .
An Australian psychology expert who has been studying emotions has found being grumpy makes us think more clearly .
In contrast to those annoying happy types , miserable people are better at decision - making and less gullible , his experiments showed .
While cheerfulness fosters creativity , gloominess breeds attentiveness and careful thinking , Professor Joe Forgas told Australian Science Magazine .
' Eeyore days '
The University of New South Wales researcher says a grumpy person can cope with more demanding situations than a happy one because of the way the brain " promotes information processing strategies " .
Negative moods trigger more attentive , careful thinking , paying greater attention to the external world
Professor Joe Forgas
He asked volunteers to watch different films and dwell on positive or negative events in their life , designed to put them in either a good or bad mood .
Next he asked them to take part in a series of tasks , including judging the truth of urban myths and providing eyewitness accounts of events .
Those in a bad mood outperformed those who were jolly - they made fewer mistakes and were better communicators .
Professor Forgas said : " Whereas positive mood seems to promote creativity , flexibility , co-operation and reliance on mental shortcuts , negative moods trigger more attentive , careful thinking , paying greater attention to the external world . "
The study also found that sad people were better at stating their case through written arguments , which Forgas said showed that a " mildly negative mood may actually promote a more concrete , accommodative and ultimately more successful communication style " .
His earlier work shows the weather has a similar impact on us - wet , dreary days sharpened memory , while bright sunny spells make people forgetful .

Halleluiah !
I intend to show this to everyone who 's ever branded me with various epithets for being " negative " .
Marcy Sheiner , USA
Being grumpy raises my blood pressure and I usually make wrong decisions when I am grumpy .
I usually sleep on it , relax and then make a decision which is usually the correct decision .
I do n't like grumpy people and I usually avoid them .
Iftikharuddin Faruqui , Pakistan Absolutely right .
There is certainly no point that I can see in viewing the world through rose - coloured spectacles .
Anybody who wanders through life in a continuous state of bonhomie either has no idea what 's going on around them or simply does n't care !
All my close friends are similar in temperament .
We would inevitably consider those who do not fit the criteria to be shallow and lacking in perception .
And yes , I am still at peace within myself for all the reasons stated in the article .
Dave Gordon , Exeter , UK I am generally a very grumpy person , but I have definitely noticed my decision making and general awareness is far higher than that of my friends who are normally much happier , jollier and generally carefree .
I love being grumpy , it 's clearly an advantage !
David James Keeves , Loughborough , UK Ah !
This study provides a plausible explanation of Schopenhauer 's philosophical clarity and superb prose .
And yet , paradoxically , the Great Grump has had a more profound influence beyond philosophy , in the realm of all those cheerful , creative artists .
Cheryl F , South Kingstown , Rhode Island , USA I find I am happier when I am just a little grumpy .
The grumpy feeling seems to aid me in concentrating on menial tasks .
Maybe in this stressful modern era a touch of grumpy is all that 's needed rather than anti-depressants and other drugs .
Derek Penn , Falmouth , Cornwall , UK
As a self - confessed misery , I work on the premise that " misery is the thinking man 's happiness " .
With misery comes a distinctive humour and a more realistic outlook on life , that actually makes me a more rounded and " real " person than those around me with a painted smile on their faces .
I enjoy being grumpy and would n't have it any other way .
Dave Woods , Coventry , UK Could it not also be argued or proven , possibly , that making decisions while grumpy can lead one to make rash decisions ?
Or is that only when you 're angry - since angry and grumpy are not the same thing ?
Parker , Louisiana , USA I 'm often identified by friends as someone who can be pessimistic , sometimes without any real reason .
I also tick the box of sceptic - which I guess goes under the category of being less gullible .
I wo n't say any more about my intelligence for fear of immodesty !
Chris Baker , Southampton , UK I work with the grumpiest man in the world and he does n't seem to be any more clever than me !
Gary , Watford , UK Being grumpy or depressed goes hand in hand with thinking .
When you 're continually happy you can just skim along on the surface of life and not examine anything too deeply .
Which is cause and which is effect , I do n't know .

Jim is a resident of London , England , and a long - time organizer with the Advisory Service for Squatters , A.S.S .
Here he speaks about the history of squatting in the UK , going as far back as the 1300's .
This interview looks at squatting 's relationship to the anarchist movement in the UK , the changing legal framework around squatting , and squatting within a framework of other social movements in the country .
The Advisory Service For Squatters is a collective of unpaid workers who have beenrunning a daily advice service for squatters and homeless people since 1975 .
It grewout of the former Family Squatters Advisory Service , which was founded in the late 1960's .
ASS publishes
The squatters Handbook , the twelfth edition of which is the current one , and has sold in excess of 150,000 copies since 1976 .
ASS offers advice on how to squat , legal help to squatters and helps fight evictions and challenge police abuse of the homeless .

Interview by Aaron Lakoff
Aaron :
Why do n't we start at 1381 !
Jim : Squatting was one of the big issues in the peasants ’ revolt .
It was the original form of land tenure .
The new idea , the very recent development is this notion that people can own land .
That 's what 's new .
That only comes with settlement and agriculture - in other words 5 minutes ago in our history .
The whole thing is a right mess , I think !
Because then people start having boundaries , saying this is my land and this is your land , and you 've got inheritance in the male line and all that .
Anyways , squatting has a long history on this island .
What everyone knows about are the Diggers in the 17th century .
We had a big commemoration in 1999 for the Diggers 350 anniversary .
What does the first of April mean to you ?
A : April fool 's day ...
J : No , it 's diggers day !
Because that 's when the diggers kicked off !
And there was so much work done on the Diggers .
Christopher
Hill got us all going .
He 's still alive , as I 've heard .
That book " The world turned upside down " was n't just about the diggers .
It was about all the radical movements of the 17th century .
That book and Leon Rosselson 's song ( " The world turned upside down " ) really has turned thousand of people on to the diggers .
What 's often forgotten about the middle of the 17th century is that there were n't only civil wars , these were years of famine as well .
A lot of them were actually the people who kicked up most of the shit during the English revolution .
A few of the diggers , those that we know about , had been quite comfortably off and had been made poor by the wars .
A : I 've often heard of the Diggers in the context of a history of anarchism .
Would you say there is any continuity between the Diggers
movement and what we know as anarchism ?
J : What you hear more often is that the Ranters were proto-anarchists .
And I think that 's wrong .
I do n't think the diggers were anarchists at all .
They wanted a just state .
One of the Diggers ’ radical ideas was that they were IN FAVOUR of promoting young people and their ideas , and this was very much against prevailing views .
It ’s a criticism of the Diggers , however , that they did n’t really seem to have much to say about the position of women in society .
Winstanley defines “ mankind ” as meaning “ everie man , both male and female ” ( inclusive language being unheard of at the time ) he had worked for a female boss before the wars ( very unusual ) and after the Diggers ’ settlements were suppressed , several of the best known Diggers went off to work for one of the women “ prophets ” of the time .
A : What about urban squatting ?
Has there been a long tradition of that ?
J : Well yes , I mean there ’s a long tradition of squatting .
Squatting has never gone away in this country .
There was a lot of squatting in the 19th century , mostly quite individualistic .
We tend to hear about squatting after it becomes organized and when it becomes not so much individualistic but at least when some people doing it have a political perspective on what they 're doing .
There was a squatting movement after the First World War , but the big one was 1946 .
There was a squatting movement in 1945 , which was quite viciously repressed by the Churchill government .
They called themselves the Vigilante movement .
I think the idea was they were vigilantly scouring the streets for empty houses and making sure they were occupied by homeless people .
The 1945 Vigilante movement started in Brighton and the people involved were anarchists , which probably made them more of an immediate target compared with the 1946 Camp Squatters .
Then the huge one kicked off in 1946 and was still going in the 50's .
There was all sorts of places squatted .
It was all the army camps and RAF stations that were now empty after the war .
People moved in and took them over , as well as many other places .
The trouble with 1946 , what you always hear about is the Communist Party ( CP ) stunt .
In May 1946 , the CP , which was very strong then , not like now , was slagging off squatting .
In fact lots of the CP members were involved in squatting , but leadership was slagging off squatting , saying that “ socialism is the language of priorities ” and all that sort of stuff .
By September it had got so big that they thought , “ Oh fuck , we had better jump on this bandwagon ! ”
So they organized these three big spectacular squats : Duchess of Bdedford Mansions near Regents Park , and 2 hotels in Bloomsbury that had all been accommodations for offices .
Well , the Dorchester Bedford Mansions was once again gonna get rented out to the rich .
Rich people rented flats in those days for 30 shillings per week ( that 's 1 pound 50 p ) , which was huge rent which working - class people could n't afford .
And ( these squats ) had huge publicity at the time .
There was a big rally in Trafalgar Square in support of the squatters .
The cops surrounded these squatted places .
( There are ) video clips of people chucking food up to the windows , most of it not getting caught .
But it was all over in a few days , because they arrested so - called ringleaders and the CP backed out and left all those people who had been used as cannon fodder .
They were left very much in the lurch .
So as far as squatting in the 40's went , the CP arrived late and left early .
A : Who were these squatters in 1946 ?
Were they mostly soldiers returning from the war ?
J : Yeah .
A : And what was the outcome of that ?
Was it the first big political squatting movement ?
J : Well , how political was it ?
I think what you have to understand about squatting here , which is very different from squatting everywhere else in Europe , is that most of the time , for most people who are squatting , squatting is about housing .
It is about the dire shortage of housing , and it always has been .
It is far less overtly political , and there are all sorts of people involved .
And that 's very different than the squatting you get everywhere else in Western Europe .
Squatting here has a very different character than , say , in Germany , where it 's very much overtly political .
Well , of course it is !
Taking over empty buildings that used to belong to private capital or elements of the state IS a political act .
But that 's not how most squatters here have historically seen it .
It 's just about doing what you have to do to get a roof over your head , and people being angry that they 've got nowhere to live and here are these places standing empty .
A : How did the laws around squatting develop ?
How has the British state traditionally dealt with it ?
J : Well , the basic thing is that squatting was , and still is ( although they try to nibble away at it ) a civil matter , not a criminal matter .
It 's a civil dispute ; it 's got nothing to do with the cops , although we 're constantly having to remind the cops of that .
There were attempts in the 1970's to make squatting a crime .
It is in Scotland .
I 'm only talking about England and Wales .
And the reason why it 's a crime in Scotland is because of the Trespass Scotland Act , which was passed after the clearances , to make sure the clearances worked and that the people did n't come back .
And so there 's virtually no squatting in Scotland .
Mind you , squatting is illegal in the USA , but a surprising amount of it happens .
And some of the squatting in the USA , especially in New York , has more the sort of character of squatting here .
Not so much people squatting places to live , but poor people squatting space to make gardens and other things they need , and to create community facilities .
This is a bit more like the character of squatting in this country than in Western Europe .
A : And so criminal trespassing is n't an issue here ?
J : Yes , it 's a crime to trespass in certain places .
You know , Ministry of Defense places , army bases , foreign embassies , and places like that .
Or prisons .
You must n’t trespass in a prison !
And railways .
So there are certain places where it's a criminal offense to trespass , but basically trespass is not a crime .
So whenever you see a notice that says “ trespassers will be prosecuted ” , it 's bollocks .
Trespassers CANNOT be prosecuted .
It 's a civil matter .
It 's a tort , not a crime .
It does n't involve the state .
So trespassers will NOT be prosecuted .
A : So this has meant that the owners of the buildings have had to take the squatters to court ?
J : Yes , to a civil court .
A : You mentioned that in the 1970's the government tried to make it a criminal matter ...
J : But that did n't work ; they had to back down from that .
It would be very difficult in England and Wales to make trespass a crime .
You could n't really .
It would bugger up the whole basis of land tenure in English law .
So what eventually came out in the 1970's was the Campaign Against a Criminal Trespass Law , and in response the government created Protected Intending Occupiers , which is another thing where you can be given a notice without going to court .
Fundamentally they were n't able to make trespass a crime .
Cops are constantly telling people that the laws have been changed , and that 's why we 're always telling people that squatting is still legal , necessary , and free .
Legal , but not lawful – in other words , it 's civil , not criminal .
A : When you were comparing squatting here with the rest of Western Europe , it 's interesting because there 's been that distinction made in Canada between the more individual squats and political squats ...
J : Well , I would n't say individual .
I mean , you get some sorts of community action type squatting , which is n't overtly political .
In fact the people doing it do n't see it as such , but I think it is .
The people doing it are n't ideologically driven , they 're doing it because there are buildings empty and they need a place to live , or there 's this derelict fucking site and we can make a community garden and our kids can play there , and things like that .
That to me is political , but that 's not how it 's perceived by the people doing it .
A : Why have people squatted ?
J : All sorts of people have squatted .
There are the sorts of lifestyle squatters – people who squat because they like it .
They do n't have to squat , housing - wise , but they want to squat .
There might be lots of people who have an alternative way of getting a roof over their head , but they do n't have a way of living the way they want to live , with a bunch of other people living collectively and doing stuff together .
That 's all fair enough too .
Squatting to live the way you want to live is often a minority of squatters , and this is n't often realized .
You do realize it if you sit in the A.S.S ( Advisory Service for Squatters ) office .
A : In terms of social housing or affordable housing in London , has there always been a lack of that ?
J : Oh yes !
This term “ affordable housing ” now , it 's very English .
It 's like how “ public schools ” are actually private schools .
Well “ affordable housing ” means UNaffordable housing !
A : Can you tell me about some of the squats that have made a big impact in London over the years ?
J : Well Huntley Street did .
That was huge news .
We had solidarity actions all around the world the night of the eviction .
That was in 1978 .
There were lots of big squats in those days .
There was Freston road in West London that declared UDI – Unilateral Declaration of Independence .
They wrote to the United Nations demanding recognition as a sovereign state !
And the people who went to negotiate with the GLC ( Greater London Council ) were called ambassadors , and everybody was a minister for something !
There were lots of ministers for alcohol , I seem to remember .
Freston road did the best squatters paper – the Corrugated Times .
A : Are any of these squats that existed in the 60's and 70's still in operation now ?
J : No .
But there are a few , especially in South London , very long - term squats , which , if people had their act together , they could have had them now .
But they have n't got the evidence together and places have been thrown away .
People have got 12 years adverse occupation .
A : Does that mean that if you stay in a place for 12 years it 's yours ?
J : Yes , effectively .
It 's a bit more complicated than that , and they changed the law 3 years ago so that if it 's registered land it 's much more difficult .
But if it ’s not registered , or it is registered and you completed your 12 years before October , 2003 , then you can make the place effectively yours ... but you 've got to have your evidence together .
Loads of people lose places that could be won by not having stuff together .
A : How long has the Advisory Service for Squatters ( A.S.S. ) been around for ?
J : Since 1975 .
It started with a breakaway .
There were loads of groups in 1968 that started opening empty buildings for homeless families .
And there was this big division between “ oh no , only families with children should be squatting ” , and “ everyone who needs a home should squat .
Single people are homeless , too . ”
The latter perspective was a breakaway from the Family Squatters ' Advisory Service .
The A.S.S moved its current office two and a half years ago .
A : I 'm interested to know about squatted social centers too .
Is that something that has had a long history in London ?
J : Yes and no .
It has more of a history outside of London .
The whole concept of social centers has only come around in recent years .
I do n't think anyone would have thought of it going further back , because back then we had local squatting groups .
If you look then , you 'll see this history of totally squatted streets and totally squatted blocks .
And of course when you get a completely squatted street and a completely squatted block , after a while people set up communal spaces .
They did this with the whole resistance to the M - 11 , which was very much political squatting .
That was bringing into London the campaigning tactics against road developments .
That was a very special kind of squatting , and that 's when social centers really started .
And most social centers are n't squatted .
But there 's this big argument of squatted vs. non-squatted .
But the vast majority of squatters have never even heard the word social center , and if they have , they 'd probably think it 's far too scuzzy for them .
For every lifestyle anarchist sort of squatter , there must be at least 10 of the current “ jobs - and - babies ” wave of squatters .
For fuck ’s sake , the lifestyle anarchists squatters are not THE squatters !
Squatting is a much bigger world and a much wider range of people than they even dream about !
I want to say to these people ' you are living in a little fucking anarchist ghetto ' .
And some people are on about the terrible damage done to the social center movement by these alleged bastards from the rented or mortgaged social centers , but in fact that ’s what most social centres are .
It ’s all needlessly divisive , though I think we ’re beginning to get beyond these silly arguments now .
Squatted , rented or mortgaged social centres each have their drawbacks and problems , as well as their advantages .
In squatted social centres we can get on with doing what inspires us , without having to worry about selling ourselves loads of beer to pay the bills .
On the other hand , what we do n’t have is a long - term presence , so that we can become a resource for many other campaigns and movements and a radical part of the life of a particular community .
A : Is that a completely separate movement , the people working for the squatted social centers and the people working for squatted housing ?
J : Not in London , but outside London a lot of people have been involved in squatted social centres who have n’t needed to squat for their housing .
Leeds and Manchester are examples .
But things changing .
The big cities in England which have traditionally had less of a crude housing shortage than London are now facing a real housing crisis and there is an increasing amount of residential squatting in those cities .
Bristol and Brighton have always had a fair bit of residential squatting .
A : When I think of squatting , I sometimes picture something that is unique to the anarchist movement ...
J : Oh no !
Not at all .
That 's the problem !
People just are n't aware of the breadth of different people who are squatting .
Please do n't think I 'm putting down any squatted social centers – I 'm not .
But it 's just such a narrow vision .
There 's a lot more to squatting and there 's a lot more going on than that .
Most of the squatting in England and Wales has been in London , with two notable other places that were big ; Brighton and Bristol .
If you look at the 1940's , it was the same .
But there 's been a lot more going on in the last few years in other parts , especially in Leeds and Manchester , because more and more people have n't got a place to live .

€ 1.4 - billion gap in ITER project could be plugged with Framework cash .
This artist 's impression shows what the ITER reactor site will look like - if it can raise enough cash .
ITER Organization
European nations hope to divert more than a billion euros that were earmarked for research grants to make up a budget shortfall at the experimental ITER fusion reactor , Nature has learned .
The proposal has alarmed scientists , who say that it will rob researchers of vital funds at a time when governments are planning to scale back domestic research budgets in response to the global economic downturn .
" I think it 's a small catastrophe in the present situation , " says Helga Nowotny , the president of the European Research Council , which funds research across Europe .
" It 's bad for European research , " she says .
Based in the south of France , the ITER reactor will one day fuse hydrogen isotopes to produce energy .
When the project was agreed in 2006 , it was expected to cost € 5 billion ( US$ 6 billion ) to construct , but unofficial estimates now put ITER 's price at around € 15 billion ( see Financial meltdown imperils reactor ) .
As the largest contributor to the project , the European Union ( EU ) will have to pay € 7.2 billion , far more than the original € 2.7 billion it had initially expected .
The most pressing problem is a € 1.4 - billion gap in the construction budget for 2012 –13 .
A tentative agreement reached on 25 June by Europe 's 27 member states would fill most of that shortfall using cash from the EU's Seventh Framework Programme ( FP7 ) for research , which is the main science - funding mechanism in Europe for 2007 – 13 .
FP7 has an overall budget of € 50.5 billion and still has about € 20 billion unspent .
The European Commission , the EU 's executive body , still needs to work out the precise budgetary details with the member states , according to several independent sources .
The commission is expected to fight the proposal , arguing that drawing so heavily on FP7 funds would damage other research goals .
In a memo on 4 May , the European Commission warned that taking the money needed for ITER from other parts of the research budget would have " a significantly negative effect on a range of policies and programmes " .
It asked member states to find more cash to help cover the deficit .
But faced with a continent - wide financial crisis and pressure to cut government spending , the member states were unwilling to pay more .
To find a way forward , the outgoing Spanish presidency of the EU formed an emergency task force , which has met weekly since mid-May and came up with the latest recommendation .
Find a compromise
Insiders say that it is highly likely that even if a compromise deal is struck between the member states and the commission , millions of euros for ITER will still come at the expense of unrelated fields including nanotechnology , health and renewable energy .
" This will not make us friends , " acknowledges one senior European fusion researcher , who declined to be identified , citing the continuing negotiations .

The European nations ' proposal , a copy of which was seen by Nature , also calls for fusion scientists to find a further 8 % in savings from the European portion of ITER .
Assuming that the demands are met , the member states will commit to funding the project at its new price , allowing ITER 's construction to move forward .
Previously some nations , notably France and Germany , had mulled scaling back ITER , or even withdrawing from it altogether .
The way that the FP7 budget is apportioned means that the " programmes that have already been selected will not suffer " , according to Achilleas Mitsos , who was the director - general for research at the European Commission from 2000 to 2005 and was a negotiator on the ITER project .
But FP7 would have difficulty absorbing the entire € 1.4 - billion cost , which might come at the expense of new projects and proposals , he says .
Mitsos remains hopeful that unspent money from other parts of the EU 's budget will be used to fill the spending gap .
Despite the budget problems , Mitsos predicts that the EU will continue to fully support ITER , because failure would incur heavy political and financial costs .
" Europe cannot afford not to go forward with the project , " he says .
ITER 's council hopes to agree a final plan at its next meeting , scheduled for late July .
With that in place , the first ITER experiments could begin in late 2019 .
Shortly after his conviction on tax evasion charges , Wesley Snipes declared that he would appeal on the grounds that the sentence was unreasonable .
Snipes got his answer today .
A federal court disagreed with his assessment , virtually guaranteeing that the actor will do time .
Two years ago , Snipes was found guilty of failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004 ; the conviction means that he will serve up to three years in federal prison .
Though he admitted that he knew that not paying his taxes “ sounded too good to be true , ” he was acquitted of related federal tax fraud and conspiracy charges .
This wo n’t be the last you hear about this , trust me .
If I had to guess , Snipes will make an announcement of some sort about his plans for the future .
I found this hilarious post by someone named Flopper on a message board :
No Government Spending Needed to Create Jobs but
There is a Cost
There are two pieces of legislation needed to accomplish full employment in America , both supported by many conservatives .
1. Repeal the minimum wage law .
2. Remove financial support for those out of work including unemployment , welfare , food stamps , etc …
Removing the minimum wage allows employers to pick up good employees at very low labor rates .
Once all financial support is removed , the unemployed will seek any kind of work offered .
It ’s either that or starve .
Unemployment rates would drop rapidly .
This will also solve the problem of jobs being sent abroad .
With the lower labor rates , employers will have little reason to go abroad for cheap labor .
The only real negative financial aspect is that working Americans will not have the income to purchase much more than necessities .
This can be overcome by exporting more of the new cheap American made goods .
Bleeding heart liberals will complain that America is becoming a third world country but you have to make a few sacrifices if you want to compete in today ’s world markets .
The above may sound a bit ridiculous but there are a lots of people that think this way .
July 14 , 2010 --
Men who are obese at age 20 are twice as likely to die young , according to new research presented at the International Congress on Obesity in Stockholm , Sweden .
As it stands , more than two - thirds of U.S. adults aged 20 and older are overweight or obese , according to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , MD .
" Entering adult life as obese leads to a life - long doubling of the risk of dying prematurely , " study researcher Esther Zimmermann , PhD , of the Institute of Preventive Medicine in Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark , tells WebMD in an email .
" The best advice is to avoid beginning adult life as obese [ because ] if you enter adult life as obese , the majority will remain obese as adults . "
Zimmerman and colleagues tracked about 5,500 Swedish men from age 20 to age 80 and found that the 1,930 men who were obese when they were 20 were twice as likely to die at any given age than were their counterparts who were not obese at age 20 .
Starting at age 55 , men who were obese at 20 died an average of eight years earlier than their counterparts who were not obese at age 20 .
What 's more , their chance of dying early increased by 10 % for each body mass index ( BMI ) unit above 25 .
BMI takes height and weight into account to measure body fat .
If your BMI is greater than 25 , you are considered overweight .
If it is over 30 , you are considered obese .
Study participants completed follow - up surveys at age 35 and 46 .
More than 70 % of men who were obese at age 20 remained so during these follow - up exams .
By contrast , just 4 % of men who were not obese at age 20 went on to become obese , the study showed .
Researchers adjusted for other factors known to affect mortality such as smoking status .
" Entering adult life as obese had a life - long effect on mortality , " she says .
The next step is to study why those individuals who were obese at age 20 died earlier , she says .
An Anasazi Ruin High In The Sky
Hi folks – A few days ago Mr. Holte Ender asked if I would like to contribute to Mad Mikes America .
I said yes and am humbled by the offer .
As a first post I ’d like to contribute a video my bud and I did last March in the Valley of the Gods which is near Bluff , UT .
Something we found some 16 or so years ago having always wanting to revisit and document .
Finally were able to accomplish that .
I / we are not movie makers but we do try and even surprised ourselves with this one .
Want you to know we did not disturb or enter this site in any way .
We also are planning on going back this fall to explore this from a different direction .
I ca n’t wait actually .
So here ya go and thank you Mad Mikes America for giving me the opportunity to be part of this great site .

This post is part of what I hope will be a multi-part tutorial / cookbook series on using c2hs ( Hackage ) .
What 's c2hs ?
c2hs is a Haskell preprocessor to help people generate foreign - function interface bindings , along with hsc2hs and GreenCard .
The below diagram illustrates how the preprocessors currently supported by Cabal fit together .
( For the curious , Cpp is thrown in with the rest of the FFI preprocessors , not because it is particularly useful for generating FFI code , but because many of the FFI preprocessors also implement some set of Cpp 's functionality .
I decided on an order for Alex and Happy on the grounds that Alex was a lexer generator , while Happy was a parser generator . )
What does c2hs do ?
Before I tell you what c2hs does , let me tell you what it does not do : it does not magically eliminate your need to understand the FFI specification .
In fact , it will probably let you to write bigger and more ambitious bindings , which in turn will test your knowledge of the FFI .
( More on this later . )
What c2hs does help to do is eliminate some of the drudgery involved with writing FFI bindings .
( At this point , the veterans who 've written FFI bindings by hand are nodding knowingly . )
Here are some of the things that you will not have to do anymore :
Port enum definitions into pure Haskell code ( this would have meant writing out the data definition as well as the Enum instance ) ,
Manually compute the sizes of structures you are marshalling to and from ,
Manually compute the offsets to peek and poke at fields in structures ( and deal with the corresponding portability headaches ) ,
Manually write types for C pointers ,
( To some extent ) writing the actual foreign import declarations for C functions you want to use
When should I use c2hs ?
There are many Haskell pre-processors ; which one should you use ?
A short ( and somewhat inaccurate ) way to characterize the above hierarchy is the further down you go , the less boilerplate you have to write and the more documentation you have to read ; I have thus heard advice that hsc2hs is what you should use for small FFI projects , while c2hs is more appropriate for the larger ones .
Things that c2hs supports that hsc2hs does not :
Automatic generation of foreign import based on the contents of the C header file ,
based on the contents of the C header file , Semi-automatic marshalling to and from function calls , and
Translation of pointer types and hierarchies into Haskell types .
Things that GreenCard supports and c2hs does not :
Automatic generation of foreign import based on the Haskell type signature ( indeed , this is a major philosophical difference ) ,
based on the Haskell type signature ( indeed , this is a major philosophical difference ) , A more comprehensive marshalling language ,
Automatic generation of data marshalling using Data Interface schemes .
Additionally , hsc2hs and c2hs are considered quite mature ; the former is packaged with GHC , and ( a subset of ) the latter is used in gtk2hs , arguably the largest FFI binding in Haskell .
GreenCard is a little more , well , green , but it recently received a refresh and is looking quite promising .
Is this tutorial series for me ?
Fortunately , I 'm not going to assume too much knowledge about the FFI ( I certainly did n't have as comprehensive knowledge about it going in than I do coming out ) ; however , some understanding of C will be assumed in the coming tutorials .
In particular , you should understand the standard idioms for passing data to and out of C functions and feel comfortable tangling with pointers ( though there might be a brief review there too ) .
Next time .
Setting up Cabal , the FFI and c2hs .
LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
A top Chinese central bank official suggested switching away from the U.S. dollar as a benchmark for the yuan 's foreign - exchange rate , switching instead to a basket of currencies , according to remarks published Thursday .
In comments posted to the People 's Bank of China Web site , the central bank 's Deputy Gov. Hu Xiaolian said using a basket of currencies from the nation 's top trading partners would allow the Chinese yuan to better reflect trading fundamentals .
We ’ve moved a long way from the keyboard - and - mouse only computer interface .
Touchscreens , speech , and even typing systems that track eye and muscle movements all aid in interaction .
But what if we could literally transmit our thoughts to computer interfaces –without any sort of implanted computer chip ?
Intel ’s Human Brain project , a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh , is attempting to do just that .
The ambitious project ( see our report from last year ) uses EEG , fMRI , and magnetoencephalography to deduce what a subject is thinking about based on their pattern of neural activity .
The process is still fairly primitive–it only works with concrete nouns within a 1,000 - word vocabulary , and it can only tell the difference between two nouns at a time .
In other words , the algorithm ca n’t yet deduce on its own if a user is thinking of the word “ arm , ” but it can figure out whether a user is thinking of “ arm ” or “ shirt ” ( or any number of other nouns ) .
Intel tells us that the algorithm is accurate 9 out of 10 times .
Eventually , Intel hopes that users will be able to slip on a headset like the one pictured above to control computer devices .
So instead of manually typing in “ fastcompany.com ” to reach this website , we could think to ourselves , “ Fast Company Magazine . ”
And instead of typing out articles , journalists could simply think about what they want to write .
Of course , the technology is nowhere near being available commercially , and Intel is n’t the only company exploring the use of mentally controlled electronics .
Intel researchers estimate that their tech could be ready in a decade in the best case scenario–or never , if things do n’t go as planned .
But just think about how much easier this could make life for the computer illiterate ( and the Stephen Hawkings ) among us .

Millions of Americans watched thetelecast of a gala performance of Paul McCartney and others stars at the White House .
Aging Beatle Paul McCartney was in fine voice .
If John Lennon were alive , he would have been singing at some demonstration protesting the slaughter in five Muslim nations .
John Lennon would not have been singing to President Obama while President Obama was lying about hisorder all his thousands of newandto attack in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia , Yemen and Iraq still because of 9/11/2001 .
( Saudi Arabia is excluded from attack , though it was Saudi Arabians who flew the our airliners into the Pentagon and World Trade Center . )
Some of us working hard to embarrass the President with public awareness for all the taking of lives , maiming and destruction by U.S. military under his command were wondering whether Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock would have been in attendance if Obama had already begun nuclear bombing Iran as he has threatened .
( Actually the ships are already in place and many in Congress support immediate hostilities . ) I mean at what point does a musician say no , I can't perform if my performing is lending support for war on defenseless populations of poor people , nominally non
White poor people , in former colonized , now neocolonized nations .
Harry Belefonte , a friend of Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez , who called George W. Bushwas most probably not invited to this gala White House concert by Bush 's successor .
We can't have much of an idea of what was in the minds of Stevie Wonder , Herbie Hancock , Lang Lang and the other musician luminaries who put their fame and reputation on the line performing at the White House during war time - a time of America 's occupation wars and proclaimed right to bomb anywhere anytime .
Stevie Wonder , in his few gracious words accepting his award spoke ( haltingly ) of thechance of America under President Barack Obama .
At least he said nothing of the past two years or present under him , and did not sound all that enthusiastic .
Herbie Hancock , another great historic musician , who yours truly knows as a fellow Buddhist and from performing on the same program of a concert for a peaceful America on the Great Lawn not far from the White House in the early 1980s .
( Herbie graced my apartment with a short visit afterward . )
What was running through Herbie 's mind as everyone swayed to the music and lyrics of ( therepeating as the credits appeared on the screen at the end ) .
I will never be able to forget Lang Lang 's participation and implied approval of Obama 's wars when I next listen to Lang Lang 's televised master classes , in the past so exciting for his ebullient sharing of sensitive intelligent discoveries of marvelous subtleties in masterpiece passages of Chopin , Mozart etc .
Such subtleties become less exquisite , for intrusive thoughts oF Afghani and Pakistani holding dying children in their arms .
Of course , six months ago we saw a similar Obama White House evening of song , that time with famous and now elderly singing heroes of a half - century of anti-war protests .
Bob Dylan sang ( anti- prophetically ) his
The event was meant to celebrate the accomplishments and sacrifices of the Civil Rights movement during ( to which that evening 's rendition ofwas dedicated ) .
Must have been a tough choice , to perform or not .
At the time , Obama had already been drone bombing Pakistan and increasing the intensity of the war in Afghanistan for a whole year .
Joan Baez seems to have agreed to appear only at the last moment .
One can only imagine how Dylan and Baez feel now as bloodshed widens and new wars are imminent .
In the cases of all the above mentioned important personalities sanitizing ( certainly unintentionally ) the Obama White House with topmost popular culture , we cannot know what might have been occurring as mitigating circumstances .
How many of these artists might have sought to use gaining entrance to the citadel of world power , in to have the opportunity to mention their disappointments and concerns to either the President , or his wife and powerful guests in within earshot ?.
We just do n't know if any of them were able to put in merciful word of complaint for the deathly targeted in the Muslim world .
In 1968 , Eartha Kitt , world famous singing star , with a single truthful remark at a white house luncheon , managed to make the front pages .
Asked by Lady Bird Johnson about the Vietnam War .
She replied : Though she became a heroine to many , she was ostracized in mainstream America and subsequently switched her career audience to Europe and Asia .
Fortunately for humanity , the White House list of personae non grata will not be short , and will contain the names of eminent citizens from all walks of life .
It would be inconceivable , for example , that Former U.S. Att. Gen. Ramsey Clark , author of the Civil Rights Act , himself the son of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice , but long become a declared legal enemy of imperialism and capitalist war in his writings and court appearances , would be invited to the White House of Commander - in - Chief of wars , Barack Obama .
As to this weeks telecast , maybe we war opposers expect too much from Americans .
Americans partied for years indifferent to its army , navy and air force crucifying the beautiful Buddhist Asian population of the French colonies of Indochina .
( That finally radicalized John Lennon . )
Why expect anything different today ?
Americans have that same , now legendary , indifference to what its government is doing to the world .
Seems that no amount of carnage could affect the average American 's inward looking desperate search for fun and games , blinkers on to the fate of the millions of victims of U.S. homicidal foreign policies .
Not that many would care , but this musician has long ago lost his desire to perform for Americans .
Music was not written for the ears of the callous , the indifferent to suffering .
And no one composes music with those who would permanently silence the music for others in mind .
Presidents typically invite Americans to appear at Rose Garden press conferences to trumpet their policy successes , but yesterday we saw what may have been a first .
President Obama introduced three Americans — an auto worker , a fitness center employee and a woman in real estate — who 've been out of work so long they underscore the failure of his economic program .
Where are his spinmeisters when he really needs them ?
Sure , Mr. Obama 's ostensible purpose was to lobby Congress for the eighth extension of jobless benefits since the recession began , to a record 99 weeks , or nearly two years .
And he whacked Senate Republicans for blocking the extension , though Republicans are merely asking that the extension be offset by cuts in other federal spending .
The one possibility the President and Congressional Democrats wo n't entertain is that their own spending and taxing and regulating and labor union favoritism have become the main hindrance to job creation .
Since February 2009 , the jobless rate has climbed to 9.5 % from 8.1 % , and private industry has shed two million jobs .
The overall economy has been expanding for at least a year , but employers still do n't seem confident enough to add new workers .
The economists who sold us the stimulus say it 's a mystery .
But maybe employers are afraid to hire because they do n't know what costs government will impose on them next .
Introduction
I am going to address a touchy subject in this essay , but I simply can’t ignore it any longer .
I have noticed that a lot of people are finding my blog through keyword searches of “ Debunking Matt Simmons . ”
About two and a half years ago , I did write an essay called Debunking Matt Simmons .
Because of Matt ’s recent claims about the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , there has been a spike in interest over whether his claims related to the disaster are actually credible .
So now seems like a good time to revisit the subject .
The topic is touchy because Matt Simmons has long been revered in the energy business , and some of his fans will be upset with me for writing this .
But Simmons has lately been making what I feel are very irresponsible and sensational claims that do n’t hold up to scrutiny .
So I will review his history here to show a pattern of Simmons making sensational predictions based on meager and / or misinterpreted data ; predictions that later proved to be grossly inaccurate .
Matt Simmons , Investment Banker and Author
Matt Simmons is an investment banker to the oil industry , probably most well - known for writing the book Twilight in the Desert .
The book laid out the arguments that Saudi Arabia had overstated their oil reserves , that their oil production was on the cusp of decline , and that prices were set to soar .
The book became very popular , especially when Saudi production began to decline shortly after the book came out .
My view was that Saudi production fell not because of the arguments Simmons put forward in Twilight , but rather because the Saudis were holding production back to keep prices up .
So my feeling was that the Saudi decline was unrelated to many of the arguments that Simmons put forth .
And in fact a couple of years later as oil prices climbed , Saudi production climbed back into record territory .
But I thought the book was important for two reasons .
One , it put a spotlight on Saudi Arabia and really highlighted the importance of that country to the rest of the world , especially once oil supplies began to shrink .
Second , it called a lot of attention to the issue of peak oil .
I have always said that Twilight and The Long Emergency were both influential in causing me to become more involved in writing and talking to people about energy .
That is n’t to say the books do n’t have flaws .
They do .
In Simmons ’ book , I felt he frequently came to conclusions that were n’t warranted by the arguments he presented .
A famous example is his “ fuzzy logic ” argument .
Fuzzy logic is the basis of many control systems , but Simmons incorrectly interpreted the phrase to mean “ hunch . ”
So when the Saudis used fuzzy logic in their control systems , Simmons made an argument that they were really guessing about their oil reserves .
In his own words , “ if they can basically just keep turning on a tap , why does it take fuzzy logic ? ”
The comment was nonsensical , but as later events would show not simply an isolated example of Simmons speaking out when he did n’t know what he was talking about .
Matt Simmons , Layman
Twilight in the Desert made Simmons famous , and he began to be called upon as an expert on all things oil - related .
There were two very big problems there .
First , Simmons is an investment banker , and is not remotely an expert on all things oil - related .
In fact , I do n’t know anyone who is .
But the bigger problem is that he either thinks he is , or just ca n’t say no to requests to do interviews and presentations .
And when he does those , he frequently makes sensational claims and predictions .
I am on an e-mail list where I saw this recent comment about Matt from a long - time admirer of his work , which I think hits the nail squarely on the head :
I think something happens to the psyche when the media pay attention to you for so long .
You stop all self criticism , believing that whatever thoughts come to your mind have validity and import .
In truth , it does n’t matter if you are eventually proven wrong , because by then you ’re off on the next topic .
Simmons ’ Blunders at ASPO 2008
In my previous essay on debunking Simmons , I provided some examples of Simmons making factually incorrect statements .
These statements were based on him not having enough information ( or bad information ) , yet still speaking authoritatively on a topic .
There were two later examples from his talk at the 2008 ASPO conference — where I also presented .
( See his presentation here ) .
He claimed in his presentation that we do n’t have a good idea of our gasoline inventories , and because of Hurricane Ike we were just beginning a gasoline crisis that could bring the entire country to a halt .
He spun quite a frightening tale , and I could see the shock on some people ’s faces .
Contrary to Matt ’s argument , the evidence was just the opposite .
Even as he was speaking , refineries were coming back online from the hurricane outages and inventories were recovering .
I caught up with Simmons later and told him that I used to work in a group in a refinery that provided inventory data to the Department of Energy , and we do indeed have very good data on gasoline inventories .
So his fundamental premise was wrong .
I was asked about Matt ’s comments on a later panel session , and I said that gasoline inventories were beginning to recover and that I predicted they would be higher in a month .
They were .
Matt ’s frightening scenario based on Hurricane Ike did n’t come to pass .
Another example is his argument about the $ 100 trillion corrosion issue in the oil industry .
The gist is that he argues that the oil industry is full of rusting infrastructure , and he questions whether we have the money or even the iron resources to fix the problem .
Further , he questions aloud how it is that he – Matt Simmons , investment banker – has ‘ discovered ’ this problem that the oil industry has missed .
I wo n’t go into all of the reasons that Matt is way off the mark on this , as that would be an essay in itself .
A corrosion engineer at The Oil Drum once weighed in on this issue , and explained that corrosion is well - understood , and not something that Simmons discovered .
Oil companies are full of corrosion engineers who work to replace corroded equipment as needed .
But it was another oil - related “ crisis ” Simmons “ discovered ” and he ran with it .
And that brings us to his recent interviews over the spill in the gulf .
Sometimes Silence is Golden
Personally , I have a rule about presentations and interviews :
If the topic is outside of my area of expertise , I decline .
If CNN calls up and says “ Can we interview you on the future of the solar industry ? ” I will tell them no and give them the names of some experts in the field .
Lately I have been asked a lot to comment on specifics on the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
I always decline , again because there are plenty of people who know more about the specifics than I do .
Simmons does n’t seem to have a filter that tells him to pass up an interview if he might not know what he is talking about .
Here is a sampling of some recent interviews in which he makes numerous extraordinary claims .
I have included some of the more extraordinary claims below , but there are plenty more out there that I did n’t list .
On Bloomberg : Simmons Says Government Should Take Over BP Oil Clean Up
On CNN : The Gulf Coast oil spill ’s Dr. Doom
With Dylan Ratigan on MSNBC :
Simmons ’ Sensational Claims on the Gulf Spill
In these and various other interviews , Simmons claims :
1 . Use of a small bore nuclear device is the “ only option ” to stop the flow of oil .
I do n’t want a banker who does n’t know what fuzzy logic is being taken seriously on the issue of using nukes in the Gulf of Mexico .
2. BP would be insolvent by July 8 , 2010 .
He has also stated several times that the stock is going to zero .
While I have said that I do n’t think the BP brand can continue in the long run , I would n’t call them insolvent and it will certainly take some time for the legal issues to play out .
A prediction of insolvency by July 8th was ridiculous .
Simmons has also shorted BP stock , so some of this may be wishful thinking on his part .
3 . The “ real , untold story ” is another leak that is 5 - 7 miles away spewing 120,000 bbls / day .
I have n’t the faintest idea where he came up with this , but I have spoken to several experts who say the chance of that is zero .
4 . That there is an underground lake of oil that is 500 feet thick , 100 miles wide , and may be covering 40 % of the Gulf of Mexico .
As one person calculated , that would equate to 500 trillion barrels of oil ; total global reserves are estimated in the region of 2 trillion barrels .
5 . The leak could last 24 years .
He believes this , because short of the nuclear weapon idea he sees no other way to stop the leak and thinks we may have to wait for all of the oil to come out of the reservoir .
Meanwhile , the news is that BP is starting to get the leak under control .
6 . The gulf states need to be evacuated .
Simmons says “ We ’re going to have to evacuate the gulf states .
Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people ?
. . .
This story is 80 times worse than I thought . ”
That last claim was in the Washington Post , leading one critic to ask of the story ’s author :
Did he consider that Simmons is a financial analyst and may have an agenda in creating heightened hysteria surrounding the spill ?
Did he consider the effect printing this claim could have on the people of the Gulf Coast ?
When Appealing to Authority , Make Sure the Authority is an Authority
Here are some comments I recently read from an actual petroleum expert ( geologist ) on some of Matt ’s arguments :
He does n’t seem to understand that the rig was connected to the well by the riser before it sank , and it was spewing oil and gas into the rig from the blow out .
He also does n’t seem to understand that most old blow outs occurred when drilling – and the drill string would get blown out of the hole – not the casing .
And he does n’t seem to know that blow outs are more common than we are currently aware and that relief wells are tried and tested means of stopping this .
And he is the foremost oil expert in the World !
This is the problem in a nutshell .
He is making authoritative , alarming , and far - fetched claims , but the real experts are n’t backing him up .
His claims are quite consistent with his claims of recent years where he goes out on a limb , finds himself all alone , and eventually just jumps to another limb .
I ca n’t figure out if he is simply after publicity to sell his book , or whether he is really as deluded as his comments seem to indicate .
Yet one thing interviewers almost always do is play up Matt ’s experience .
The danger in this sort of appeal to authority comes about when the supposed authority is n’t really an expert , and yet has the potential to cause mass hysteria and / or influence public policy .
Simmons thinks it would be a good idea to set off a nuclear explosion in the Gulf of Mexico .
He thinks we should evacuate 20 million people in the Gulf Coast .
He has influence .
But I think the media needs to start doing a better job here and stop facilitating this nonsense .
Conclusions
The purpose of this essay was not simply to dump on Simmons .
But he is involved in sensationalistic fear - mongering , enabled by the media ’s mistaken belief that he is an expert in all things oil - related .
I want to make sure people know that they should take his claims with the grain of salt they deserve .
As I have documented here , that grain of salt is warranted based on his history of sensational claims that never materialized .
Sadly , I believe he is in the process of destroying his credibility , and I ultimately do not think history is going to judge him kindly when it looks back on these events .
This is very unfortunate , because despite the sensational claims , I still believe he is correct on a lot of the big picture questions of peak oil , long - term prices , and the need to take action .
But if he loses his credibility , he will diminish his ability to convince people of the importance of the big picture issues .
One in five Irish people would deny citizenship to Travellers , a new survey has found .
This result was described as “ frightening ” by report author Fr Michael MacGreil SJ .
It marks an increase of 10 per cent over the last 20 years and shows a “ growing polarisation in public attitudes towards Travellers ” , he said .
He was speaking this evening as he published Emancipation of the Travelling People which monitors changes in public attitude towards Travellers over the past 35 years .
Three quarters of people would be reluctant to buy a house next door to a Traveller , the survey of over 1000 people by the ESRI in 2007 / 2008 found .
This finding has increased since a similar survey 20 years ago .
It indicates a “ negative mood ” in Irish society towards having Travellers in the immediate area , Fr Mac Greil said .
A change in the main reason for this answer changed from “ not socially acceptable ” in the 1988 survey to “ way of life ” in the 2008 survey .
This was welcomed by the author .
At almost 40 per cent , those who would welcome Travellers as a member of their family was the highest ever measured .
It was triple 1988 finding .
While the percentage was still too low , it took Travellers out of the “ lower - caste ” status in the minds of a significant portion of people , Fr MacGreil said .
The report ’s most positive finding was that three quarters of people felt that Travellers were competent to sit on a jury .
This marked an increase of 20 per cent compared to 1988 .
" In the folklore of travellers very little confidence in the courts because feel they are not represented " he said .
There was also a slight improvement in the number of people who would be willing to employ a Traveller , which stands at 60 per cent .
Almost three quarters of people who supported Travellers being facilitated to their own way of life , to 72 per cent , a decline of 20 per cent .
Respondents with third level occupations were least in favour of this which was “ disappointing ” the report said .
Solidarity between less - well off people and Travellers was revealed in the results .
Respondents in unskilled and semi-skilled occupations and those with least education were the most tolerant towards Travellers pointing to solidarity , the report said .
This pointed both to class prejudice and evidence of solidarity , the report said .
Among the main recommendations of the report were the removal of the culture of poverty and depravation , creation of a unique ethnic group status and a statutory commission to review Traveller policy .
Fr Mac Greil said there needed to be a new and pluralist approach by thestate as the policy of assimilation or “ settling ” Travellers had not succeeded in integrating travellers into Irish society .
The findings showed a need for strong robust anti-discrimination legislation and a well - resourced body to implement it , Martin Collins of Pavee Point said .
Minister for Community , Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs Pat Carey said that conflict resolution in the Traveller community would be his priority .
The report was based on an ESRI survey in 2007 / 2008 and replicates previous surveys in 1972 and 1988 .
Here 's a key exchange between Yousef al - Otaiba , and yours truly , at the Aspen Ideas Festival .
I asked him , Do you want the U.S. to stop the Iranian nuclear program by force ?
And he answered : " Absolutely , absolutely .
I think we are at risk of an Iranian nuclear program far more than you are at risk .
At 7,000 miles away , and with two oceans bordering you , an Iranian nuclear threat does not threaten the continental United States .
It may threaten your assets in the region , it will threaten the peace process , it will threaten balance of power , it will threaten everything else , but it will not threaten you . "
He went on to say , " I am suggesting that I think out of every country in the region , the U.A.E. is most vulnerable to Iran .
Our military , who has existed for the past 40 years , wake up , dream , breathe , eat , sleep the Iranian threat .
It 's the only conventional military threat our military plans for , trains for , equips for , that 's it , there 's no other threat , there 's no country in the region that is a threat to the U.A.E. , it 's only Iran .
So yes , it 's very much in our interest that Iran does not gain nuclear technology . "

WASHINGTON  Supreme Court confirmation hearings are usually designed to probe a nominee ’s conception of the role of the justices .
But this week ’s questioning of Elena Kagan turned into a tutorial on Congressional responsibility .
Over and over , Ms. Kagan reminded the senators questioning her of their own duty to pass cogent , sensible  and constitutional  laws .
The Supreme Court , she said , was not created to strike down foolish measures .
On Tuesday , for instance , Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma , asked what should happen if Congress enacted a law requiring Americans “ to eat three vegetables and three fruits every day . ”
“ It sounds like a dumb law , ” Ms. Kagan said .
But she would not commit to striking it down .
“ I think that courts would be wrong to strike down laws that they think are senseless , just because they ’re senseless , ” she said .
The Deus Ex : Human Revolution E3 demo was mostly action packed .
We did n’t see Adam Jensen successfully smooth talk his way to the end of a mission , but you can do that , if you want to .
Social and hacking routes , as well as augmentations to buff those abilities , are part of the game .
“ We have things that let you know how the conversations are going , ” Jean - Francois Dugas , Lead Game Designer , explained when I asked him about social augmentations .
“ You can have an analysis of the psychological profile of the character to help you out and also might have points to convince him right now , not two rounds [ of conversation ] , right now . ”
Dugas gave an example of the social mechanics can by detailing an unseen part of Deus Ex : Human Revolution .
Deus Ex : Human Revolution has a mission set in Detroit where Adam needs to go into a police station to recover information .
Adam can fight his way in or sneaking in through the roof or sewers .
If you want to take a non-violent route , Adam can walk through the main lobby and talk to the desk sergeant .
“ By talking to him you ’ll discover there is a background story between your character and his character , ” Dugas highlighted .
“ If you try to convince him to go inside he says ‘ I ’ll lose my job ’ , that type of thing .
If you pursue that route and win you can access the entire police station . ”
Pick this path and you wo n’t have to resort to stealth or fighting .
Later on in the game , Adam may run into the desk sergeant again in civilian clothes .
After letting Adam into the building he lost his job and is upset with Adam .
Again , you ’re not forced to fight .
You can try to calm down the enraged desk sergeant with words .
Adam can also equip hacking augmentations .
These enhancements let players access higher level devices and upload viruses that can capture nodes to reach a computer ’s registry .
Once accessed , Adam can read e-mails and control cameras to scout out his surroundings .
While you can built up Adam for hacking or social paths , there are times where Adam has to fight .
Bosses , Dugas explained , have to be fought and killed .
Everyone is fair game , you can keep them alive if that ’s you ’re style of play .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg : BP still in ' grand shape ' despite record losses
BP says it has set aside $ 32.2 bn ( £ 20.8 bn ) to cover the costs linked to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The company said the charge gave it a loss of $ 17bn for the three months between April and June - a UK record .
BP 's chairman said the costs estimate was based on the company 's belief that it was not grossly negligent , and added the bill could be higher .
BP also said Bob Dudley , head of the Gulf clean - up operation , will replace Tony Hayward as chief executive
Mr Hayward will leave his post by mutual agreement in October .
He is likely to retain a role within the company .
BP plans to nominate him as a non-executive director of its Russian joint venture , TNK - BP .
BP also announced it would increase its asset sales over the next 18 months to $ 30bn , a total that includes the $ 7 bn - worth earmarked for sale last week .
The $ 32.2 bn cost of the clean - up includes the $ 20 bn already set aside in an escrow account for compensation claims .
" That estimate is also based on our belief that we are not grossly negligent , " BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg told the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston .
" Of course we will not know precisely because it depends on how many claims are coming in and [ other ] things that could happen . "
But he insisted that the company was in good financial shape , with strong cashflow .
" It 's of course a huge loss that overshadows everything else , but the underlying performance of the company is actually strong , " he told the BBC .
" There is no worry about our financial position and our ability to get through this .
It 's of course a tragedy and it has large consequences , but we have no doubt that we will be able to rebuild the company , " he said .
Stripping out the oil spill costs , BP made a second quarter profit , on a replacement cost basis , of $ 5bn , compared with $ 2.9bn for the second quarter of 2009 .
' We will change '
MEGA QUARTERLY LOSSES AIG : $ 61.7bn loss in fourth quarter 2008
AOL Time Warner : $ 54.2 bn loss in first quarter 2002
General Motors : $ 39bn loss in third quarter 2007
Bob Dudley , currently managing director and a US citizen , told ABC's Good Morning America programme , that BP would become a leaner organisation .
" It will be smaller and financially , it will grow .
We 're going to learn a lot from this incident and this accident ...
There 's no question that we will change as a company . "
The announcements were welcomed by most investors for their clear - cut approach .
Peter Hitchens , of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers , said : " It 's basically a kitchen sink job ...
" I think it 's the board trying to wipe the slate clean . "
' Milestone '
It is very difficult to describe a $ 17bn loss for three months of trading as a sparkling performance .
But for BP it could have been a lot worse Robert Peston , BBC business editor Read Robert 's blogSend us your comments
Tony Hayward said that , now oil had stopped spilling from the Macondo well , it was a good time to leave his post .
" With the leak now capped , we have reached a significant milestone .
This provides a firm basis to reshape the company , " he said .
On Monday , the BBC revealed that 53 - year old Mr Hayward will receive a year 's salary plus benefits , together worth more than £ 1m .
He will also be entitled to draw an annual pension of £ 600,000 once he reaches the age of 55 .
Mr Hayward 's pension pot is valued at about £ 11 m and he will keep his rights to shares under a long - term performance scheme which could - depending on BP 's stock market recovery - eventually be worth several million pounds .
Carl - Henric Svanberg said Mr Hayward would be missed .
" The BP board is deeply saddened to lose a CEO whose success over some three years in driving the performance of the company was so widely and deservedly admired , " he said .
The handling of the explosion on the drilling rig off Louisiana on 20 April , which killed 11 workers and triggered the worst oil spill in the US , raised questions about Mr Hayward 's leadership .

Ferrari's F10 will feature a special bodywork package in Montreal © Getty Images Enlarge
Ferrari is not prepared to give up on its 2010 car , despite falling dramatically off the pace at last weekend 's Turkish Grand Prix .
Fernando Alonso failed to make the Q3 qualifying session at Istanbul Park , while Felipe Massa was the team 's highest placed finisher - behind the Red Bulls , the McLarens , the Mercedes and the Renault of Robert Kubica .
Ferrari's F10 will feature a special low - downforce bodywork package in Montreal next weekend , before a big update is debuted at Valencia later this month .
It is rumoured that the Valencia upgrades will include a major repackaging of the rear end and exhaust system , an area that Red Bull has exploited with its innovative RB6 .
But team boss Stefano Domenicali denied that if the new parts fail to push Ferrari back towards the front of the grid , it will begin to focus on 2011 .
" We are not going to stop developing this car - we are not throwing away these races so far , " he said .
Even though the Italian media is decrying Ferrari's " disaster " and " crisis " , Alonso is only 14 points off the lead of the drivers ' championship .
Domenicali insisted : " We will continue working on the F10 until the end of the season .
The championship is still open and we have seen that anything can happen in the races .
We will not give up . "
Alonso agreed Ferrari is still in a position to fight for the title , but is concerned that no matter how good the Valencia upgrade is , it will not be enough to close the gap to the front .
" We know that McLaren and Red Bull are very far away and we do n't know if that 's enough .
We have to work hard , " he said .
" We do n't know how long it is going to take , but the truth is that we are almost eight tenths from Red Bull and 6 or 7 tenths from McLaren , and these developments [ for Valencia ] are not going to give us that much . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon decried overly negative assessments of the Afghan war on Wednesday , telling Congress the conflict is a “ roller coaster ” of ups and downs but insisting progress is being made .
Commander of the U.S. Central Command , Army General David Petraeus ( R ) , testifies on the situation in Afghanistan during a hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington June 16 , 2010 , as Defense Undersecretary for Policy Michele Flournoy looks on .
The United States has presented evidence to Pakistan that the Haqqani militant faction aligned with the Taliban and based in Pakistan orchestrated brazen attacks last month in Afghanistan , Petraeus said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
President Barack Obama and U.S. military planners are on the defensive due to growing anxiety over a six - month - old strategy that lawmakers fear is failing to turn the tide in the costly , unpopular conflict .
The strategy hinges on pouring U.S. forces into southern Afghanistan , the heartland of the Taliban insurgency , before starting a gradual withdrawal in July 2011 , conditions permitting .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged it would be a “ long and a hard fight ” and that U.S. casualties would rise over the summer .
But he assured skeptical lawmakers the new strategy had put the Afghan war on the right path .
“ I think frankly that the narrative ... has been too negative .
I think that we are regaining the initiative .
I think that we are making headway , ” Gates said .
Gates , a holdover from the George W. Bush administration , called for patience amid tough questions about the effectiveness of the war strategy from members of Congress , including Obama ’s fellow Democrats .
He said progress could not be measured week - to - week .
“ This is not something where we do ourselves any favors by tearing ourselves up by the roots every week to see if we ’re growing , ” Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee .
Senator John McCain , a top Republican who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election , said on Tuesday he was deeply concerned about the trends in the Afghan conflict .
McCain warned the U.S. campaign could be heading toward a “ crisis ” and expressed skepticism over the July 2011 timeline , given the violence and lawlessness on the ground .
The second - guessing has touched a nerve in the Pentagon , where some worry negativity is undercutting public sentiment for Obama ’s strategy before it has a chance to work .
About a third of the 30,000 reinforcements Obama deployed in December have yet to arrive in Afghanistan .
“ I have a certain sense of deja vu , ” Gates said .
“ I was sitting here getting the same kind of questions about Iraq in June of 2007 , when we had just barely gotten the surge forces into Iraq at that point . ”
ROLLER COASTER
General David Petraeus , who oversees the Afghan war as head of U.S. Central Command , compared the campaign to a roller coaster ride .
But overall , the situation was improving , he told the Senate Armed Services Committee .
“ It is truly an ‘ up and down ’ ( experience ) , when you ’re living it , when you ’re doing it , ” Petraeus said .
“ But the trajectory in my view has generally been upward , despite the tough losses , despite the setbacks . ”
Asked later by the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee , Petraeus said : “ Defining winning as making progress , then I think we are winning in Afghanistan .
It is a roller coaster ride , however . ”
A lone protester interrupted the hearing , shouting “ This is mass murder ” as she was being escorted out by police .
To bolster his case to the U.S. public , Obama needs to show progress in Afghanistan by December when a White House review of the war strategy is scheduled .
Perceptions of a struggling U.S. campaign have been fueled by stronger - than - expected Taliban resistance in the southern district of Marjah -- meant to be a showcase of U.S. strategy -- and a slower start to a long - awaited offensive in the Taliban ’s birthplace of Kandahar .
A massive military operation in Kandahar is the linchpin of Obama ’s campaign to turn the tide in the war this year and will weigh heavily in a White House review of strategy .
Michele Flournoy , undersecretary of defense for policy , said media reporting about “ the so - called delay in the Kandahar campaign has been overplayed . ”
“ I think we owe General ( Stanley ) McChrystal a great deal of operational flexibility , ” she said , referring to the top NATO and U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
Some of the deepest concerns center on Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s government .
Karzai has made repeated anti-Western statements and raised eyebrows last weekend by firing his interior minister and intelligence chief , two cabinet members broadly respected by Washington .
Gates said he had confidence in Karzai , his government and Afghan security forces .
Problems Gaining Root On The EVO
If you 've been following the EVO 4G root progress , you would know that the current root status is incomplete :
the unrevoked method allows granting root to apps but does n't allow writing to the / system partition , which means you can't remove applications added by Sprint and do any kind of useful hackery , such as installing custom recoveries or ROMs
toastcfh 's original method ( now known as Part 1 ) , which grants write access to / system but only in recovery mode , which means you need to reboot your phone into a special recovery console to gain those write permissions .
This method at least allow installing custom ROMs but you still can't write to / system , even when using those .
The /system write protection , which also exists on the Droid Incredible , was a new method of system lockdown implemented by HTC using NAND protection .
No other Android phones used this method before , as far as I know , which is why full root was much simpler to achieve on such phones as the Nexus One .
Full EVO Root
However , as of tonight , thanks to the amazing effort of toastcfh , a well respected Android hacker and the creator of the original root method , we now have instructions for achieving full EVO 4G root , including writing to / system from within a running OS !
This means you will be able to remove those pesky Sprint apps and finally use ROM Manager to install recovery images and flash custom ROMs .
The instructions come in 2 parts , the 1st one being the same crippled original root method :
Part 1 - same as before
Part 2 - new steps that achieve full write access to / system
The root process requires a bit of effort , but works consistently , unlike the current Droid Incredible method , which requires quite a bit of tinkering and luck .
Massive props to toastcfh and the Android development community !
Now get rooting and report back .
The comments are waiting for you .
P.S. Is the Incredible next ?
It uses the same NAND protection , and if the same methods used for the EVO can be applied to it , we may be in luck .
We will clarify this when we receive word from developers .
Preparation
Peppercorns can be used whole , crushed or ground to add heat and flavour to cooking .
Use them whole in stews and soups or as part of a bouquet garni .
You will often find whole peppercorns spicing up salamis or sausages .
Freshly ground peppercorns have much more flavour than ready - ground pepper , so buy fresh whole peppercorns and invest in a pepper grinder .
Try grinding fresh black pepper over a bowl of strawberries and see how it enhances the flavour of the fruit , releasing a very subtle pepper flavour .
Lightly crushed or cracked peppercorns can be used to spice up creamy sauces or to coat fillet steaks or chicken breasts .
The light crushing releases the fragrant spiciness ; using ground pepper in this way would just release too much heat .
Black pepper 's flavour diminishes during cooking , so it 's best to season dishes towards the end of cooking or at the table .

Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid bootcamp : Raul is out , Guti is gone and the showbiz is over ...
Jose Mourinho has hit the ground running at Real Madrid - almost literally .
He touched down on Wednesday in Los Angeles for his first pre-season training camp at his new club .
Despite his players ' body clocks reading 11.30 pm after a seven - hour flight , he had them out training at 10 am the next morning .
It was the first of two sessions , repeated on Friday , as they prepare for their first friendly on Wednesday against Club America in San Francisco .
Real changes : Jose Mourinho has wasted no time making his mark in Madrid
Having transformed the club 's Valdebebas training complex from beach club to bunker in a matter of days , he has now taken the boot camp on tour in a bid to knock football 's most notorious underachievers into shape .
Club staff , who have seen 10 managers leave in the last seven years , have been stunned by the intensity and seriousness of the new Real , with the clockwork precision of Mourinho 's training regime designed to maximize the time players spend together while minimising distractions .
The superstars have already been told the team bus waits for nobody - ' I would rather play with 10 than pick someone who arrives a minute late ' is his philosophy - and training sessions last precisely 90 minutes .
The coach has reinforced his demands for punctuality by turning up for work at 7.30 am each morning , three hours before most of his predecessors .
A lack of unity has also been identified as a problem .
Mourinho has turned a VIP area previously filled with autograph - hunting guests of the players into an exclusive relaxation zone , devoid of entourages and fitted with sofa beds so that no - one leaves base camp between morning and afternoon training sessions .
Players can take a siesta on site having eaten lunch together and mobile phones are kept in silent mode at all times .
On the pitch , Cristiano Ronaldo ( right , with Mourinho ) , of whom so much is expected , seems to have been given assurances by his boss that Real will continue to play the attacking football they produced throughout last season .
' Mourinho adapts to the players he has , ' said the Portugal forward .
' If he has attacking players then he will play attacking football .
Training has been spectacular and we know he is a winning coach whose titles speak for themselves . '
For his part , Mourinho has said one of his first tasks will be to find the best position in which to field Ronaldo .
' We have to find the formation that suits him best , ' he said of a player who started his Manchester United career on the right wing , moved to centre forward but ended up playing on the left in his first season in Madrid .
Ronaldo , who recently became a father following a relationship with a mystery woman , occasionally brings with him the showbiz baggage that Mourinho hates .
Some see the possibility of a clash of egos but there is every indication that both know the worth of having the other on their side and will do everything to make the relationship work .
For now this is just part of the fascination for the Madrid - supporting press , a group who will devour everything and anything about the new man .
Results will dictate how long they put up with the newly created distance between themselves and the team - the tour of the US is the first which has seen the press not travelling with the players .
All pre-season arrangements have required Mourinho 's authorisation .
It 's a far cry from dragging the galacticos halfway around the world on a photo - opportunity tour , regardless of whether or not the coach thought it made for good pre-season preparation .
Task - master : Mourinho has taken his new club to a gut - busting training camp in the US
Real 's new manager told the club to scrap a planned tour of Ireland because he believed privacy would be an issue .
He then gave the go - ahead for the US tour , saying he preferred the anonymity offered by the team 's current Beverly Hills surroundings .
The personnel at the club has also changed .
Mourinho has brought in his own team with Rui Faria and Jose Morais joining him in Spain , having followed him from Porto to Chelsea and then on to Inter Milan .
But he has also been careful to hire some local knowledge - appointing Aitor Karanka , a popular former Madrid defender , as his assistant .
Just in case the revolution prompted anybody to say ' we never used to do it like this ' , two of the club 's longest serving players - vice - captain Guti and captain and Real Madrid institution Raul - have been consigned to history .
The former has been sold to Besiktas and the latter offloaded to Schalke .
Mourinho will not have been the first coach keen to unburden himself of the two untouchables but he is the first to actually manage it .
Underachiever Guti was a thorn in the side of previous coach Manuel Pellegrini .
The two had a blazing row at half - time in last season ' s embarrassing cup exit to a third division team .
Guti had been reading the riot act to team - mates when Pellegrini had the audacity to question his own performance .
A fiery debate broke out and the midfielder was subsequently dropped for a month .
Once asked by Vicente Del Bosque , the Real Madrid manager at the time , when he was going to get his hair cut , Guti famously replied : ' When you shave off your moustache . '
He was a character .
But he did not have the character that Mourinho insists upon .
Early headaches :
Not everything has met with Mourinho 's approval
Raul certainly does have the right temperament but his legs appear to have gone .
He made his debut at 17 and 16 years of playing at the highest level has made competing for places with the likes of Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain impossible .
Pellegrini left Raul on the bench last season but from there he often rose to give instructions and call out encouragement as if he was the manager - something that no one could see happening under Mourinho .
His goalscoring record is boosted by the sheer number of games played .
He remains Spain 's top scorer but second - placed David Villa has scored 43 goals in 65 internationals while Raul 's 44 strikes came in 102 matches .
That fact aside , he has still - in the words of club president Florentino Perez - amassed more honours than most clubs and is adored by the Madrid fans .
When Spain ditched Raul , much to the ire of most Real supporters , it coincided with the beginning of a golden era for the national team .
Mourinho will hope for a similar reaction from Madrid .
Spanish daily El Pais has already bemoaned the low - key send - off Raul was given , saying : ' There was no stage in the centre of the pitch as there was to welcome Cristiano Ronaldo last season . '
But Mourinho will argue that was then and this is now .
He declined the offer of a similar , glitzy showbiz entrance for his own presentation two months ago .
This is the new high - tempo , low - key Madrid and from now on no one gets the fireworks out until a trophy has been won .

The Atlantic bluefin tuna is shaped like a child ’s idea of a fish , with a pointy snout , two dorsal fins , and a rounded belly that gradually tapers toward the back .
It is gunmetal blue on top , and silvery on the underside , and its tail looks like a sickle .
The Atlantic bluefin is one of the fastest swimmers in the sea , reaching speeds of fifty - five miles an hour .
This is an achievement that scientists have sought to understand but have never quite mastered ; a robo - tuna , built by a team of engineers at M.I.T. , was unable to outswim a real one .
( The word “ tuna ” is derived from the Greek thuno , meaning “ to rush . ” )
Atlantic bluefins are voracious carnivores — they feed on squid , crustaceans , and other fish — and can grow to be fifteen feet long .
The world ’s “ peak fish ” point came in the late nineteen - eighties , but no one noticed .
Illustration by Hellovon
At one time , Atlantic bluefins were common from the coast of Maine to the Black Sea , and from Norway to Brazil .
In the Mediterranean , they have been prized for millennia — in an ode from the second century , the poet Oppian describes the Romans catching bluefins in “ nets arranged like a city ” — but they are unusually bloody fish , and in most of the rest of the world there was little market for them .
( Among English speakers , they were long known as “ horse mackerel . ” )
As recently as the late nineteen - sixties , bluefin in the United States sold for only a few pennies a pound , if there were any buyers , and frequently ended up being ground into cat food .
Then , in the nineteen - seventies , the Japanese developed a taste for sushi made with bluefin , or hon-maguro .
This new preference , it ’s been hypothesized , arose from their exposure , following the Second World War , to American - style fatty foods .
The taste for hon-maguro was , in turn , imported back to the U.S. Soon , fishing for bluefin became so lucrative that the sale of a single animal could feed a family for a year .
( Earlier this year , a five - hundred - pound Pacific bluefin went for an astonishing three hundred and forty dollars a pound at a Tokyo fish auction . )
First , the big bluefins were fished out , then the smaller ones , too , became hard to find .
Tuna “ ranching , ” a practice by which the fish are herded into huge circular nets and fattened up before slaughter , was for a time seen as a solution until it was shown to be part of the problem : as fewer bluefins were allowed to reach spawning age , there were fewer and fewer new fish to fatten .
Bluefin catches are managed — the word is used here loosely — by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas .
The commission , known by the acronym ICCAT — pronounced “ eye- cat ” — is based in Madrid , and its members include the U.S. , the European Union , Japan , Canada , and Brazil .
In 2008 , ICCAT scientists recommended that the bluefin catch in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean be limited to between eighty - five hundred and fifteen thousand tons .
ICCAT instead adopted a quota of twenty - two thousand tons .
That same year , a panel of independent reviewers , hired by the commission to assess its performance , observed that ICCAT “ is widely regarded as an international disgrace . ”
( Carl Safina , the noted marine conservationist , has nicknamed the group the International Conspiracy to Catch All the Tunas . )
By most estimates , bluefin stocks have fallen by eighty per cent in the past forty years .
According to other assessments , the situation is even grimmer .
Callum Roberts , a professor of marine conservation at England ’s University of York , has calculated that there is now only one bluefin left for every fifty that were swimming in the Atlantic in 1940 .
Last year , in an effort to save the Atlantic bluefin from annihilation , Monaco proposed that the fish join animals like the giant panda and the Asian elephant on a list of creatures that cannot be traded — either alive or cut up for parts — across international borders .
When the proposal came up for a vote at a U.N. meeting in Doha this past March , the U.S. voted in favor of it .
“ The science is compelling , ” Tom Strickland , the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish , Wildlife , and Parks , told the Times .
“ That species is in spectacular decline . ”
Nevertheless , the measure was defeated .
( The vote — sixty - eight to twenty , with thirty nations abstaining — was widely seen as a victory for Japan . )
The following month , the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , and oil began gushing into the Gulf of Mexico .
The Gulf is one of only two known Atlantic - bluefin spawning sites , and April is the start of the spawning season .
If the Atlantic bluefin tuna were the first species to be fished into oblivion , its destruction would be shameful .
But , of course , its story has become routine .
Cod , once so plentiful off the coast of Newfoundland that they could be scooped up in baskets , are now scarce .
The same goes for halibut , haddock , swordfish , marlin , and skate ; it ’s been calculated that stocks of large predatory fish have declined by ninety per cent in the past half century .
In 1943 , Rachel Carson was a young biologist working for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service when she wrote a booklet titled “ Food from the Sea . ”
The point of the boosterish guide was to convince American consumers of the delectableness of fish like the wolffish , an enormous creature with a bulbous head , big teeth , and an eel - like body .
Wolffish is “ one of New England ’s underexploited fishes , a condition that will be corrected when housewives discover its excellence , ” Carson wrote .
Apparently , she was so persuasive — and bottom trawling so wrecked its habitat — that the wolffish is now considered a threatened species .
The sorry state of ocean life has led to a new kind of fish story — a lament not for the one that got away but for the countless others that did n’t .
In “ Saved by the Sea : A Love Story with Fish ” ( St. Martin’s ; $ 25.99 ) , David Helvarg notes that each year sharks kill some five to eight humans worldwide ; meanwhile we kill a hundred million of them .
Dean Bavington , the author of “ Managed Annihilation : An Unnatural History of the Newfoundland Cod Collapse ” ( University of British Columbia ; $ 94 ) , observes that two hundred billion pounds ’ worth of cod were taken from Canada ’s Grand Banks before 1992 , when the cod simply ran out .
In “ Four Fish : The Future of the Last Wild Food ” ( Penguin Press ; $ 25.95 ) , Paul Greenberg estimates that somewhere in the range of a hundred million salmon larvae used to hatch in the Connecticut River each year .
Now the number ’s a lot easier to pin down : it ’s zero .
“ The broad , complex genetic potential of the Connecticut River salmon , ” Greenberg writes , has “ vanished from the face of the earth . ”
The Great International Fisheries Exhibition , which took place in London in 1883 , was a celebration of all things piscatorial .
More than two thousand exhibitors from around the world displayed herring nets and salmon ladders , trout rods and eel spears , life buoys and lamprey baskets .
Awards — dozens of them were bestowed — included twenty pounds sterling for the best collection of smoked fish , twenty - five pounds for the best model of a sailing trawler , and ten pounds for the “ best Apparatus for , or Method of , protecting Young Brood and Oysters against Dog Whelks and other natural enemies . ”
Thomas Huxley , who is now mostly remembered for being an early supporter of Charles Darwin , was at the time the president of Britain ’s Royal Society , and he delivered the exhibition ’s opening address .
As his topic , Huxley chose the question “ Are fisheries exhaustible ?
That is to say , can all the fish which naturally inhabit a given area be extirpated by the agency of man ? ”
The answer , Huxley decided , was a qualified no .
Although people might be able to wipe out the salmon in a certain stream by throwing a net across it “ in such a manner as to catch every salmon that tries to go up and every smolt that tries to go down , ” conditions in the ocean were altogether different .
“ Probably all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible ; that is to say that nothing we do seriously affects the number of the fish , ” Huxley declared .
To the extent that there was a problem with the fishing industry , it was due to its “ relative backwardness . ”
Fishing , Huxley said , had failed “ to keep pace with the rapid improvement of almost every other branch of industrial occupation in modern times ” and still lagged “ very far behind scientific agriculture . . . as to the application of machinery . ”
Huxley ’s views dominated thinking about fisheries for most of the next century .
In 1955 , Francis Minot , the director of the Marine and Fisheries Engineering Research Institute , in Woods Hole , Massachusetts , co-wrote a book titled “ The Inexhaustible Sea . ”
As yet , he observed , “ we do not know the ocean well enough .
Much must still be learned .
Nevertheless , we are already beginning to understand that what it has to offer extends beyond the limits of our imagination . ”
In 1964 , the annual global catch totalled around fifty million tons ; a U.S. Interior Department report from that year predicted that it could be “ increased at least tenfold without endangering aquatic stocks . ”
Three years later , the department revised its estimate ; the catch could be increased not by a factor of ten but by a factor of forty , to two billion tons a year .
This , it noted , would be enough to feed the world ’s population ten times over .
Michael L. Weber observes , in “ From Abundance to Scarcity ” ( 2002 ) , that as recently as the nineteen - nineties U.S. policy was predicated “ on the belief that the ocean ’s productivity was almost limitless . ”
In the meantime , “ machinery ” beyond Huxley ’s wildest imagining was being developed .
Purse seines were introduced in the nineteen - thirties .
These giant nets can be played out around entire schools of fish , then gathered up with drawstrings , like huge laundry bags .
Factory freezer trawlers , developed after the Second World War , grew to be so gargantuan that they amounted to , in effect , seafaring towns .
In the nineteen - fifties , many fleets added echo - sounding sonar , which can detect fish schools long before they surface .
Today , specially designed buoys known as “ fish aggregating devices , ” or FADs , are deployed to attract species like yellowfin tuna and blue marlin .
So - called “ smart ” FADs come equipped with sonar and G.P.S. , so operators can detect from afar whether they are , in fact , surrounded by fish .
In the short term , the new technology worked , much as Huxley had predicted , to swell catches .
But only in the short term .
In the late nineteen - eighties , the total world catch topped out at around eighty - five million tons , which is to say , roughly 1.9 billion tons short of the Interior Department ’s most lunatic estimate .
This milestone — the point of what might be called “ peak fish ” — was passed without anyone ’s quite realizing it , owing to inflated catch figures from the Chinese .
( These fishy figures were later exposed as politically motivated fabrications . )
For the past two decades , the global catch has been steadily declining .
It is estimated that the total take is dropping by around five hundred thousand tons a year .
Meanwhile , as the size of the catch has fallen , so , too , has the size of the creatures being caught .
This phenomenon , which has become known as “ fishing down the food web , ” was first identified by Daniel Pauly , a fisheries biologist at the University of British Columbia .
In “ Five Easy Pieces : How Fishing Impacts Marine Ecosystems ” ( Island Press ; $ 50 ) , Pauly follows this trend to its logical — or , if you prefer , illogical — conclusion .
Eventually , all that will be left in the oceans are organisms that people wo n’t , or can ’t , consume , like sea slugs and toxic algae .
It ’s been argued that humans have become such a dominant force on the planet that we ’ve ushered in a new geological epoch .
Pauly proposes that this new epoch be called the Myxocene , from the Greek muxa , meaning “ slime . ”
The new fish stories can be read as parables about technology .
What was , once upon a time , a stable relationship between predator and prey was transformed by new “ machinery ” into a deadly mismatch .
This reading is n’t so much wrong as misleading .
To paraphrase the old N.R.A. favorite , FADs do n’t kill fish , people do .
In an effort to figure out what ocean life was like before the modern era , marine scientists have , in the past few decades , cored through seafloor sediments , measured the size of fish bones tossed out at ancient banquets , and combed through the logs of early explorers .
As Callum Roberts reports in “ The Unnatural History of the Sea ” ( 2007 ) , the work suggests that humans have been wreaking havoc in the oceans for centuries .

WALL OF SHAME AND SOLUTIONS :
In a city that is rapidly changing to cater to the one - percent at every level , Clarion Alley Mural Project ( CAMP ) is one of the last remaining truly punk venues in San Francisco , organized by a core and revolving group of individuals who have collectively volunteered tens of thousands of hours throughout its history over the past 21 years .
As part of CAMP ’s mission to be a force for those who are marginalized and a place where culture and dignity speak louder than the rules of private property or a lifestyle that puts profit before compassion , respect , and social / economic / environmental justice , CAMP artists / organizers Megan Wilson , Christopher Statton , and Mike Reger have just completed Clarion Alley Mural Project ’s Wall of Shame and Solutions to address the current crisis of displacement and the dismantling of our city ’s historic culture .
Wilson herself was evicted in 2008 through the Ellis Act from her home of 13 years .
In 2013 she was evicted from her studio at 340 Bryant Street , along with 150 other artists , by developer Joy Ou of Group i to make way for new tech offices .
340 Bryant Street was one of the last remaining affordable industrial spaces for artists ’ studios in San Francisco .
Additionally , during the painting of the “ Wall of Shame and Solutions ” Wilson was held by a Mission District police officer ( with a back - up team of two officers ) for 30 - minutes for “ breaking San Francisco ’s Sit / Lie Ordinance ” by sitting on the ground while taking a break from painting the mural .
The mural includes the following selection of “ Shames ” and “ Solutions ” – there are many others that could ’ve been included ; however , due to space , we narrowed it down :
SHAME : 3,705 Ellis Evictions 1997 – 2013 , SF Eviction Epidemic
SOLUTION : Ellis Act Relocation Bill & Support the Anti-Speculation Tax and Support the SF Community Land Trust
SHAME : “ Google Buses ” / SFMTA
SOLUTION : Ban Private Shuttles From Public Bus Stops and Pay Into The Existing Public Transit System
SHAME : Corporate Tax Give - Aways by : Mayor Ed Lee & Supervisors Jane Kim , Scott Weiner , Malia Cohen , Mark Farrell , Eric Mar , and David Chiu
SOLUTION : End Corporate Welfare and Tax Them and Make Them Pay Their Fair Share
SHAME : Uber , Lyft , Sidecar etal .
SOLUTION : Regulate & Tax
SHAME : Airbnb
SOLUTION : Regulate & Tax
SHAME : Corporate Community Benefit Agreements
SOLUTION : Just Say “ NO ” – Make Them Pay Their Fair Share
SHAME : Closure of Chess Game in Mid Market
SOLUTION : Bring Back The Public Chess Games

CONTEXT :
San Francisco is experiencing a massive displacement of its residents , its communities , and its diverse culture – as the high tech industry and its workers continue to move into our City and to recruit more and more of its employees from outside of the Bay Area .
Additionally , high numbers of foreigners are buying up property in San Francisco as second or third homes , contributing to the shortage of affordable housing .
Those being forced out of their homes and neighborhoods include longtime residents ( many who are low and middle income , immigrants , and communities of color ) , local businesses , and non-profit social service and arts organizations – agencies that act as integral parts to the neighborhoods they live in and serve .
It ’s been truly heartbreaking to watch so many people who have spent many years creating and contributing to our communities be forced to leave because , while they have plenty of creativity , energy , and love for their neighborhoods , they do n’t have enough money to keep their homes , small businesses , and community - based organizations .
This is an epidemic rooted in a systemic war being forged by politicians and for - profit interests across the world .
In San Francisco it ’s a war being led by Mayor Ed Lee ( led by Gavin Newsom before him , and Willie Brown before that ) , District Supervisors , and the Planning Commission , funded by deep pockets with the money to pull these City “ leaders ” ’ strings .
These are the folks who have created and are creating the changing image of San Francisco as “ money is the priority , ” not culture and / or a voice for the disenfranchised .
All eyes throughout the world are now on San Francisco and watching as the city that was once known for its progressive free - love counterculture is rapidly being dismantled by free - market capitalism on steroids .
Ultimately the power of the people who do n’t have deep pockets lies in calling these interests out , demanding better , and coming up with “ creative solutions ” to put an end to the powers that are cruelly targeting the most vulnerable populations locally , nationally , and globally .
After a spirited international campaign joined by Western politicians and celebrities , the Iranian government apparently will not stone a woman accused of adultery .
But human rights activists and her lawyer still worried Friday that she could be executed by other means .
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , a 43 - year - old mother of two , has been imprisoned in the city of Tabriz since 2006 after being charged with having sex outside of marriage , considered a serious offense under Islamic law .
She was convicted of the charge , even though her husband had been slain before the alleged affair , and she received a public flogging .
Rights activists and Ashtiani ’s family say that during the later trial of two men accused of killing her husband , another court found her guilty of committing adultery with the suspects before her husband ’s death , though it cited no evidence , and sentenced her to death .
On Thursday , Iran ’s Embassy in London issued a news release saying Ashtiani would not be stoned to death , a gruesome process in which a person is buried up to their chest or neck and then pelted with medium - sized rocks until they die .
However , Iranian officials have yet to clarify what fate awaits the woman .
“ The communique is not enough , ” said Mohammad Mostafai , Ashtiani ’s lawyer , who has been blogging on his client ’s behalf for weeks .
“ It ’s ambiguous , ” he said in a telephone interview from Tehran , the Iranian capital .
“ It does not say if the sentence has been turned into another sentence .
It does not say if she is going to be free .
It does not say what will happen to her next . ”
The embassy in Britain described word of the impending stoning as “ false news ” and said that “ according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran , she will not be executed by stoning punishment . ”
But Mostafai and international human rights activists said they were worried because Iran ’s judiciary has yet to issue a statement rejecting the use of stoning in the case .
Iran is among the world ’s top practitioners of capital punishment .
The rights group Amnesty International reports that 126 executions have been carried out this year .
Ashtiani ’s tale also points to the changing nature of Iranian society .
Traditional and pious families often shun a relative accused of adultery .
But Ashtiani ’s children , especially her son , who is in his 20s , have stood by her and helped mobilize international support .
The case also suggests that Iran ’s government , which has grown more repressive since the crackdown that followed the disputed June 2009 presidential election , remains susceptible to public pressure .
“ Our campaign has shown that we can force the regime to back down , ” said Mina Ahadi , an Iranian human rights activist based in Germany .
“ Our pressure is working .
We must intensify it until we secure a victory for the people of Iran by saving the lives of Sakineh and others . ”
The trial of Ashtiani unfolded in the province of East Azerbaijan .
Her defenders say Ashtiani , a member of Iran ’s ethnic Azeri community , could not clearly understand the Persian - language court proceedings .
She has retracted a confession , which she says was obtained under duress , and insists she is innocent of adultery .
The case attracted worldwide attention .
A - list Hollywood stars including Robert Redford , Emma Thompson and Colin Firth , along with politicians including Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the stoning sentence .
“ We ’re deeply troubled by press reports of the planned execution by Iranian authorities of Ms. Ashtiani by stoning , ” U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday .
“ Stoning , as a means of execution , is tantamount to torture .
It ’s barbaric and an abhorrent act . ”
Amnesty International says seven Iranian women and three men await death by stoning , which is a practice Iranian officials have repeatedly promised to halt .

This post is expanded on in the new post ‘ Build Responsive Games For Mobile Phones , Tablets and Computers with HTML5 Canvas ’
One of the best ways to learn how to program in any language is to make a game and then change the code to create different variations on the game .
I learned C++ long ago by creating an elevator simulation game ( thanks Tom Swan ) .
It ’s fun and it is the closest you can come to ‘ instant gratification ’ in programming .
Let ’s make a maze game in an HTML5 canvas .
In this post Moving Shapes on the HTML5 Canvas With the Keyboard we learned to use keyboard input to move a shape around the canvas .
All we need to do to make our game is
1 . Add an image of the maze to the canvas .
2 . Add collision detection code so we know if our shape hits a border in the maze .
What you need to run this
An HTML5 friendly browser .
I use Google Chrome and Firefox 3.6 .
A text editor like Notepad .
I use PSPad
A web server to upload your page to .
All the code for the maze game is in this post but it does build on the post Moving Shapes on the HTML5 Canvas With the Keyboard which you can refer to if you do n’t understand the keyboard input routines .
This example can not be run from your desktop because it uses the getImageData ( ) method of the 2d context for collision detection .
For security reasons it can only be run from a page served to the browser by a server .
See the comments to the post here for more info .
Here ’s the game ( you need an HTML5 friendly browser to view this )
Here is our canvas in action .
Since this post is longer than one page , pushing the arrow keys will scroll the page in addition to moving the square around .
I substituted the arrow key keycodes with new keycodes .
Press w to move up ( keycode 87 )
Press s to move down ( keycode 83 )
Press a to move left ( keycode 65 )
Press d to move right ( keycode 68 )
Canvas Maze Game

You can copy this code and paste it into a new file called something like maze .
html and upload it to a webserver along with your maze image ( they must be in the same directory ) .
When you open it with an HTML5 friendly browser like Firefox 3.6 it will display the canvas with the maze game on it .
Getting a maze image
There is a free tool at http://hereandabove.com/maze/mazeorig.form.html that makes awesome maze images which you can right click and save in order to use them in your canvas page .
Make sure that you set the Path width ( in pixels ) to be wider than your square plus whatever you use for dx and dy or else your square will always be colliding with a wall and wo n't go anywhere .
Here is the image that I used .
You can right click it and save it if you do n't want to make your own right now .
Putting the maze image on your canvas
After getting a maze image , we need to add it to our canvas .
Be sure that you upload the image into the same directory as your HTML file .
Make the canvas size the same size as the size of the image .
My image is 482x482 .
< div > < canvas id =" canvas " width = " 482 " height = " 482 " >
This text is displayed if your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas .
</ canvas > </div >﻿
This makes it easier because the coordinate system of the canvas will match the coordinate system of the maze image .
Add a variable to hold our image .
var img = new Image ( ) ;
We put our image into our new variable in our init ( ) function which is the function that we call to start everything .
function init ( ) { canvas = document.getElementById(" canvas " ) ; ctx = canvas.getContext ( " 2d " ) ; img.src = " maze.gif " ; return setInterval ( draw , 10 ) ; }
Then we draw our image onto the canvas in our clear ( ) function .
function clear ( ) { ctx.clearRect(0 , 0 , WIDTH , HEIGHT ) ; ctx.drawImage( img , 0 , 0 ) ; }
This way when we call clear , only our little square is erased and we can look at the area of the maze where the square would go next and easily see if it is going to collide with a border .
The drawImage method of the 2d context has three arguments
ctx.drawImage ( variable holding the image , X coordinate of the top left of the image , Y coordinate of the top left of the image )
When we call it , we put our maze image on the canvas with the top left corner at ( 0,0 ) which is the top left corner of our canvas also .
Now when we look at a pixel like ( 100,100 ) on our canvas , we are also looking at pixel ( 100,100 ) on our image .
Adding collision detection
Now all we need to do is check to make sure that we only move the square if the movement will not cause it to cross over one of the borders in the maze .
Here 's some pseudocode .
User presses an arrow key
Calculate where that would move the square to .
Look at all of the pixels on the maze image that the square will cover in its new position ( our square is 15x15 so we look at 225 pixels )
Are any of the pixels black ( the maze is white with black borders .
If a pixel is black that means the square would collide with a border )
YES : then do not move
NO : then move
Our collision detection needs to occur when a user presses an arrow key to move the square .
Let 's look at what happens when the up arrow is pressed .
function doKeyDown ( evt ) { switch ( evt.keyCode ) { case 38 : /* Up arrow was pressed */ if ( y - dy > 0 ) { y -= dy ; clear ( ) ; checkcollision ( ) ; if ( collision == 1 ) { y += dy ; collision = 0 ; } }
When a key is pressed on the keyboard , our event listener calls doKeyDown ( ) which then checks to see if an arrow key was pressed .
If the keyCode of the event is 38 then that means the up arrow key was pushed down .
First we check to make sure that the requested move wo n't move the square off of the canvas ( y < 0 ) .
if ( y - dy > 0 ) {
In order to move the square up we need to decrease the value of y by dy ( dy and dx are set to the number of pixels that we move the square with each keypress .
We are using dy = 5 and dx = 5 in our example ) .
y -= dy ;
Now we need to check if the new y value causes our square to cross over a border in the maze .
First we call our clear ( ) function which redraws our canvas with the maze picture but does not draw our square .
function clear ( ) { ctx.clearRect(0 , 0 , WIDTH , HEIGHT ) ; ctx.drawImage( img , 0 , 0 ) ; }
This allows us to look at the pixels on the maze image where our square wants to move to .
Now we can check if there is a collision between the square and any of the borders of the maze .
Here 's our checkcollision ( ) function .
function checkcollision ( ) { var imgd = ctx.getImageData(x , y , 15 , 15 ) ; var pix = imgd.data ; for ( var i = 0 ; n = pix. length , i < n ; i += 4 ) { if ( pix [ i ] == 0 ) { collision = 1 ; } } }
We get the image data from a square at ( x , y , 15 , 15 ) which is the 15x15 square area that our square will cover when we draw it .
Then we load that data into a one dimensional array pix [ ] .
var imgd = ctx.getImageData(x , y , 15 , 15 ) ; var pix = imgd.data ;
This array has four values for each pixel in our 15x15 area .
The values are
RED value
GREEN value
BLUE value
ALPHA value
A white pixel with no transparency looks like this
255
255
255
255
A black pixel with no transparency looks like this
0
0
0
255
4 values X 15 pixels X 15 pixels = 900 values in our array but since we are looking for either black or white we can simply look at only the RED value of each pixel which means we compare 225 values instead of 900 .
If the pixel is black RED is 0 and if the pixel is white RED is 255 so we look at every fourth value in the array and check to see if it is 0 ( for black ) .
If it is , we set the variable collision = 1 .
for ( var i = 0 ; n = pix. length , i < n ; i += 4 ) { if ( pix [ i ] == 0 ) { collision = 1 ; } }
Now we are back in our keydown code for the up arrow where we check for the collision variable being set to 1 and if it is we undo the change to y and set the collision variable back to 0 .
Y remains unchanged and the next time the draw ( ) function is called ( it is called once every 10 milliseconds ) it will not move the square up .
if ( collision == 1 ) { y += dy ; collision = 0 ;
Where to go from here
You can now jazz up your maze game .
Here are some suggestions .
Add a timer display that counts down and the player must solve the maze before time runs out .
Use the timer to keep score so players can see who is the fastest .
Add sound effects .
BEEP when the player hits a border or a fanfare when they win .
Add more mazes .
Make ten mazes that are progressively more difficult and when the player finishes one , start the next one .
You can use any black and white image .
Make a finger numbing spiral maze .
Make a trainer to help disabled people learn to use a neural impulse actuator to operate a computer .
Have fun with the code as that is the easiest way to learn .

Is that a 3 - handle I see on the long bond and a 2 - handle of the 10 - year treasury ?
Why yes it is .
Treasury Yields - Weekly Close
click on chart for sharper image
The week is not over yet but this looks rather ominous .
Treasury yields are back where they were in April of 2009 at the start of the so - called " recovery " .
I am not quite sure why the 3 - month treasury displays as a flatline at .5 .
The flatline is closer to 0 .
Consumer Sentiment Plunges
Inquiring minds note that the Consumer Conference Board Confidence Index Drops Sharply .
The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index ® which had been on the rise for three consecutive months , declined sharply in June .
The Index now stands at 52.9 ( 1985=100 ) , down from 62.7 in May .
The Present Situation Index decreased to 25.5 from 29.8 .
The Expectations Index declined to 71.2 from 84.6 last month .
Those saying conditions are “ good ” decreased to 8.0 percent from 9.7 percent , while those saying business conditions are “ bad ” increased to 42.4 percent from 39.5 percent .
Consumers ’ assessment of the labor market was also less favorable .
Those claiming jobs are “ hard to get ” increased to 44.8 percent from 43.9 percent , while those saying jobs are “ plentiful ” decreased to 4.3 percent from 4.6 percent .
Consumers ’ short - term outlook , which had improved significantly last month , turned more pessimistic in June .
Those anticipating an improvement in business conditions over the next six months decreased to 17.2 percent from 22.8 percent , while those expecting conditions will worsen rose to 14.9 percent from 11.9 percent .

For those of you who do n’t like your stock or alternative add - on keyboards on your Android device , have I got good news for you : the Swiftkey beta is now available in the Android market .
I ’ve been using Swiftkey through a private beta for the past few weeks and there ’s one word I have to describe it : fantastic .
I replaced my Swype keyboard with Swiftkey and have n’t looked back since .
Predictive Text
One of the best features of this keyboard is the predictive text .
I ’m not talking about predicting the rest of a word that you ’ve already begun to type .
I ’m talking about actually predicting the next word that you might type based on what you ’ve already input .
It predicts based on the context of what you ’re writing about .
From the Swiftkey website :
“ SwiftKey offers intelligent next - word prediction by analysing the context of a user ’s sentence and input behaviour .
This is accomplished through TouchType 's Fluency ™ prediction engine , which employs statistical language models generated by analysing billions of words of background text . ”
All I can say is that it “ just works ” and that the more you type , the more it learns your word patterns which helps it become even better at predicting your next word .
In fact , it correctly predicts your next word around a third of the time without your entering any characters from that word and it correctly predicts 80 % of the time with only one or two characters input from that word .
This is nothing short of “ very cool . ”
You ’ve got to see it in action yourself to believe it .
In the graphic below , you ’ll see a short paragraph with the words colored as “ next words predicted , ” “ characters entered , ” and “ word completion . ”
Take a look at the “ keystrokes saved ” and “ next words predicted ” figures .
I think you ’ll see why this is such a big deal .
Swiftkey beta is currently free , though limited by an expiration date , after which it may extend the free beta or convert to a paid model .

SEATTLE , June 3 / PRNewswire / --
In a landmark decision , Oregon regulators have given first - ever official US approval to a brand of medical marijuana hydroponics nutrients .
Oregon and most other states have regulatory agencies that examine fertilizers and hydroponics plant supplements to determine the legitimacy , ingredients and effectiveness of plant growth products .
Advanced Nutrients co-founder Michael Straumietis welcomes the news that Oregon 's government proffered formal approval for an Advanced Nutrients formula designed for a specific strain of medical marijuana .
" Regulatory approval is a breakthrough for the medical marijuana community , " Straumietis explains .
" For the first time , government regulators have examined and affirmed the use of crop- specific medical marijuana hydroponics nutrients . "
Until Straumietis asked regulators to evaluate the medical marijuana effectiveness and safety of Advanced Nutrients hydroponics formulas , regulators nationwide had apparently never considered how hydroponics nutrients specifically affect medical marijuana crops .
'' It has n't been part of the discussion , until now , '' Straumietis explains .
" For example , when fertilizer regulators evaluate fertilizers that have labels claiming to produce larger tomatoes , they require specific efficacy data proving those claims .
Now Oregon regulators have opened the door for formal evaluation of hydroponics nutrients and medical marijuana growth , quality and yield . "
Oregon medical marijuana patients , cultivators , doctors and advocates applauded the regulatory decision , citing their long - held concern that regulators were not looking at how hydroponics nutrients interact with medical marijuana .
" Advanced Nutrients and the medical marijuana community give kudos to Oregon regulators for being the first state regulators to evaluate the science of medical marijuana and hydroponics nutrients , " Straumietis says .
" Our community is looking for similar action from regulators in other medical marijuana states . "

What is a Design Pattern ?
A design pattern is a proven solution for a general design problem .
It consists of communicating classes and objects that are customised to solve the problem in a particular context .
The usefulness of the solution a pattern presents has been proven in many designs .
As such it captures design experience of experienced programmers .
A designer who is familiar with such patterns can apply them immediately to design problems without having to rediscover them .
This way design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures .
Expressing proven techniques as design patterns makes them more accessible to developers of new systems .
Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability .
Design patterns can even improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an explicit specification of class and objects interactions and their underlying ' intent ' .
Put simply , design patterns help a designer get a design ' right ' faster .
The design patterns are not about designs such as linked lists and hash tables that can be encoded in classes and reused as is .
Nor are they complex , domain specific designs for an entire application or subsystem .
The following Design Patterns are from the Whiteants ModelMaker Manual
Wrapper pattern ( also called ' Adapter ' ) , converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect .
Mediator pattern , creates event handlers for a ' used ' class and wires them .
Singleton pattern , ensures a class only has one instance , and provides a global point of access to it .
Decorator pattern , attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically .
Lock pattern , provides a mechanism to temporarily lock some aspect of a class .
Visitor pattern , represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure by a class .
Observer pattern , defines a one - to - many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state , all its dependants are notified .
I 've also written an example to illustrate the two most common Design Patterns in designing a Data Aware Component .
In addition I 've put together a worked example of the following patterns from the Design Patterns Book .

He ’s in the dog house !
Cops carted away hot - dog - devouring legend Takeru “ The Tsunami ” Kobayashi after the iconic competitive eater — banned from yesterday ’s Nathan ’s Hot Dog Eating Contest — tried to rush the stage .
Six - time Nathan ’s champ Kobayashi made his move after eating machine Joey “ Jaws ” Chestnut of San Jose , Calif. , won his fourth consecutive Nathan ’s title .
Kobayashi , of Japan , was barred from the competition due to a contract beef with Major League Eating , which organized yesterday ’s competition .
He was charged with resisting arrest , trespassing and obstruction of governmental affairs .
As cops cuffed the ex-champ , fans chanted , “ Let him eat !
Let him eat ! ”
Kobayashi , who had been watching the action feet from the stage , was trying to grab the microphone before cops took him down , sources said .
“ It was extremely unfortunate and a little bizarre , ” admitted Major League Eating Chairman George Shea .
The slender Kobayashi , 32 , was hauled off wearing a “ Free Kobi ” T - shirt — a sentiment he and his fans had been proclaiming for days to protest his exclusion .
Later , a handcuffed and smiling Kobayashi was led out of the 60th Precinct station house on his way to Central Booking .
WATCH VIDEO OF KOBAYASHI GETTING ARRESTED
His spokeswoman , Maggie James , said Kobayashi had hoped to give the frankfurter faithful an eating demonstration .
“ But nobody knew he ’d jump onstage , ” she insisted .
Kobayashi tried to do just that after Chestnut put away 54 dogs and buns and coasted to victory .
Chestnut , 26 , relished his win , although he fell short of his record of 68 .
“ I came out here , I knew what I had to do , ” said Chestnut , clutching the famed Mustard Yellow Belt .
Chestnut insisted he ’s still top dog , despite the absence of Kobayashi .
“ If he was real man , he ’d be on the stage , ” said Chestnut , apparently unaware of Kobayashi ’s arrest .
“ There was no reason for him not to be here . ”

BP and Feds Withheld Videos Showing Massive Scope of Oil Spill Coast Guard Admiral Landry told public not to ' fixate ' on the rate of oil spill .
June 3 , 2010  --
New videos show more clearly than ever how BP , with little resistance from the Coast Guard or other federal agencies , kept the public in the dark about just how bad things were beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico .
On May 1 , 11 days after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded , and nine days after oil began spilling into the Gulf , the Coast Guard had still only released a single image of oil leaking a mile beneath the surface -- a fuzzy photograph of a broken pipe spewing oil .
But inside the unified command center , where BP and federal agencies were orchestrating the spill response , video monitors had already displayed hours of footage they did not make public .
The images showed a far more dire situation unfolding underwater .
The footage filmed by submarines showed three separate leaks , including one that was unleashing a torrent of oil into the Gulf .
BP officials said they made all the video available to federal officials .
" The video has been available to the unified command from the very beginning , " said Mark Proegler , a BP spokesman .
" It 's always been here from the beginning .
They had it . "
Coast Guard officials told ABC
News that BP refused to allow them to release the more startling images , arguing they were proprietary .
But at the time , the agency was doing little to convey to the world what the images were showing .
Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry was sticking with estimates , calculated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which put the spill 's size at about 5,000 barrels a day for several weeks .
Coast Guard officials said they were focused on the response , and advised the public not to worry about just how much oil was pouring into the water .
" I would caution you not to get fixated on an estimate of how much is out there , " said Adm .
Landry .
Two days later , as oil continued to spew , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said much the same thing .
" This fixation on the number of barrels is a little bit misleading , " said Napolitano .
BP officials said everyone inside the Unified Command center in Louisiana agreed that the 5,000 barrel figure was the best they could offer .
But Dr. Ian MacDonald , an oceanographer and oil expert at Florida State University said he disagrees , and he remains " baffled and bothered " by the decision to keep under wraps the images that he believes indicated the spill was much bigger .
" We need to know what 's coming at us , " he told ABC News .
" You know , we are Americans , we respond to threats .
Do n't sugarcoat it .
Tell us the truth and we 'll do the best we can .
And I think that 's exactly what did n't happen here .
The government , I 'm sorry to say has been behind the information curve every step in this process . "
CLICK HERE to follow the ABC News Investigative Team 's coverage on Twitter .
Sen . Bill Nelson , a Florida Democrat , said the apparent suppression of the tapes prevented an independent analysis of how much oil was spilling , a move that might eventually save BP millions , since federal fines are based on $ 1,000 a day per barrel .
The difference between a spill of 5,000 barrels a day and 20,000 barrels a day is $ 15 million a day .
" It clearly tells us why they drug their feet to release these tapes , " Nelson said .
" I guess they were hoping that they could get it under control and this whole problem would go away . "

Nasenkorrektur
Nasenkorrektur Nasenkorrektur , ein paar wichtige Informationen
Hunderte Nasenkorrektur OPs werden von uns pro Jahr durchgeführt .
Auf unserer Webseite finden
Sie alle wichtigen Informationen wie Fotos , Preise , Bilder , Erfahrungen , Kosten und Finanzierung Ihrer Wunschoperation .
Die Nasenkorrektur ist neben der Brustvergrößerung und dem Facelift die älteste und am häufigsten durchgeführte Schönheitsoperation .
Die Nase hatte immer schon eine bedeutende Rolle .
In früheren Kulturen wurde zum Beispiel im Rahmen einer Strafe bei Verrat oder Ehebruch die Nase einfach abgeschnitten .
Da die Nase im Mittelpunkt des Gesichtes steht , ist die harmonische Verteilung von Länge und Größe ein wichtiger Parameter für das gesamte Gesicht .
Optimaler Weise sollte sie sich den übrigen Gesichtszügen anpassen und nicht als „ Blickfang “ dienen .
Stellt sie jedoch durch ihre außergewöhnliche Form oder übermäßiger Größe den Blickfang im Gesicht dar , so kann durch eine operative Nasenkorrektur bestmögliche Linderung erreicht werden .
Zumeist wird die Nase dabei verkleinert und gerade gerückt .
Nasenvergrößerungen sind eher selten aber prinzipiell möglich .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches Angebot anfordern .
Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Die Nase besteht aus knorpeligen und knöchernen Anteilen , die ein flexibles Stützgerüst unter der bedeckenden Nasenhaut bilden .
In der Mitte befindet sich die Nasenscheidewand .
Bei Nasenkorrekturen gilt es , dieses Gerüst so umzugestalten , dass sich die äußere Form der Nase durch die darüberliegende Haut positiv verändert .
Ziel der operativen Nasenkorrektur ist es , die Nasenform und / oder Größe so zu verändern , dass die Proportionen zwischen Stirn , Nase und Kinn ein Gleichgewicht darstellen .
Auch kann eine Verkrümmung der Nasenscheidewand zu einer erschwerten Nasenatmung führen und aus diesem Grund eine Operation erforderlich werden .
Die ästhetische Nasenkorrektur kann aus medizinischen ( Nasenscheidewandverkrümmung ) oder aus ästhetischen ( Höckernase , Knollennase , schiefe Nase etc. ) Gründen durchgeführt werden .
Von jedem Menschen wird die Nase genau betrachtet , da diese in der Mitte des Gesichtes sitzt .
Jede Veränderung von Form oder Größe wird somit sofort bemerkt und führt auch zu einer optischen , veränderten Persönlichkeit .
Die Nasenkorrektur ist erst nach dem Abschluss des Wachstums möglich , also nicht vor dem 17 .
Lebensjahr .
Sollte die Operation erst in höherem
Alter stattfinden , ist mit verzögerter Heilungsphase zu rechnen , da das Gewebe weniger anpassungsfähig und elastisch ist .
Die Genesungszeit beginnt direkt nach der Nasenkorrektur .
Ein guter Heilungsverlauf ist nur mit Ihrer Hilfe möglich und erfordert ein wenig Geduld .
Das endgültige Ergebnis kann spätestens nach einem Jahr beurteilt werden .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches Angebot anfordern .
Ein paar Tips Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Hauptaufgabe der Nase ist das Anfeuchten der Atmungsluft , die Funktion als Riechorgan und die Regulierung der Luftzufuhr .
Bei der Nasenkorrektur muss man alle Funktionen der Nase in seinen Operationsplan miteinbeziehen .
Bei der Planung der Operation ist die Funktion der Nase und der Wunsch des Patienten genau zu besprechen und berücksichtigen .
Es darf nicht der Fall sein , dass die Nasenkorrektur eine „ Einheitsnase “ wird .
Jeder Patient möchte „ seine ganz persönliche Nase “ , welche optimal zu ihm und seinem Gesicht passt .
Die Nasenkorrektur ergibt fast nie sichtbare Narben , denn die Nase wird dabei komplett von innen operiert .
Nicht selten steht eine missgeformte Nase im Mittelpunkt erhöhter Aufmerksamkeit .
Bei manchen Menschen führt dies zu psychischen Belastungen ( auch und im Besonderen bei Kindern ) .
Dem ist nicht jeder gewachsen .
Die Nasenkorrektur ermöglicht es die Form der Nase so zu verändern , das der Träger sich eher mit ihr identifizieren kann und die Angst verliert , sie im täglichen Leben zu zeigen .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches Angebot anfordern .
Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Die genaueste Planung der Nasenkorrektur mit Ihrem Operateur ist eine der wichtigsten Voraussetzungen für Ihre Zufriedenheit .
Die Nase ist ein lebenswichtiger und markanter Teil von Ihnen .
Das ( bei femmestyle kostenlose ) Beratungsgespräch , wo der genaue Operationsablauf und Ihre Wünsche besprochen werden , ist ein absolutes Muss .
Die Nase sollte nach einer Korrektur vollkommen natürlich aussehen , harmonisch zu Ihrem Gesicht passen und die Funktion muss dabei erhalten oder verbessert werden .
Bei schon voroperierten oder sehr stark verformten Nasen kann auch ein zweiter Eingriff erforderlich werden .
Das erfordert einen sehr erfahrenen Chirurgen , welcher über viel Einfühlungsvermögen verfügt .
In unserer Klinik werden für diese Operationen zusätzlich Spezialisten hinzugezogen , um ein optimales Ergebnis zu erreichen .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches Angebot anfordern .
Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der operativen Nasenkorrektur
Tipps für die Zeit vor der Operation :
Vor der Operation müssen blutverdünnende Medikamente ( ThromboAss , Aspirirn ) abgesetzt werden .
Diese können zu stärkeren Blutungen führen .
Das Rauchen sollte ebenfalls zwei Wochen vor einer geplanten Operation stark eingeschränkt werden , um den Heilungsverlauf nicht negativ zu beeinflussen .
Direkt vor der Operation wird die Nase von Ihrem Operateur genau vermessen und angezeichnet .
Das garantiert den exakten Operationsverlauf .
Sollten Silikonimplantate benötigt werden , müssen diese für Sie angefertigt werden .
Am häufigsten wird die Schnittführung an der Innenseite der Nase gelegt , somit sind nach der Operation keine Narben zu sehen .
Es kann sowohl das knöcherne , als auch das knorpelige Nasengerüst optimal korrigiert werden .
Sollte die Atmung bei Ihnen beeinträchtigt sein , wird auch die Begradigung der Nasenscheidewand erforderlich sein .
Hier können Sie Ihr persönliches Angebot anfordern .
Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Direkt nach der Operation wird ein stützender Verband oder Gipsschiene zur Stabilisierung der operierten Nase angelegt .
Die Nase ist meistens für 1 - 2 Tage noch zusätzlich tamponiert .
Aufstehen ist direkt nach der Operation ( mit Begleitung ) möglich .
Die Schlafposition sollte die ersten
Tage mit erhöhtem Oberkörper sein .
Die Tamponade und der Verband sollten von Ihrem Operateur gewechselt und entfernt werden .
Nach der Entfernung der Schiene kann es hilfreich sein , in der Nacht noch zusätzlich stützende Pflaster zu verwenden .
Nach der Operation kann es zu Schwellungen oder Blutergüssen kommen , welche aber nach ca. 14 Tage nicht mehr sichtbar sind .
Nach der Nasenoperation sind schwere Komplikationen nicht zu erwarten .
Bei sehr großen Deformationen kann eine zweite Korrektur erforderlich werden .
Die Nasenkorrektur selbst dauert nicht lange .
Bei normalen Eingriffen sollten
Sie mit höchstens 2 Stunden rechnen , bei komplizierten Eingriffen dauert es ein wenig länger .

Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Welche Risiken bestehen bei einer Nasenkorrektur ?
Wie bei jeder Operation sind Blutungen , Wundinfektionen , Wundheilungsstörung und Narbenbildung nicht auszuschließen .
Diese sind aber sehr selten und können sofort und erfolgreich behandelt werden .
Bei starken Rauchern , Diabetikern und Patienten mit chronischen Erkrankungen ist die Gefahr der Wundheilungsstörung höher .
Nach der Entfernung der Tamponade kann es zu einer Krustenbildung kommen , welche nur von Ihrem Arzt gereinigt oder entfernt werden sollte .
Ein Taubheitsgefühl in der ersten Zeit klingt mit der ev. vorhandenen Schwellung ebenfalls ab .
Ein leichtes Nasenbluten in den ersten Tagen ist völlig normal .
Durch die Schwellung kann es am Anfang zu einer eingeschränkten Nasenatmung kommen und Sie haben das Gefühl , dass Sie schwerer Luft bekommen .
Diese Symptome verschwinden ebenfalls mit dem Abschwellen der Nase .
Die erste Zeit sollten
Sie sich körperlich Schonen , keine ruckartigen Bewegungen und die Nase vor Druck oder Spannungen bewahren .
Der gesamte Heilungsverlauf könnte dadurch beeinträchtigt werden .
Make - up können
Sie nach dem Abheilen ( 2 Wochen ) wieder auflegen .
Direkt Sonneneinstrahlung oder Solarium wäre für 4 - 6 Wochen zu vermeiden .
Wichtiger Tipp für Brillenträger :
Direkt nach der Operation verändert sich die Nase noch ( abklingende Schwellungen ) .
In dieser Zeit können Sie eine Brille mit Spezialbügel tragen .
Diesen erhalten sie bei Ihrem Optiker auf Bestellung .
Die Brille sollte aber nicht zu lange am Tag getragen werden , um Druckstellen zu vermeiden .
Sie sollten erst 2 - 3 Wochen nach der Operation eine neue Brille anpassen lassen , wenn die letzte Brille nicht mehr passt .

Ein paar Tips und Tricks für die Zeit nach der Nasenkorrektur
Wie wird Behandlungserfolg nach einer Nasenoperation sein ?
In den meisten Fällen lässt sich mit der Nasenkorrektur die Form der Nase deutlich verbessern und die Patienten verlassen zufrieden die Klinik .
Da die Nase nach Abnehmen des Verbandes meist noch etwas geschwollen ist , wird das endgültige Ergebnis erst nach einigen Monaten erkennbar sein .
Trotz des ausgedehnten Eingriffs klagen Patienten nach einer Operation meist kaum über Schmerzen .
Sollten Schmerzen auftreten , so sind diese mit geeigneten Medikamenten sehr gut behandelbar .

At first I thought this would be a hard case to prove .
I thought , how can Shirley Sherrod prove professional racist Andrew Breitbart selectively aired portions of that video with the intention of damaging her ?
But now that I 've had time to think about it , maybe I was setting the bar too high .
Maybe Sherrod only need demonstrate Andrew Brietbart 's malicious propensity to abandon all " journalistic " standards when " reporting " on black people who do n't happen to be Republicans .
Perhaps she 'll get professional racist James O'Keefe on the record to prove her case .
It should be fun .

Her biggest obstacle , I believe , will be his defense of " absence of malice " .
He will claim that he did not know the video was deceptive , and that he believed the video was true , all as a continuation of his " I did not edit the video - somebody gave it to me that way " shtick .
I would love to be on that jury to hear that defense .

Again , this is n't as simple as it looks .
If Sherrod is found to be a public offical , it will be very difficult for her to win .
This is by no means a slam dunk .
If she files , she may very well follow the footsteps of ACORN in Maryland .
File the suit for self - gratification , and then let it die .
While we are on the subject , what has happened in the Philly case ( Conway - Russell v. James E. O’Keefe III ) ?
Have the plaintiffs abandoned this one too ?

I doubt she can find the lawyers to take on Faux News also but their ADDITIONAL editing made the video appear even WORSE that what Brightscum posted on his website .
The good news for Ms. Sherrod is that she was a private citizen therefore the liable bar is somewhat lower .
She only has to prove that Faux acted with malice publishing the story .
Now running the story in and of its self would fall under the category of " news " however I would love to have a JURY decide if the Faux News 's EDITING of the tape constituted intent to defame .

What should sink Brightscum is the ADDITIONAL titling he , yes he , ADDED to the video he was " given " .
In that ADDITIONAL titling he made two substantial and material FALSE and DEFAMITORY claims .
HE said she acted as a government official to deny benefits , neither of which were true !
Now the most interesting part will be the determination of damages .
Given that she only lost her job for a matter of days and that the resulting publicity actually ENHANCED her reputation I ’m not sure she could collect the big pay day we all here at the Brad Blog think Brightscum deserves to pay for his total lack of ethics !

... Rvrctyrdnck said on 7/30/2010 @ 10:35 am PT ...
Faux
News can escape responsibility by saying that they were only " reporting " what Brightscum had posted and get off the hook entirely UNLESS it can be PROVED that they altered the video to present a DIFFERENT story than what Brightscum posted on Biggovt AND that that presentation was materially different AND was KNOWINGLY factually incorrect and / or done with malice .
Now the armchair lawyers out there like me would say that you do n't need to prove malice since she is a private citizen , however it is easier to prove malice in this case than it would be to PROVE that Faux News " should " have know that the comments were 180 degrees opposite from what she actually said .
News organizations are NOT required by CRIMINAL LAW to be accurate .
ONLY the consequences of CIVIL action require ANY media to be accurate !
And that my friends is why big media like Faux News and the small media like your home town Newspapers can get away with LYING and DEFAMATION on a regular basis .
Unless you have the $ ’s to hold them accountable they can do & say just about anything they want !

Using publicly available information on Facebook , a researcher has been able to gather personal details of nearly 170 million users of the service , or about a third of all users .
The data includes names , addresses , e-mails , phone numbers , and birthdays : essentially anything that was not marked as private is now part of this file .
The file has now ended up on The Pirate Bay , and so far has seen over 10,000 downloads .
This could mean hackers would have an easy way to obtain personal information necessary for identity theft and other malicious uses .
Skull Security researcher Ron Bowes was the man behind the work .
He did not hack into the service at all but rather scraped the data from Facebook 's open directory .
While it 's a violation of the social networking site 's terms of service , nothing is stopping anyone from doing it .

Bowes has decided to make the file a torrent , even though he acknowledged that the more info an attacker had on a person , the higher likelihood of a security breach .
His move is somewhat curious considering he arguably could be held liable for attacks as a result of his actions .
Even so , the incident could prove to be a wake up call for those sharing data on Facebook .
" I am of the belief that , if I can do something then there are about 1,000 bad guys that can do it too , " he told the BBC News Thursday .
" For that reason , I believe in open disclosure of issues like this , especially when there 's minimal potential for anybody to get hurt .
Since this is already public information , I see very little harm in disclosing it , " he argued .
Facebook Spokesperson Andrew Noyes told several media outlets that this was public information and no private information had been disclosed as a result of Bowes ' work .
The quick downplay of the data leak is probably due to the drubbing the social networking site has taken when it comes to privacy as of late .
To ensure that your own data is not at risk , users of Facebook should take the following steps .
Click on " Privacy Settings " under the Account menu option .
Ensure that information is not set for " Everyone " to view .
Alternatively , the user can also uncheck " Enable Public Search " which would take the account out of the directory Bowes used to do the data mining .
The Skull Security website was inaccessible as of Thursday afternoon .
Angle : DISCLOSE
Act already exists ( except it does n’t )
It was rejected by the Senate this week .
But here 's what Sharron Angle said to conservative talker Heidi Harris today ( audio at right ) :
Harris :
Interesting story , or I should say Op - Ed , in the Washington Post this morning , ‘ Where does Sharron Angle , what does Sharron Angle believe about campaign finance ? ’
The particular writer Greg Sargent said , ‘as best I can determine Angle has made no public statements directly about the DISCLOSE Act , which would place a host of new restrictions on the power of corporate money to influence our elections and force people who fund elections to reveal their roles . ’
What do you think about campaign finance regulations ?
Angle :
Well I think that the Supreme Court has really made their decision on this , they found that we have a First Amendment right across the board that was violated by the McCain - Feingold Act .
And that ’s what they threw out , was those violations .
The McCain - Feingold
Act is still in place .
The DISCLOSE Act is still in place .
It ’s just that certain provisions within that they found to be definitely violating the First Amendment .
If we did n’t have the DISCLOSE
Act there would be a lot of different things that people would n’t be able to find out .
And certainly you can go to FEC.gov and see where Harry Reid is getting most of his money from special interests .
Forecasts suggest that this year will see the amount of sea ice in the Arctic retreat to one of the lowest extents since satellite records began .
So what will be the impact of an Arctic devoid of sea-ice during the summer in the future ?
Science writer Richard Hollingham has joined a scientific expedition trying to find out .
Image caption Arctic sea-ice extent during recent summers has been on a downward trend
" It 's incredibly cold ! " to paraphrase the words of Heiko Moossen as he emerged from a dive hole in the ice .
" As I went in my whole face was burning because it was so cold . "
Mr Moosen , from the University of Glasgow , was diving under the ice to catch clumps of algae in a plastic bag .
" It was really hard because as you breathe out , the bubbles travel along the bottom of the ice and disturb the algae , " he explained .

That there is any plant life at all , a metre beneath the Arctic sea ice at 80 degrees North , is in itself remarkable .
" It looks like an inverted landscape with hills and valleys but with quite a lot of light coming through the ice , " he added .
The landscape above is every bit as beautiful : in the sunshine glistening ice floes stretch in every direction , separated by jagged ridges of ice and leads of gently rippling water .
Birds - including the almost perfectly white ivory gull - circle overhead , seals flop by the ice edge and , every day or so , a polar bear wanders by .
" I think it 's very , very beautiful and a very unusual place to be , " said expedition leader Ray Leakey from the Scottish Association for Marine Science ( SAMS ) .
" It 's also fascinating scientifically because we know so little about it .
Few expeditions come here so we 're among the first people . "
Locked in the ice
Even getting this far North - we are currently around 1,000 km from the Pole - has been a challenge .

Our ship , the James Clark Ross operated by the British Antarctic Survey , is specially designed for the Polar regions .
It has an ice strengthened hull and the ability to roll from side to side to break through or , if necessary , escape from the ice .
To reach this far we had to crunch our way through ice floes until we were completely surrounded .
The ship is now moored up against a sheet of ice around half - a- kilometre wide and less than a metre thick .
Diving is only one aspect of the work that 's been going on here .
The ice floe is dotted with experimental stations designed to investigate the biology , chemistry and physics of the ice .
The Polar regions act as thermostats for the planet , regulating its temperature .
The ice helps drive ocean currents and cools the Earth by reflecting heat back into space .
A team led by Ronnie Glud , also from the Scottish Association for Marine Science , has recently discovered another effect .
" The sea ice acts as a giant gas pump , " Professor Glud explained .
" It pumps carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the deep ocean - and it's on a large scale . "
He said his research was initially treated with scepticism but is now widely accepted .
" It 's a new insight we 're gaining into this and the implications have astonished and surprised us . "
The implication being that as the ice cover recedes , this pump will shut down and with it an important mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
Adapt or die
The plants and animals that live here are also at risk if the ice disappears , from microscopic creatures living in brine channels within the ice to the bears that roam across it .
Image caption Polar bears are not the only creatures facing an uncertain future Bears are great to look at but when you 're trying to do serious science on the ice they are a bit of a nuisance Dr Ray Leakey , Expedition leader
Many of the species that live here are unique and if this lid on the top of the world disappears , Dr Leakey warned that as well as the effect on the climate , the whole biology of the Arctic could change .
" You will get an easier flow of ocean currents between the Pacific and Atlantic and the possible transfer of organisms between the two , " he suggested .
" As the area warms up , you 'll also get more and more organisms trying to get into the Arctic - some will be successful and some wo n't but for the organisms living up here at the moment , it 'll be a case of adapt or die . "
The symbol for the changing Arctic is the polar bear .
In the nine days we 've been moored against the ice , we 've seen eleven bears .
They amble across the landscape in a smooth - almost rippling - movement , leaving no doubt who 's in charge .
Cream , rather than white in colour , they head towards the ship at no great speed .
Twice they 've tried to chew through our mooring lines and one tore open a metal box which had , a few days earlier , contained a couple of chocolate bars .
A sobering illustration of their sense of smell - a bunch of scientists would be easy prey .
" Bears are great to look at but when you 're trying to do serious science on the ice they are a bit of a nuisance , " said Dr Leakey .
Whenever anyone 's working out on the ice , two look - outs are posted on the top deck to keep an eye on the bears .
As an added precaution , each landing team carries flares and a gun , only to be used as a last resort .
" If a bear appears , we clear the ice ; the last thing we want to do is lose one of our scientists , " Dr Leakey explained .

Few vessels are designed to cope with the harsh Arctic conditions
An Arctic free of sea-ice in future summers is a very real possibility , studies have suggested .
But there 's much more at stake than polar bears .
It would affect the entire food chain from the microbes in the ice and the algae beneath , to the fish , seals and , yes , bears .
Without ice , the Earth 's ability to regulate its temperature would be reduced ; the sea ice pump , identified by Professor Glud and his team , will switch off ; and perhaps the ocean currents will change .
Other changes may be more positive : increases in fish stocks , new trade routes across the top of the world and the opportunity to exploit mineral resources .
As I look out of my porthole , blocks of ice are crushed against the side of the ship .
As they topple into the water they reveal a myriad of colours .
A jigsaw of floes , ice blocks and water channels blends into the mist .
Scientists are only now beginning to understand the Arctic , to uncover its secrets .
There is a lot more to this place than just ice .

Does Python 2.7's Release Mean the End of the Line for Python 2.x ?
The open source Python language is at a crossroads with two major versions available to developers .
The end of the road for the Python 2.x branch is now a little closer , with the release of Python 2.7 this week .
Python 2.7 is intended to be the last major Python 2.x release as the open source project aims to help developers migrate to the newer Python 3.x release codebase .
Python 3.x first hit general availability in December of 2008 .
Though the Python 2.x branch is now at the end of the line in terms of new releases , Python 2.x still has a lot of life left in it .
With Python 2.7 developers have backported a number of features from Python 3.1 , providing a lifeline for users of both versions of Python .
" The intention was to bind 2.x and 3.x as closely as possible to make porting easy , " Benjamin Peterson , the release manager for Python 2.7 , told InternetNews.com .
" Backporting features also help projects like 3to2 , which help people maintain 2.x and 3.x compatible codebases . "
In addition to the backported features from Python 3.1 , the Python 2.7 release will be supported for a longer period of time than a typical Python release .
Normally Python releases are supported by the project with bug and security fixes for up to two years .
But Peterson said the current plan for Python 2.7 is to offer support for up to five years .
The Python 2.7 release is n't the first time that the Python project has aimed to provide a bridge between the 2.x and 3.x releases either .
The Python 2.6 release , which came out in 2008 , was also intended to help smooth the transition from Python 2.x to 3.x .
Though the Python 3.x branch has been out for over 18 months at this point , the migration of Python 2.x users is still an ongoing process .
" Most people are still on 2.x , but are probably eyeing 3.x and considering their eventual porting plans , " Peterson said .
As to what the barriers to adoption are for current Python 2.x developers in moving to Python 3.x there are a few factors in play .
" It unfortunately seems to be a chicken and the egg problem , " Peterson said .
" Many developers are waiting for their dependencies to be ported .
There still is n't a WSGI ( Web Server Gateway Interface ) standard for 3.x yet , which is holding back Web framework developers .
Otherwise , I think there 's also a lack of motivation to port and maintain where there is n't much demand yet . "
While Python 2.7 is the last release of Python 2.x , the Python 3.x series is still in active development .
The first beta release of Python 3.2 is set for this October .

OAKLAND , Calif . -- Golden State Warriors owner Chris Cohan reached an agreement Thursday to sell the franchise for a record $ 450 million to Boston Celtics minority partner Joe Lacob and Mandalay Entertainment CEO Peter Guber .
" I am incredibly excited to have the opportunity to be the next steward of this storied NBA franchise .
This is my dream come true , " said Lacob , who is also the managing partner with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
" Peter and I intend to do what we do best -- innovating and building .
It is our passion to return the Warriors to greatness and build nothing short of a championship organization that will make all of us in the Bay Area proud . "
Lacob and Guber beat out three other finalists , including Oracle CEO Larry Ellison , who had been considered the favorite to buy the team from Cohan .
Ellison has a personal fortune of $ 28 billion , according to an annual survey by Forbes magazine , and is the sixth - richest man in the world .
He had been courted by Warriors fans at a game earlier this year to buy the struggling franchise , which has made the playoffs only once in the past 16 seasons .
Ellison said in a statement that he was surprised he did not win because he made the biggest offer .
" Although I was the highest bidder , Chris Cohan decided to sell to someone else , " he said .
" In my experience this is a bit unusual .
Nonetheless , I wish the Warriors and their fans nothing but success under their new ownership . "
Sal Galatioto , the president of Galatioto Sports Partners , which advised Cohan on the sale , said a handshake agreement with Lacob and Guber was agreed to about two weeks ago .
The team had four offers of at least $ 400 million at the time of the deadline .
While the two sides worked out the details , Ellison came back with what Galatioto described as a " marginally higher " offer just hours before the signing .
" He was way past the deadline , " Galatioto said .
" There was no way I was going to recommend that bid to Chris . ...
Once the shot clock expires , are you allowed to get back on the court and have it count ?
I do n't think so . "
A league source told ESPN.com's J.A. Adande that Ellison had no one to blame but himself .
" Everybody knows he can afford more than $ 450 [ million ] , " the source said .
" We all know Larry Ellison can buy any team in the league .
" If you know Larry Ellison as a businessman , if you see he paid $ 6 milion for a company it probably was worth $ 8 billion .
He does n't pay what people want . "
The bid from Lacob and Guber broke the record for the largest sale in league history , topping the $ 401 million Robert Sarver paid to buy the Phoenix Suns in 2004 .
The deal still needs to be approved by three - quarters of the NBA Board of Governors .
Lacob also must sell his interest in the Celtics .
Galatioto said he expects the deal to be finalized by the end of September .
Lacob , who has been a season - ticket holder for the Warriors , was part of the ownership group with the Celtics when they won their 17th championship two years ago .
He has also been involved in sports websites and was the primary investor in the women 's American Basketball League in venture capital .
Guber is a producer who helped bring movies such as " Rain Man , " " Batman , " " Flashdance " and " The Color Purple " to the screen .
In 1995 , he founded the Mandalay Entertainment Group with partner Paul Schaeffer , who will also be an owner of the team .
Mandalay has financed , produced and distributed numerous motion pictures including " Donnie Brasco , " " Enemy at the Gates " and " Seven Years in Tibet . "
Is it easy to intentionally write bad code ?
When you look at a lot of the software out in the industry is seems that the answer has to be ' yes . '
We 're surrounded by bad code , but that is n't the same thing as writing it intentionally .
In trainings and workshops over the past couple of months , I 've asked people to sit down and intentionally write the worst code that they can imagine .
A lot of it ends up being obtuse , with redundant and obscure calculations , but somehow it always seems to miss the mark - it 's not like the " bad code " that we typically encounter , and it 's worth wondering why .
Anyway , I offer this as a challenge to you .
Try to intentionally write the worst code that you can and see how you feel about it .
Notice how that code is different from bad code that you tend to see .
There 's a psychologist named Fritz Perls who coined something he called the ' Law of Paradoxical Intention . '
If you are blocked on something , try to do the exact opposite of what you are trying to do .
It turns out that there 's a lot you can learn about good design by intentionally trying to write bad code .
Just , please , do n't ever check it in .
If you do this kata , please post your results and reflections online .
I 'll be blogging reflections about what I 've learned so far soon .
Edit : I may have gotten this idea transitively from Jason Gorman .
I heard that he ran a ' bad code kata ' at a QCON conference last year .
Authorities fear at least 12 women may have been deliberately infected with the HIV virus by a Zimbabwe - born circus acrobat .
Australian citizen Godfrey Zaburoni , 31 , appeared in a Sydney court yesterday for an extradition hearing and is due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court today .
Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young urged any women who had had unprotected sex with Mr Zaburoni , who it 's been revealed once appeared on Australia 's Got Talent , to seek medical attention .
" We 're aware this gentleman has HIV and we understand he's had unprotected sex with quite a number of women across the country , so I 'm here today to ask any women who have had unprotected sex with this man to come forward and be tested , " she said .
A man accused of killing his three sons by driving them into a dam has told the Victorian Supreme Court he cannot explain why he left them trapped in the water and went to find their mother .
Robert Farquharson has taken the witness stand for the second day .
The 41 - year - old is being tried for the murder of his three boys .
They drowned when the car he was driving plunged into a dam near Winchelsea in the state 's south - west on Father 's Day in 2005 .
Prosecutors are continuing their cross-examination of Farquharson and have asked him why when he escaped from the car , he left the scene and went to find the boys ' mother .
" It was just something I had to do , I ca n't explain it , " he said .
" She 's the mother of my children and I wanted to tell her I had an accident . "
Farquharson told the court he was a very loving father .
The trial continues .

David Petraeus , the new commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan looks on during the Independence Day celebrations Saturday , July 3 , 2010 in Kabul , Afghanistan .
Petraeus arrived Friday night to assume command of the troubled international military mission in Afghanistan .
( AP Photo / Dusan Vranic ) KABUL , Afghanistan 
" We are in this to win , " Gen .
David Petraeus said as he took the reins of an Afghan war effort troubled by waning support , an emboldened enemy , government corruption and a looming commitment to withdraw troops -- even with no sign of violence easing .
Petraeus , who pioneered the counterinsurgency strategy he now oversees in Afghanistan , has just months to show progress in turning back insurgents and convince both the Afghan people and neighboring countries that the U.S. is committed to preventing the country from again becoming a haven for al - Qaida and its terrorist allies .
" We are engaged in a contest of wills , " Petraeus said Sunday as he accepted the command of U.S. and NATO forces before several hundred U.S. , coalition and Afghan officials who gathered on a grassy area outside NATO headquarters in Kabul .
Petraeus , widely credited with turning around the U.S. war effort in Iraq , said the Taliban and their allies are killing and maiming civilians -- even using " unwitting children to carry out attacks " -- in an attempt to undermine public confidence in the Afghan government and the international community 's ability to prevail .
" In answer , we must demonstrate to the people and to the Taliban that Afghan and international forces are here to safeguard the Afghan people , and that we are in this to win , " Petraeus said on the Fourth of July , U.S. Independence Day .
Continual discussion about President Barack Obama 's desire to start withdrawing U.S. forces in July 2011 has blurred the definition of what would constitute victory .
That coupled with the abrupt firing of Petraeus ' predecessor , a move that laid bare a rift between civilian and military efforts in the country , has created at least the perception that the NATO mission needs to be righted .
June was the deadliest month for the allied force since the war began , with 102 U.S. and international troops killed .
Progress in stabilizing Taliban strongholds in the south has been slow , support for the war is waning in the United States and allied nations , and doubts persist about the Afghan government 's willingness and ability to fight corruption .
" After years of war , we have arrived at a critical moment , " Petraeus said .
" We must demonstrate to the Afghan people -- and to the world -- that al - Qaida and its network of extremist allies will not be allowed to once again establish sanctuaries in Afghanistan from which they can launch attacks on the Afghan people and on freedom - loving nations around the world . "
Petraeus suggested he would refine -- or at least review -- the implementation of rules under which NATO soldiers fight , including curbs on the use of airpower and heavy weapons if civilians are at risk , " to determine where refinements might be needed . "
Some troops have complained that such restraint puts their own lives in danger and hands the battlefield advantage to the Taliban and their allies .
" Protecting those we are here to help nonetheless does require killing , capturing or turning the insurgents .
We will not shrink from that , " Petraeus wrote Sunday in a memo to his troops .
But he added when they got into tough situations , NATO must " employ all assets to ensure your safety , keeping in mind , again , the importance of avoiding civilian casualties . "
The rules aimed at protecting civilians were put in place under Petraeus ' predecessor , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who was dismissed last month for intemperate remarks he and his aides made to Rolling Stone magazine about Obama administration officials -- mostly on the civilian side .
Petraeus praised McChrystal early in his 10 - minute speech .
" The progress made in recent months -- in the face of a determined enemy -- is in many respects the result of the vision , energy and leadership he provided , " he said .
In an effort to move past the rifts between the civilian and military camps , Petraeus reiterated the message he delivered Saturday at the U.S. Embassy : " Cooperation is not optional . "
The new commander said everyone had worked hard during McChrystal 's tenure in Afghanistan to carry out an effective civilian - military counterinsurgency , one that Petraeus pioneered in Iraq .
Petraeus also sought to counter skepticism , even defeatism , that was on display last month during hearings in Washington when lawmakers challenged Pentagon assertions that progress was being made in the war .
He acknowledged the fight in Afghanistan has been grueling , but insisted progress had been made : 7 million Afghan children in school compared with fewer than 1 million a decade ago ; child immunization rates at 70 percent or higher ; new roads ; and bustling economies in several cities .
When announcing the 2011 target , Obama was careful to say any pullout decisions would be based on improved security .
Yet that caveat has often been forgotten .
Obama 's timetable has provided the Afghan government the impetus to implement reforms and bolster governance deeper into the provinces .
But it also fueled fears in Afghanistan that the U.S. commitment was fading in the almost nine - year - old war .

It 's yet another sign that Microsoft is no longer the biggest dog in the tech world :
Its executives are taking pot shots at competitors , but in a way that underscores the company 's own difficulties .
Speaking at the company 's Worldwide Partner Conference , chief operating officer Kevin Turner took aim at Apple over problems with the iPhone 4 .
" It looks like the iPhone 4 might be their Vista , and I 'm OK with that , " he said .
Windows Vista , of course , was the much - criticized and relatively unsuccessful version of Microsoft 's operating system that launched in 2007 .
Although the iPhone 4 has sold well and seen praise for many of its features , Apple too has faced complaints -- about the design of the antenna , which has been found to drop calls in certain circumstances .
It 's a problem that Mr. Turner could n't keep from pointing out when discussing Microsoft 's upcoming smartphone .
" You 're going to be able to use a Windows Phone 7 and not have to worry about how you 're holding it to make a phone call , " Mr. Turner told attendees .
He went as far as to say Apple 's misstep had him doing figurative " cartwheels . "
Two weeks ago RapidShare announced a change in the pricing scheme for their premium members .
Starting this month , account holders would 've been required to pay an amount based on their daily usage volume along with a requirement to skip between various packages to avoid overpayment .
This planned change resulted in a revolt among RapidShare users which forced the company to revisit its plans .
RapidShare has made several drastic changes to its service in the last months .
They began in March when it became apparent that the company was trying to get copyright holders on board in an attempt to convert pirates into paying customers .
A month later RapidShare ditched its CEO Bobby Chang on claims he was no longer the right person to successfully lead the company .
And in a continued effort to avoid the pirate site stigma , RapidShare killed its reward program and went after sites that infringed their trademark to facilitate illicit downloading .
Two weeks ago premium users of the file - hosting site were informed about another upcoming change that was set to go into effect this month .
RapidShare announced that it would stop the existing payment plans to introduce 5 new packages .
These new packages would have daily usage limits and users would have to switch between them according to their daily download demands .
The result was that most users would be worse off than with their current plans , or would be forced to switch back and forth between the various packages on a day - to - day basis .
Unsurprisingly , many premium users complained to RapidShare , urging the company to reconsider their offer .
“ As a result of the recent adjustments to our product and pricing model we have received a lot of feedback from our users , ” RapidShare communicated to its users yesterday .
“ There was also positive response but we want to be honest with you : most answers were negative . ”
“ With our adjustments we have alienated many users .
As a matter of course , that was not our intention .
Instead , it is our goal to introduce a system that gives our users more flexibility .
However , we are happy about every single user response that we have received as this is the only way we can learn what our users really want , ” the company added .
To accommodate the complaints of the revolting users , RapidShare changed its payment scheme to a simpler and much cheaper offer .
For less than 5 euros users can now buy 4 months of premium access with 10 GB storage and a 30 GB monthly data limit .
Heavy users can buy additional traffic and storage space if required .
The main benefit of the revised scheme , besides the fact that nearly every user will be better off , is the change from a daily limit to a monthly one .
Under the old scheme , users with the cheapest account had a 1 GB download limit that they would have to upgrade even though they might never go over the 30 GB a month .
With these changes RapidShare thinks that there wont be any future revolts from users over the new pricing scheme .
“ We are convinced that we will meet our users ’ needs with the new and simple model , ” the company said .

As Chris Hayes says . . .
This all seems eerily familiar .
The conversation — if it can be called that — about deficits recalls the national conversation about war in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
From one day to the next , what was once accepted by the establishment as tolerable — Saddam Hussein — became intolerable , a crisis of such pressing urgency that " serious people " were required to present their ideas about how to deal with it .
Once the burden of proof shifted from those who favored war to those who opposed it , the argument was lost .
thenation.com
Bold text added by the diarist
It does n't matter if the proof provided by the advocates of the Shock Doctrine disaster capitalism sucks and is skewed away from reality ( Al Qaeda is linked to Saddam because something something ) , what matters is that the people in power have already decided what to do , and any facts that can prove that they are wrong will be ignored , because as Ronny Reagan once said " facts are stupid things " .
The LIES ( WMD's , Deficits are the problem , Death Panels , Maverick ) , once accepted as gospel by the villagers and their uber - wealthy patrons shall no longer require second thought .
Anyone with proof of the fallacy of the gospel of the villagers will be ignored .
The burden of providing proof is never on the side of the people who push corporatist policies that harm everyone so the richest may profit .
And once the corporatist policies utterly fail everyone who was n't super rich already ( just like they are supposed to ) the same people who were dead wrong the first time will be right back telling you why they never saw it coming and their NEW idea is just what the doctor ordered .
More from Chris Hayes . . .
We are poised on the same tipping point with regard to the debt .
Amid official unemployment of 9.5 percent and a global contraction , we should n't even be talking about deficits in the short run .
Yet these days , entrance into the club of the " serious " requires not a plan for reducing unemployment but a plan to do battle with the invisible and as yet unmaterialized international bond traders preparing an attack on the dollar .
Perhaps the most egregious aspect of the selling of the Iraq War was its false pretext .
It never really was about weapons of mass destruction , as Paul Wolfowitz admitted .
WMDs were just " what everyone could agree on . "
So it is with deficits .
Conservatives and their neoliberal allies do n't really care about deficits ; they care about austerity — about gutting the welfare state and redistributing wealth upward .
That 's the objective .
Deficits are just what they can all agree on , the WMDs of this manufactured crisis .
Senator John Kyl of Arizona , speaking on Fox , has come out and admitted as much .
All new spending increases must be offset , he said , but " you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans . "
So there you have it .

Bold text added by the diarist
The deficits we have now were caused by the Bush / Cheney Administrations zeal for war profiteering , tax cuts for the richest among us and the rampant deregulation of Wall St that took place in the 90's ( thanks a ton , President Clinton ) .
Any solution to fixing the deficit that does NOT include ending the wars , taxing the rich and new regulations to keep the banksters from crashing the economy again is BULLSHIT .
As Grover Norquist once said " I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub . "
The way he will do that is by cutting taxes , creating deficits , cutting spending , wash , rinse , repeat .
Tax cuts CREATE deficits .
Deficits create the need to either raise taxes or cut spending , and we all know which one of those is taboo .
So the fix seems like it is in .
The # 2 Democrat in the House , Steny Hoyer has declared that " We could and should consider a higher retirement age , or one pegged to life span . "
Republican House Minority Leader John Boehner has declared " We 're all living a lot longer than anyone ever expected , " .
Boehner continued by saying " And I think that raising the retirement age — going out 20 years , so you 're not affecting anyone close to retirement — and eventually getting the retirement age to 70 is a step that needs to be taken . "
The # 2 Democrat in the Senate , Dick Durbinhas said " Bleeding Heart Liberals " Should Be Open to Medicare and Social Security Cuts .
House Speaker Pelosi stuck a rule in the war supplemental bill that passed earlier this month that would bind the House to accept Obama 's Deficit Commission if the Senate passes it , and Obama 's 18 member Deficit Commission is stacked with proponents of raising the retirement age and investing 20 % of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market .
So the fix looks like it is in .
The rich will keep their tax cuts , the wars will go on , and the serfs will just have to work another 5 years and retire at 70 in the name of " austerity " to pay off the deficits created by policies that only benefitted the richest among us .
Deficits ARE the new Weapons of Mass Destruction , free trade is the new Hoovernomics , and , apparently , main street is the new Baghdad .
Same Shock Doctrine , same old song and dance .

When I have a new art idea I always like to try it out in Mendocino , Ca .
I think Mendocino is the most beautiful place on the planet , so it is a good place to make streetart , everything looks good there .
I ” ve done enough yarnbombing in Mendocino that various businesses just ask me what I ’m doing this year .
Before I started the installation at the Good Life Cafe I did a little event at the Community Center and I had some cards in hand that people had already written what they are for in their politics .
I noticed in subsequent days that people were adding more writing of their own .
This was interesting , the interactive element was evolving .
Also people squeezed the pom poms as they went by .
I can see the Good Life pom poms from by bedroom window .
This is the way to do streetart .
I often wonder what people think of a given piece and now I can sit at my desk and draw and drink water and watch folks play with my pom poms .
The most recent piece I did was a big fall of pom poms at Oddfellows Gallery for a pop up art show called Art Pop .
I hung 18 strings of pom poms from the balcony of the building .
I tied them in units of 3 so they could blow with the wind .
I also hung some small strings inside in the window behind a pedestal .
I piled up a bunch of pom poms on the pedestal and put a stack of the cards there with some pens .
Well the gallery attendees went right to work writing .
I guess we all have a lot to say about politics at this point .
I kept putting out more cards .
After a few days I noticed people were tying the cards to the pom poms and arranging them .
This really touched me .
I like the idea that the audience makes the art .
I also liked walking down the street and seeing a building with pom poms floating up and down off it .
Somehow it seemed to relate to the movement of the ocean .

Classic Sports
Cars will never go out of style .
Best sports car or sports utility vehicles are craven by people from all over the world mostly due to the style and oomph quotient .
Sports cars score high on the glamour quotient and also deliver in terms of performance and driving .
Sports car has been patronized by people , especially the younger generation ever since sports cars were actually created .
Diamonds are forever they say , but to a sports car enthusiast , a classic sports car is forever and never goes out of style .
Sports cars are symbolic of the decades of glamour of Hollywood celebrities and music icons that made sure that particular models of sports cars actually never went out of style .
It is thanks to them that sports cars are patronized by people in the present day .
Young people who worshipped their icons from movies and rock concerts who zipped around in the sleekest sports cars possible always dreamt of owning a particular model of a classic sports car .
So when they grew up some of them actually realized their dream of owning classic cars and this trend ha been maintained to this day .
Classic sports cars can never go out of fashion thanks to celebrities who drove such cars and made them extremely popular , in fact iconic and unforgettable among the masses .
The popularity of a classic sports car is an undeniable fact .
Classic sports cars will basically never go out of style .
So what are the requirements for a car to be branded as a classic sports car ?
It definitely must be a sports car that is a sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) .
But aside from this very obvious qualification , a number of reasons and factor might qualify a car to be a classic sports car .
One of the most important reasons is sentimental value .
Thanks to sentimental value and also screen presence in a particular iconic moment of a movie and such cars are capable of attuning iconic status .
Case in point - the 007 Aston Martin that is driven by James Bond the iconic secret agent in the James bond movies .
The Aston Martin has acquired cult status among connoisseurs of cinema thanks to the immense popularity of the James Bond movies .
A classic sports utility vehicle thus cannot be defined in precise terms .
A number of classic sports utility vehicles are there in the present day which will actually almost never go out of style .
These cars are still produced in large numbers even if they are outdated and use outdated technology , and these cars have almost become collector ’s editions .
The cost of production of these cars might be high but despite all that they are still produced in large numbers and are sold in almost equally large numbers despite the new cars in the market .
These cars persist in the present day because of their sentimental value and the sentimental value of these cars is an undeniable fact that cannot be denied and is thus an undeniable fact .
A few of the best classic sports cars have been enumerated in the following list :
The Alfa Romeo Carabo
The Alfa Romeo iguana
The Alfa Romeo Disco Volante
The Aston Martin DB5
The Audi Avus Quattro
The BMW Nazca
The Daimler SP 250 Dart
The Ferrari Mythos
The Ford RS 200
The Ford GT90
The Ford GT70
The Jaguar XJ 13
The Jaguar SS 100
The Jaguar E Type
The Lamborghini Portofino
The Lamborghini 530 GTV
The Lamborghini Espada
The Maserati Ghilbi
The Maybach Exelero
The Mercedes Benz c Class c 111
The Mercedes Benz 300 SL
It is an undeniable fact that all of the above mentioned cars will never go out of style .
These cars are symbolic of an era gone by , decades of glory and glamour that will never come back again .
So people in a desperate effort to cling on to the days gone by have accepted that value that a classic sports car actually has and the fact that a classic sports car actually has the potential to never go out of style , ever .
The sentimental value of a classic sports car is an undeniable fact .
Classic sports cars have basically been immortalized on the big screen by a variety of fashion icons like - models , actors and actresses , rock artists and other celebrities .
The establishment of a car as a classic sports car does wonders for the brand or the motor car company or the automobile company that is engaged in the production of the classic sports car .
Their brand value gets boosted , and they witness a steep rise in sales which translates to amazing profits for the car company in question that is responsible for the creation of a classic sports car .
Once a sports car has attained iconic status the brand value increases by leaps and bounds .
Sharp increase in the sale of that particular car is witnessed along with the sharp increase in profits .
A sports car is basically an open car that is of low built and is extremely fast .
It can either be luxurious or even Spartan , but the most important parameter of a classic sports car in top notch driving performance and top notch mechanical performance .
A number of drivers think of name of the brand as well as the reputation of the brand and the history of the brand as a parameter to judge the classic sports car in question .
A Porsche , a lotus or even a Ferrari and even certain exotic brands of cars like Lamborghini are involved in the production of a classic sports car .
One definition is not enough for a good classic sports car .
Solar air conditioning could be more efficient and less expensive following new research being conducted in the UK and Australia .
Engineers from Warwick University will be helping a team at Australia ’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) develop materials for adsorption chillers , which are used for converting collected solar heat into cool air .
The project will focus specifically on developing novel desiccant materials for adsorbing water vapour .
Once developed the material will be coated onto a rotating part of the solar air - conditioning device , known simply as ‘ the wheel ’ .
Bob Critoph , a professor at Warwick ’s school of engineering , said most of the work will be conducted at CSIRO , where the technology will be patented .
It is later hoped the technology will contribute to the development of new higher - efficiency solar air - conditioning system with mass - market potential for commercial buildings .
‘ At the moment desiccant rotors are expensive bits of kit so if you could get a lower capital cost and efficient desiccant material onto this wheel that could increase its market potential , ’ he said .
Dr Stephen
White , who is leading the research at CSIRO , declined to give details about the technology being developed because patents have yet to be granted , but his research facility ’s website gives some indication of how it will work .
According to White ’s description , the system will take in outside air , dehumidify it and then evaporatively cool it in a way similar to how human skin is cooled by the evaporation of moisture from its surface .
A solar thermal collector – such as a solar hot - water panel or a parabolic solar trough – gathers heat from the sun and uses it to drive the desiccant dehumidifier .
The market for solar - cooling technology has room to grow .
A report by Solarnext , a German solar - cooling and heating system provider , states that , in 2006 , approximately 12 MW cooling capacity had been installed in Europe .
This works out to about 100 to 120 solar - cooling systems .
Germany has around 39.1 per cent of the systems , while Spain and Greece take up 27.5 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively .
One key reason these systems are not more popular , points out Roberto Fedrizzi , a solar - cooling expert from Italian research centre EURAC , is that upfront costs are too high .
An 8 kW adsorption solar - cooling system , he said , could cost as much as € 40,000 ( £ 33,000 ) .
While these systems save a significant amount on yearly electricity costs , Fedrizzi estimated that payback time without government incentives could be anywhere around 30 years .
Those involved in the Warwick and CSIRO project hope upfront expense will decrease as the market for solar - cooling technology matures and governments roll out incentives for investing in low - emission technology .

Michel Platini has been taken to hospital in Johannesburg after collapsing in a restaurant this evening .
It had initially been feared that the Uefa president had suffered a heart attack .
However , Uefa sources said he had fainted , having been suffering from flu for the past few days , and was in no danger .
Platini was dining at La Pagalle restaurant in Sandton when he keeled over at the table , knocking over a chair .
He was understood to be conscious but was kept in the Morningside Medi-Clinic , a private hospital , overnight for observation .
The 55 - year - old fell to the floor at around 8.15 pm UK time leaving his dining companions , who included the former Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and former Scotland coach Andy Roxburgh , calling for the emergency services .
Platini , the former France and Juventus midfielder , is a heavy smoker but had appeared in good health .
He was taken to hospital accompanied by Houllier and the long - standing Fifa media officer , Alain Leblang , and was later visited by the Fifa president , Sepp Blatter .
Houllier suffered a heart problem in 2001 , which kept him out of the game for six months .
The Uefa official William Gaillard said : " He is fine .
He had been suffering from a cold and a bit of flu and he fainted before eating in a restaurant .
He is still in hospital now undergoing tests but he is conscious and is fine .
It is not true that he has had a heart attack . "
Gaillard admitted he had not spoken directly to Platini but had received the information from a Uefa colleague , who had accompanied the Frenchman to the restaurant .
He added that the test results had shown up nothing serious .
" I talked to his assistant who was with him and it seems [ he was ] just fainting because he has a cold and a fever , " he said .
" All the preliminary exams are negative .
He 's conscious , he 's fine .
They may carry out more tests because , when a well - known person faints , they normally do that but I 've been told not to worry .
It 's nothing serious . "
On reports that Platini had suffered a heart attack , Gaillard added : " When people faint , people imagine the worst .
That 's a normal human reaction .
I talked to someone who told me not to worry .
Nothing serious .
These things happen .
" It 's cold there .
A lot of people have a cold , the flu , they have a fever .
That could explain it . "
Gaillard said he did not know whether Platini would be kept in hospital longer than overnight .
According to witnesses , Houllier in particular appeared concerned as paramedics attended to Platini , having suffered a heart problem himself earlier in his career .
In October 2001 , after falling ill at half - time in Liverpool 's Premier League match with Leeds United , the Frenchman was taken to hospital for an emergency operation when he suffered a dissected aorta .
The condition kept him out of the game for six months .
It ’s A Bird - It ’s A Plane - It ’s Comic - Con 2012 !
Summer in San Diego means warm beaches , beautiful weather , and masses of people walking around the Gaslamp Quarter in super - hero costumes .
Yes , ‘tis the season for San Diego Comic - Con International and with four days of events from art shows to a Masquerade Ball , there is no better place to be than Comic - Con International on July 12 - 15 , 2012 .
As the world ’s best comics and pop-culture convention , Comic - Con International in San Diego attracts comic fans from around the globe .
In 2012 , the San Diego Convention Center reached maximum capacity of over 130,000 attendees , all ready to meet their favorite artists and experience the phenomenon known as Comic - Con .
Last year the big event brought Twilight fans by the droves to catch a glimpse of their favorite Twi - hard couple , actors Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart .
They will be in attendance this year as well , but all eyes are on the upcoming movie , The Amazing Spider - Man , starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone .
Founded in 1970 , Comic - Con was originally a small event known as the Golden State Comic Book Convention .
With a meager 300 people in attendance , the original Comic - Con was held at the US Grant Hotel in Downtown San Diego .
As the convention gained in popularity and grew year after year , it eventually found its current home at the San Diego Convention Center in 1979 .
With the ever - present issue of overcrowding , Comic - Con has occasionally expanded into Downtown San Diego hotels such as the DoubleTree Hotel to help maintain such large numbers of attendees .
The focus of the original Comic - Con was initially on comic books as well as science - fiction / fantasy movies and TV shows , it has since grown immensely to feature an array of pop-culture facets ranging from anime to horror films .
Speaking of horror , steer clear of the streets of the San Diego Gaslamp Quarter on Saturday , July 14th unless you want to be engulfed in a mob of zombies .
The Zombie Walk has sprung out of the festivities of San Diego Comic - Con and every year hundreds of zombie - clad Comic - Con fans take to the streets of San Diego displaying their best undead saunter .
It ’s a sight you do n’t want to miss as the Gaslamp Quarter is transformed into the set of a zombie horror film at 5 pm starting at Horton Plaza and ending at the San Diego Convention Center .
San Diego Comic - Con International ’s growing success and popularity has raised some concerns and many have questioned , “ Has Comic - Con outgrown San Diego ? ”
With tickets selling out every year and the capacity of the San Diego Convention Center maxing out , the idea of moving locations is constantly looming in the background .
The Gaslamp Quarter provides convenience , beauty and a vibrant setting for Comic - Con , and the organizers do not want to lose these qualities .
So for now , Comic - Con will remain in “ America ’s Finest City . ”
With the San Diego International Airport just four miles away and a surplus of great San Diego hotels and restaurants within walking distance to the event , San Diego is the ideal location and the birthplace of Comic - Con International .
For visitors coming into town , bags packed with their favorite super - hero duds , the Gaslamp Quarter has plenty of perfect hotels close to the Comic - Con action .
The original home of Comic - Con , the US Grant Hotel , is just a few short blocks away and is a great place to stay and celebrate the start of this world - renowned event .
The boutique style , LEED Certified Hotel Indigo or the San Diego Marriott Gaslamp are also great options that are close enough to park your car and walk the weekend away in Downtown San Diego .
With so many neighboring hotels , restaurants , and nightlife venues , the San Diego Gaslamp Quarter makes Comic - Con an event the whole city can enjoy .
For those visitors who were n’t lucky enough to snag one of the sold - out tickets for Comic - Con San Diego , do n’t fret , the Gaslamp Quarter is Comic - Con central during the event and a great place to people watch and interact with the crowd .
Trendy San Diego is infiltrated with costumes and comic - lovers for four fun days in San Diego .
Whether you are attending the event or enjoying the Comic - Con festivities while sipping a cocktail at your favorite Gaslamp Quarter hangout , the city transforms into Comic - Con mania each year making it a must - see for anyone lucky enough to be in the area .
What started as a modest comic - book event in Downtown San Diego has flourished to become the 4th largest Comic Convention in the world !
San Diego Comic - Con International is four days of non -stop excitement and a chance to bring the comic loving world together in one amazing place , the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego !
Facebook data harvester speaks out By Daniel Emery
Technology reporter , BBC News Published duration 29 July 2010
image caption
The torrent is attracting hundreds of downloads
The man who harvested and published the personal details of 100 m
Facebook users has spoken out about his motives .
Ron Bowes , a Canadian security consultant , used a piece of code to scan Facebook profiles , collecting data not hidden by users ' privacy settings .
The list , which contains the URL of every searchable Facebook user 's profile , name and unique ID , has been shared as a downloadable file .
Mr Bowes told BBC
News that he did it as part of his work on a security tool .
" I'm a developer for the Nmap Security Scanner and one of our recent tools is called Ncrack , " he said .
" It is designed to test password policies of organisations by using brute force attacks ; in other words , guessing every username and password combination . "
By downloading the data from Facebook , and compiling a user 's first initial and surname , he was able to make a list of the most common probable usernames to use in the tool .
The three most common names , he found , were jsmith , ssmith and skhan .
In theory , researchers could then combine this list with a catalogue of the most commonly used passwords to test the security of sites .
Similar techniques could be used by criminals for more nefarious means .
Mr Bowes said his original plan was to " collect a good list of human names that could be used for these tests " .
" Once I had the data , though , I realised that it could be of interest to the community if I released it , so I did , " he added .
Mr Bowes confirmed that all the data he harvested was already publicly available but acknowledged that if anyone now changed their privacy settings , their information would still be accessible .
" If 100,000 Facebook users decide that they no longer want to be in Facebook 's directory , I would still have their name and URL but it would no longer , technically , be public , " he said .
Mr Bowes said that collecting the data was in no way irresponsible and likened it to a telephone directory .
" All I 've done is compile public information into a nice format for statistical analysis , " he said
Simon Davies from the watchdog Privacy International told BBC News it was an " ethical attack " and that more personal information had not been included in the trawl .
" This is a reputational and business issue for Facebook , for now , " he said
" They can continue to ride the risk and hope nothing cataclysmic occurs , but I would argue that Facebook has a special responsibility to go beyond doing the bare minimum , " he added .
Snowball effect
Mr Bowes ' file has spread rapidly across the net .
On the Pirate Bay , the world 's biggest file - sharing website , the list was being distributed and downloaded by thousands of users .
image caption Facebook hit its 500 m user in mid June 2010
One user said that the list showed " why people need to read the privacy agreements and everything they click through " .
In a statement to BBC News , Facebook confirmed that the information in the list was already freely available online .
" No private data is available or has been compromised , " the statement added .
That view is shared by Mr Bowes , who added that harvesting this data highlighted the possible risks users put themselves in .
" I am of the belief that , if I can do something then there are about 1,000 bad guys that can do it too .
" For that reason , I believe in open disclosure of issues like this , especially when there 's minimal potential for anybody to get hurt .
" Since this is already public information , I see very little harm in disclosing it . "
Digital trends
However , he said , it also highlighted a new trend that was emerging in the digital age .
" With traditional paper media , it was n't possible to compile 170 million records in a searchable format and distribute it , but now we can , " he said .
" Having the name of one person means nothing , and having the name of a hundred people means nothing ; it is n't statistically significant .
" But when you start scaling to 170 million , statistical data emerges that we have never seen in the past . "
A spokesperson for Facebook said the list was " similar to the white pages of the phone book .
" This is the information available to enable people to find each other , which is the reason people join Facebook . "
" If someone does not want to be found , we also offer a number of controls to enable people not to appear in search on Facebook , in search engines , or share any information with applications . "
Earlier this year there was a storm of protest from users of the site over the complexity of Facebook 's privacy settings .
As a result , the site rolled out simplified privacy controls .

Stars Just Got Bigger
A 300 Solar Mass Star Uncovered
Using a combination of instruments on ESO ’s Very Large Telescope , astronomers have discovered the most massive stars to date , one weighing at birth more than 300 times the mass of the Sun , or twice as much as the currently accepted limit of 150 solar masses .
The existence of these monsters — millions of times more luminous than the Sun , losing weight through very powerful winds — may provide an answer to the question “ how massive can stars be ? ”
A team of astronomers led by Paul Crowther , Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Sheffield , has used ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , as well as archival data from the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope , to study two young clusters of stars , NGC 3603 and RMC 136a in detail .
NGC 3603 is a cosmic factory where stars form frantically from the nebula ’s extended clouds of gas and dust , located 22 000 light - years away from the Sun ( eso1005 ) .
RMC 136a ( more often known as R136 ) is another cluster of young , massive and hot stars , which is located inside the Tarantula Nebula , in one of our neighbouring galaxies , the Large Magellanic Cloud , 165 000 light - years away ( eso0613 ) .
The team found several stars with surface temperatures over 40 000 degrees , more than seven times hotter than our Sun , and a few tens of times larger and several million times brighter .
Comparisons with models imply that several of these stars were born with masses in excess of 150 solar masses .
The star R136a1 , found in the R136 cluster , is the most massive star ever found , with a current mass of about 265 solar masses and with a birthweight of as much as 320 times that of the Sun .
In NGC 3603 , the astronomers could also directly measure the masses of two stars that belong to a double star system [ 1 ] , as a validation of the models used .
The stars A1 , B and C in this cluster have estimated masses at birth above or close to 150 solar masses .
Very massive stars produce very powerful outflows .
“ Unlike humans , these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age , ” says Paul Crowther .
“ Being a little over a million years old , the most extreme star R136a1 is already ‘ middle - aged ’ and has undergone an intense weight loss programme , shedding a fifth of its initial mass over that time , or more than fifty solar masses . ”
If R136a1 replaced the Sun in our Solar System , it would outshine the Sun by as much as the Sun currently outshines the full Moon .
“ Its high mass would reduce the length of the Earth 's year to three weeks , and it would bathe the Earth in incredibly intense ultraviolet radiation , rendering life on our planet impossible , ” says Raphael Hirschi from Keele University , who belongs to the team .
These super heavyweight stars are extremely rare , forming solely within the densest star clusters .
Distinguishing the individual stars — which has now been achieved for the first time — requires the exquisite resolving power of the VLT ’s infrared instruments [ 2 ] .
The team also estimated the maximum possible mass for the stars within these clusters and the relative number of the most massive ones .
“ The smallest stars are limited to more than about eighty times more than Jupiter , below which they are ‘ failed stars ’ or brown dwarfs , ” says team member Olivier Schnurr from the Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam .
“ Our new finding supports the previous view that there is also an upper limit to how big stars can get , although it raises the limit by a factor of two , to about 300 solar masses . ”
Within R136 , only four stars weighed more than 150 solar masses at birth , yet they account for nearly half of the wind and radiation power of the entire cluster , comprising approximately 100 000 stars in total .
R136a1 alone energises its surroundings by more than a factor of fifty compared to the Orion Nebula cluster , the closest region of massive star formation to Earth .
Understanding how high mass stars form is puzzling enough , due to their very short lives and powerful winds , so that the identification of such extreme cases as R136a1 raises the challenge to theorists still further .
“ Either they were born so big or smaller stars merged together to produce them , ” explains Crowther .
Stars between about 8 and 150 solar masses explode at the end of their short lives as supernovae , leaving behind exotic remnants , either neutron stars or black holes .
Having now established the existence of stars weighing between 150 and 300 solar masses , the astronomers ’ findings raise the prospect of the existence of exceptionally bright , “ pair instability supernovae ” that completely blow themselves apart , failing to leave behind any remnant and dispersing up to ten solar masses of iron into their surroundings .
A few candidates for such explosions have already been proposed in recent years .
Not only is R136a1 the most massive star ever found , but it also has the highest luminosity too , close to 10 million times greater than the Sun .
“ Owing to the rarity of these monsters , I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon , ” concludes Crowther .
Notes
[ 1 ]
The star A1 in NGC 3603 is a double star , with an orbital period of 3.77 days .
The two stars in the system have , respectively , 120 and 92 times the mass of the Sun , which means that they have formed as stars weighing , respectively , 148 and 106 solar masses .
[ 2 ]
The team used the SINFONI , ISAAC and MAD instruments , all attached to ESO ’s Very Large Telescope at Paranal , Chile .
[ 3 ] ( note added on 26 July 2010 ) The " bigger " in the title does not imply that these stars are the biggest observed .
Such stars , called red supergiants , can have radii up to about a thousand solar radii , while R136a1 , which is blue , is about 35 times as large as the Sun .
However , R136a1 is the star with the greatest mass known to date .

On Wednesday the full bench of the High Court will hear a case which will decide whether tens of thousands of Australians get to vote or not on August 21 .
The advocacy group GetUp ! is challenging the constitutional validity of changes the Howard government made to the Electoral Act in 2006 .
Before 2006 , voters had seven days after an election was called to enrol to vote .
When the new laws came in the rolls shut on the day the election writs were issued .
GetUp ! is arguing that these changes have eroded the voting rights of over 100,000 Australians .
And if you look at enrolment figures , they do have a point .
During the 2004 campaign 157,311 people enrolled to vote after the election was called .
In this year 's campaign that figure declined to 85,996 with voters only having one working day to enrol after the election was announced .
These numbers do n't count those who 've tried to change their enrolment details in the same period .
So why did the Coalition government change the laws in the first place ?
John Howard said at the time it was about " maintaining the integrity of the roll " and that there was " plenty of evidence " of rorting of the rolls .
In 2007 , I asked Gary Nairn , the minister responsible for the electoral laws if he could give me some evidence of vote rigging in the close of rolls period .
He could n't provide any , saying , " But there 's no evidence that there has n't been as well " .
But before these laws were introduced the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) had done plenty of research .
Following allegations of voter fraud , the AEC scrutinised all the federal elections between 1990 and 2000 .
In a period in which around 60 million votes were cast across four elections and one referendum , they found only 71 cases of electoral fraud .
Most of these cases were considered to be mistakes or too frivolous to lead to prosecution .
If there was any evidence of vote rigging in the close of rolls period , the AEC did n't find it .
Instead they found " There were no cases that disclosed any organised conspiracy against the Electoral Roll for federal electoral purposes " .
So why change the laws ?
At the time , critics suggested it was a cynical attempt by the Coalition to reduce the amount of young people on the roll .
The conventional wisdom is that first time voters are more likely to vote Labor .
At a speech to the Sydney Institute in 2005 , Senator Eric Abetz dismissed these claims .
Quoting a study of the 2004 election by Professor Clive Bean , Senator Abetz said that 41 per cent of under 25s gave their primary vote to the Coalition and only 32 per cent voted Labor .
These figures were accurate , but Senator Abetz neglected to mention that 17 per cent also voted Green , with the majority of their preferences flowing back to Labor .
In a Roy Morgan poll of 18 - 24s conducted last week Labor was polling 62.5 per cent in two - party preferred terms .
In June , Labor tried to reform the electoral laws .
A bill designed to change the close of rolls period back to seven days passed through the House of Representatives .
But it never made it through the Senate .
The bill had the support of the Greens and Independent Senator Nick Xenophon , but was opposed by the Coalition .
The bill 's passage was in the hands of Senator Steve Fielding .
Senator Fielding gave no undertaking which way he would vote , and Labor failed to introduce it to the Senate .
The failure to pass this bill has meant that people like Shannen Rowe are n't able to vote at this election .
Shannen is an 18 - year - old student from South Australia .
She is one of the plaintiffs in GetUp !'s High Court challenge .
Shannen filled out an enrolment form on Monday July 19 and was planning to drive to her local AEC office before the rolls shut .
But like many students , she was short on cash and petrol , and did n't have enough in the tank to get her to the nearest AEC .
Shannen Rowe did n't lodge her enrolment form till later in the week .
Shannen and others like her should have enrolled to vote earlier .
But not every 18 - year - old is great with deadlines , and not all of them are the kind of political nerds who enrol to vote the minute they turn eighteen .
If our independent electoral commission can't find any evidence of vote rorting in the old seven - day close of rolls period , surely we should go back to that system .
We should be doing all we can to encourage young people to participate in our democratic system , not finding ways to rub out their votes .
In 1951 , when the Soviet Union was on its high , authorities had an idea of building special floatation devices for tanks .
First sample workpieces for T - 54 tank were made at in 1952 , and , some several weeks later tests were carried out on the Oka river .
In the next two years trial test at the sea were conducted .
And in 1957 , eventually , the floatation device was passed into service .
There were supposed to be as many as 187 ( according to the amount of tanks ) floatation devices on the strength of the motor rifle division .
Along with that working activities of building floatation devices for T - 55 and 3SU - 57 - 2 tanks were lead .
In 1959 at plants №342 and № 174 there were working activities of commoning of floatation devices carried out .
In 1960 , an upgraded floatation device PST - U ( universal one ) was put into service .
PST - U consisted of five pontoons that were filled with plastic foam .
Total weight of the device was 10 tonnes .
Buoyancy reserve ( with T - 54 tank ) was 40 % .
Maximum speed of tank with the floating device was 19 km/h ashore and 12 km/h afloat .
The floating device was equipped with its own fuel tanks with a capacity of 500 litres ; equal to coverage of 60 - 80 kilometers distance without any tank ’s fuel consumption .
Water obstacles traverse could be done with sea disturbance of 5 points and tank gunnery with 1.5 points .
Together with tank it was possible to carry a landing troops crew of 25 people ( 40 for 3SU - 57 - 2 ) though gunnery with the crew aboard was prohibited .
A floatation device mounting could be carried out in as less as 35 minutes and its release was performed in no time at all .
PST - 54 floatation device was carried by four ZIS - 151 trucks .
In 1962 there were test of light - weighted floatation device PS - 1 for T - 55 carried out .
Its total weight was 5.5 tonnes , its maximum speed was 13.7 km/h afloat and 25 km/h aground while it could cover up to 100 kilometers .
The floatation device was carried by two trucks .
After it lots of new tests were performed and many different upgraded kinds of floatation devices ( some of them for heavy tanks ) were constructed .
In the end of 1950 ’s there was engineering of high - velocity landing floatation devices with underwater wings commenced .
The floatation device comprised two motor boats ( with displacement of 12 tonnes each ) which helped to boost speed of a waterborne vehicle to 30 knots .
Every motor boat had engine with 1000 hp/h .
First prototypes were made in 1961 .
In 1967 - 1968 two production prototypes passed tests and mass production began .
The Baltic and the Black Sea region battalions were equipped with these floatation devices right away .

The Utah Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned the rape - as - an - accomplice conviction of Warren Jeffs , the prophet and leader of a polygamist sect based on the Arizona - Utah border , leaving his fate in the legal system uncertain .
In a unanimous decision , justices found that jurors in the case were given improper instructions by Washington County Judge James Shumate before reaching their verdict that Jeffs contributed to the 2001 sexual assault of teenage victim Elissa Wall , then 14 , by directing her marriage to an adult cousin .
Jeffs , 54 , once was listed among the FBI 's most wanted fugitives , and faced criminal prosecutions related to child rapes in three states .
Because Mohave County prosecutors dismissed the Arizona charges against Jeffs in June , the Supreme Court decision in Utah could mean the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints faces only remaining criminal charges in Texas .
Brian Filter , senior deputy in the Washington County Attorney 's Office , said no determination has been made on whether Jeffs will be retried .
" We 've just gotten the opinion .
It 's lengthy and obviously very complicated , " Filter said .
" From the beginning , we 've sought justice in this case , and that 's what we 'll continue to do . "
The ruling stunned former FLDS church member Flora Jessop of Phoenix , who wept over the phone as she denounced the court 's findings : " I think the Supreme Court of Utah just raped Elissa Wall , and I wonder who 's going to prosecute that case , " said Jessop , who was abused before she fled the sect at age 16 .
" Anybody with kids should move out of Utah and Arizona because there 's not justice here .
It 's a betrayal of all of us � every child victim �
It just sickens me . "
By contrast , Jeffs ' Utah attorney , Walter Bugden Jr. , said it was " thrilling " to see justices uphold the rule of law by vindicating a man who has been vilified in Utah and nationwide .
Noting that the FLDS sect is an unsanctioned offshoot from the mainstream Mormon church , which renounced polygamy more than a century ago , Bugden said : " The Utah Supreme Court was willing to exonerate a religious figure who is very unpopular in this state .
That 's the truly exciting part �
It 's a significant decision because of Utah 's religious roots . "
Bugden said the criminal case in Utah was based on a flawed legal theory designed to convict Jeffs on charges that would result in the maximum punishment .
The Supreme Court found that Judge Shumate incorrectly advised jurors that they could find Jeffs guilty as an accomplice to rape based on the notion that his authority and marriage ceremony led to the sexual assault , regardless of whether that was his intention .
Bugden said he believes
Utah will be forced to drop charges not only because new jury instructions will make a successful prosecution almost impossible , but because of evidence developed by defense lawyers in Arizona which has undermined Wall 's credibility .
" I think they'd have immeasurable problems , " Bugden said .
Michael Piccarreta , Jeffs ' Arizona lawyer , said charges in Mohave County were dismissed in part because the alleged victim had conspired with a midwife to create false medical records of a miscarriage .
While the medical document itself was not a vital to conviction , Piccarreta said , " fabricated evidence " and Wall 's testimony in the Utah court would damage her believability in future proceeding .
" The Utah case is now effectively dead , " Piccarreta said .
" There is no evidence that Mr. Jeffs intended anyone at any time to engage in the rape of anyone . "
Wall , co-author of a book titled " Stolen Innocence , " could not be reached for comment .
Her attorney was unavailable .
Gary Engel , a Mohave County investigator who has worked on the FLDS issues for several years , disputed Piccarreta 's allegation against Wall , saying , " She did n't fabricate anything . "
The FLDS church , once estimated to have 10,000 members , holds that plural marriage is ordained by God and essential to achieving the highest level of salvation .
Church members claim that polygamy , including the assignment of child brides , are acts of religious freedom protected by the U.S. Constitution .
Nearly a decade ago , attorneys general in Arizona and Utah began investigating child marriages in Colorado City - Hildale , twin communities on the two states ' border , as well as allegations of financial fraud , the banishing of young males and other issues .
At least a half - dozen sect members have been convicted of felonies related to sexual conduct with minors .
Church - operated schools were shut down .
Most of the property in Colorado City - Hildale , controlled by an FLDS trust , was turned over to a court - appointed trustee .
A number of Colorado City police officers were stripped of law enforcement certification .
The arrest and conviction of Jeffs was viewed as the culminating event in that campaign .
Now , Piccarreta and Bugden said , it appears Texas is the only remaining venue where Jeffs could be convicted , and charges there also are problematic .
The 2008 investigation in Eldorado , Texas , was launched after a deranged woman made a series of fraudulent phone calls to authorities , claiming to be a pregnant teenage abuse victim imprisoned within the FLDS Yearning for Zion Ranch .
In arguing to preclude evidence from the ranch in Jeffs ' Mohave County case , Piccarreta said Texas authorities knew or should have known that the phone call was bogus .
Instead of debunking the woman 's distress calls , he said , Texas Rangers obtained a search warrant and raided the FLDS community with " legions of officers , helicopters and a tank . "
More than 400 people were rounded up , with children temporarily removed from their parents .
Jeffs was charged with having sex with an underage bride , but Piccarreta said the case hinges on evidence gathered during the questionable raid .
" The search is one of the top 10 in U.S. history in terms of being unconstitutional and illegal , " he said .
" Unless they can use the fruits of their illegal search , they cannot successfully prosecute Mr. Jeffs .
I think this is a real test for the judicial system in Texas . "
Jeffs , now incarcerated in Utah , was serving two sentences of five years to life .
An extradition hearing scheduled Tuesday was cancelled after the Utah conviction was overturned .
Carolyn Jessop , a former sect member who testified for Texas prosecutors in six convictions of FLDS men for sexual abuse of children , described the Utah ruling as " terribly discouraging . "
Jessop , who authored " Triumph : Life after the Cult , " a book about her escape from the FLDS sect , said she is confident Jeffs will be found guilty in Texas , even if there is no retrial in Utah .
In the meantime , she said , the Utah decision will empower FLDS leaders in their resolve to continue arranging marriages with underage children .
" I do n't think they have any intention of stopping , " she said .
" They strongly believe that God is on their side . "
People will be encouraged to work longer under government plans to phase out the so - called default retirement age of 65 by October 2011 .
Currently employers can make staff retire at 65 regardless of their circumstances , but ministers signalled this was set to change as people were living longer , healthier lives .
The proposal to phase out the default retirement age ( DRA ) is outlined in a consultation document , published today , which will run until October .
However , the government said bosses will still be able to operate a compulsory retirement age if they can " objectively justify it " .
The move to phase out the DRA is one of a number of measures the government is taking to help and encourage people to work for longer against the backdrop of demographic change .
Other steps include reviewing when the state pension age should increase to 66 and re-establishing the link between earnings and the basic state pension .
The business department said the consultation also proposes to help employers by removing the administrative burden of statutory retirement procedures .
A department spokesperson said : " With the DRA removed there is no reason to keep employees ' right to request working beyond retirement or for employers to give them a minimum of six months notice of retirement .
" Although the government is proposing to remove the DRA , it will still be possible for individual employers to operate a compulsory retirement age , provided that they can objectively justify it .
Examples could include air traffic controllers and police officers . "
The plans provoked a mixed reaction .
Campaigners welcomed the decision , but employers warned the removal of a default retirement age could make workforce planning more difficult .
Chris Ball , chief executive of The Age and Employment Network , called it a " win/win outcome " for employers , but warned that today 's move is only a first step .
" Many employers will need to adopt a totally new mindset , " Ball said .
" They will need to actively plan and assist workers to be able to go on contributing to the success of their organisations .
" This may mean adapting work practices and work places .
It will certainly mean providing opportunities to train or retrain and to work more flexibly , and , crucially , actually recruiting people in their 50s and 60s where they may not have done so in the past . "
Rachel Krys , campaign director of anti-ageism group the Employers Forum on Age ( EFA ) , said the default retirement age , which was created in 2006 , was a " dated and unfair system " .
" Its removal is simply common sense , " she said .
" With rising life expectancies , and people staying fitter for longer , it is archaic to assume that someone 's age is an indicator of the contribution they can make to the workplace .
" Employers have nothing to fear from this change .
This is an outdated policy and the removal of forced retirement is an opportunity to put policies and processes in place which make the most of an age - diverse workforce . "
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) , which has campaigned for many years to remove the DRA , said the " breakthrough " was " greatly encouraging " .
Dianah Worman , the CIPD 's diversity adviser , said : " Our research has shown that many employees wish to work past retirement for differing reasons and many employers are already benefiting from allowing such flexibility . "
The Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ) said the proposals will give employers little time to prepare and leave them with unresolved problems .
John Cridland , CBI deputy director - general , said : " Scrapping the DRA will leave a vacuum and raise a large number of complex legal and employment questions , which the government has not yet addressed .
Employers and staff will not know where they stand .
There will need to be more than a code of practice to address these practical issues ; we will need changes in the law to deal more effectively with difficult employment situations . "
David Yeandle , the Engineering Employers Federation 's head of employment policy , said : " Many manufacturers will be seriously concerned about this change in policy , which will make workforce planning more difficult .
" The proposed timetable also gives employers virtually little or no time to alter their policies and practices before such an important change in employment legislation is introduced .
" There is also a real danger that it could open a Pandora 's box with the onus being placed on employers to prove whether older employees are capable of continuing in their current role .
Inevitably , this could lead to employment tribunal cases from some older employees who have been dismissed rather than allowed to retire . "
' An artifical construct '
As a founder member of the EFA , Nationwide building society has been pushing hard for the DRA to be removed .
It has allowed employees to work past retirement up to the age of 70 since 2001 , once it realised many of its customers preferred to discuss their financial arrangements with older people .
In 2005 it raised that limit to 75 subject to employees passing what its HR director , John Whitehouse , describes as a " gateway test " .
" As long as people want to carry on working and there are n't any problems , we 're happy to let them do that , " he said .
" Since then I can't think of any example of us saying to staff , sorry we do n't want you to carry on . "
Out of an approximate 15,500 employees , Nationwide has 285 over the age of 60 working in all areas of the business .
Its oldest branch manager is 60 , while its oldest employee is a 76 - year - old lady who works part time in its Swindon call centre .
From an employer 's perspective , Whitehouse said Nationwide does have to think about issues like succession and benefits in a different way , " but they are not insurmountable things .
Arguably these are things companies should be doing anyway .
This artifical construct that we all must stop working at 65 is a relic of past usage .
It 's the stuff of the 1950s . "
Today , pensions minister Steve Webb admitted that people face a " hell of a shock " when they reach retirement because of their failure to save .
In an interview with the Independent , he admitted that the basic state pension of £ 97 a week is " not enough to live on " , and confirmed that the government would raise the state retirement age to 66 earlier than planned .
He said that around 7 million people are currently not saving enough to meet their retirement aspirations .
San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) won three critical exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) anticircumvention provisions today , carving out new legal protections for consumers who modify their cell phones and artists who remix videos — people who , until now , could have been sued for their non-infringing or fair use activities .
" By granting all of EFF 's applications , the Copyright Office and Librarian of Congress have taken three important steps today to mitigate some of the harms caused by the DMCA , " said Jennifer Granick , EFF 's Civil Liberties Director .
" We are thrilled to have helped free jailbreakers , unlockers and vidders from this law 's overbroad reach . "
The exemptions were granted as part of a statutorily prescribed rulemaking process , conducted every three years to mitigate the danger the DMCA poses to legitimate , non-infringing uses of copyrighted materials .
The DMCA prohibits " circumventing " digital rights management ( DRM ) and " other technical protection measures " used to control access to copyrighted works .
While the DMCA still chills competition , free speech , and fair use , today 's exemptions take unprecedented new strides towards protecting more consumers and artists from its extensive reach .
The first of EFF's three successful requests clarifies the legality of cell phone " jailbreaking " — software modifications that liberate iPhones and other handsets to run applications from sources other than those approved by the phone maker .
More than a million iPhone owners are said to have " jailbroken " their handsets in order to change wireless providers or use applications obtained from sources other than Apple 's own iTunes " App Store , " and many more have expressed a desire to do so .
But the threat of DMCA liability had previously endangered these customers and alternate applications stores .
In its reasoning in favor of EFF 's jailbreaking exemption , the Copyright Office rejected Apple 's claim that copyright law prevents people from installing unapproved programs on iPhones : " When one jailbreaks a smartphone in order to make the operating system on that phone interoperable with an independently created application that has not been approved by the maker of the smartphone or the maker of its operating system , the modifications that are made purely for the purpose of such interoperability are fair uses . "
" Copyright law has long held that making programs interoperable is fair use , " confirmed Corynne McSherry , EFF 's Senior Staff Attorney .
" It 's gratifying that the Copyright Office acknowledges this right and agrees that the anticircumvention laws should not interfere with interoperability . "
EFF also won a groundbreaking new protection for video remix artists currently thriving on Internet sites like YouTube .
The new rule holds that amateur creators do not violate the DMCA when they use short excerpts from DVDs in order to create new , noncommercial works for purposes of criticism or comment if they believe that circumvention is necessary to fulfill that purpose .
Hollywood has historically taken the view that " ripping " DVDs is always a violation of the DMCA , no matter the purpose .
" Noncommercial videos are a powerful art form online , and many use short clips from popular movies .
Finally the creative people that make those videos wo n't have to worry that they are breaking the law in the process , even though their works are clearly fair uses .
That benefits everyone — from the artists themselves to those of us who enjoy watching the amazing works they create , " added McSherry .
On EFF 's request , the Librarian of Congress renewed a 2006 rule exempting cell phone unlocking so handsets can be used with other telecommunications carriers .
Cell phone unlockers have been successfully sued under the DMCA , even though there is no copyright infringement involved in the unlocking .
Digital locks on cell phones make it harder to resell , reuse , or recycle the handset , prompting EFF to ask for renewal of this rule on behalf of our clients , The Wireless Alliance , ReCellular and Flipswap .
However , the 2009 rule has been modified so that it only applies to used mobile phones , not new ones .
" The Copyright Office recognizes that the primary purpose of the locks on cell phones is to bind customers to their existing networks , rather than to protect copyrights , " said Granick .
" The Copyright Office agrees with EFF that the DMCA should n't be used as a barrier to prevent people who purchase phones from keeping those phones when they change carriers .
The DMCA also should n't be used to interfere with recyclers who want to extend the useful life of a handset . "
Along with the exemptions that EFF championed , several other DMCA exemptions were expanded , granted or narrowed including one for documentary filmmakers and college - level educators , as well as some for security researchers .

Two videos featuring employees at KARK - TV , Channel 4 , including news reporter Pete Thompson and weekend anchor Courtney Collins , that appeared on YouTube .
They were shot inside the KARK newsroom and have since been removed from the popular video site .
OK , come on now .
I mean , really .
One picture cropped to remove a knife might be explained as incompetence or a simple mistake .
But now we have two pictures from the “ peace activists ” that were cropped by someone at Reuters to remove knives in the hands of the activists , as they attempted to take soldiers hostage .
Reuters has published this picture from the activists .
The picture is a cropped version of this photo from the IHH website ( IHH is the Islamist group whose members rioted aboard the Mavi Marmara ) .
What did the Reuters photo editor crop out ?
A big knife and a big pool of blood .
UPDATE at 6/6/10 4:20:27 pm :
And it gets worse .
I took the photo into Photoshop and increased the exposure to lighten the dark areas , and discovered that they did n’t just crop out the knife and blood — they also cropped out another badly injured Israeli soldier lying on the floor .

Natural gas drilling operations in Dimock , Pa .
Photo : Helen Slottje , Shaleshock.org
Agriculture officials have quarantined 28 beef cattle on a Pennsylvania farm after wastewater from a nearby gas well leaked into a field and came in contact with the animals .
The state Department of Agriculture said the action was its first livestock quarantine related to pollution from natural gas drilling .
Although the quarantine was ordered in May , it was announced Thursday .
A mere taste of what 's to come from natural - gas fracking in the Marcellus Shale , folks .
With fracking , or hydraulic fracturing of rock formations to extract natural gas , we 're setting ourselves up for an environmental disaster of epic proportions -- and much of it the result of an inability to develop rural economies .
Residents in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania are desperate for income , and the gas companies are happy to write checks for mineral rights .
Meanwhile , Pennsylvania and New York are in the middle of state budget crises .
The prospect of tax revenue from fracking is apparently more than enough to offset environmental concerns .
In fairness , both states are paying attention to the risks of water contamination , but they may both conclude that a little water contamination is a small price to pay for a balanced budget and increased rural incomes ( at least for leaseholders ) .
Pennsylvania is already experiencing pushback from gas companies who say the state 's drilling regulations for drinking water protection in Marcellus Shale regions are unreasonably high .
Complicating matters further is that both the New York City and Delaware Valley watersheds are likely to gain special protections , which leaves areas outside those regions more vulnerable to lenient standards .
Ya gotta drill somewhere !
Nightmare scenarios abound .
As High Country News summarizes , fracking has brought the West " polluted wastewater problems , large scale habitat disturbance , methane leaks from pipelines , and potentially serious health impacts that come along with the use of toxic chemicals in hydraulic fracturing . "
And as this article on Civil Eats suggests , even heavily regulated fracking could be enough to destroy much of New York 's Hudson Valley farmland .
After all , how many cattle quarantines or lost crops does it take to put a farmer out of business ?
Answer : not many .
Indeed , this latest episode , despite the fact that the cattle do n't yet seem to have been harmed , will give little comfort to those who have to listen to industry assurances of safety .
Would you want to eat cows that have been dining in fields covered in benzene and diesel fuel ?
My hope is that the tactics the energy industry have used to exploit natural resources to great success out West wo n't work back East , where they are operating much closer to media and population centers .
But betting on the strength of politicians ' spines to resist doing the bidding of the energy industry never made anyone any money ...

Wall of text ahead .
Just brain stewing .
I ’ve been doing a lot of thinking on motivation , goals , life in general , and this blog .
That last point is pretty important as I really want to flesh out the role this thing will be playing in the whole “ Operation : Figure Shit Out ” ( not the most creative name , but it works ) .
As it stands now , it ’s really been nothing more than a public workout log .
This , as it was the current iteration , did n’t work out too well .
It ’s the middle of August .
I am 217lbs currently .
No weight lost , probably some gained .
This is my fault .
Solely my fault .
I have n’t been hitting the gym as hard or as frequently as I should be .
Life has gotten busy and I ’ve been using it as an excuse to eat like shit and put off working out .
This is me owning up to it .
As far as the giving up all video games goes , that ’s not going to happen .
A negative goal like that ( “ Do this or else ” ) does n’t work and would make me miserable .
I will be slimming down on what I got though , putting some stuff in boxes and keeping them there for a while .
So what do I take from this ?
I am human .
I make mistakes .
It ’s a big deal , yeah , but it happens .
There is no time like the present to fix this .
So I will do everything in my power to grow and learn from this .
I will continue my goals , and one day will meet them .
Where to now ?
Well that ’s the real question is n’t it ?
I ’ve kinda boiled it down to two questions .
What kind of man do I want to be ?
Where am I in 5 years ?
The first question is a hard one .
I ca n’t be the only one to ask this of themselves ( replace man with woman and so on ) .
The question was really a response to another question : “ What will it take for me to be proud of myself ? ”
Which was a response to : “ Why am I not happy with who I am ? ” and so on .
I ’ve been thinking of an answer to this question for MONTHS .
I mean , there ’s the obvious : I want to be loving , caring , honest , sincere , happy , etc .
These really just describe emotions more than anything else .
Honesty is the biggest one for me .
It ’s extremely easy for me to be honest with other people , I ’ve never had a problem there , but I can lie to myself like no one else .
So I have to be honest with myself , great !
What next ?
I want children eventually , what kind of father do I want to be ?
Well I want to be strong !
I want to be caring !
I want to be there for my kids !
Pretty normal stuff right ?
Well , I want to be brave too .
I want to stand up for injustices !
I want to speak my mind and say hard truths when they need to be !
How does this fit with father hood ?
How does it fit to me ?
This continuous stream of consciousness , this idea of the ideal person just leads to more ideas , a bigger and broader picture , and most importantly : more questions !
I ’ll just be continuing to try and work that out I guess .
So now for the other , “ Where am I in 5 years ? ”
This one is easier to answer , it ’s a dream .
It ’s just picture a scene and go for it .
Well , in 5 years I will be 29 years old .
Wow , I will be almost out of my 20’s !
I totally want to be starting my family by then ( if not then by 30 ) !
I see myself hopefully married to a wonderful woman .
I see myself working a job I love and living in a place I enjoy .
I see myself driving the same Honda I have now ( probably recently paid off too ) .
I see pictures on the fridge from places I ’ve traveled to .
I see myself running at least 3 miles a day and able to lift my own body weight with ease .
I see myself happy .
So , what do I do to get there ?
I do n’t have all of it planned out , but there are some things necessary for this .
I have to get healthy !
I want to be strong and that will require discipline .
I want a family .
This means I will have to get out there , socialize , and hopefully find the woman of my dreams .
I have to figure out a work plan and design around it .
I have to save up and just travel to places I ’ve never been .
Nothing to specific for now I guess , but there we go .
Where does this leave the blog ?
I have no idea .
Really , this thing may stay a work out log .
This may turn into a daily / weekly / monthly / whatever journal .
Who knows .
I just want to thank you for reading and I will keep updating as I can .
A science historian at The University of Manchester says he has cracked ' The Plato Code ' , secret messages purported to be hidden in the writings of history 's most famous philosopher .
Plato likely needs no introduction here but , in brief , he was one of the most influential authors in history ; philosopher , mathematician and founder of the Academy in Athens , the first institution of higher learning in the West , which laid the foundations of both Western philosophy and science .
Dr. Jay Kennedy is publishing his findings in the journal Apeiron and says that Plato used a regular pattern of symbols , inherited from the ancient followers of Pythagoras , to give his books a musical structure .
Pythagoras , scientist and religious teacher when such a thing was possible without a lot of drama , had declared that the planets and stars made an inaudible music , a ' harmony of the spheres ' and Kennedy says Plato imitated this hidden music in his books .
Kennedy says the hidden codes show that Plato anticipated the Scientific Revolution 2,000 years before Isaac Newton , discovering its most important concept – that nature is written in the language of mathematics .
Kennedy further says the decoded messages open up a surprising way to unite science and religion because the awe and beauty we feel in nature , Plato says , shows that it is divine and discovering the scientific order of nature is getting closer to God .
Whew .
Good thing that whole culture war between science and religion can end now .
" Plato 's books played a major role in founding Western culture but they are mysterious and end in riddles , " Kennedy says .
" In antiquity , many of his followers said the books contained hidden layers of meaning and secret codes , but this was rejected by modern scholars .
It is a long and exciting story , but basically I cracked the code .
I have shown rigorously that the books do contain codes and symbols and that unraveling them reveals the hidden philosophy of Plato .
" This is a true discovery , not simply reinterpretation .
"
If so , it will change perception of the early history of Western thought , including the histories of ancient science , mathematics , music , and philosophy .
Kennedy spent five years studying Plato 's writing and and says he found that in his best - known work " The Republic " , Plato placed clusters of words related to music after each twelfth of the text – at one - twelfth , two - twelfths , etc .
This regular pattern represented the twelve notes of a Greek musical scale .
Some notes were harmonic , others dissonant .
At the locations of the harmonic notes he described sounds associated with love or laughter , while the locations of dissonant notes were marked with screeching sounds or war or death .
This musical code was key to cracking Plato 's entire symbolic system .
"
As we read his books , our emotions follow the ups and downs of a musical scale .
Plato plays his readers like musical instruments , " Kennedy says .
Presumably he means those among us who can read ancient Greek .
But Plato did not design his secret patterns purely for pleasure , it was also for his own safety , because his ideas were a dangerous threat to Greek religion .
He said that mathematical laws and not the gods controlled the universe .
Plato's own teacher had been executed for heresy , secrecy was normal in ancient times - especially esoteric and religious knowledge - so Plato may have regarded confidentiality as a matter of life and death .
Encoding his ideas in secret patterns was the only way to be safe .
Plato led a dramatic life .
Born around 400 BC , at a time when Sparta defeated Athens , he wrote 30 books and not only founded the world 's first university , he was arguably the first feminist , because he allowed women to study there .
He is also considered the first great defender of romantic love ( as opposed to marriages arranged for political or financial reasons ) and , in good Greek fashion , defended homosexuality in his books .
If that 's not exciting enough , he was once captured by pirates and sold into slavery before being ransomed by friends .
Says Kennedy , " Plato 's importance cannot be overstated .
He shifted humanity from a warrior society to a wisdom society .
Today our heroes are Einstein and Shakespeare – and not knights in shining armour – because of him .
" Kennedy says the effort took so long because he carefully peeled back layer after symbolic layer .
" There was no Rosetta Stone .
To announce a result like this I needed rigorous , independent proofs based on crystal - clear evidence .
The result was amazing – it was like opening a tomb and finding new set of gospels written by Jesus Christ himself .
" Plato is smiling .
He sent us a time capsule .
" Modern historians have always denied that there were codes but Kennedy says he has proved otherwise .
" This is the beginning of something big .
It will take a generation to work out the implications .
All 2,000 pages contain undetected symbols .
" Kennedy has a blog - http://jaybeekennedy.wordpress.com/
- where he updates his research .
Some selectyou will recognize : “ Ignorance : the root of all evil .
” “ Only the dead have seen the end of war .
”
“ The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men .
” “ Wise men talk because they have something to say ; fools , because they have to say something .

The title of the movie , to be clear is Titanic II , not ‘ Titanic II – No this is NOT a Joke ’ as the title may suggest !
I ca n’t believe it either as the movie that could never , ever spawn a sequel , has indeed , spawned a sequel !
Will it hit an ice berg ?
YES ?!?!
With the tragic line of
“ Looks like history is repeating itself ! ”
Who writes this stuff ?!
To my knowledge , Jack does not ‘ Come back ’ and neither does Kate Winslet .
I ’ll let the trailer do the talking while I ( along with no doubt many of you ) do the moaning !
Dread Central have unleashed this travesty onto the world so blame them , I ’m just the messenger !
This is almost as bad as another Spice Girls movie but that will never happen will it ?!
Oh man !!!

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Some Germans are calling for a public roasting of the oracle octopus who correctly picked the winner of all six of their national soccer team ’s World Cup matches -- including a bitter defeat to Spain on Wednesday .
Two year - old octopus Paul , the so - called " octopus oracle " predicts Spain 's victory in their 2010 World Cup semi-final soccer match against Germany by choosing a mussel , from a glass box decorated with the Spanish national flag instead of a glass box with the German flag , at the Sea Life Aquarium in the western German city of Oberhausen July 6 , 2010 .

Paul , a two - year - old octopus in a German aquarium , turned into a global celebrity for his uncanny ability to predict the winner of all Germany ’s matches -- even a group stage defeat to Serbia and an ousting by Spain in the semi-finals .
“ Nothing beats grilled octopus , ” said Dolores Lusch , a Germany fan who works on a Berlin fish stall .
“ Cut him up in thin slices and grill him on all sides with a dash of lemon juice , olive oil and garlic on it .
Delicious ! ”
Not an ordinarily superstitious people , Germans became believers in Paul ’s possible psychic powers .
The country was shocked and distraught when he picked Spain to win after tipping German wins over Argentina , England , Ghana and Australia .
German newspapers and websites were filled with suggestions of what to do with Paul -- most involved cooking and eating him .
“ Throw him in the frying pan , ” wrote the Berliner Kurier newspaper in a popular sentiment echoed by Die Welt , Sueddeutsche Zeitung , the Hamburger Abendblatt and other newspapers .
Paul ’s picks have become news across Germany and around the world .
German networks have had live reports on Paul ’s picks .
On Friday , Paul will tip the winner of Saturday ’s Germany - Uruguay match for third place as well as the winner of the Spain - Netherlands final on Sunday .
Networks in Germany , Spain and the Netherlands are planning live coverage .
The octopus , considered by some to be the most intelligent of all invertebrates , gets the choice of picking food from two different transparent containers lowered into his tank -- one with a German flag on it and one with the opponent ’s flag .
The container Paul opens first is regarded as his pick .
Media attention over Paul ’s picks in Germany and abroad has grown exponentially and some commentators even wondered aloud whether his improbable winning streak might have begun to influence some of the more superstitious players .
Despite the antipathy toward Paul , Sea Life spokeswoman Tanja Munzig said Paul has a bright future at his home in Oberhausen .
“ Nothing bad will happen to Paul , ” she said .
“ No one wishes him ill - will .
Paul has had a great run . ”
Munzig added that Paul ’s career might go on .
“ We ’ve had some enquiries about his future , ” she said .
Regime sees naval and air drills as sign of hostility as US urges Asian nations to enforce UN sanctions against North Korea
This article is more than 10 years old

North Korea today threatened a " physical response " to planned military exercises by the US and South Korea this weekend , as tensions on the Korean peninsula dominated a regional security forum in Hanoi .
The regime did not specify what that response might be , but said it interpreted the launch on Sunday of four days of naval and air drills in the Sea of Japan as another sign of US " hostility " .
" It is a threat to the Korean peninsula and the region of Asia as a whole , " a North Korea spokesman , Ri Tong - il , told reporters at the Asean regional forum .
Ri said the drills harked back to 19th - century gunboat diplomacy and violated North Korea 's sovereignty .
" And [ our ] position is clear : there will be physical response to the threat imposed by the United States militarily , " he said .
Operation Invincible Spirit will involve 8,000 US and South Korean troops , 200 aircraft and 20 ships , including the nuclear - powered aircraft carrier the USS George Washington .
The meeting in Hanoi has quickly become the stage for a war of words between the north and the US , although there has been no direct contact between the countries ' delegates .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said " isolated and belligerent " North Korea would have to end its " campaign of provocative , dangerous behaviour " if it wanted better relations with the US and the rest of Asia .
North Korea has pulled out of six - party talks on its nuclear programme and is blamed for the March sinking of the Cheonan , a South Korean navy vessel , in which 46 sailors died .
The regime denies carrying out the attack and has unleashed a wave of belligerent rhetoric in response to what it calls US aggression .
On Wednesday , Clinton unveiled new sanctions designed to deny luxury goods to North Korean elites and strangle funding for Pyongyang 's nuclear programme .
The north says it will not return to nuclear negotiations unless the sanctions are lifted .
Today , Clinton urged Asian nations to pressure North Korea into abandoning its nuclear ambitions by enforcing strict UN sanctions imposed after the regime 's second nuclear test last year .
" One measure of the strength of a community of nations is how it responds to threats to its members , neighbours and region , " Clinton said .
A South Korean newspaper said the new US sanctions would target 200 North Korean - held foreign bank accounts thought to be connected with illegal activities such as nuclear weapons development , drug trafficking and counterfeiting .
" Even before the Cheonan incident , the US was tracking around 200 North Korean bank accounts in banks in China , Russia and even eastern Europe and Africa that are believed to be involved in the development of weapons of mass destruction and the export of drugs , counterfeit money , fake cigarettes and weapons , " the Chosun Ilbo newspaper quoted a diplomatic source as saying .
The paper said the North Korean leader , Kim Jong-il , is believed to hold a US $ 4bn slush fund in secret accounts in Switzerland , Luxembourg and Liechtenstein .
North Korea also rejected South Korean demands to apologise for the sinking of the Cheonan .
" We can not accept such a claim because they try to use it to shift ( their ) responsibility on to us , " Ri said .
He repeated North Korea 's position that the cause of the sinking remains unclear and insisted that it be allowed to conduct a joint investigation with the south .
" South Korean authorities bear the responsibility for causing tension ... South Korea is the one who must apologise , " he said .
A woman has been charged with defacing an online Facebook tribute page for Sunshine Coast murder victim Justine Jones .
Disgusting pictures and messages were posted on the Facebook site last week , after Richard Peter Coburn , 26 , was charged with the murder of Ms Jones .
Ms Jones had been missing from her home in Boolarang Crescent in Alexandra Headland since July 7 .
Police later found her remains in the rubbish at the Nambour transfer station on July 15 .
Detectives north of Brisbane on Thursday evening charged a 22 - year - old Gympie woman with using a carriage service to menace , harass or offend for her posts on the social networking site on or about July 17 .
The woman is due to appear in the Gympie Magistrates Court on August 2 .
Julian Assange , fondateur et porte - parole de Wikileaks .

Il y a eu la publication de la liste des adhérents du BNP , le parti d'extrême droite britannique .
Puis celle des centaines de milliers de messages texte envoyés aux Etats - Unis le 11 septembre 2001 , ou encore la mise en ligne d'une vidéo d'une bavure en Irak qui s'était soldée par la mort de plusieurs civils .
Depuis sa création en 2007 , le site Wikileaks , spécialisé dans la publication de documents confidentiels , a rendu publics des milliers de fichiers de toutes natures : documents militaires , compte - rendus de réunions secrètes , rapports d'écoutes et autres documents de services de renseignement ou militaires .
Wikileaks fonctionne sur un principe simple : le site offre un anonymat total à ses informateurs , qui peuvent envoyer des documents par connexion sécurisée sur Internet ou par la Poste .
Ce qui n'empêche pas ses " taupes " de courir des risques : fin mai , Brad Manning , un soldat américain de 22 ans , a été arrêté par la police militaire .
Il est soupçonné d'avoir transmis à Wikileaks la vidéo d'une bavure de l'équipage d'un hélicoptère Apache , qui avait ouvert le feu sur des civils dans les faubourgs de Bagdad en 2007 .
Il est également suspecté d'avoir transmis au site 150 000 télégrammes diplomatiques , copiés depuis son poste de travail ... sur un faux CD de Lady Gaga !
Il sera en revanche beaucoup plus difficile pour les services américains de remonter jusqu'à la source des " journaux de guerre afghans " .
Comme l'explique Mother Jones , les 90 000 documents militaires publiés ce week - end par le site proviennent du Secret Internet Protocol Router Network ( SIPRNet ) , un réseau auquel peuvent avoir accès la quasi - totalité des militaires engagés en Afghanistan , et même des prestataires de l'armée .
UNE COMMUNICATION BIEN HUILÉE
Les équipes de Wikileaks – représentées par le charismatique Julian Assange – ne sont pas seulement spécialisées dans la publication anonyme de documents .
Elles sont également expertes en communication et en relations médias .
La publication des " fichiers afghans " ne s'est pas faite au hasard .
Wikileaks a tout d'abord édité les quelque 100 600 documents obtenus , et en a supprimé 15 000 pour " éviter de porter préjudice à des sources " .
Le site a ensuite contacté trois journaux – le Guardian , le New York Times et le Spiegel – pour leur proposer l'accès en avant - première aux documents , à condition qu'ils n'en dévoilent pas le contenu avant ce lundi 26 juillet .
Une sélection qui ne doit rien au hasard : outre la légitimité de ces trois grands quotidiens internationaux , Wikileaks a ainsi ciblé deux titres aux sites
Web expérimentés dans le traitement journalistique de vastes quantités de données , et un grand hebdomadaire d'un pays où la guerre en Afghanistan est particulièrement mal perçue dans l'opinion publique .
PARTIES DE CACHE -CACHE
Car si Wikileaks est une source de première importance , c'est aussi un média engagé .
A plusieurs reprises , Julian Assange a pris la parole pour dénoncer les gâchis humains que représentent les guerrres en Irak et en Afghanistan .
C'est d'ailleurs le message que tente de faire passer l'armée américaine , quelques heures après la publication des " journaux afghans " : dans un courriel envoyé aux rédactions américaines , la Maison Blanche estime qu'" il est important de noter que Wikileaks n'est pas un média objectif , mais une organisation opposée à la politique menée par les Etats - Unis en Afghanistan " .
Le site n'en est pas à son coup d'essai : lors de la publication de la vidéo de la bavure américaine en Irak , il avait savamment fait monter la pression plusieurs semaines avant la mise en ligne , annonçant coup sur coup qu'il détenait un " document exceptionnel " , puis qu'il était espionné par la CIA .
Recherché par le Pentagone depuis plusieurs semaines , qui souhaite le convaincre de ne pas publier des télégrammes diplomatiques qui seraient en sa possession , Julian Assange joue au chat et à la souris avec les enquêteurs , apparaissant ici ou là , à des conférences ou sur des plateaux de télévision .
Faute d'un mandat , des agents du FBI lancés à sa poursuite avaient dû payer leur entrée à la conférence HOPE , à New York en juin ... pour rien : Julian Assange n'y avait finalement pas assisté , ses avocats lui ayant déconseillé de rester sur le sol américain .
FINANCEMENT ERRATIQUE
Malgré son aura , et les nombreuses informations exclusives révélées par Wikileaks , Julian Assange ne fait pas l'unanimité , y compris chez les défenseurs de la liberté d'expression et les militants de l'accès aux données publiques .
Géré par une fondation , Sunshine Press , et financé uniquement par des dons , Wikileaks fait face à de graves difficultés financières .
En janvier , le site annonçait avoir reçu 130 000 dollars de dons en 2009 ( 100 000 euros ) , alors qu'il dit avoir besoin de 200 000 dollars pour assurer ses dépenses de fonctionnement et de 600 000 dollars pour payer ses employés .
Conséquence de ces difficultés , le site tournait au ralenti ces derniers mois .
" Malgré une flopée d'articles de presse plutôt flatteurs , décrivant Wikileaks comme une source inépuisable de documents embarrassants pour les multinationales et les gouvernements , le site n'a publié que douze documents depuis le début de l'année , et le dernier [ date d' ] il y a quatre mois " , notait Wired fin juin .
Mi-juin , la page permettant d'envoyer des documents au site avait cessé de fonctionner :
Wikileaks avait oublié de renouveler son certificat SSL , une mesure de sécurité ne coûtant que quelques dizaines de dollars .
La gestion des dons et le budget de Wikileaks sont peu clairs .
Au fil des mois , un ou plusieurs accusateurs anonymes se présentant comme des membres ou d'anciens membres de Wikileaks ont accusé Julian Assange d'avoir utilisé l'argent des dons à son propre profit ou de détourner le site de son but originel , en donnant la priorité à des informateurs sélectionnés .
" De la désinformation " pure et simple , a rétorqué Wikileaks , sans donner davantage de précisions sur le budget de fonctionnement du site .
Après avoir publié la vidéo de la bavure en Irak , le site avait engrangé 150 000 dollars de dons .
Les " journaux de guerre afghans " , dont le retentissement est bien plus important , devraient également susciter un important volume de dons .

Personal Quote :
[ on the Cinerama process in How the West Was Won ]
I must say , though , for telling a story as vast as the West , the process they used at Cinerama gave you a feeling of what the undiscovered country was like .
CBS Evening News with Katie Couric shared the above video on Thursday , offering proof that a southern right whale did , indeed , jump out of the water on Sunday and crash onto the sailboat of a couple sailing off the coast of Cape Town , South Africa .
There has been some speculation that perhaps the image posted Wednesday on Outposts as well as on numerous other websites had been Photoshopped .
" It is definitely legitimate , " Paloma Werner , who had been out sailing with her boyfriend and business partner , Ralph Mothes of the Cape Town Sailing Academy , told Matt Lauer Thursday on NBC's Today Show .
" We were on the boat and we saw the whale coming out , and we saw it .
It 's legitimate -- it has n't been Photoshopped . "
The couple have been speaking publicly about their ordeal .
" I never for a minute thought this thing would hit the boat , " Mothes added when speaking with Lauer .
" Blow me down , suddenly I saw this huge monster shape come up out of the water on my port side and yeah , that 's it .
I mean , it just happened in an instant .
It was quite frightening . "
Officials from the local Department of Environmental Affairs have launched an investigation into the incident after several people came forward to say the boaters had broken the law by approaching the whale and that the 33 - foot , 40 - ton mammal was provoked into the attack .

The innovative online music service Pandora lets you create personalized music stations that you can stream online , but it also makes those stations viewable to anyone on the internet who knows your e-mail address .
And there seems to be nothing you can do to make them private .
Update :
See end of post to learn how to turn this off .
While the fact you created a Metallica radio station may not seem like the most confidential thing in the world , Pandora makes it feel like a private act when you use the service .
But last week , I got an e-mail from a company pitching its social dashboard software .
The e-mail noted the service keeps up with what your contacts do online – including Pandora – and the writer of the e-mail added , perhaps showing off a bit , that he likes the Yeah Yeah Yeahs too – a nod to a station on my Pandora account .
Now there 's nothing on the Pandora site that tells you " your stations " are public to anyone who knows your address .
Its options for sharing talk about how you can publish to Twitter and Facebook .
But the site makes no mention in your profile settings that your e-mail address is the key to unlocking your musical tastes .
There is , however , a handy box in the corner of the front page called Friends , and on the Friend page you can look up anyone 's personalized choices by entering their e-mail address .
There 's no notification to them that you are now watching what stations they create .
Ostensibly , there 's an API somewhere too that the aforementioned social dashboard service is using .
What can you find out ?
Well , a fellow with the e-mail address sergey@google.com likes an angsty band called Rise Against ( one wonders what the hell someone with that e-mail address actually has to rebel against ) .
The choices for an e-mail address that Apple CEO Steve Jobs uses suggests he favors the jazz trumpeter Chris Botti and country music legend Willie Nelson .
I then played around a bit looking for some settings to tweak to turn this off or some explanation to users that their musical selections were public information and could end up being spidered by an automated web service but found nothing .
I dove deep into the privacy policy , but found no mention there .
So I wrote the contact e-mail address for privacy at Pandora last Thursday , asking for clarification as to whether this was a bug or an undocumented feature .
It 's been 8 days now and Pandora has n't written back or even acknowledged it received the e-mail .
So take this post as a necessary , missing update to their privacy policy :
Anything you listen to on Pandora is not confidential and is available to anyone who has or guesses your e-mail address .
Do with that what you please – letting someone see what you listen to online may or may not feel like letting someone open your own personal Pandora 's Box , but at least now you know they can open it .
Update : Friday 6:35 Pacific :
Turns out you can hide your music , if you like !
Reader BH points us to this page , which tells you can go to your profile , click the tiny edit button in the corner , then scroll down to a checkbox that makes your profile private .
Other users then can't even discover if you are registered or not .
Nice find , BH – who stumbled on that page when trying to figure out how to delete his profile in order to stop the sharing .

Image caption Mr Xue says interrogators burned his arms with cigarettes
A Chinese - born American geologist has been sentenced to eight years in jail in China for stealing state secrets .
Xue Feng , 44 , was detained in 2007 after negotiating the sale of an oil industry database to his employers , an American consultancy company .
Mr Xue said the information he had acquired about China 's oil industry was publicly available .
He claimed he had been tortured while in detention .
The US embassy said it was " dismayed " and called for his immediate release .
ANALYSIS Xue Feng 's punishment follows the 10 - year sentence given in March to Stern Hu , formerly of mining firm Rio Tinto , for accepting bribes and dealing in state secrets .
So are there lessons to draw ?
It seems so .
First , what is a secret in China ?
The definition may be vague , but both cases show how sensitive China is about information relating to its state firms , particularly in strategic resources sectors .
Xue Feng was dealing in oil , Stern Hu in iron and steel .
Second , China also seems to be extremely sensitive if you 're Chinese - born but go abroad , get a passport and then return to work for a foreign firm .
Men like Xue Feng and Stern Hu can make contacts , build relationships and get access to information inside China that no foreigner can .
They can be invaluable to foreign firms .
There are more and more Chinese like them and China seems to see them as a threat .
Both men found that their passports , American for Xue Feng and Australian for Stern Hu , offered little protection .
US President Barack Obama raised Xue Feng 's case , Australia raised Stern Hu's .
But China delivered harsh sentences anyway .
Their fate appears to send a clear warning : Information about China 's resources and the commercial dealings of its state firms is jealously protected and if you acquire such information and you are Chinese - born do n't expect your foreign passport to shield you .
The jail term handed down was described by his lawyer as " very heavy " .
Mr Xue was also fined 200,000 yuan ( £ 19,500 ; $ 30,000 ) .
Mr Xue 's crime was to arrange the sale of an openly available database about China 's largely state - controlled oil industry to his US consulting firm IHS Energy , now known as IHS inc .
The geologist has claimed that interrogators burned his arms with cigarettes and hit him on the head with an ashtray .
The US Ambassador to China , Jon Huntsman , was at court for the sentencing , in a show of high - level US concern over the case .
The embassy later issued a statement saying it was dismayed and urged China to grant Mr Xue " humanitarian release and immediately deport him " .
Three Chinese nationals were also sentenced for illegally providing intelligence abroad .
Li Yongbo was sentenced to six years in jail , and Chen Mengjin and Li Dongxu were both given two - and - a - half - year sentences .
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing says that after this case foreign businesses in China are likely to tread even more warily when dealing with information about state firms .
Draft regulations released by China 's government earlier this year defined business information held by state firms as state secrets .
Legal observers have also voiced concern that China 's courts are ignoring legal procedures when dealing with sensitive cases .
In Xue Feng 's case the two - and - a - half - years it has taken to reach a verdict they say breaches China 's own legal time limits .

The graduate tax proposed last week is now described as " unlikely "
The coalition government will reject the idea of a graduate tax to pay for university fees in England , suggests a senior Conservative source .
Last week the Business Secretary Vince Cable set out the advantages of a graduate tax as a fairer repayment system .
But now it is believed there are plans to keep the payment link between students and individual universities .
As such a " pure graduate tax " is described as an " unlikely " option .
In terms of bridging the university funding shortfall , there are suggestions that universities could raise money from some form of bond issue .
Direct payments
The findings of a review of tuition fees and university funding , chaired by Lord Browne , are expected to be published in the week after the Conservative party conference in October .
This will make recommendations on how universities should be funded and whether students in England should pay more than the current fee level of £ 3,225 per year .
Setting out his own views on higher education , the Liberal Democrat business secretary , whose department is responsible for universities , last week said the idea of a graduate tax should be considered " as a priority " .
But the coalition government is distancing itself from the idea that a graduate tax is the best way to get students to pay more towards the cost of their university education .
Instead ministers are exploring the options for a scheme that allows graduates to contribute towards their university education in a way that maintains the direct payment from the individual to the university .
By contrast , a conventional graduate tax would go directly to the Treasury .
However ministers are committed to moving away from the current tuition fee system .
Simply raising the cap on fee levels - either to £ 5,000 , £ 7,000 or removing it altogether - is not believed to be an attractive option for ministers .
Election pledge
In part this is because they are keen to avoid breaking the Liberal Democrats ' election pledge to abolish fees .
Analysis By Carole Walker , Political Correspondent
These comments are embarrassing for Vince Cable , who was keen to flag up the idea of a graduate tax in his big speech on the subject last week .
In fact the Business Secretary talked about " variable graduate contributions tied to earnings " , but he clearly had in mind some form of graduate tax .
The cautious wording was almost certainly a recognition of the sensitivities within the coalition on this .
The Liberal Democrats fought the election on a promise to scrap tuition fees within six years .
The Conservatives did not rule out increasing them .
Whilst the idea of a graduate tax did not go down well with some but not all Lib Dems , there was even more unease on the right of the Tory party .
In fact at the time both David Willetts , the Conservative Higher Education Minister and his Lib Dem boss , Dr Cable , made it clear that there would be limits to any additional levy and the money would be tied to specific universities , rather than going into the general Treasury coffers .
The whole thorny issue is now in the hands of Lord Browne who is due to report in the autumn .
It will not be easy for him to come up with a solution that appeals to both coalition partners and their parties - as well as universities , students and parents .
But a pure graduate tax - an additional levy that would be imposed on all graduates - is out of favour for several reasons .
Ministers are understood to believe it would be unfair for high - earning graduates to pay back more than the cost of their degree .
As one source put it , this would be seen as turning successful graduates into " milch cows " to subsidise the system .
Another problem worrying ministers is the fear that a graduate tax would encourage a " brain drain " as graduates leave the country to work abroad to avoid the extra levy .
But the greatest concern about the graduate tax is that it would break the direct link between students and the university .
As a senior source put it : " It is important that the money goes to the institutions .
They have to have an incentive for student recruitment or a penalty if the numbers are falling " .
Ministers are also understood to be very keen to put universities under pressure to respond to student demands on the quality of teaching .
' Contribution ' not ' fees '
They believe the financial link between the student and their own university is an important driver in improving student satisfaction .
Although a number of variations on the current system of fees have been considered , none are believed to be finding much favour , as ministers are keen to move away from the terminology of " fees " .
Ministers have looked at the Australian system - where fees vary according to the type of subject studied - but this is not regarded as a fruitful route .
If reports that the government is set to reject proposals for a graduate tax turn out to be true , that is good news for the UK 's status as a world leader in higher education Wendy Piatt , Russell Group Graduate tax change ' shambolic '
There are also doubts about an above - inflation rate of interest could be charged on tuition fee loans .
While this would bring extra income to the Treasury , this option is seen as too close to the current system .
So the current debate in ministerial circles is believed to be considering the precise form the " graduate contribution " will take .
Ministers would like the new system to be more progressive than the current fees method , in which all graduates start off by paying back the same amount for each year of study .
As such , although a pure graduate tax is being ruled out , the new system may still involve some graduates paying back more than others .
A spokesperson for the Business , Innovation and Skills Department said : " Last week Vince Cable outlined his interest in a system of variable graduate contributions that could replace the current fees arrangements Lord Browne confirmed that he was looking seriously at this option as part his wide - ranging review into university funding and this has not changed .
" The coalition agreement makes clear that the review 's findings will be judged against a range of criteria including the impact on student debt , ensuring a properly funded university sector , improving the quality of teaching , increasing social mobility and attracting a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds .
We cannot pre-empt its recommendations . "

Kernel Log : Linux 2.6.35 taking shape
by Thorsten Leemhuis
Linux 2.6.35 will deliver better network throughput , support the Turbo Core functionality offered by the latest AMD processors and de-fragment memory as required .
On LKML , a discussion on merging several patches developed by Google for Android is generating large volumes of email .
Two weeks on from the release of Linux 2.6.34 , on Sunday night Linus Torvalds released the first pre-release version of Linux 2.6.35 to concluding the merge of the major changes for the next kernel version , expected to be released in about ten weeks .
The merge window has once again stretched to around 14 days , after its abbreviation in Linux 2.6.34 caused confusion among some subsystem maintainers .
As usual , the next version of the main development tree will include many changes and enhancements to infrastructure and drivers .
Changes introduced by Google developer Tom Herbert mean that the kernel 's network subsystem now supports receive side packet steering ( rps ) and receive flow steering ( rfs ) , both of which improve the way the steps for processing received network packets are distributed across available processors .
As a result throughput is increased and latency reduced .
Memory compaction should allow the kernel to reduce memory fragmentation on demand .
This allows the creation of larger areas of free memory which can be used with larger page sizes , reducing overhead .
Linux 2.6.35 will also include full support for the Turbo Core functionality offered by the latest AMD processors , which allows them to ramp up clock speeds at low loads .
Kernel hackers have also been working on beefing up the rudimentary support for power saving features on Radeon graphics chips offered by Linux 2.6.34 .
The code for cpuidle now keeps better tabs on system load to ensure it does n't reduce throughput through over enthusiastic use of the run-time processor sleep mode .
As ever , over the next few weeks Kernel Log will be reporting on these and hundreds of other changes in Linux 2.6.35 on The H. Between 2.6.34 and 2.6.35 - rc1 there were a total of 8113 commits in the main development tree which , according to diffstat , added 609,506 lines of code and removed 270,035 .
Around two thirds of these were concerned with modifications to driver code .
2.6.35 significantly slower ?
Phoronix , a website specialising in Linux hardware topics , claims its speed tests show that , over the last few days , the Linux kernel in the main development tree has been running significantly slower than the old kernel .
The Phoronix website dedicates a five page article entitled " The Huge Disaster Within The Linux 2.6.35 Kernel " to the subject .
This looks like a lot of effort to go to for a pre-release version of 2.6.35 , with nearly two months likely to elapse before the kernel proper sees the light of day – indeed at the time of testing no pre-release version of 2.6.35 had even been released , as the Phoronix team acknowledges in the first paragraph of the article .
There is plenty of time to deal with any performance problems .
Nonetheless , reports of performance problems in pre-release versions can be found in great numbers on the Linux Kernel Mailing List ( LKML ) – they are picked up every couple of weeks , or months , by testers at AMD , IBM , Intel or elsewhere .
Even on media platforms specialising in Linux this barely merits a mention , since there are usually good reasons for variations in performance and any genuine problems are fixed by the time the kernel version in question hits the streets .
One can , as for any benchmark , also quarrel over the real - world relevance of the tests – indeed among kernel developers Phoronix does not enjoy the best of reputations in this respect ( e.g. 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
The current tests , for example , were carried out on two net - tops with feeble Atom processors .
Both registered a major drop in performance , with the biggest drop being seen on the net - top running on a Poulsbo chip - set , a chip - set which is avoided by many Linux users due to problems with drivers .
This net - top was also using the Btrfs file system , which is still marked as experimental and is not yet considered suitable for live use .
On Monday night the kernel developers were informed of the problem .
There is some speculation as to the root cause , which might have already been fixed .
In the scope of that discussion Dave Airlie criticised the work of Phoronix in a broader scope ; Ingo Molnar pointed out , that although Phoronix ' actions might not be helpful , the kernel developers will have to get used to this sort of thing .

Development in " Jewish terrorist " case .
Ynet learned that the police arrested on Thursday the parents of David Sitbon , suspected of aiding alleged Jewish terrorist Haim Pearlman , after they arrived at Ben Gurion Airport .
" The arrest of the Sitbon couple is intended to check whether they are aware of the actions of their son , who has been arrested for a few days in connection with the ' Jewish terrorist ' case , " said a law enforcement official knowledgeable of the case to Ynet on Thursday .
It was also reported that the couple will apparently be released on Thursday night .
Sitbon is suspected of breaking into an IDF base and stealing a weapon , which he then allegedly passed on to Haim Pearlman , who is suspected of stabbing four Arabs to death and seven other counts of attempted murder .
Aharon and Rivka Sitbon , who live in France , arrived Thursday for a vacation in Israel and were arrested at passport control .
Their son , Michael , was arrested simultaneously at his mother - in - law 's Mevaseret Zion home .
Rachel , David Sitbon 's wife , told Ynet , " It is something unbelievable , true madness .
These are sensitive people , close to 70 , who were arrested only to place pressure on my husband .
They ( the police and the Shin Bet ) lost in court and are left with only a few hours left with him in their custody .
They want to use them to the very last minute in order to incriminate him .
This shows they do n't have any evidence .
It 's all a false charge . "
' Nothing more cynical '
Sitbon 's associates said in a conversation with Ynet , " The Shin Bet deteriorated to a moral low point as of yet unknown . "
" They came to visit their son .
The father had a series of cardiac incidents ; the mother is half out of her senses .
There is nothing more cynical that taking a couple of poor parents and exploiting them , playing with the son 's conscience to make him confess .
It is very sad that this is what democracy looks like in 2010 , " one of Sitbon 's associates said .
Attorney Uri Keinan , who is representing Sitbon 's parents , also claimed that their arrest is meant to put illegitimate pressure on Sitbon , who is slated to meet his legal counsel , Attorney Ariel Atari , for the first time on Friday following a Supreme Court ruling .
Justice Edmond Levy ruled that Sitbon 's continued disconnect from the world is unjustified .
" His relatively small part in the investigated affair , the manner in which he behaved in his interrogations , the planned investigative moves – in none of these could I find just cause for preventing a meeting ( between Sitbon and his lawyer ) , " said Justice Levy .

Books by and about Hitler are in demand in India Slowly but steadily , a decade - old business around the dead and universally despised dictator Adolf Hitler is emerging as a small - scale industry in India .
Books and memorabilia on the German leader 's life have found a steady market in some sections of Indian society where he is idolised and admired , mostly by the young .
The numbers are small but seem to be growing .
Latest reports say Bollywood is now planning to cash in .
A film - Dear Friend Hitler - is due to be released by the end of the year , focusing on the dictator 's relationship with his mistress Eva Braun .
It 's hard to narrow down what makes the dictator popular in India , but some young people say they are attracted by his " discipline and patriotism " .
Most of them are , however , quick to add that they do not approve of his racial prejudices and the Holocaust in which millions of Jews were killed .
But the truth is that books , T - shirts , bags and key - rings with his photo or name on do sell in India .
And his autobiography , Mein Kampf , sells the most .
' Bestseller ' Jaico , the largest publisher and distributor of Mein Kampf in India , has sold more than a 100,000 copies in the last 10 years .
Crossword , an India - wide chain of book stores , has sold more than 25,000 copies since 2000 and marketing head Sivaram Balakrishnan says : " It 's been a consistent bestseller for us . "
The dictator is admired by some for his ' discipline and patriotism '
And demand seems to be growing .
Jaico 's chief editor RH Sharma says : " There has been a steady rise of 10 % to 15 % in the book 's sale . "
Until two years ago , a typical Mumbai ( Bombay ) bookstore sold 40 - 50 copies of Mein Kampf a year .
Now the figure is more like several hundred copies annually .
The more well - heeled the area , the higher the sales .
For example , the Crossword outlet in Mumbai 's affluent Bandra district sells , on average , three copies a day .
The book has several editions and is available in vernacular Indian languages too .
Mannyes Booksellers in the western city of Pune keeps at least four editions .
There are at least seven publishers now competing with Jaico .
Global sales figures for Mein Kampf are hard to come by , but the book sells well in other parts of the world too .
In the US , it sold 26,000 copies last year 2009 .
In 2005 it sold 100,000 copies in Turkey in just a few months .
The Arabic imprint is popular in the Palestinian territories .
Mein Kampf is published by Random House in the UK but the company would not give sales figures to the BBC .
' Positive and negative ' Nearly all the booksellers and publishers contacted in India say it is mainly young people who read Mein Kampf .
[ Hitler ] mesmerised the whole nation with his leadership and iron discipline - India needs his discipline
Student Prayag Thakkar
It 's not just the autobiography - books on the Nazi leader , T - shirts , bags , bandanas and key - rings are also in demand .
A shop in Pune , called Teens , says it sells nearly 100 T - shirts a month with Hitler 's image on them .
Prayag Thakkar , a 19 - year - old student in Gujarat state , is one of them : " I have idolised Hitler ever since I have had a sense of history .
I admire his leadership qualities and his discipline . "
The Holocaust was bad , he says , but that is not his concern .
" He mesmerised the whole nation with his leadership and iron discipline .
India needs his discipline . "
Dimple Kumari , a research associate in Pune , has not read Mein Kampf but she would wear the Hitler T - shirt out of admiration for him .
She calls him " a legend " and tries to put her admiration for him in perspective : " The killing of Jews was not good , but everybody has a positive and negative side . "
Young people have no sense of history - [ Mein Kampf ] is not easy to understand unless you know the history of Germany
Academic Govind Kulkarni Shilpi Guha says she started reading the book but could not finish it and she would n't like to dwell on the dictator 's negative side .
In the past , a couple of right - wing Hindu leaders have also expressed their admiration for Hitler .
But young Indians ' fascination for him has been explained succinctly by academic Govind Kulkarni : " The youth look for a hero , a patriot , and Hitler was a committed patriot .
He is seen as someone who can solve problems .
The young people here are faced with a lot of problems . "
Mr Kulkarni says he believes the young are gullible and fail to see the sinister side of Hitler .
" Young people have no sense of history .
The book is thick and not easy to understand unless you know the history of Germany , " he says .
Amit Tripathi , a Mumbai - based scholar , read the book a long time ago but just out of curiosity .
" I did n't find the book inspiring at all .
It was interesting to read how he coped with his days of struggle , but his ideology of racial purity smacked of racism . "

The New Orleans Hornets have yet to start entertaining trade offers for Chris Paul , but that has n't stopped the superstar point guard from making exit plans .
The Orlando Magic have emerged as the top team on Paul 's list of preferred destinations , replacing the New York Knicks , according to league sources .
While the Knicks are still high on Paul 's list , he believes the Magic , with All - Star center Dwight Howard , would be a better fit .
Paul also realizes Orlando has much more to offer New Orleans in a trade and therefore believes it is a more realistic destination than New York , according to the sources .
Paul will meet with Hornets president Hugh Weber , new general manager Dell Demps and new head coach Monty Williams to discuss the future direction of the club .
The Hornets hope to convince Paul to give the new regime a chance , but sources say he is fully expected to present New Orleans with a list of teams he would like to be traded to .
In addition to Orlando and New York , Dallas and Portland are on Paul 's list .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune reported on Friday that Paul 's agent Leon Rose reached out to all four teams this week .
While New Orleans currently has no plans to trade Paul , the club also realizes how problematic it would be to have Williams start his coaching career with a disgruntled star .
That 's why the Hornets may indeed decide to trade Paul even though he has two years left on his contract .
But New Orleans would not limit itself to the four clubs on Paul 's list .
Instead , New Orleans would look for the best deal for its franchise , according to league sources .
New Jersey and Charlotte are known to be among the many teams that would make offers for Paul .
Some league sources believe New Orleans would insist that Hornets center Emeka Okafor , who has four years and $ 52 million left on his contract , be included in any deal for Paul .
Orlando is one of several teams that called New Orleans about trading for Paul earlier this summer , but under former GM Jeff Bower the Hornets refused to consider moving the three - time All - Star .
League executives are now wondering if that stance will change under Demps .
New Orleans has not listened to proposals yet , and most clubs will likely wait until after Monday 's meeting to begin making offers .
Orlando has not had trade discussions with the Hornets regarding Paul , according to sources .
Paul 's desire to play in New York is largely tied to Carmelo Anthony , the Denver Nuggets ' star .
Both players would like to team with new Knick Amare Stoudemire to form a Big Three that could rival Miami 's trio of LeBron James , Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh .
But while such a scenario is possible , it will be difficult to pull off .
First ,
Anthony must turn down Denver 's three - year , $ 65 million extension offer , which is something most league insiders do n't believe he will do .
Then , the Knicks must put together a package for Paul that entices the Hornets without eating up all the future cap space they would use to sign Anthony as a free agent next summer .
If the Knicks took back Okafor with Paul , signing Anthony as a free agent in 2011 would be impossible .
Beyond that , sources say New Orleans may be unlikely to send Paul to New York because so many other teams could present better offers .
Orlando , with point guard Jameer Nelson and former All - Star Vince Carter , who has only one year of guaranteed money left on his contract , is one such team .
And a pairing of Paul and Howard would unquestionably make the Magic a title contender .

The Clôture of Deconstruction :
A Mahāyāna Critique of Derrida
David Loy
Vol. XXVII , No . I
Issue No. 105 ( March 1987 )

59 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
One senses Derrida is indeed on the verge of someway else , if not a something else , but surely he has not yet broken out of the turn .
Derrida is in the turn of language , but he has logically demonstrated language to be not a turn but a labyrinth .
Robert Magliola , Derrida on the Mend [ 1 ]
DERRIDA'S RADICAL critique of Western philosophy is defective only because it is not radical enough .
His deconstruction is incomplete because it does not deconstruct itself and attain clôture : that much - sought clôture of metaphysical thinking which would also be the opening to something else .
This is why Derrida remains in the halfway - house of proliferating " pure textuality , " whereas deconstruction could lead to a transformed mode of experiencing the world .
Any notion of a clôture for deconstruction seems incongruous with Derrida 's project , whose différance , in deconstructing any proffered " transcendental signified , " allows the dissemination of endless supplementation .
Nevertheless , I shall argue for this by contrasting Derrida 's method and claims with another form of deconstruction that antedates his by some nineteen centuries : the Mādhyamika " anti-philosophy " of Nāgārjuna .
A worthy opponent for the enfant terrible of contemporary Western philosophy , Nāgārjuna is indisputably the greatest thinker of Mahāyāna Buddhism , and many consider his Mādhyamika to be " the central philosophy of Buddhism . " [ 2 ]
Its influence in India , Tibet , Mongolia , China and Japan can hardly be overestimated .
The Vajrayāna Buddhism of Tibet treasures Nāgārjuna 's works as the most profound possible expression of philosophical truth ; and while Zen Buddhism neither is nor has a philosophy , it is no less true that Mādhyamika ( along with Yogācāra ) provided the theoretical perspective which made the development of Zen practice possible .
Even some of the devotional schools of Pure Land Buddhism look back to Nāgārjuna as their founding father .
Given this historical significance , it is an intellectual scandal that Mādhyamika is so little known in the West .
But Nāgārjuna 's subtle and complicated dialectical method is often difficult to follow , perhaps because it cuts too much to the bone , challenging commonsense more than we are able or willing to understand .
Nāgārjuna is more systematic than Derrida in his critique and refutation of all possible metaphysical views , including any that might be called his own .
To what end ?
To anticipate , the debate between them will turn on the following issues .
60 LOY
Nāgārjuna 's dialectic works by undermining such " commonsense " dualities as that between objects and their causal relations , or that between things and time .
In both of these examples ( to be discussed later ) , the latter term may be used first to deconstruct the former and to deny that there is anything self - existing or self - present .
Derrida 's demonstration of the ineluctability of différance makes the same point .
But that alone is incomplete .
The interdependence of both terms in such dualities implies that the negation of either must also lead to negation of the other .
We use " cause - and - effect " to explain the relationships between supposedly discrete things , which means that our concepts of objects and causal relations , being relative to each other , must stand or fall together : if there are no objects , then there can be no causality ( as usually understood ) .
We shall see that the same paradox holds true for time : if there is only time , because there are no objects " in " time , then there is no time .
Each pole deconstructs the other .
It is the necessity for this second and reverse movement that Derrida does not see .
Expressed in his categories , Derrida , although aware that each term of a duality is the différance of the other , does not fully realize how deconstructing one term ( transcendental signified , self - presence , reference , etc. ) must also transform the other ( différance , temporization , supplementation , etc. ) .
What is the result of this double - deconstruction of " commonsense " dualities ?
Derrida 's single - deconstruction leads to the " temporary " reversal of their hierarchy , and / or to a discontinuous , irruptive " liberation " from reference grounded in the search for unattainable origins , into the dissemination of a free - floating meaning beyond any conceptual clôture .
For Nāgārjuna , this would be only the illusion of liberation , while remaining trapped in a textual " bad infinity " which tends to become increasingly playful .
What is needed is not just " a change of style , " however seductive or frustrating that may be .
Rather , the complete deconstruction of such dualities can lead , not merely to their more self - conscious " reinscription , " but to a mode of experience which is not governed by them .
Nāgārjuna agrees that such dualities are ineluctably inscribed in language , and thus are fundamental categories of thought ; this means , however , not that they are inescapable , but that their deconstruction points finally to an experience beyond language -- or , more precisely , to a different way of experiencing language and thought .
In other words , the ultimate irony is that deconstruction ends in the elusive " origin " which metaphysics has always sought and which Derrida believes he has refuted .
They are both right .
Philosophy will never come to rest in such an origin , for no " transcendental signified " can be located with / in language , and philosophy is a language - game .
The rhetorical operations which produce supposedly logical proofs cannot be eliminated : philosophy , like all language , is basically metaphorical .
This is Derrida 's positive and , I hope , lasting contribution .
But the deconstruction of thought via language -- for this is what Nāgārjuna understood himself to be doing -- offers a different mode of approach to the problem .
" There is nothing outside the text " is more true for us now than Derrida realizes , but it is not necessarily true .
In order to understand this , let us consider :
What is the paradigm " transcendental signified , " according to Buddhism ?
Not nirvāna , as two centuries of Western interpretation have led us to believe , for , as we shall see , nirvāna is neither transcendental ( " The ontic range of nirvāna is the ontic range of the everyday world .
There is not even the subtlest difference between the two . "
MMK , XXV , 20 ) [ 3 ] nor signified ( " No truth has been taught by a Buddha for anyone ,
61 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
any where . " XXV , 24 ) .
On the contrary , the paradigm transcendental signified is the thing -- here meaning not only physical objects but also the objectified subject .
What most needs to be deconstructed is the apparent objectivity of the world , which is due to taking perceptions as " signs " of the object .
The relationship between names and things is the archetypal signifier / signified correspondence , and the Buddhist goal is nothing less than its complete deconstruction : " ... the non-functioning of perceptions as signs of all named things is itself nirvāna " ( Candrakīrti ) [ 4 ]
It is not Buddhism that postulates ametaphysical Reality behind appearance , but our usual " commonsense " view , which distinguishes them by objectifying the former with a name .
Nirvāna , in contrast , is nothing other than " the utter dissipation of ontologizing thought " ( Candrakīrti ) .
Unarticulated and delusive ontological commitments underlie even the most everyday uses of language .
Suddenly , language / thought is no longer the means ( as according to metaphysics ) nor even the end ( according to Heidegger and Derrida , in very different ways ) but the problem itself .
This perspective is essential to Buddhism and to most meditative traditions .
Philosophy cannot grasp what it seeks in any of its categories , but , as language becoming self - conscious of its function , it can learn to " undo " itself and cease to be an obstruction , in that way allowing what we have long sought to manifest itself .
This " origin - which - cannot - be- named " has always been the most obvious thing , but says Nāgārjuna , all ways of thinking about it -- whether metaphysical or deconstructive -- can only conceal it by dualistically separating us from it .
To avoid becoming even longer than it is , this paper must presuppose some familiarity with the writings of Jacques Derrida .
First I present , in some detail , the approach and perspective of Nāgārjuna , although with reference to Derrida when the similarities suggest such a comparison . [ 5 ]
I hope that this first part is interesting in itself , but in any case it is necessary to the critique that follows .
The main differences are reserved for Part Two , where Derrida is subjected to a Mādhyamika critique .
I
1 . Even more than most philosophers , both Nāgārjuna and Derrida can be understood only within their philosophical context .
Like Kant 's dialectic , both deconstructive methods are dependent on philosophy having attained a high degree of sophistication ; both are self - consciously parasitic upon the dogmatism of previous paradigms , " the interminable and total conflict of reason " ( Murti ) .
But otherwise the difference in their contexts is more striking .
Nāgārjuna is very much within the Buddhist tradition , which is as much religious as philosophical ( a distinction whose invalidity becomes apparent in such an application ) , although Mādhyamika constitutes so major a development within Buddhism that it is almost a break with the prior tradition .
But Nāgārjuna never questions Buddhist methods and goals , although he explains them in a new way .
Also , like Kant , he is responding to a conflict of traditions .
62 LOY
There are two main currents of Indian philosophy -- one having its source in the atma-doctrine of the Upanisads and the other in the anatma doctrine of Buddha .
They conceive reality on two distinct and exclusive patterns .
The Upanisads and the systems following the Brahmanical tradition conceive reality on the pattern of an inner core or soul ( ātman ) , immutable and identical amidst an outer region of impermanence and change , to which it is unrelated or but loosely related .
This may be termed the Substance - view of reality ...
The other tradition is represented by the Buddhist denial of substance and all that it implies .
There is no inner and immutable core in things ; everything is in flux .
Existence for the Buddhist is momentary , unique , and unitary .
The substance ( the universal and the identical ) was rejected as illusory ; it was but a thought - construction made under the influence of wrong belief . [ 6 ]
It was the conflict between these paradigms that prompted Nāgārjuna 's aufheben , which nonetheless did not lead to any merger between the two traditions ( although Advaita Vedānta borrowed the dialectical argumentation of Mādhyamika for the same end , refuting the reality of the objective world ) .
Nāgārjuna , although constituting a " Copernican Revolution " within Indian philosophy , understood himself as only explicating more clearly than others what the Buddha himself had taught .
In contrast to Indian pluralism , where conflicting systems evolved adjacently by adding sub-commentaries to commentaries on revered works , Derrida is heir to a more integrated tradition which has developed by repeatedly revolutionizing itself .
Each philosophical generation defines its own identity by cannibalizing what its forebears have left .
Since the failure of the Hegelian synthesis , this has meant killing not only one 's own father but all one 's forefathers .
This difference is important because it affects their respective deconstructions .
In contrast to Derrida 's " hierarchy reversal " ( e.g. , a grammatology to replace phono - and logocentrism ) there is no such reversal , temporary or not , in Mādhyamika because Nāgārjuna was reacting to a conflict between diametrically opposed paradigms .
Yet these differences should not overshadow what the two deconstructions share .
One often - overlooked aspect of Buddhism , unusual for a religion but common with Derrida , is that Buddhism assumes no " golden age " in the past , no mythical pure point of historical origin to which Buddhists yearn to return .
Because of their belief in an all - loving God , the Semitic religions must postulate a Garden of Eden from which man fell because of his own sin .
Buddhism , accepting no such Creator , is silent about the origin of the world and of our duhkha ( suffering in the broad sense : including dissatisfaction , frustration , angst ) .
The most the Buddha ever said about this was that " a beginning can not be found . "
Insofar as nirvāna might be taken as such an origin , it is not something that needs to be regained or even gained , but only to be realized by ending the delusion that keeps us from understanding the way things have always been .
On other occasions , the Buddha pointed out that whether or not there was a beginning really makes no difference , since what is important is that there is an end .
He often stated that he came to teach only two things : that our lives are duhkha ( suffering ) , and there is a way to end that duhkha .
Most central to Buddhist doctrine is the denial of an ontological self .
This brings us back to the paradigm conflict between Vedānta and early Buddhism .
Essential to the Vedantic " Substance - view " is not only its postulation of an immutable soul ( ātman )
63 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
but also the identification of that soul with the Ground of the universe ( Brahman ) .
The Buddhist rejection of self should be understood as a critique of any such self - existent , self - present transcendental signified , and the most important Buddhist doctrine , pratītya - samutpāda , is nothing less than a systematic deconstruction of any claim to self - reflexive " pure consciousness " ( cit ) .
Pratītya - samutpāda ( " dependent origination " ) refutes any such conception by demonstrating the interdependence of all elements of our experience .
Everything , including consciousness , may be located within a set of cause - and - effect , differing - and - deferring relationship ( " when X exists , then Y arises " ) which precludes any simple " self - presence . "
The early Pali sutras contain various versions of this " interlocking chain , " but the standard doctrinal compilation presents twelve factors .
( 1 ) ignorance of the interdependent nature of all things ( constituting not only the first " link " but the basic presupposition of the whole process ) leads to the activation of
( 2 ) mental formations ( psychological causal factors derived from past thoughts and actions and usually understood as karmic tendencies persisting from past lifetimes ) leads to
(3 ) ( rebirth ) consciousness ( necessary for impregnation ) leads to
( 4 ) name - and - form ( the developing mind - body complex of the fetus ) which leads to
( 5 ) the six sense - organs ( including the mind as the organ of thinking ) which lead to
( 6 ) contact between such organs and sense - objects ( including mind and " mind objects " ) and thus
( 7 ) sensation ( pleasant , unpleasant or neutral ) leading to
( 8 ) craving ( not only desire for objects of pleasure but also aversion to unpleasant ones and indifference to neutral ones ) and hence
( 9 ) grasping at sense - objects , the manifestation of craving , leading to
( 10 ) becoming ( the tendency to be reborn , a function of such grasping ) , which causes
( 11 ) ( re -) birth , which leads to
( 12 ) duhkha , old age , and death .
Calling this a " causal chain " does not mean that the last link rejoins directly with the first .
The first two factors are causes from the past affecting the present ; the next seven are causes and effects operating in the present ; the last three are the future effects of present causes .
Whether or not this doctrine is taken literally as referring to past and future lifetimes or psychologized into past and future experiences , its importance for Buddhism can hardly be overemphasized .
The interdependence of all experience is explained without any reference to a first cause ( a creator God , etc. ) or a final cause .
There is only " conditionality " : everything is both conditioned and conditioning , each event only a function of an " economy of differences . "
But at first the full critique of self - presence ( Nāgārjuna 's term is svabhāva , " self - existence " ) was only implicit .
It remained for Nāgārjuna , six centuries after the Buddha , to rethink pratītya - samutpāda as implying śūnyatā ( devoidness , lack of being ) [ 7 ] of all phenomena .
By his time Indian philosophy had developed and formalized itself to a sophistication unknown to the Buddha 's generation , and in his major work the Mūlamadhyamikakārikā -- indisputably the most important work of Buddhist philos -
64 LOY
ophy -- Nāgārjuna examined the views of the main schools on the central problems of philosophy : causality , motion , the senses , material objects , the self , time , action , etc .
In what follows we shall summarize Nāgārjuna 's analysis of two issues , causality and time .
The choice is not random .
Causality is the fundamental problem for Nāgārjuna -- many of the other topics , such as motion , only apply its general conclusions to more specific instances -- and , given Derrida ' s critique of self - presence , temporality is the crucial issue for him .
There is another reason for choosing these two .
Causality and time imply each other , to the extent of being two sides of the same coin ( or , to anticipate the deconstruction which follows , two aspects of the same bifurcation ) .
Causality requires that cause precede the effect , and time requires that the past cause the future .
Our plight -- the root of our duhkha -- can also be summarized in these terms : we feel that we are ( or should be ) free , but we know that our lives are physically and psychologically determined ; we feel that we are ( or should be ) timeless , yet we realize that we are mortal , inextricably trapped in time .
To deconstruct fully any of these philosophical problems is to deconstruct the others as well .
But before we begin that deconstruction , a brief description of Nāgārjuna 's method will be helpful .
It would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast of styles than that between Derrida 's clever , multi-layered bricolage and Nāgārjuna 's straightforward dialectics , whose dry " either / or " bears more than a passing resemblance to early Greek dialectics .
[ 8 ]
Without explicitly postulating the laws of non-contradiction and excluded middle , Nāgārjuna 's makes liberal use of them , doing nothing more than demonstrating their full implications in order to deconstruct metaphysics ( including the metaphysics enshrined in our ordinary ways of thinking , implicit in the categories of language ) . [ 9 ]
Classical Indian philosophy was a quest to determine the Real , and the Real , it was agreed , is that which is self - existent , not dependent upon anything else .
Anything which can be shown to be relative to something else is thereby refuted as a candidate .
So Nāgārjuna 's task was quite simple : to take all the proposed candidates for Reality and demonstrate their relativity ( śūnyatā ) , leaving nothing -- not even śūnyatā , since that term too is relative to the candidates .
" ... śūnyatā is the exhaustion of all theories and views ; those for whom śūnyatā is itself a theory are incurable " ( MMK , Xlll , 8 ) .
Rather than attempt to construct a new theory or language with śūnyatā as the key term , Nāgārjuna , while understanding that ordinary language is full of deluding ontological commitments , accepts it and deconstructs it from within : " Śūnyatā is a guiding , not a cognitive , notion , presupposing the everyday " ( XXIV , 18 ) .
No privileged language is created in this deconstruction , and his goal cannot be expressed or pointed to with out the delusive logocentrisms of language ; but , like Derrida , Nāgārjuna thus uses it " under erasure , " without committing himself to its categories .
It is here that we find the deepest resonance with Derrida , whose deconstruction also proceeds by demonstrating the inescapable différance infecting all Western metaphysical candidates for a " transcendental - signified . "
Deleuze 's cryptic remark about Foucault -- that he is a new kind of map - maker , constructing maps for use rather than to mirror the terrain [ 10 ] -- is equally true for both Nāgārjuna and Derrida .
The fun -
65 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
damental presuppositions of metaphysics -- that we can mirror the whole terrain from some Archimedean point of pure , self - contained thought -- is the illusion they subvert , and their weapons are śūnyatā / différance .
These mirror nothing because they have no reference apart from their subversive function ; to fix them within a given system is to use them in ways that suppress that function .
Where they diverge is in their understanding of the result of this subversion .
For Nāgārjuna the primary transcendental - signified to be deconstructed is the world we live , for the supposedly objective world is a function of our ways of thinking about it .
In Indian philosophy vikalpa and prapañca refer to the superimposition of such reified thought - categories and the proliferation of thought - constructions that this generates .
Realizing that the world is determined for us by our ways of thinking about it then yields to meditative practices which may lead to " the end of prapañca " ( MMK , XXV , 24 , the closest Nāgārjuna comes to a " definition " of nirvāna ) , allowing something hitherto obscured to reveal itself .
In that sense , there is a " higher truth , " but any attempt to describe it -- even to call it a truth -- can only be part of the " lower truth " which , as part of prapañca , must finally be superseded .
In answer to an opponent 's objection that then his own thesis is also self - refuted as śūnya ( devoid of any truth - value ) , Nāgārjuna replied : " If I were to put forth any thesis whatsoever , it would have that defect ; but since I advance no thesis , I do not have that fault . " [ 11 ]
Nāgārjuna has nothing to offer ; he only wants to take something away from us .
The following deconstructions should be read in that light . [ 12 ]
2 . The problem of causality is the most important one for Mādhyamika , but at first encounter there seems to be a contradiction in Nāgārjuna 's analysis .
One the one hand , causal interdependence is so central that Nāgārjuna identifies it with the most important concept , śūnyatā ( MMK , XXIV , 18 ) .
The undeniable relativity of everything is the means by which all self - existence ( svabhāva ) is refuted .
At the same time , Nāgārjuna redefines pratītya - samutpāda in such a way as to negate causality altogether .
The first and most important chapter of the MMK concluded that the causal relation is incomprehensible , and later chapters go further to claim that causation is delusive : " Origination , existence , and destruction are of the nature of māyā , dreams , or a fairy castle " ( MMK , VII , 34 ) .
The last chapters seize on this issue as one way to crystallize the difference between samsāra and nirvāna .
What is perhaps the most important verse in the MMK distinguishes between them by attributing causal relations only to samsāra : " That which , taken as causal or dependent , is the process of being born and passing on , is , taken non-causally and beyond all dependence , declared to be nirvāna " ( MMK , XXV , 9 ) .
How are we to take this obvious contradiction ?
The paradox , I shall argue , is that the experience of complete conditionality is phenomenologically equivalent to a denial of all causal conditions .
A view which is so radical as to analyze all things away into " their " causal conditions is offering an interpretation of experience which becomes in -
66 LOY
distinguishable from a view that negates causality altogether .
Thus a dialectic is inherent in the Mādhyamika analysis .
The first step examines the commonsense distinction between things and their cause - and - effect relationships , using the latter to dissolve the former and to refute the self - existence of " things . "
Less obvious is the second step , which reverses the analysis : the lack of " thingness " in things implies a mode of experience in which there is no awareness of cause and effect .
Things and their causal relations must stand or fall together , because our notion of cause - and - effect is dependent on that of objectively - existing things .
If causality explains the interaction among things , then things themselves must be " noncausal . "
And this is precisely our commonsense notion of what an " object " is : that thing whose continued existence does not need to be explained -- i.e. , once in existence , it " self - exists . "
The objectivity of the world ( including the objectivization of myself , my own sense of being a discrete , persisting self ) depends upon this dualism .
It is the bifurcation between them that Nāgārjuna shows to be untenable , by using each pole to deconstruct the other .
In order to understand the Mādhyamika critique , we must begin with a clear sense of what it is that is being criticized : not primarily metaphysics , but our commonsense understanding of the world , which sees it as a collection of discrete entities ( including myself ) interacting causally " in " space and time .
This understanding ( one or the other aspect of which is absolutized in systematic metaphysics ) is what makes the everyday world samsāra for us , and it is this samsāra that Nāgārjuna is concerned to deconstruct .
The implication of Nāgārjuna 's arguments against self - existence ( e.g. , MMK Chapters I , XV ) is to point out the inconsistency concealed within this everyday way of " taking " the world : we accept that things change , yet at the same time we assume that they remain " essentially " the same -- which is necessary if they are to be " things " at all .
Other Indian philosophers , recognizing this inconsistency , tried to solve it by absolutizing one of these at the expense of the other .
The satkāryavāda substance - view of Samkhya emphazied permanence at the price of not being able to account for change , and the asatkāryavāda modal - view of early Buddhism had the opposite problem of not being able to account for continuity .
The basic difficulty with all such views is that any understanding of cause and effect which tries to relate two separate things together can be reduced to the contradiction of both asserting and denying identity .
As the first prong of his attack on the bifurcation , Nāgārjuna refutes our common - sense distinction between things and their causal relations simply by sharpening the distinction to absurdity .
If things are to be self - existent , then they must be distinguish able from their conditions , but their existence is clearly contingent upon the conditions which bring them into being and eventually cause them to disappear .
If it is objected that one cannot live without reifying such fictitious entities , at least to some extent , then the Mādhyamika agrees ; but this " lower truth " ( samvrti ) , while not denied completely , must not be taken as a correct understanding of the way things really are .
But that is only the first step , for now the critique dialectically reverses .
The category of causality turns out to be just as dependent upon things as things are on their causal conditions .
This second step is easy to state but harder to understand .
Granted , if there is only cause - and - effect , then there is no thing which causes and no thing which is effected ; but if there is nothing to cause or be effected , then there is no reason to perceive the world in terms of cause - and - effect .
For example , implicit in our concept of change is the notion that a thing is becoming other than it was , so unless one reifies something self - existent in order to provide continuity between these different conditioned states ,
67 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
there is nothing apart from the changing conditions to be changed .
The concept of change needs something to " bite " on , but the first step of the dialectic leaves nothing unconditioned to chew .
If the colleague I meet for lunch is not in any sense the same person I saw earlier , because there is no substratum of permanence to " him , " then it also makes no sense to say that " he " has changed .
Thus , if there is only coming - and - going -- with no " thing " that comes or goes -- then there is no real coming and going .
What are we left with ?
A universe śūnya- events , none of which occurs for the sake of any other .
Each event -- every leaf - flutter , wandering thought , and piece of litter ( all things become " thingings " ) -- is whole and complete in itself , because , although conditioned by everything else in the universe and a manifestation of that whole , for precisely that reason it is not subordinated to anything else but is an end - in - itself .
In that sense each thing is the only thing in the whole universe ( tathatā , " just this ! " ) and thus is unconditioned , because the duality between determinism and freedom is deconstructed at the same time .
If " liberty or freedom signifies properly the absence of opposition " ( Hobbes ) , then such unimpeded interdependence implies freedom , since there is not only no " thing " that does the event but also no " other " to oppose it .
This means that , whenever any event occurs , it is the whole universe that makes the event happen or rather is the event .
If we accept that the universe is self - caused , then it acts freely whenever anything is done .
The spontaneous actions of an enlightened person respond to a situation like a glove fits on a hand because they are not done by him ( her ) .
Without a sense of self , thoughts and actions are experienced as welling - up nondually from a source unfathomably deep -- or ( what amounts to the same thing ) from nowhere .
If one nondualistically is a cause / effect , without the sense of being a hypostatized self that dualistically uses cause / effect , then there is not the awareness that it is a cause / effect ; it is experienced as whole , complete , and " traceless . " [ 13 ]
If we try to find a " transcendental signified " in Mādhyamika , it can only be every event that ever occurs in the whole universe , which is why the Buddha could teach simply by twirling a flower .
So there turn out to be only two alternatives : either cause - and - effect relationships between discrete thought - constructed objects , or nondual " all - conditionality " ( pratītya - samutpāda ) which is experienced as unconditioned freedom ( tathatā ) . [ 14 ]
In order to experience the latter , the heirarchy which causality constructs -- for the most important hypostatized object is me , the subject who craves other objects and needs an understanding of cause - and - effect relationships in order to manipulate circumstances and obtain them -- must be demolished .
" All conditionality , " in its complete negation of anything to be attached to , offers no practical utility , because there is no longer any object to be obtained or any self to crave it ; whereas a hypostatized self which wants to obtain some other hypostatized thing will need to construct a causal chain of events which leads to it .
Because each event in such a chain is experienced not in itself but only
68 LOY
for the sake of the next , and the next , ... , the śūnya nature of each is overlooked in our eagerness to obtain the objectified goal .
The dissatisfaction with each particular event , in hurrying to the next , is essential to the sense of self , which is why causality is the root category of thought and hence the one most in need of deconstruction .
3 . Before considering the implications of the above analysis for Derrida , we must see that exactly the same paradox applies to temporality : if there is only time , then there is no time .
To deconstruct the delusive dichtomy between beings and time is to realize that I am not in time because I am time , which means that I am free from time .
The early Buddhist emphasis on impermanence does not mean an acceptance of time and change as we usually experience them .
Samsāra is literally the temporal cycle of birth and death , coming and going , which is somehow negated in nirvāna .
What is the genesis of such birth and death ? " ... time is generated by the mind 's restlessness , its stretching out to the future , its projects , and its negation of ' the present state ' . " [ 15 ]
But there is no future without a past ; expectations and intentions are determined by previous experiences -- more precisely , by the " seeds " ( vāsanās ) and mental tendencies ( samskāras ) which remain from them .
So past and future work together to obscure the present , usually negating it so successfully that we can hardly be said to experience it .
The ceaseless stream of intentionality devalues the present into simply one more moment in the sequence of causal relationships , as an effect of past causes and a cause of future effects .
The consequence of this devaluation of the present is that time becomes objectified through a reversal taking place .
Instead of past and future being understood as a function of present memories and expectations , the present is reduced to a moment within a " time - stream " which is understood to exist " out there " -- a " container , " as it were , like space , within which things exist and events occur .
But in order for time to be a container , there must be a contained -- something that is " in " it -- which is objects .
And in order for objects to be " in " time , they must in themselves be atemporal -- i.e. , self - existing .
In this way , the delusive bifurcation that occurs between objects and causality is paralleled by the same bifurcation between objects and time , as a result of which each pole gains a spurious " reality . "
The first reified object , the most important thing to be hypostatized as atemporal , is the " I , " the sense of an ontological self that is permanent and unchanging , which comes into being to discover itself in the anxious position of being an atemporal entity nonetheless inextricably trapped " in " time .
The first half of the Mādhyamika dialectic deconstructs the object that is " in " time by demonstrating that it is time .
Much of our difficulty in understanding time is due to spatial metaphors , but in this case a spatial analogy is helpful .
We normally understand objects such as cups to be " in " space , which implies that in themselves they must have a self - existence distinct from spatial relations .
Not much reflection , however , is necessary to realize that the cup itself is irremedially spatial : all its parts must have a certain thickness , and without the various spatial relations among the bottom and sides and handle , the cup could not be a cup .
One way to express this is to say that the cup is not " in " space but itself is space : the cup is " what space is doing in that place , " so to speak .
The same is true for the temporality of the cup .
The cup is not an atemporal , self - existing object that just happens to be " in " time , for its being is irremedially temporal .
This de -
69 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
stroys the thought - constructed dualism between things and time .
When we want to express this , we must describe one pole in terms of the other , by saying either that objects are temporal ( in which case they are not " objects " as we usually conceive of them ) or , conversely , that time is objects -- that is , that time expresses itself in the manifestations which we call objects .
Probably the clearest expression of this was by the Japanese Zen master Degas : " The time we call spring blossoms directly as an existence called flowers .
The flowers , in turn , express the time called spring .
This is not existence within time ; existence itself is time . " [ 16 ]
This is the meaning of his " being - time " ( uji ) :
" Being - time " means that time is being ; i.e. , " Time is existence , existence is time . " ...
Every thing , every being in this entire world is time ...
Do not think of time as merely flying by ; do not only study the fleeting aspect of time .
If time is really flying away , there would be a separation between time and ourselves .
If you think that time is just a passing phenomenon , you will never understand being - time . [ 17 ]
Time " flies away " when we experience it dualistically , with the sense of a self which is observing it from outside .
Then time becomes something which I have ( or do n't have ) objectified and quantified in a succession of " now - moments " that cannot be held but incessantly fall away .
In contrast , the " being - times " which we usually reify into objects do not occur in time because they are time .
As Nāgārjuna would put it , that things ( or " thingings " ) are time means that there is no second , external time which they are " within . "
This brings us to the second prong of the dialectic .
Having used temporality to deconstruct things , we must now reverse the analysis and use the lack of a thing " in " time to negate the objectivity of time also .
When there is no contained , there can be no container .
If there are no things which have an existence apart from time , then it makes no sense to speak of " them " as being young or old : " So the young man does not grow old nor does the old man grow old " ( Nāgārjuna ) [ 18 ] .
Dōgen expressed this in terms of firewood and ashes :
... we should not take the view that what is latterly ashes was formerly firewood .
What we should understand is that , according to the doctrine of Buddhism , Firewood stays at the position of firewood ...
There are former and later stages , but these stages are clearly cut . [ 19 ]
Firewood does not become ashes ; rather , there is the " being - time " of firewood , then the " being - time " of ashes .
If there are no atemporal objects , then the present does not gain its value or meaning by its relation to past or future .
Each " being - time " is complete in itself .
But how does such " being - time " free us from time ?
Similarly , when human beings die , they cannot return to life ; but in Buddhist teaching we never say that life changes into death ...
Likewise , death cannot change into life ...
Life and death have absolute existence , like the relationship of winter and spring .
But do not think of winter changing into spring or spring into summer . [ 20 ]
70 LOY
Because life and death , like spring and summer , are not in time , they are in themselves timeless .
If there is no one who is born and dies , there is only birth and death ; but if there are only the events of birth and death , then there is no real birth and death .
Alternatively , we may say that there is life and death in every moment , with the arising and passing away of each thought and act .
Dōgen again : " Just understand that birth - and - death is nirvāna ... only then can you be free from birth and death . "
This paradox suggests two contradictory descriptions .
We may say that there is only the present : not , of course , the present as usually understood -- a series of fleeting moments which incessantly fall away to become the past -- but a very different present which incorporates what we normally call the past and the future , because it always stays the same .
We can not be separated from time .
This means that because , in reality , there is no coming or going in time , when we cross the river or climb the mountain we exist in the eternal present of time ; this time includes all past and future time ....
Most people think time is passing and do not realize that there is an aspect that is not passing ( Dōgen ) . [ 21 ]
What is the aspect of time that is not passing ?
It is always now .
Alternatively , this non-dual way of experiencing time may be described as living in eternity : again , not eternity in the usual sense , an infinite persistence in time which presupposes the usual duality between things and time .
There is " an eternity on this side of the grave " if the present is not devalued , as Wittgenstein realized :
For life in the present there is no death .
If by eternity is understood not infinite temporal duration but non-temporality , then it can be said that a man lives eternally if he lives in the present . [ 22 ]
So there is nothing outside the incessant flux of change , yet there is also something which does not change at all .
Transformation is experienced very differently if one is the change rather than an observer of it .
The same is true for causality .
The interdependence of time and causality means that to live ( in ) the Now - which - does - not - fall - away is freedom , for that Now is an unconditionality which is not incompatible with conditions as long as I am those conditions .
To be the Now means to be one with whatever is happening , in which case conditions are not a constraint but constitute the everchanging web of possibilities which may be actualized ( or not ) freely .
Such freedom is not a delusion born of ignoring the causal factors that determine my behavior , but just the opposite : it is motives , conscious or unconscious , which pull me out of the Now by objectifying both time and things ( including , first , me ) in order to provide a field - of - play for the network of intentions .
Of course , there is nothing wrong with such an objectified field as long as it is realized to be a mental construction , for then I am not objectively trapped within my own objectifications .
But , from the " highest point of view , " we have always lived only ( in ) the Eternal Now .
Any other sense of time is the result of prapañca thought - projection within that Now .
That is why philosophy -- not only metaphysics but even deconstructive anti-philosophy , including this paper -- cannot be the Way , but must finally yield to something else .
To identify with any thought - construction is to be objectified by it and lose the Now , whereas meditation -- zazen , yoga , etc. -- is learning how to dwell in that Now .
71 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
II
1 . In terms of the double - deconstruction above , Derrida performs the first phase of the dialectic but not the second .
The Mahāyāna dissolution of self - existing objects " into " time anticipates the critique of self - presence which Derrida makes in textual terms , by showing that every process of signification is an economy of temporal differences :
The play of differences supposes , in effect , syntheses and referrals , which forbid at any moment , or in any sense , that a simple element be present in and of itself , referring only to itself ...
There are only , everywhere , differences and traces of traces . [ 23 ]
But , despite realizing that each term of such dualities is only the différance of the other , Derrida does not see the second phase , in which the dialectic reverses .
In Dōgen 's " being - time , " lack of self - presence is not incompatible with " the eternal present of time , " because without self - existing objects time is not composed of a succession of " now- moments . "
Such moments exist only relative to objects , as their successive modulations .
Mahāyāna ends up with a distinction between the commonsense understanding of objectified time , in which the present shrinks to a moving dividing - line whereby the future continuously falls away to become past , and the non-metaphysical experience of an Eternal Now .
It is no coincidence that this bears more than a passing resemblance to ( among many other things )
Heidegger 's distinction between the " fallen " metaphysical conception of time and a more primordial understanding which the " fundamental ontology " of Being and Time attempts to grasp .
Derrida 's most detailed examination of time and of Heidegger is in " Ousia and Grammē : Note on a note from Being and Time . " [ 24 ]
Its point of departure is a footnote from Being and Time in which Heidegger , having differentiated his own view of time from the traditional and metaphysical one , argues that the " fallen " conception of time is implicit in all Western metaphysics from Aristotle through Hegel and Bergson .
It originates in an aporia found in Aristotle 's Physics IV , in which the nature of time is determined as " nonbeing ' ' because it is composed of a succession of elementary parts -- " nows " ( nun ) :
But in order to be , in order to be a being , it [ time ] must not be affected by time , it must not become ( past or future ) .
To participate in beingness , in ousia , therefore is to participate , in being - present , in the presence of the present , or if you will , in presentness ( p.40 ) .
The circularity of this definition remains " unthought " until Heidegger .
From the Mādhyamika perspective , this aporia is merely another version of the delusive bifurcation between things and time .
Aristotle 's metaphysical demonstration is only a more explicit determination of the duality already latent in ordinary language .
Whether both terms resulting from the bifurcation are taken to be real ( both " container " and " contained " being real , as presented above in Part 1 ) or the reality of one is used to deny the reality of the other ( as with Aristotle ) is irrelevant to the main point .
72 LOY
From a Mādhyamika perspective , what is most interesting is that Derrida 's essay takes for granted the very metaphysical determination of time that Heidegger and ( to a lesser extent ) even Hegel are attempting to bring into question .
Ironically , the many passages which Derrida quotes from Hegel and Heidegger repeatedly point to the second and reverse movement , a move which Derrida himself cannot see .
It would be difficult to find another text that deconstructs itself so well .
For example :
... this Hegelian determination of time permits us to think the present , the very form of time , as eternity ...
Eternity is another name of the presence of the present .
Hegel also distinguishes this presence from the present as now ( pp. 45 - 6 ) .
Derrida 's critique arises from not seeing the distinction which Heidegger makes between two different types of present : fallen and primordial , gegenwärtig and anwesen .
Derrida introduces Heidegger 's footnote by placing it in its context .
The Note belongs to the next to last section of the last chapter ( " Temporality and Within - Time - ness as the Source of the Ordinary Conception of Time " ) .
Time is usually considered as that in which beings are produced .
Within - time - ness , intratemporality , is taken to be the homogeneous medium in which the movement of daily existence is reckoned and organized .
This homogeneity of the temporal medium becomes the effect of a " leveling off of primordial time " ... , and constitutes a world time more objective than the object and more subjective than the subject ( p. 35 ) .
Derrida sees that the " leveling " of which Heidegger speaks as due to the exorbitant privilege of the " now " and the " point " ( p. 36 ) .
Yet , after reproducing the entire footnote , he can understand its significance only as calling into question , not some conception of the present , but , simply , " the present " :
Has not the entire history of philosophy been authorized by the " extraordinary right " of the present ?...
How could one think Being and time otherwise than on the basis of the present , in the form of the present , to wit a certain now in general from which no experience , by definition , can ever depart ?
The experience of thought and the thought of experience have never dealt with anything but presence ( p. 38 ) .
Derrida 's concern is to overthrow the privilege granted to the present , but merely relegating presence into a function of past and future différances misses the deeper point of Heidegger 's distinction and Nāgārjuna 's critique .
What is taken for granted in " Ousia and Grammē " is nowhere obvious there , but it becomes explicit in a much - quoted passage from the previous essay " Différance " :
Différance is what makes the movement of signification possible only if each element called " present , " appearing on the stage of presence , is related to something other than itself , but is retaining the mark of the past element and is already letting itself be hollowed out by the mark of its relation to the future element , -- the trace relating no less to what is called the future than to what is called the past , and constituting what is called the present by this very relation to what is not ; that is , not even to a past or a future considered as a modified present .
In order for it [ the present element ] to be , an interval must separate it from what it is not ; but this interval that constitutes it in the present must also , with one and the same stroke , divide the present in itself , thus dividing , along with the present , everything that can be conceived on its basis , that is , every being , -- in particular , for our metaphysical language , the substance or subject ( emphasis mine ) . " [ 25 ]
73 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
the present in itself , thus dividing , along with the present , everything that can be conceived on its basis , that is , every being , -- in particular , for our metaphysical language , the substance or subject ( emphasis mine ) . [ 25 ]
An interval must separate the present from what it is not in order for the present to be itself .
But how does an interval function to make the present " be itself " ?
It can only be by distinguishing one " now - moment " from another , which is not - yet or already - was .
What remains " unthought " in this is the usual and apparently innocuous assumption that the present is a series of such " now - moments " which successively fall away .
Now is the time to reflect further on the implications of this assumption .
Does n't any such conception of the present presuppose another present that each " now - moment " successively " occupies " ?
For what else can determine that one now - moment is now present , while another is not - yet or already - was ?
But this begins to sound oddly familiar .
What did Derrida say about Aristotle 's aporia ?
... time is defined according to its relation to an elementary part , the now , which itself is affected -- as if it were not already temporal -- by a time which negates it in determining it as a past now or a future now .
The nun , the element of time , in this sense is not in itself temporal ( P.40 ) .
Derrida 's attack on " the privilege granted to the present " should not distract us from realizing that his own conception of time constitutes another version of the everyday and " commonsense " conception of time .
Ironically , both are versions of the circular aporia which Derrida criticizes in Aristotle .
This shows us again that it is not only , or primarily , formal metaphysics which must be deconstructed , but the ontological commitments sedimented in the categories of ordinary language and thus in our everyday , taken - for - granted understanding of experience .
Otherwise our analysis , although deconstructing the explicit " transcendental signifieds " of systematic metaphysics , also reveals the implicit , concealed ones of commonsense .
Derrida concludes his essay by suggesting that " perhaps there is no ' vulgar concept of time . ' "
The concept of time , in all its aspects , belongs to metaphysics , and it names the domination of presence .... an other concept of time cannot be opposed to it , since time in general belongs to metaphysical conceptuality ( p. 63 ) .
This is more true than Derrida realizes : because his own conception of time , like that of commonsense , like any conception , is metaphysical .
A view of time , and thus a metaphysics ( whether articulated or latent ) is unavoidable as long as the delusive bifurcation between time and things has not been eliminated through ending prapañca thought - construction .
However much Derrida may " solicit " the history of Western metaphysics , this example suggests that his " de- sedimentation " finally functions to justify a commonsense view which does not become aware of its own metaphysical assumptions .
This critique of Derrida recuperates much of Heidegger against him .
Derrida criticizes his valorization of presence and nearness , " the prevalence granted to the phenom -
74 LOY
enological metaphor . " [ 26 ]
From the strict perspective of Mādhyamika deconstruction , such metaphors are no more acceptable than any other attempt to describe what is , yet are also understandable as an attempt to describe the nondual experience which occurs when prapañca ends .
If the sense of self is one of the objectifications due to prapañca , then ( to paraphrase Eckhart ) such experience is closer to us than we are to ourselves , and phenomenological metaphors seem naturally suggested .
But despite his great attempt to deconstruct metaphysics and overcome philosophy , Heidegger never discovered the way really to do so .
He realized the illusion of system - making , but never the root delusion of thought - construction .
From a Buddhist perspective , one senses that he had some taste of nondual experience -- perhaps at the time of the Kehret ? -- and that he spent the rest of his career in an attempt to develop philosophical categories adequate to express it .
Derrida is correct to criticize Heidegger 's opposition between " primordial " and " derivative " temporality as still metaphysical ( p. 63 ) , yet Heidegger himself knew this .
Unfortunately , he never discovered the way out of metaphysics .
But neither has Derrida .
2 . What must be the nature of philosophical discourse which wants to announce the inability of thought and language to re-present reality ?
Simply trying to represent that inability is self - defeating and " risks sinking into the autism of the closure " ( Ends , p. 135 ) .
But not to represent at all leaves only silence or the ludic free - play of discourse , neither of which in itself is of much help to anyone else .
The Mahāyāna solution is to adopt both , using a " double - strategy " which produces a theory about the delusiveness of thought and also dismisses that theory by turning it back against itself .
This is the strategy employed in the voluminous Prajñapāramitā ( literally , " transcendental wisdom " ) literature of Mahāyāna , which contains countless formulations of the following form : " X is X , but it is not really X . "
Nāgārjuna 's more rigorous deconstruction is a classic example of how the second strategy devours the first : head swallows tail , and nothing remains -- no nirvāna , no Buddha , no teaching at all .
" No truth has been taught by a Buddha for anyone , anywhere " ( MMK , XXV , 24 ) .
One result of this was Zen :
... the fundamental dharma ( teaching ) of the dharma is that there are no dharmas , yet that this dharma of no - dharma is in itself a dharma ; and now that the no - dharma dharma has been transmitted , how can the dharma of the dharma be a dharma ?
( Huang Po [ 27 ] )
The practice negated any theory , even though it was a particular theory which justified that practice and made it possible .
Only meditative practice can actually end prapañca and open up a new mode of experience .
Derrida too has a " double - strategy , " but his works very differently .
His first strategy -- his theory of why theory cannot represent -- is différance and the grammatological critique of self - presence ; the second is the " dissemination " which this opens up , allowing " the seminal adventure of the trace . "
Again , the first strategy justifies and requires the second .
There is an inevitable tension within both double - strategies , but Nāgārjuna 's deconstruction is finally resolved in a clôture whose silence reveals an alternative to the superimpositions of thought - construction .
In contrast , the contradiction within Derrida 's deconstruction , rather than devouring itself , becomes an ambivalent " bad infin -
75 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
ity " in which what is unsatisfactory about each strategy is disguised by alternatively having recourse to the other .
Derrida understands that all philosophy , including his , can only " reinscribe , " but , for him , the sole solution is to disseminate wildly in the hope of avoiding any fixation into a system that will subvert his insight . [ 28 ]
One wonders what freedom can be found in such a need to keep ahead of yourself .
In contrast , we have the Buddhist example of a Zen master , who plays with language -- moving in and out of it freely -- because he is not bound by it .
His laconic expressions emerge from and are one with , an unrepresentable ground of serenity ; and although they cannot point directly to this ground , there are ways to suggest it for someone else .
In comparison with this freedom , to rejoice in being caught in a language which has lost its ability to represent any truth brings to mind Shaw 's comment on the pleasures of an endless holiday : " a good working definition of hell . "
3 . The same criticism can be made from another direction .
The exposition of Mādhyamika concluded with paradoxes : if there is only causation , then everything is unconditioned ; if there is only time , then there is no time .
Derrida 's conception of interpretation and supplementation may be deconstructed into another version of the same paradox : if there is no pure and simple " origin , " but only the deferral of supplements ( " the trace is the origin of the origin " ) , then there is no supplementation either , because each supplement becomes its own origin .
In one sense this indeed liberates interpretation , but in amore fundamental sense it refutes the possibility of " interpretation . "
If , as Nietzsche said , the text disappears under its interpretation , then so must the interpretations .
As before , Derrida begins a deconstruction but does not complete it .
By turning the deconstructed term back against the deconstructing one , dissemination may be deconstructed into " the end of prapañca . "
" Poststructuralism " was inaugurated by the linguistic realization that in the functioning of the sign it is not possible to distinguish the order of the signified from the order of the signifier .
The role of the signified is played by a set of signifiers .
" The ontological consequences for such a view are immense .
The rigid metaphysical distinction between empirical signifier and ideal signified becomes obliterated in a general circulation of signs , i.e. , in the play of signifiers . " [ 29 ]
The literary consequences are equally immense .
The sharp distinction between the original text - in - itself and its interpretations becomes obliterated in a " disseminating " discourse which can " decenter the text " by appending its own commentary as a " textual graft . "
" The hermeneutic project which postulates a true sense of the text is disqualified ....
Reading is freed from the horizon of the meaning or truth of Being , " etc . [ 30 ]
This " liberation " of the signifiers also establishes a democracy among them ; in the general circulation of signs , they become equal .
By eliminating the intentions of the author ( another signified " origin " ) , Nietzsche 's cryptic remark on a scrap of paper -- " I have forgotten my umbrella " -- becomes " no
76 LOY
more or less significant than any other passage . "
" Dissemination ... affirms ( I do not say produces or controls ) endless substitution , it neither arrests nor controls play . " [ 31 ]
Who likes to stop someone else from playing and having fun ?
But there is something odd here .
Why does one interpret ?
The original motivation presupposed a search for truth , understood as a signified which language could come to signify .
Supplementation and interpretation were necessary because previous attempts to signify this truth were inadequate : the old categories needed to be adjusted or , more radically , new paradigms substituted .
But why supplement now , if we are no longer trying to discover some conceptual truth that can be signified ?
Derrida offers an alternative view of interpretation : there is not only " deciphering to end exile , " but also " affirming play . "
If there is no pure origin then there is no exile to return from ; but in what sense can such " play " still be called " interpretation , " if the chain of supplementation is not rooted in some to - be-signified ?
The poststructuralist response is that this objection is based on a confusion .
Because other signifiers function as signifiers for each other , there is always reference -- not to some mythical origin , but to other supplements .
There is only the interpretation of other interpretations .
This is why deconstruction is necessarily parasitic : not believing that there is any non-metaphorical truth - in - itself to be signified , it needs as " host " another text which attempts to provide such a signified .
Then it is not only the host which makes truth - claims , but also the deconstruction which gains a derivative truth - signifying ability of its own from its critique of the proffered signified .
The irony in this is that Derrida , while believing that he has refuted any transcendental signified , has in effect reconstituted an equivalent in the truth - claim of the host - text , because that is the only way his own deconstruction can make any truth - claim .
The motivation behind all interpretation is the belief that there is some truth to be discovered in the text , or -- what amounts to the same thing -- that some is to be derived from criticizing it .
The demonstration of errors presupposes some truth , and whether that truth is a transcendental signified or a function of other signifiers makes no difference .
Derrida eliminates the presumed origin of supplementation without realizing that this origin was also the origin of all truth , and this second loss infects all subsequent supplements all the way back to him . [ 32 ]
This is not a difficulty for Nāgārjuna , who realizes that his own deconstruction implies the refutation of all truth as well as error , including any truth that might be called his own .
He does not mind this : on the contrary , he is happy for others to realize the ultimate meaninglessness of his statements as long as they realize the meaninglessness of all others as well .
Any conceptual " truth " derived from deconstruction is no less deluding prapañca than error .
The " devoidness " ( śūnyatā ) of all language pleases him because he has another , nonconceptual , perspective , the experience of which is the goal of Buddhist deconstruction .
It is not sufficient to answer that the deconstructive concept of truth , rather than presupposing a " transcendental signified " outside the text , requires only an " invagination " of the text , a reflexive infolding back onto itself .
For the problem is precisely what is obscured by all self - referring involutions .
The concept of interpretation , presuppos -
77 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
ing such reflexivity , is an instance of such " infolding . "
The conquence of this , as we shall now see , is that , although nothing escapes the circle of supplementation , for that very reason nothing has ever supplemented anything else .
This requires a brief discussion of Buddhist meditation , for it is in meditation that such thought - involutions unravel and we are able to realize the nondual nature of non-reflected experience .
Some understanding of how meditation functions to end prapañca is essential to Buddhist deconstruction for the simple reason that it is the only effective deconstruction .
Briefly , Zen Buddhist meditation ( for example ) is a means to forget oneself .
Since there is really no self to eliminate , all that is needed is to " let go " of the sense of self .
But this is not something that the sense - of - self can directly do , since it is itself the problem .
What is needed is a special type of " self - forgetting . "
A common technique is to concentrate on something so completely that the sense of subject - object duality " fades away " as one " becomes one " with it .
This mode of " forgetfulness " is best described in contrast with Nietzsche , Heidegger and Derrida , since " forgetfulness " is an important concept for all of them .
Derrida believes that it is Nietzsche 's interplay between philosophical knowledge and an active , joyful forgetfulness of it which cannot be reconciled with Heidegger 's one - sided metaphysical reading of him . [ 33 ]
For Heidegger , forgetfulness of Being -- which is metaphysics -- is to be in a " remembering back " ( Wiedererinnerung ) .
It is this still - metaphysical " remembering back " to Being which Derrida wishes to eliminate in his deconstruction of any transcendental signified .
This leaves him with what he thinks is an active Nietzschean forgetfulness , expressed in the " free play " of dissemination .
The question already raised is whether such a forgetfulness of metaphysics is only a more subtle form of bondage to the unarticuiated metaphysical categories implicit in our everyday understanding .
The " forgetfulness " of Zen meditation is different from these .
For Buddhism , the fundamental duality in need of deconstruction is that between subject and object , between conscious self and the external world .
As with the bifurcations already discussed in Part One , to deconstruct one of the two terms must result in a new understanding of the other .
Dōgen again :
To learn about Buddhism is to learn about yourself .
To learn about yourself is to forget yourself .
To forget yourself is to perceive yourself as all things .
To do this is to let " fall away " the body and mind of self and others . [ 34 ]
I came to realize clearly that mind is nothing other than mountains and rivers and the great wide earth , the sun and the moon and the stars . [ 35 ]
Such a nondual experience requires actually deconstructing one 's own sense - of - self which means some form of meditation to unravel the self - reflexive thought - constructions which maintain the sense of self .
Derrida 's view of the subject is similar -- up to a point :
It [ the economic aspect of différence ] confirms that the subject , and first of all the conscious and speaking subject , depends upon the system of differences and the movement of
78 LOY
différance , that the subject is not present , nor above all present to itself before difference , that the subject is constituted only in being divided from itself , in becoming space , in temporizing , in deferral ... [ 36 ]
Buddhism agrees that différance is intrinsic to the subject .
The disagreement is whether it is possible to put an end to such temporizing deferral .
Can such a subject actually be deconstructed ?
Despite his critique of the Western metaphysical tradition , Derrida still implicitly accepts the post - Aristotelian view -- a metaphysical view now too firmly inscribed in rationalist " commonsense " to be recognized as such -- that any other mode of experience is a religious myth .
Buddhism agrees that the subject is not a cause but an effect , and for that reason cannot directly undo itself .
But in Buddhism it is the way the mind reflexively " doubles - back " upon itself that creates the sense of self -- e.g. , the sense of being a thinker , the one who links thoughts together .
John Levy has elaborated this point into what is perhaps the classic argument against subject - object duality :
When I am conscious of an object , that is , of a notion or a percept , that object alone is present .
When I am conscious of my perceiving , what alone presents itself to consciousness is the notion that I perceive the object ; and therefore the notion of my being a perceiver also constitutes an object of consciousness .
From this , a most important fact emerges : the so - called subject who thinks , and its apparent object , have no immediate relation .
The notion , lam reading , does not occur while we are thus absorbed [ in reading a book ] ; it occurs only when our attention wavers ... a little reflection will show that even when we are not thus absorbed for any appreciable lapse of time , the subject who afterwards lays claim to the action was not present to consciousness when the action was taking place .
The idea of our being the agent occurs to us as a separate thought , which is to say that it forms an entirely fresh object of consciousness .
And since , at the time of the occurrence , we were present as neither the thinker , the agent , the percipient , nor the enjoyer , no subsequent claim on our part could alter the position ...
If the notions of subject and object are both the separate objects of consciousness , neither term has any real significance .
An object , in the absence of a subject , cannot be what is normally called an object ; and the subject , in the absence of an object , cannot be what is normally called the subject .
It is in memory that the two notions seem to combine to form an entirely new notion , I am the perceiver or the thinker . [ 37 ]
Levy develops a point much stressed in Vedānta : the self is that which cannot be known , for to know it would be to make it into an object .
What is usually overlooked about this point is that our usual sense - of - self is the result of exactly such an objectification .
But then what would happen if I did not reflexively " superimpose " the notions of subject and object together in memory ?
If each thought were experienced autonomously , just by itself , would n't that eliminate the delusive sense of subject - object duality ?
That this is the principle behind Zen meditation is suggested by perhaps the greatest Zen master , the sixth Chinese patriarch , Hui Neng :
In the exercise of our thinking faculty , let the past be dead .
If we allow our thoughts , past , present and future , to link up in a series , we put ourselves under restraint .
On the other hand , if we never let our mind attach to anything , we shall gain freedom . [ 38 ]
79 MAHĀYĀNA CRITIQUE OF DERRIDA
Hui Neng 's " dharma - grandson , " Ma-tsu , describes the result of this practice -- how thoughts are experienced after enlightenment , once the sense of self has " fallen away " : " So with former thoughts , later thoughts , and thoughts in between : the thoughts follow one another without being linked together .
Each one is absolutely tranquil . " [ 39 ]
This is not to deny that from another perspective thoughts are conditioned by other thoughts , a function of other mental events .
Here we have another version of the causality paradox : the conditionality of all mental events -- the fact that all thoughts are always " supplements " -- means that each one may be experienced autonomously , as if it were the only one in the whole universe ) springing up nondually by itself .
In the causality paradox , this occurred because the " noncausal " term -- the object -- was deconstructed .
The equivalent here is the thinker , the sense of a self which is supposedly doing the thinking by linking the thoughts together , never letting go of one until there is another to hold .
When that thinker suddenly evaporates , the nondual nature of each thought becomes evident : I do not think it , because " I " am it .
This strange phenomenon is in fact quite familiar to us , for it is the source of creativity .
This explains why creativity is necessarily mysterious , for the honest genius will admit that he does n't know where his inspirations come from .
Innumerable examples of such nondual thinking can be cited .
Given the topic of this paper , the best examples are from Nietzsche and Heidegger :
Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century a clear idea of what poets of strong ages have called inspiration
If not , I will describe it . --
If one had the slightest residue of superstition left in one 's system , one could hardly reject altogether the idea that one is merely incarnation , merely mouthpiece , merely a medium of overpowering forces .
The concept of revelation -- in a sense that suddenly , with indescribable certainty and subtlety , something becomes visible , audible , something that shakes one to the last depths and throws one down -- that merely describes the facts .
One hears , one does not seek ; one accepts , one does not ask who gives ; like lightning , a thought flashes up , with necessity , without hesitation regarding its form -- never had any choice ....
Everything happens involuntarily in the highest degree but as in a gale of a feeling of freedom , of absoluteness , of power , of divinity .... [ 40 ]
Notice how Nietzsche equates conditionality ( " involuntarily in the highest degree ' ') and the unconditioned ( " a gale of a feeling of freedom ... " ) .
There are no such dramatic examples in Heidegger , but this concept of " nondual thinking " provides an insightful approach to all his later work , which is concerned not to construct a system but to think ever more deeply and nondually .
In fact , this constitutes perhaps the major difference between his earlier project , which was still metaphysical in trying to represent Being , and his later work after the Kehre when his thinking was " claimed by Being . " [ 41 ]
I know of nothing comparable in Derrida .
Perhaps the French legacy of Cartesian subjectivity is not so easily effaced .
Despite his clever " dance of the pen , " Derrida 's multivalent wit never becomes the inspiration of Nietzsche , any more than savoir vivre is found in the cruel laughter of the Overman , who leaves without looking back at the
80 LOY
texts burning behind him .
Is it necessary to add that many examples of both are to be found in the Zen tradition ? [ 42 ]
III
The purpose of this essay has been to show that , although Derrida 's différance constitutes a major philosophical insight , his employment of it does not develop its most radical implications .
There is no " transcendental signified " to which language can point , because every signified is only a function of other signifiers ; all we can ever have in language is a general circulation of signs .
The importance of this can hardly be over - emphasized , but from this sudden checkmate of all philosophy there are two directions to go .
One is to make the reasonable but solipsistic assumption that , because language cannot point outside itself , we must remain forever inscribed in its sign - circulation .
This " liberates " the proliferations of dissemination , a " free - play " that must be called nihilistic if it is motivated by having nothing else to do . [ 43 ]
The other possibility is that perhaps what metaphysics has sought in language can be found in some other way .
Needless to say , contemporary Western philosophy is not sympathetic to such a possibility ; but is n't that a consequence of the frustration of it sown attempt to point outside itself ?
In language , such a possibility cannot be proven or disproven , but most of the Asian philosophical tradition is predicated on that possibility .
Of course , examples are not lacking in the West either . [ 44 ]
The poststructuralist response to this is predictable .
What I have called a deconstruction is only another attempted aufheben of metaphysics .
The Now - which - does - not - fall - away , etc. , is merely another transcendental signified , a fact disguised by ambivalently signifying it and then denying that it can be signified .
Of course , such a criticism is true .
But it is unnecessary .
This paper readily deconstructs itself , as Buddhism has been doing for over two thousand years .
The truth of all this can only imply its ultimate meaninglessness , since this paper becomes merely a proliferation of thought - constructions .
But that does not make me a Cretan liar , for the philosophical point has been to demonstrate the need to go beyond philosophy .
Perhaps it is only in this sense that language can truly point beyond itself .
May this critique contribute , not to the endless proliferation of commentary , but to that true deconstruction which abruptly finds its clôture in the nonconceptual realization of our nondual nature .

The archaeology team , are carefully excavating a 10 - metre wide corridor
Archaeologists in Herefordshire have uncovered the remains of what could possibly be a female gladiator .
Amongst the evidence of a Roman suburb in Credenhill , they have found the grave of a massive , muscular woman .
The archaeological Project Manager , Robin Jackson , said : " Maybe the warrior idea is one that you could pursue , I 'll leave that to people 's imaginations . "
Her remains were found in a crouched position , in what could be a suburb of the nearby Roman town of Kenchester .
She was found in an elaborate wooden coffin , reinforced with iron straps and copper strips , which indicate her importance .
Robin Jackson said : " When we first looked at the leg and arm bones , the muscle attachments suggested it was quite a strapping big bloke , but the pelvis and head , and all the indicators of gender , say it 's a woman . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The coffin would have been made of wood - we have n't got any of the wood left , but we 've got the nails around the outside then three huge giant straps that run all the way around the coffin , and also bronze strips on the corners which would have probably strengthened it , but probably decorated it .
" It 's quite an elaborate and probably a very expensive coffin , and yet the person in it looked like they had a hard working life , and so there 's an anomaly there . "
An offering of beef and a fired pot were also found in the grave , and she was buried on top of a base of gravel .
Also unusual was the place where she was buried - in the suburb , instead of in a cemetery on the edge of the settlement , which was the law in Roman times .
Herefordshire Council say on their website : " There were no weapons buried in the grave with her , nor are there any other objects which might be indicative of this having been a gladiator . "
Excavations
This archaeological find is as a result of excavations in advance of the construction of the Yazor Brook Flood Alleviation Scheme , which will protect homes and businesses in Hereford .
The road east from Kenchester was constructed by the Roman army in the mid 1st century AD , as they pushed westwards into Wales .
Very little was known previously about the suburb which grew up beside this road , however , preliminary results suggest that the main period of development for the suburb was the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD , and that it was much more extensive and densely occupied than had previously been thought .
Archaeological discoveries made in fields near Credenhill Well preserved remains Trial work , undertaken in 2009 , showed that the area contains the well - preserved remains of Roman buildings , yards and rubbish pits situated to either side of a major Roman road , which ran east out of the town .
These form part of an important Roman suburb , which developed alongside the road , but now lies buried , along with the rest of the town , beneath fields and a footpath .
A team of archaeologists from Worcestershire Historic Environment and Archaeology Service , working in close co-operation with Amey Consulting and Herefordshire Council 's archaeology team , are carefully excavating a 10 - metre wide corridor , to allow the flood culvert to be built across this area .
A huge amount of information has already been gleaned , and this is beginning to allow the archaeologists to gain an understanding of this part of the town .
It is hoped that by the time the excavation is completed , at the end of July 2010 , the archaeological team will have built up a detailed understanding of the development and nature of this Roman suburb .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause , offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance .
The test , which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries , was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of 4 months , according to data to be presented at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome on Monday .
“ The results ... could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of women ’s reproductive status many years before they reach menopause , ” said Ramezani Tehrani of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran , who led the study .
Experts commenting on the work agreed it was promising , but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials .
“ The possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting .
People have been looking for something like this for years , ” said Dagan Wells of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Oxford University .
The average age for menopause is 51 , with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age 40 and 60 .
But it can happen later or earlier , making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait .
Tehrani ’s team took blood samples from 266 women aged between 20 and 49 who were also taking part in another study called the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study , which started in 1998 .
They then measured concentrations of a hormone called the anti-Mullerian Hormone ( AMH ) that is produced by cells in women ’s ovaries .
AMH controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop , and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function .
STATISTICAL MODEL
The researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the women ’s socioeconomic background and reproductive history .
“ We developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of AMH concentration , ” Tehrani explained in a report on the study .
“ Using this model , we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span . ”
Tehrani said the results showed “ a good level of agreement ” between predicted and actual age at menopause for the 63 women in the group who reached menopause during the study .
The average difference between the predicted age and the women ’s actual age at menopause was a third of a year , and the maximum margin of error was three to four years .
Wells said Tehrani ’s team appeared to have hit upon a “ fairly accurate algorithm ” for predicting menopause .
But said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends .
“ A woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at 50 , but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this , ” he said .
“ It will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation . ”

Hogan mentioned Bob Bennett ’s comments earlier .
Bennett thought it beneath him and outside conservatism to think the constitution may limit him , a senator , from legislating .
Well , over in South Carolina , Daniel Foster points out another example , defeated Republican Bob Inglis .
Inglis , defeated in a Republican primary by tea party activists , has shared what he really thinks of conservatives — they are racist , bigotted , and easily led by villains like Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck .
The soon to be former congressman loathes the term “ death panel ” and thinks people who criticize Barack Obama are racists , just like those tea party activists who , on the day they were throwing Bob Inglis out of office , were putting in office an Indian lady and a black guy down in Charleston .
I guess they are blind racists .
Somebody ask Bob Inglis to confirm .
The reports suggest the Pakistani military has acted as both ally and enemy , as its spy agency runs what American officials have long suspected is a double game -- appeasing certain American demands for cooperation while angling to exert influence in Afghanistan through many of the same insurgent networks that the Americans are fighting to eliminate .
The behind - the - scenes frustrations of soldiers on the ground and glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials , looking to sustain a drone campaign over parts of Pakistani territory to strike at al - Qaida havens .
Administration officials also want to keep nuclear - armed Pakistan on their side to safeguard NATO supplies flowing on routes that cross Pakistan to Afghanistan .
The records also contain firsthand accounts of American anger at Pakistan 's unwillingness to confront insurgents who launched attacks near Pakistani border posts , moved openly by the truckload across the frontier , and retreated to Pakistani territory for safety .
Some of the reports describe Pakistani intelligence working alongside al - Qaida to plan attacks .
Experts cautioned that although Pakistan 's militant groups and al - Qaida work together , directly linking the Pakistani spy agency , the Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , with al - Qaida is difficult .
While current and former American officials interviewed could not corroborate individual reports , they said that the portrait of the spy agency 's collaboration with the Afghan insurgency was broadly consistent with other classified intelligence .
But many of the reports rely on sources that the military rated as reliable .
Much of the information -- raw intelligence and threat assessments gathered from the field in Afghanistan -- cannot be verified and likely comes from sources aligned with Afghan intelligence , which considers Pakistan an enemy , and paid informants .
Some describe plots for attacks that do not appear to have taken place .
Taken together , the reports indicate that American soldiers on the ground are inundated with accounts of a network of Pakistani assets and collaborators that runs from the Pakistani tribal belt along the Afghan border , through southern Afghanistan , and all the way to the capital , Kabul .
The documents , made available by an organization called WikiLeaks , suggest that Pakistan , ostensibly an ally of the United States , allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan , and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders .
Americans fighting the war in Afghanistan have long harbored strong suspicions that Pakistan 's military spy service has guided the Afghan insurgency with a hidden hand , even as Pakistan receives more than $ 1 billion a year from Washington for its help combating the militants , according to a trove of secret military field reports made public Sunday .
The plot hatched in Wana that day , according to the report , involved driving a dark blue Mazda truck rigged with explosives from South Waziristan to Afghanistan 's Paktika Province , a route well known to be used by the insurgents to move weapons , suicide bombers and fighters from Pakistan .
The gathering was designed to hatch a plan to avenge the death of " Zamarai , " the nom de guerre of Osama al - Kini , who had been killed days earlier by a CIA drone attack .
Kini had directed al - Qaida operations in Pakistan and had spearheaded some of the group 's most devastating attacks .
For example , one intelligence report describes him meeting with a group of militants in Wana , the capital of South Waziristan , in January 2009 .
There , he met with three senior Afghan insurgent commanders and three " older " Arab men , presumably representatives of al - Qaida , whom the report suggests were important " because they had a large security contingent with them . "
Gul is mentioned so many times in the reports , if they are to be believed , that it seems unlikely that Pakistan 's current military and intelligence officials could not know of at least some of his wide - ranging activities .
And more than two decades later , it appears that Gul is still at work .
The documents indicate that he has worked tirelessly to reactivate his old networks , employing familiar allies like Jaluluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , whose networks of thousands of fighters are responsible for waves of violence in Afghanistan .
Lt. Gen. Hamid
Gul ran the ISI from 1987 to 1989 , a time when Pakistani spies and the CIA joined forces to run guns and money to Afghan militias who were battling Soviet troops in Afghanistan .
After the fighting stopped , he maintained his contacts with the former mujahedeen , who would eventually transform themselves into the Taliban .
Another , dated August 2008 , identifies a colonel in the ISI plotting with a Taliban official to assassinate Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan .
The report says there was no information about how or when this would be carried out .
The account could not be verified .
From the current trove , one report shows that Polish intelligence warned of a complex attack against the Indian Embassy a week before that bombing , though the attackers and their methods differed .
The ISI was not named in the report warning of the attack .
American officials have rarely uncovered definitive evidence of direct ISI involvement in a major attack .
But in July 2008 , the CIA 's deputy director , Stephen R. Kappes , confronted Pakistani officials with evidence that the ISI helped plan the deadly suicide bombing of India 's Embassy in Kabul .
Accusations that Pakistan is aiding insurgent groups are usually met with angry denials , particularly by the Pakistani military , which insists that the ISI severed its remaining ties to the groups years ago .
An ISI spokesman in Islamabad said Sunday that the agency would have no comment until it saw the documents .
In a show of strength , the Taliban leaders approved a plan to send 50 Arab and 50 Waziri fighters to Ghazni Province in Afghanistan , the report said .
Gul urged the Taliban commanders to focus their operations inside Afghanistan in exchange for Pakistan 's turning " a blind eye " to their presence in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
It was unclear whether the attack was ever executed .
Gul , who says he is retired and lives on his pension , dismissed the allegations as " absolute nonsense " by telephone from his home in Rawalpindi , where the Pakistani army keeps its headquarters .
" I have had no hand in it . "
He added : " American intelligence is pulling cotton wool over your eyes . "
SUICIDE BOMBER NETWORK
The reports also chronicle efforts by ISI officers to run the networks of suicide bombers that emerged as a sudden , terrible force in Afghanistan in 2006 .
The detailed reports indicate that American officials had a relatively clear understanding of how the suicide networks presumably functioned , even if some of the threats did not materialize .
It is impossible to know why the attacks never came off -- either they were thwarted , the attackers shifted targets , or the reports were deliberately planted as Taliban disinformation .
One report , from Dec. 18 , 2006 , describes a cyclical process to develop the suicide bombers .
First , the suicide attacker is recruited and trained in Pakistan .
Then , reconnaissance and operational planning gets under way , including scouting to find a place for " hosting " the suicide bomber near the target before carrying out the attack .
The network , it says , receives help from the Afghan police and the Ministry of Interior .
In many cases , the reports are complete with names and ages of bombers , as well as license plate numbers , but the Americans gathering the intelligence struggle to accurately portray many other details , introducing sometimes comical renderings of places and Taliban commanders .
In one case , a report rated by the American military as credible states that a gray Toyota Corolla had been loaded with explosives between the Afghan border and Landik Hotel , in Pakistan , apparently a mangled reference to Landi Kotal , in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
The target of the plot , however , is a real hotel in downtown Kabul , the Ariana .
" It is likely that ISI may be involved as supporter of this attack , " reads a comment in the report .
Several of the reports describe current and former ISI operatives , including Gul , visiting madrassas near the city of Peshawar , a gateway to the tribal areas , to recruit new fodder for suicide bombings .
One report , labeled a " real threat warning " because of its detail and the reliability of its source , described how commanders of Hekmatyar 's insurgent group , Hezb - i- Islami , ordered the delivery of a suicide bomber from the Hashimiye madrassa , run by Afghans .
The boy was to be used in an attack on American or NATO vehicles in Kabul during the Muslim Festival of Sacrifices that opened Dec. 31 , 2006 .
According to the report , the boy was taken to the Afghan city of Jalalabad to buy a car for the bombing , and was later brought to Kabul .
It was unclear whether the attack took place .
TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN
The flood of reports of Pakistani complicity in the insurgency has at times led to barely disguised tensions between American and Pakistani officers on the ground .
Meetings at border outposts set up to develop common strategies to seal the frontier and disrupt Taliban movements reveal deep distrust among the Americans of their Pakistani counterparts .
On Feb. 7 , 2007 , American officers met with Pakistani troops on a dry riverbed to discuss the borderlands surrounding Afghanistan 's Khost Province .
According to notes from the meeting , the Pakistanis portrayed their soldiers as conducting around - the - clock patrols .
Asked if he expected a violent spring , a man identified in the report as Lt. Col .
Bilal , the Pakistani officer in charge , said no .
His troops were in firm control .
The Americans were incredulous .
Their record noted that there had been a 300 percent increase in militant activity in Khost before the meeting .

On the heels of our recent post about an anti-rape ad that did the unusual — target men and tell then not to rape — comes this Scottish ad , sent along by Sociologist Michael Kimmel , that does a fantastic job of mocking the idea that some women are “ asking for it ” :
History books – and gadget sites – will tell you that laserdiscs came before compact discs .
And that fuzzy quarter - inch tapes led to the VHS revolution .
However , things could have turned out very differently if certain technologies evolved in a different direction .
Imagining a world without DVD , for example , is quite easy : if the big CE players did n’t agree on a standard for DVD in 1994 / 1995 , consumers would have never given up on tape .
VHS would still be thriving today , along with Blockbuster .
Let ’s now take a look at five technologies that could have drastically changed the world as we know it :
1. Vinyl video brings VCRs to the masses
What if video was encoded in vinyl discs instead of magnetic tape ?
This could mean that by 1960 , EVERYONE had a VCR at home .
Think about the impact on TV ads and TV shows .
Multimedia LPs – a bizarro version of those mixed mode CDs that included audio and video in a single disc – could suddenly become reality .
MTV , a byproduct of cheap video cameras and VCRs , would have arrived a decade earlier .
2 . Turn of the century electric cars ( the 20th century , that is ) and the end of our obsession with fossil fuels
Electric cars could have been the rule , not the exception .
Can you imagine how different things would have turned out if we did n’t pollute the planet with poisonous gases 24/7 ?
What if no wars were ever fought for oil ?
Cities , on the other hand , would be whisper - quiet and air quality would be extraordinary ( even in Mexico City ) .
It does n’t take much to guess that we ’d all sleep better at night …
And live longer , probably .
3 . Wireless electricity for thirsty gadgets
Nicola Tesla allegedly demonstrated this breakthrough in the early 20th century .
If he had succeeded , electricity would have conquered the world in a couple of years , not decades .
Smartphones , laptop computers , tablets – they could all have evolved without the need for batteries .
4. D-VHS : tape powerhouse rewrites HD disc formats out of history
We rely on Blu-ray discs and broadband , 720 p streaming for all of our video needs .
But what if D - VHS won ?
In 2003 , D - VHS was the only way to record 720 p and 1080i signals and D - Theater – JVC ’s copy - protected format for pre-recorded material – the only way to watch a big - budget Hollywood movie in high - definition .
And to think that the HD - DVD / Blu-ray war almost killed HD discs altogether , relegating humanity to a future of compulsory rewinding .
5. 3DO ends console wars ( and fanboysm )
The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer .
My employer , The Bohle Company , launched it in 1993 .
The 3DO could have been a unified console standard , following in the footsteps of compact discs and VHS tapes .
But it cost $ 700 so nobody bought one .
Not even after a redesign and a price reduction .
Not even for The Need for Speed and Road Rash .
If it had succeeded , there would be no 32 and 64 - bit console wars .
No platform - driven fanboysm in the shape of never - ending Xbox 360 vs. PlayStation 3 flame wars .
Developers would be making games for a single platform , a shared hardware standard not unlike VHS .
Maybe games would have made Roger Ebert cry by now .
Maybe not .
Can you think of other technologies that fit the profile ?

Too much of one thing can cause a person a lot of stress , and you know what 's stressing me out ?
All these rights guaranteed to me by the U.S. Constitution .
There 's like — how many — a couple dozen ?
And they keep adding more !
Is n't that a bit much ?
I 'm just a simple man who likes simple things , and I can tell you right now , there 's just no way I 'm ever gonna need all those constitutional rights .
Advertisement
Did anyone even ask me if I wanted all these rights ?
No , they did not .
And , to be honest , I 'm a little chafed about it .
It 's hard enough keeping up with the bills in my mailbox without some huge Bill of Rights hanging over my head .
People are always talking about rights , or protecting them , or trying to get me to exercise them .
Enough already !
God , I feel like I 'm being suffocated by personal liberties .
I 've got rights coming out my ass .
Seriously , have you looked at the Constitution lately ?
It 's like a giant to - do list of all these annoying , super - specific rights we 're all " entitled " to .
And right there at the top is the right to free speech .
Great , so now I got to think of something to say ?
Thanks but no thanks .
When I want to say something , I 'll let you know .
I do n't need a right to tell me .
Advertisement
Take the right to bear arms .
Yes , there are times when you need a gun , but most of the time you do n't .
So why go to all the trouble of writing it down and making everyone sign it ?
Just so I know how many people I 'm disappointing when I do n't use it ?
I do n't even like guns , but sure enough , I 've got three of them , right there in my closet .
Where I 've been granted the right to keep them .
And another thing , there are way , way too many amendments .
They 've got so many , they 've started protecting me from stuff I might actually like .
Like quartering soldiers .
Are you kidding me ?
I can't quarter a soldier ?
Who does n't like a houseguest ?
I 've got an extra bed , and my motto is " Mi casa es su casa . "
Just bring a six - pack and we 'll make spaghetti .
Advertisement
Another one that could go is the protection from search and seizure .
First off , I got nothing to hide .
I know I 'm innocent , so you are n't going to find any evidence against me unless you plant it .
Second , I do n't need someone to protect my stuff .
If you start messing with my property , I 'll call the police .
Plain and simple .
Then wo n't you look stupid .
Right to a speedy trial , right to petition , freedom of religion — on , and on , and on it goes .
I 'm over 40 now , so there are probably some in there I 'm never even going to use .
Look at me .
Do I really need the right to assemble ?
I can barely get my ass off the couch to go out to breakfast with my friend Jerry once a week .
And Lord knows Jerry is n't going to use his right to assemble anytime soon .
He still lives with his mom .
Advertisement
So there 's two rights to assemble going to waste already , and I 'm supposed to feel all guilty about it .
It would be a lot easier just to split them up , and give some of the people some of the rights and other people other rights .
That way they all get used , and nobody 's left with a bunch of unused rights , looking like a total idiot .
Or maybe we could just have one per-sonal freedom per day .
That way you could express your freedom of religion on Monday , and on Tuesday you could move on to your protection from self - incrimination , and so on .
At least that would be manageable .
Advertisement
Look , all I really want to do is live my life and pursue a little bit of happiness , but it 's almost impossible with all these rights gumming up the works .
Why not get rid of the useless ones and replace them with some new rights we can actually do something with ?
Like the right not to get a million text messages from your insane ex-girlfriend , or the right to a clean bathroom at the gas station , or free Netflix for everyone .
You know , something all Americans can agree on .
I was commissioned by one gentleman to make this custom engagement ring box .
His girlfriend and now fiancée is a big fan of movie “ Up ” and all Disney Pixar related .
He saw my previous model in scale 1:160 and wanted to use it as an unique engagement ring box .
I thought he has a great idea so I crafted it for him .
I used the design of my first miniature as a base and modified it a bit so it is hollow and opens at the bottom revealing secret compartment lined with felt and custom ring holder made of foam and covered with matching fabric .
The space inside is 50 mm long by 20 mm width and 40 mm heigh so any diamond engagement ring should fit inside .
The model itself is very small , it measures 6 cm long , 6 cm width and 7 cm height to top of the chimney .
Even at this size it is packed with details .
It even shows under floor joists as seen at original house from the Up movie .
Not a single detail was omitted from my first model so after the proposal it can serve as cake topper or be displayed as custom movie collectible .
The base with white picket fence can be easily constructed using paper and scissors , I can help you with instructions or create it for you if you wish .
Originally I hand made everything with cardboard and paper , all lasercut based on patterns I designed and tested .
All individual pieces were assembled together with paper siding on elevation trimmed and glued on walls one by one .
It was very time consuming process , but resulted in quite accurate miniature .
I should just engrave the lines but I could not resist creating more realistic texture .
The paint brings it all to live .
Here again I would not go the easy route and just paint it with flat colours .
I go extra mile and treat every surface with darker colour wash and lighter shades for highlights .
This adds subtle variations in colours creating impression of aging wood and dirt gathered on real house .
I try to keep balance with weathering , dont want it too old and dirty because this models purpose is to hold and add to beauty of expensive engagement ring inside and mark this important day for years to come .
The box was shipped to USA safely and they are already engaged .
I wish you Gennady and Maggie all the best , long and happy life together .
Your request also started my own adventure , I did n’t know back then that I will be creating custom engagement ring boxes for people around the world trying to turn their passions and ideas into real life objects while improving my own skills and craft .
I still enjoy building my collection of finished models and memories attached to each of them , so if you are looking for something similiar or totaly new , something you ca n’t find in the shops , write me a comment below and we can create it together .

The Republicans have found a new scapegoat for the economy , in addition to illegal immigrants .
The new scapegoat is public sector workers .
Unwilling to blame Bush for the budget deficit , unable to blame Wall Street for wrecking the economy , and incapable of blaming a lack of regulation or capitalism itself for the morass we ’re in , Republicans are pointing their fingers now at public sector workers .
The teachers , police officers , fire fighters , and other government employees are just making too much money , the Republicans say , regardless of the fact that public sector workers in state after state have been laid off or put on unpaid furloughs .
But Republicans do n’t want you to think about .
Much less do they want you to notice that it ’s the top 1 percent that ’s made off like bandits over the last 30 years .
God forbid we raise the marginal income tax rates , or the capital gains tax , or the estate tax .
The last thing Republicans want is to incite class warfare against the upper class .
Far better to incite warfare within the middle class and have the majority of Americans blaming each other .
( See “ War on Public Workers , ” by Amy Traub in The Nation , July 5 . )
One Republican politician after another is joining the chorus against public sector workers , whether it ’s Scott Brown of Massachusetts or Mitch Daniels of Indiana or Rand Paul of Kentucky or even Arnold Schwarzenegger of California , who has ordered all state workers to get minimum wage until the budget mess there is resolved .
In Wisconsin , where I live , the Wisconsin State Journal just ran a story about public sector workers in Dane County earning more than workers doing similar jobs in the private sector , with at least one local politician complaining about this .
But the average public sector salary is only about $ 35,000 .
Are we really going to accept that such a salary is too high ?
Shall we just kiss the middle class goodbye ?
Part of this strategy of blaming the public sector worker is mere distraction — a shell game to keep people from focusing on those who are really feasting at the trough : the corporations and the richest of the rich .
And part of it is a calculated attack on unions , since the public sector has a 37.4 percent unionization rate , while the private sector is down at 7.2 percent .
But whatever the motivation , it ’s a disgusting strategy .
The next time you hear a politician or a pundit trash public sector workers , ask them if they ’d like to take minimum wage — or even a salary of $ 35,000 .
Chances are , they ’re making a lot more than that .

Since 1993 , SmartMouth Oral Health Laboratories has led the charge against bad breath .
It was at this time that our founder , Dr. Marvin Cohen , recognized the need for a long - lasting solution to bad breath .
Dr. Cohen was a leading authority on the etiology of halitosis , which is the study of the origin and diagnosis of bad breath .
His many years of research on the cause of bad breath led to the creation of our patented zinc ion activated technology .
Dr. Cohen ’s vast knowledge of bad breath led him to understand that most fresh breath products only provided temporary solutions to breath issues .
Nothing on the market addressed the underlying issue of eliminating sulfur gas production .
He knew that preventing bad breath required a smarter approach , and SmartMouth ’s activated zinc ions were his solution to eliminating the sulfur production at the root of bad breath .
We ’re so confident every SmartMouth solution will eliminate your breath issue , that all of our products carry a full money back satisfaction guarantee .
Luxury - spending data can tell us a lot about the state of the nation — and our own neighborhoods .
Take Detroit — not the city where one might expect to see the strongest recovery .
Yet when American Express Co. looked at luxury spending in top and midsize cities around the country , Detroit led the list , with growth of 18 % in the first quarter of 2010 from the year - earlier quarter .
Lo and behold , Ford stock is up , too , suggesting that Detroit 's local investors are feeling more optimistic than they were when auto executives were ...
On a rainy November night in Manhattan in 1962 , Fantasy Football had a very humble beginning .
In the early years of the American Football League , the Raiders took a two - week swing through the East , during which they played the Buffalo Bills , New York Titans ( who became the Jets in 1963 ) and the Boston ( now New England ) Patriots .
To save money , they stayed in the East for that period , instead of flying back to Oakland after each game .
So one night in ' 62 Raiders limited partner Bill Winkenbach , Oakland Tribune beat writer Scotty Stirling and Raiders public relations man Bill Tunnell sat in a New York hotel room and planned the scheme that would form the basis for Fantasy Football .
" It was really Wink who came up with the idea , " said Stirling , now head of college scouting for the Sacramento Kings .
" He was an amazing guy , very smart , who had made a lot of really good business investments .
He loved playing with different ideas . "
Winkenbach , who died several years ago , also came up with the whimsical name for the game : Greater Oakland Pigskin Prognosticators League ( GOPPL ) .
" We basically put the thing together there and brought it home the next day , " Stirling said .
As soon as they returned , Winkenbach enlisted the aid of Tribune sports editor George Ross , who is retired and living in the Sierra Nevada area in the small Plumas County town of Graeagle .
" Wink had played around with a fantasy baseball concept in the '50s and we had talked about it , so I was familiar with the idea , " Ross said .
" I could see right away that it would be easy to set up and something everybody would enjoy . "
At the beginning , the only players were members of the Tribune staff and people connected with the Raiders .
" One of the reasons I liked it was that it forced the reporters who were involved to follow the whole league , not just the Raiders , " Ross said , " so they wrote better stories . "
The rules were similar to today 's games -- drafting players whose statistical success determines the payoffs -- but the money involved was not .
A participant earned just 25 cents for a passing touchdown , for instance , and the only " big money " payoffs were $ 2.50 for kickoffs returned for touchdowns and a whopping $ 5 for a touchdown by a defensive lineman .
There were eight club owners for the first year , including Winkenbach , Ross , Stirling and Tunnell .
The commissioner was a local high school teacher , Tom Crawford .
Bill Downing , one of the original owners , was the second commissioner .
Teams had to choose four receivers , four halfbacks , two fullbacks , two quarterbacks , two kick returners , two placekickers , two defensive backs or linebackers and two defensive linemen .
The first player chosen was Houston quarterback George Blanda , for a logical reason : Blanda threw at least 40 passes a game and a fair percentage of them went for touchdowns .
Blanda still holds club records for the Oilers / Titans with 68 passes in a 1964 game against Buffalo and 36 touchdown passes in the 1961 season .
Research for the drafts was very primitive , with little of the information that is available today .
The basic information was supplied by the Street and Smith yearbooks , but that information was all from the previous season .
Even when a midseason draft was added in the ' 70s , information was sketchy .
" I remember one year one club drafted a tight end , J.V. Cain , who was playing for the Cardinals -- but he had died some weeks before , " said Andy Mousalimas , longtime owner of the Kings X sports bar in Oakland and a club owner that first year .
( Cain had a fatal heart attack in training camp on July 22 , 1979 ) .
The first few drafts were held in Winkenbach 's rumpus room , after which the team owners would go to dinner at an Oakland restaurant .
" We had fun with it , " Stirling said .
" Wink had a wood lathe in his basement and he carved a figure of a football with a dunce cap on it .
The loser each year would get that and he had to display it prominently in his house .
If one of us visited him and he did n't have it out , he could be fined . "
Mousalimas opened the Kings X in November 1968 , and the next year the draft was held in his bar .
He also started sports trivia contests to bring in more business .
" I think that 's what really started the spread of the game , " Stirling said .
" A lot of guys came over from San Francisco to play our game and the trivia contests , and pretty soon , San Francisco bars had their own leagues . "
The game , under different names , soon spread across the country .
" I heard later that the guys in New York who started the Rotisserie League claimed they were the first , " Stirling said , " but they were n't .
We were . "
" Scotty and I used to talk about maybe taking this idea to a game company and trying to sell it , " Ross said , " but we never did .
I do n't know how much money we would have made , but before we could do anything , it seemed everybody was playing it . "
Even in Oakland , there were multiple leagues .
Upset when Mousalimas suggested some rules changes , Winkenbach split with him , and Mousalimas started his own Kings X League .
Tribune employees also started their own league .
Now , of course , the game is huge nationwide .
All football publications include sections on Fantasy Football , there are entire magazines devoted to it and even some TV stations show stats for Fantasy League players .
Mousalimas was invited to a Fantasy Football convention in Las Vegas two years ago by Emil Kladec , a publisher of one of the magazines .
" He had reserved 500 rooms at the MGM Grand , " Mousalimas said .
" I said to him , ' Are you crazy ? '
He said , ' There are 2 - 3 million playing this game .
Do you think I can't get 500 of them to come here ? '
Of course , he filled them all . "
DENVER -- Colorado Rockies closer Huston Street bruised the right side of his abdomen when he was hit by a line drive in batting practice Tuesday .
The team said he was sent home to rest and his availability will be on a day - to - day basis .
The accident quickly changed the mood for the Rockies , who were regaling in the return of All - Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki from the disabled list .
Street was taken off the field in an ambulance and transported to an emergency room for further examination .
Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger said that Street passed out " two or three times " and had ringing in his ears after being struck by the baseball off the bat of Ian Stewart as Street warmed up in right field .
Street also complained of pain down his right leg and stomach discomfort .
" Right on the pelvis .
You could see a black - and - blue mark , " Dugger said .
" He 'd hold his breath when he felt discomfort and pain . "
Stewart went into the right field corner to check on his teammate soon after the incident .
" I was hoping it was n't going to hit anybody .
I thought it hit him in the arm , " Stewart said .
" I saw him down there and told him I was sorry .
He said , ' At least you hit the ball hard . '
It 's just one of those trends that continues for us so far this year . "
The Rockies have been hit hard by injuries this season .
But they were looking on the bright side Tuesday , especially after a woeful road trip .
After all , they were getting Tulowitzki back .
The slick - fielding shortstop was activated after missing nearly six weeks with a broken left wrist .
At first , the Rockies did n't miss their best player , going 15 - 7 without him .
But they went 2 - 9 on a brutal three - city trip after the break that dropped Colorado eight games behind NL West leader San Diego .
With their leader 's return , the Rockies were hoping this would be the spark to get them rolling again .
" Getting Tulo back , we 're expecting a lot of good things , " said Clint Barmes , who will shift from shortstop back to second base and platoon with Jonathan Herrera .
" Having him back in our lineup is only going to make us stronger , is only going to make us better .
I do n't know if you want to say savior or not , but it 's pretty important for us to have him back . "
No pressure there .
" That 's what everyone thinks is going to happen : Since I 'm coming back , all of a sudden something magical is going to happen -- we 're going to win all kinds of games , " said Tulowitzki , who broke his wrist June 17 in Minnesota when he was hit by a pitch from Twins reliever Alex Burnett .
" The reality of it is that 's not how it 's going to be .
I 'd like to contribute , but at the same time , I 'm not no savior .
I 'm not going to turn this thing by myself . "
To make room for Tulowitzki on the roster , the team designated first baseman Brad Eldred for assignment .
He was hitting .250 as he helped fill in for Todd Helton , who 's been out since early July with a stiff lower back .
Rockies manager Jim Tracy was thrilled at the thought of penciling Tulowitzki's name back into the cleanup spot .
Tulowitzki entered Tuesday hitting .306 with nine homers and 34 RBIs .
" Obviously , we 're putting a very special name back in the lineup , " Tracy said before the game Tuesday night against Pittsburgh .
" It 's a very good feeling , knowing we have the opportunity to do that . "
It 's been an injury - riddled season for Street as the reliever missed the first 69 games of the season recovering from an inflamed right shoulder .
Since his return on June 22 , Street has saved six games in seven chances .
His command has been pinpoint , striking out 15 and issuing just one walk in 15 innings .
Soon after being hit , Street went to the ground in the right field corner .
He had a throng of teammates gather around him as they waited for the ambulance to arrive .
" It 's scary when you have to have the ambulance come out , " Stewart said .
" It 's not something we 're accustomed to out here .
I said a prayer for him and hope he 's OK .
That 's all I could do for him . "
Australian studio Durbach Block Architects have completed a wedge - shaped building in Sydney , Australia , that appears to have been pinched in at the top .
The four storey building on Roslyn street features a façade with both glossy and matte , white and buff mosaic tiles broken up with rows of uneven black windows that jut out of the surface .
The top floor is partially uncovered , with a triangular roof garden surrounded by curved walls and steel window frames .
The building houses a restaurant on the ground floor , a bar on the first floor and commercial units on the top two floors .
Photographs are by Peter Bennetts unless otherwise stated .
Above photograph is by Anthony Browell .
Here 's some more information from the architects :
5 - 9 Roslyn Street Potts Point is a triangular shaped site , less than 200 m2 in size .
The rounded end looks directly onto a small public space .
Above photograph is by Anthony Browell .
The shape of the site exaggerates perspective , the tiny footprint amplifies the perception of height .
We wanted the building to sit easily in its place , to recognise the architectural traits of its neighbours .
Above photograph is by Neil Durbach .
We also wanted to take a new view of the thick masonry walls , small detailed windows and overhanging cornices typical of the area .
Above photograph is by Anthony Browell .
The cornice is exaggerated to overhang the street , to suggest a room .
The fine steel lined windows are slightly offset and casually misaligned .
Above photograph is by Anthony Browell .
The awning splits to mark individual entry points on the street .
Above photograph is by Neil Durbach .
On the street , it seems an ephemeral version of the neighbourhood buildings , the rhythm held by the openings as the wall recedes .
Then , at the corner the building shifts to being strongly surfaced , curving in two directions , becoming a peninsular of moulded light .
The surface of crackled tiles , a mixture of gloss and matte , white and biscuit , reflect and refract the surroundings .
Above photograph is by Anthony Browell .
An exotic roof top garden of frangipani trees and seasonal plantings is framed in the sky through buckled openings .
Above photograph is by Neil Durbach .
The softly modulated interior of the restaurant accommodates the shifting geometry of the site , uses of the room and its services .
The palette of timber , off white concrete , graded textiles and delicate white furniture gives the room a calm and slight remove from the intensity of its urban setting .
Above photograph is by Neil Durbach .
Program : Four levels plus basement service area .
Basement Service : Restaurant Service
Ground Floor : Restaurant
Level 1 : Bar with direct street access
Level 2 : Commercial
Level 3 : Commercial and Roof garden
Energy Efficiency
The building observes the fundamental principles of energy efficiency and good design for a medium scaled city building :
Solid masonry walls provide insulation from outside temperatures , while windows with recessed reveals provide natural light without excessive heat gain .
High floor to ceiling heights admit plenty of solar access in winter , excluding sun in summer and contribute to the volume and efficiency of natural ventilation

Opening sections in the windows reduce the reliance of interior spaces on air conditioning , providing floor by floor choice for occupants .

Several of my friends are Labor voters , despite disagreeing with 90 % of what the party actually does in office .
“ Why waste my vote by voting for the Greens ? ” they ask .
“ They ’ll never be in power ! ”
For progressive ALP voters there ’s a very simple answer to this question : because voting Greens will make the ALP a more compassionate , humanitarian party .
If you vote ALP regardless of how far to the right they lunge , then they know they can ignore you while they chase conservative votes .
If you vote Greens and preference ALP , then you tell them that they need to represent progressive views or risk losing seats to the Greens .
They ’ll precisely two choices then : either adapt by paying attention to what you want and stopping emulating Tony Abbott – or you , along with other progressive voters , will eventually end up electing Greens MPs .
( And they ’ll hold the ALP accountable to your views in Parliament . )
The reason the ALP keeps lunging to the right is that it thinks its main competition is the Liberals , and it ’s trying to appeal to their voters .
For the same reason , the more serious the competition it gets from the Greens ( by ALP voters abandoning it for the Greens , the same way swinging voters abandon it for the Liberals ) , the more it ’s going to have to compete for progressive votes – which means the ALP starting to actually listen to you !
It means the ALP proposing policies with which you might actually agree .
This will not happen if you just vote ALP regardless of what it actually does .
By voting 1 for the Greens and preferencing the ALP , your vote is just as strong at keeping Tony Abbott out – but you also , critically , make the ALP less like him .
Julia Gillard emulating John Howard ?
That ’s what you get when you let the ALP take you for granted .
Also , remember : whichever party you vote 1 for gets the funding for next time .
By giving your first preference to a major party , you ’re helping lock in more of the same policies .
By giving it to the Greens , you ’re helping to give them real competition .
PS As for “ my vote ’s not going to make a difference ” – it ’s going to make just as much difference as every other person’s .
You have the same vote as Julia Gillard , or Tony Abbott , or Bob Brown .
Pick the one you dislike the most : you can cancel theirs out .
If you waste your vote , you ’re in effect giving an extra vote to the people you like the least .

LA club tries to put the loss behind them and move forward .
CARSON , Calif --
The first leg of a qualification match for the CONCACAF Champions League did not go Galaxy 's way as they were humiliated 4 - 1 at home by the Islanders with all five goals ( including an own - goal ) of the match coming by way of Puerto Rico .
At times , Galaxy were in complete disarray .
Though the ball possession was in their favor ; 23 shots were recorded by the home side , but nothing resulted on the scoreboard .
The only goal Los Angeles managed to get was a product of an own - goal late in the second .
" Well , we got beat soundly tonight ; there 's no question about that , " said a disgruntled coach Bruce Arena .
" There 's no excuse ... our efforts were good , our executions were not .
" Though his team has done well enough on the MLS season to hold first place in the league , granting him the coaching gig at the All - Star Game , it fell apart spectaculary for Arena and his men versus the Islanders .
"
Firstly , our experienced players did n't have a good night ; and secondly , our finishing was poor , theirs was was superb , " Arena analyzed .
One could arguably point the the finger squarely on net - minder Josh Saunders for allowing at least two of the quartet of goals into his net .
However , the coach stood by his keeper in the main , though he criticized as well as defended him .
" Josh Saunders has n't gotten a goal scored against him this year , and Josh is a good goalkeeper , certainly capable of playing in this game tonight .
We did n't lose this game tonight because of Josh Saunders , there are a lot of reason why we lost this game .
" Other club members like defender Gregg Berhalter were flabbergasted , puzzled and bewildered at the end result of the match .
" It was one of those games ; it was a bizarre game , " said the defender .
" We give a lot of credit to them , but we have to look at ourselves and say this just is n't good enough .
It was a just a nightmare .
It was one of those games you can't explain .
That 's how soccer goes .
" All - Star Landon Donovan was more critical of the situation , calling on his team to step it up .
" I'm just disappointed , " confessed the international .
" I think we were incredibly naive about how we went about things after we went a goal down .
Our team now , as healthy as it's been all year , guys should know that if they do n't play well , they 're not going to play .
And I think we learned a lot about our team tonight , and we got to get better .
" Both Donovan and Edson Buddle were selected to represent the MLS on Wednesdays All - Star game against Manchester United in Houston .
Despite this and an MLS matchup against Chicago on Sunday , the duo are still eying the second leg versus Puerto Rico next Wednesday for possible redemption " We have a big challenge in front of us to do that same thing , " expressed Buddle .
" To go in their home and to do what they did to us .
I 'm going to try to put this behind me as quickly as possible , but it does hurt right now .
[ And I just have to ] try to move forward and tomorrow will take care of itself . "
" It 's incredibly difficult to go anywhere and score four goals , " explained Donovan .
" But the flip side to that , if they were able to score four here , we should be able to score four there .
We 're going to go for it and see what happens . "
Thomas DiLorenzo ’s recent columns at LewRockwell.com are well worth reading ( “ Glenn Beck ’s Lincoln Contradictions ” ; “ see also , How the Lincoln Myth Was Hatched ” ) .
They emphasize Puritan religious fanaticism aimed at using the government to create the morally perfect society .
As explained by Murray Rothbard in “ America ’s Two Just Wars : 1775 and 1861 ” ( in John Denson , ed. , The Costs of War , Transaction Publishers , 1997 , p. 128 ) :
The North , in particular the North ’s driving force , the “ Yankees ” – that ethnocultural group who either lived in New England or migrated from there to upstate New York , northern and eastern Ohio , northern Indiana , and northern Illinois – had been swept by a new form of Protestantism .
This was a fanatical and emotional neo-Puritanism driven by a fervent “ postmillennialism ” which held that , as a precondition for the Second Advent of Jesus Christ , man must set up a thousand - year Kingdom of God on Earth .
To the Yankees , their “ kingdom ” was to be a “ perfect society ” cleansed of sin , the principal causes of which were slavery , alcohol , and Catholicism .
Furthermore , “ government is God ’s major instrument of salvation , ” Rothbard wrote .
This is why the Yankees never seriously considered ending Southern slavery how THEY had ended it in their own states – peacefully through some kind of compensated emancipation .
They were not so concerned about the welfare of the poor slaves .
Indeed , even Tocqueville noticed that “ the problem of race , ” as he phrased it , was worse in the North than it was in the South .
Instead , as Rothbard continues :
The Northern war against slavery partook of fanatical millennialist fervor , of a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions , to commit mayhem and mass murder , to plunder and loot and destroy , all in the name of high moral principle and the birth of a perfect world .
The Yankee fanatics were veritable Pattersonian humanitarians with the guillotine : the Anabaptists , the Jacobins , the Bolsheviks , of their era .
This analysis of the Puritans also reflects David Hackett Fischer ’s Albion ’s Seed ( 1989 ) and Kevin Phillips ’ The Cousins ’ Wars : Religion , Politics , and the Triumph of Anglo - America ( 1999 ) , and I used it in trying the fathom the depths of WASP pathology ( e.g. , here ; academic version ) .
The fact is that all of the Jewish intellectual movements discussed in The Culture of Critique were fundamentally aimed at some kind of moral perfection — exactly the weak spot of WASP America .
DiLorenzo points out that the neocons have used this weapon in order to rationalize wars ( KM : on behalf of Israel ) but framed as great moral crusades :
“ The neocon establishment , which is influential in both major political parties , believes in just the opposite : ‘ entangling alliances ’ and endless military interventionism with as many nations as possible , all in the name of some undefinable Great Moral Cause , in the tradition of Dishonest Abe . ”
Charles Krauthammer is a perfect example of an American Jewish intellectual who cynically exploits the tendency among Whites for moral idealism and universalism in order to advance his narrow ethnic intererts .
Here he is pushing war against the entire Muslim world :
Beyond power .
Beyond interest .
Beyond interest defined as power .
That is the credo of democratic globalism .
Which explains its political appeal : America is a nation uniquely built not on blood , race or consanguinity , but on a proposition — to which its sacred honor has been pledged for two centuries … .
Today , post - 9/11 , we find ourselves in an…existential struggle but with a different enemy : not Soviet communism , but Arab - Islamic totalitarianism , both secular and religious . …
At some point , you have to implant something , something organic and self - developing .
And that something is democracy .
( Democratic Realism )
Here is U.S. District Court of Appeals Judge Simon Rifkind testifying in 1951 on behalf of pretty much the entire organized Jewish community on how America should approach immigration :
We conceive of Americanism as the spirit behind the welcome that America has traditionally extended to people of different races , all religions , all nationalities . [!]
Americanism is a tolerant way of life that was devised by men who differed from one another vastly in religion , race background , education , and lineage , and who agreed to forget all these things and ask of a new neighbor not where he comes from but only what he can do and what is his spirit toward his fellow men .
Rifkind , whose remarks were quite famous at the time , defines Americanism in moral terms as implying tolerance and positive feelings toward others .
Like Krauthammer , the national interest of the United States is not the critical issue .
We should pursue Rifkind ’s multi-racial utopia without concern for economic benefits to the US :
Looking at [ selective immigration ] from the point of view of the United States , never from the point of view of the immigrant , I say that we should , to some extent , allow for our temporary needs , but not to make our immigration problem an employment instrumentality .
I do not think that we are buying economic commodities when we allow immigrants to come in .
We are admitting human beings who will found families and raise children , whose children may reach the heights — at least so we hope and pray .
For a small segment of the immigrant stream I think we are entitled to say , if we happen to be short of a particular talent , “ Let us go out and look for them , ” if necessary , but let us not make that the all - pervading thought .
( p. 570 ) [ see Culture of Critique , Chap. 7 , pp. 278-279 . ]
DiLorenzo points out that Puritan publicists created the mythic Abe Lincoln out of thin air , and those who defied the duty to deify Lincoln did so at their peril–quite reminiscent of what happens to people who contravene the current standards of political correctness .
Jews are remarkably immune to moral crusades when it comes to Israel .
Then it ’s ethnic politics with a vengeance , and lofty ideals about multi-racial immigration are non-starters .
The New England WASPs seem particularly disposed to such behavior , although other Whites seem predisposed as well .
“ Ideas worth fighting for , ” as Justice John Paul Stevens had it .
No non-White group seems inclined in this direction .
In my view , this proclivity stems ultimately from Western individualism as an ethnic trait :
In individualist societies where relatedness beyond the immediate family is not important , ideas with great emotional appeal have a group - binding function , resulting in cohesive , emotionally motivated ingroups willing to mete out punishment to outgroups defined not on the basis of kinship but on the basis of their beliefs .
On the other hand , in collectivist societies like Judaism cohesion is ultimately a matter of kinship relatedness , and ingroups and outgroups are defined ethnically .
It is worth noting that the 19th - century Puritan intellectuals loved the German idealist philosophers .
One of Willhem Marr ’s most interesting observations is his proposal that
Germans formed idealistic images of Jews during the Enlightenment when others had more realistic and negative views .
Jews are realists , accepting the world as it is and advancing their interests based on their understanding of this reality .
Judaism is characterized by particularlst morality ( Is it good for the Jews ? ) .
Germans , on the other hand , tend to have idealized images of themselves and others — to believe that the human mind can construct reality based on ideals that can then shape behavior .
They are predisposed to moral universalism — moral rules apply to everyone and are not dependent on whether it benefits the ingroup .
In large part the problem confronting Whites stems from our psychology of moralistic self - punishment exemplified at the extreme by the Puritans and their intellectual descendants , but also apparent in a great many other Whites .
As Fischer noted , “ New England … had the lowest relative rates of private crime ( murder , theft , mayhem ) , but the highest rates of public violence — ’ the burning of rebellious servants , the maiming of political dissenters , the hanging of Quakers , the execution of witches ’ ” ( p. 189 ) .
These people will eagerly use government against the politically incorrect , morally reprobate ne ’er - do - wells in their midst .
The best strategy for a collectivist group like the Jews for destroying Europeans therefore is to convince the Europeans of their own moral bankruptcy .
A major theme of [ The Culture of Critique ] is that this is exactly what Jewish intellectual movements have done .
They have presented Judaism as morally superior to European civilization and European civilization as morally bankrupt and the proper target of altruistic punishment .
The consequence is that once Europeans are convinced of their own moral depravity , they will destroy their own people in a fit of altruistic punishment .
The general dismantling of the culture of the West and eventually its demise as anything resembling an ethnic entity will occur as a result of a moral onslaught triggering a paroxysm of altruistic punishment .
Thus the intense effort among Jewish intellectuals to continue the ideology of the moral superiority of Judaism and its role as undeserving historical victim while at the same time continuing the onslaught on the moral legitimacy of the West .
( see here )
The main difference between the Puritan New Jerusalem and the present multicultural one is that the latter will lead to the demise of the very
White people who are the mainstays of the current multicultural Zeitgeist .
Unlike the Puritan New Jerusalem , the multicultural New Jerusalem will not be controlled by people like themselves because the non-White ethnic actors will act on the basis of narrow ethnic interest , not high principle .
The ultimate irony is that without altruistic
Whites willing to be morally outraged by violations of multicultural ideals , the multicultural New Jerusalem is likely to revert to a Darwinian struggle for survival among the remnants .
But the high - minded descendants of the Puritans wo n’t be around to witness it .
Posted by John , July 4th , 2010 - under Julia Gillard , Resource Super Profits tax .
The big mining bosses have won .
Gillard has dumped the Rudd Resource Super Profits
Tax faster than oil began spewing into the Gulf of Mexico .
To give the impression of compromise she and her mining masters – BHP , Rio Tinto and Xstrata – have adopted a Minerals Resource Rent Tax ( MRRT ) .
One capital markets analyst has called this a win for the big miners .
How so ?
Let me count the ways .
Only iron ore and coal will be covered .
Resources like copper , uranium , nickel , bauxite and gold are no longer included .
BHP ’s Olympic Dam anyone ?
But hang on .
Was n’t the whole point about the mining tax that the resources belong to us and mining companies are getting a free ride ?
Yes .
So they will continue to get that free ride if the minerals are not iron ore or coal .
The number of companies subject to the tax will plummet from 2500 to 320 .
The headline rate has been cut from 40 percent to 30 percent .
But like all things about this ‘ compromise ’ the new headline rate is misleading .
A 25 percent extraction allowance means the real rate of the tax is 22.5 percent .
The uplift rate has been increased from the long term bond rate of almost 6 percent by 7 percent added on top to 13 percent .
The trade of is that the Government will no longer fund to 40 percent the risk of projects failing .
This will adversely impact on small iron and coal explorers especially but have no effect on BHP , Rio Tinto and the like .
The government has effectively abandoned applying the tax to existing projects .
They have used a market value / book value sleight of hand to do this .
The end result is that the big mining companies will have an artificially inflated cost base to wipe out much of the ‘ super ’ profits on existing projects .
And after 1 July 2012 capital expenditure on projects covered by the MRRT will be recoupable .
The Government estimates there will only be a slight fall in revenue collected – $ 10.5 billion compared to $ 12 billion .
This looks like a pile of steaming hot dung to me , based on the concessions given .
But given the tax does n’t kick in till 2012 , who will know or care in two years time how much the tax raises ?
The tax cuts for business and the infrastructure spending will be paid out of our toil and public goods , not out of profits and that will set the pattern for future company tax cuts and other benefits to business .
The Government claims that both the RSPT and MRRT are going to be used to pay for superannuation .
More rubbish .
First the amount being spent on topping up low paid workers is about 3 percent overall of the estimated tax collected .
Most of the revenue will go in tax cuts for all business , accelerated depreciation for small business and infrastructure spending for the big miners – ports , roads and train lines .
Second , the idea that the business tax cut ( now held at 29 percent rather than 28 percent ) will fund the superannuation guarantee charge increase from 9 to 12 percent over six years is wrong .
Those increases will come out of wages .
Unions will negotiate wage cuts equivalent to the scheduled gradual increases .
Historically Labor ’s role – apart from disorienting the working class movement with attacks on it – has been to makes reforms for the benefit of capital generally , sometimes at the expense of sectional interests .
The backdown on the RSPT means that that role for Labor is now dead and it too is a captive of , or will pander to , special business interests .
Part of the scare campaign the mining magnates ran against the RSPT was the likely increase in unemployment .
Nowhere in the announcement from Gillard has there been any indication that the Labor Government negotiated , let alone sought , any agreement from the miners about employment levels .
There is nothing at all from Labor on securing jobs in exchange for the sellout on tax .
So the mining bosses who sacked 15 percent of their workforce during the Global Financial Crisis are free to do the same in the future .
What a disgrace from Labor .
This back down on taxing the big mining companies shows just where the ALP ’s priorities are when it comes to capital and labour .
This is a Government moving rapidly to the right and hoping that jump will win it re-election .
Mr. Daniel said the company used internal inspection tools to determine the levels of corrosion or cracking on all pipelines .
There had not been any repairs or replacements made to the part of the pipe where the spill took place , he said .
State officials here have expressed grave concern over the environmental impact if the spill reaches Lake Michigan , more than 60 miles away .
Officials for the Environmental Protection Agency , which is leading the response efforts , said Thursday that they were confident that they could prevent that from happening .
Ralph Dollhopf , a federal coordinator for the agency , said efforts by response workers had so far stopped the oil from entering Morrow Lake , about 30 miles downstream from the site of the spill .
“ We do not anticipate that Lake Michigan is at risk , ” he said at a news conference .
Still , officials said it could take months to clean up the spill , which was believed to be among the largest ever in the Midwest .
Hundreds of response workers continued on Thursday to lay boom , skim the water and conduct flyovers to assess the damage .
Nothing to read here …. go away .. seriously …

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama signed into law on Wednesday the most comprehensive financial regulatory overhaul since the Great Depression , vowing to stop risky behavior on Wall Street that imperiled the U.S. economy .
Influential business groups lined up to criticize the new law , underscoring Obama ’s uneasy relationship with America ’s business community .
Some on Wall Street , however , welcomed the clarity offered by the law after months of wrangling in Congress over what should be in the legislation .
The law , which got final approval from the Senate last week , targets the kind of Wall Street risk - taking that helped trigger a global financial meltdown in 2007 - 2009 and also aims to strengthen consumer protections .
Obama , facing voter unrest over Wall Street bailouts that have failed to spark a strong Main Street job recovery , pledged taxpayers would never again have to pump billions of dollars into failing firms to protect the economy .
“ Because of this law , the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street ’s mistakes , ” Obama said at a signing ceremony attended by some Wall Street bankers , business leaders and lawmakers .
“ There will be no more taxpayer - funded bailouts .
Period . ”
With Republicans poised to make gains in the November congressional elections , Obama ’s Democrats are eager to show voters that they have taken steps to tame an industry that dragged the economy into its deepest recession in 70 years .
Obama and Democrats have yet to gain political traction from the legislative victory , with Americans still anxious about a 9.5 percent jobless rate and ballooning deficits .
The financial regulatory reforms were a major achievement for Obama and his ambitious domestic agenda .
Earlier this year he signed into law sweeping reforms of the United States ’ $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system .
The financial reforms won Democrats few friends on Wall Street .
Wealthy donors have started to steer more campaign contributions to Republicans , who voted overwhelmingly against the reforms .
“ UNSCRUPULOUS LENDERS ”
Obama had harsh words for “ unscrupulous ” lenders and others he said had taken risks that endangered the economy .
He said the new law was aimed at curbing abuses and excesses on Wall Street and stopping taxpayer bailouts of failing companies .
The law would provide certainty “ to everybody from bankers to farmers to business owners .
And unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers , you have nothing to fear from this reform , ” Obama said .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , an influential business group that often criticizes Obama ’s economic policies , said it would have the opposite effect .
“ Such a broad , sweeping bill epitomizes a law with unintended consequences that creates more uncertainty for American businesses , ” said Thomas J. Donohue , president and CEO of the Chamber .
The American Bankers Association expressed disappointment with the legislation , saying it “ contains a tsunami of new rules and restrictions for traditional banks that had nothing to do with causing the financial crisis in the first place . ”
Slideshow ( 10 images )
Much of its impact will depend on how it is put into practice .
Bart Chilton , a commissioner with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , said the law boosts transparency and gives regulators better tools to regulate markets , but many questions remained to be answered .
“ This is a wide - ranging bill with many facets , hundreds where regulators still need to put some more meat on the bones .
How we do that , and when we do that , are questions that will really tell if this legislation meets the expectations of its supporters , ” he said .
“ FAKE CONTROVERSY ”
Ruth Porat , chief financial officer of financial giant Morgan Stanley , which on Wednesday reported higher - than - expected second quarter profits , said the company was pleased to see the bill signed as it put “ some clarity around the issues . ”
The legislation targets potentially lucrative trading in risky over - the - counter derivatives and aims to force banks to end trading for their own profits .
It creates a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to regulate products ranging from credit cards to mortgages .
The administration considered this one of the most critical parts of the bill but banks fought it bitterly .
Obama received repeated ovations during his speech and one round of applause was reserved for his praise of three Republican lawmakers who broke ranks with their party to vote for the legislation .
The White House said Citigroup Inc ’s CEO Vikram Pandit ; Bob Diamond , president of Barclays Plc ; and Gerald Hassell , president of Bank of New York Mellon , attended the bill - signing .
JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was one of the few major bank heads not invited , a spokeswoman for the second - largest U.S. bank said .
Dimon once enjoyed a close relationship with Obama , but he later emerged as a vocal critic of the efforts to reform the U.S. banking industry .
The White House dismissed as a “ fake controversy ” media reports on the failure to invite business leaders like Dimon .
“ The CEOs who opposed reform never expected to be invited to the bill signing and not a single one has complained to the Administration , ” White House spokesman Jen Psaki said .
I have used most of the torrent clients out there for Windows ( utorrent , vuze , Mainline , bittornado , etc ) and I have also used most of the torrent clients available for Linux ( Transmission , Deluge , halite , Ktorrent , qbittorrent , rtorrent ) .
Out of all these the one that I used most of the times in Utorrent on Windows XP .
There is no match for Utorrent on Windows XP or any other Windows based operating System because its light and fast .
While using Windows I having Ubuntu installed on other partition .
But I never actually used it for using bit - torrent .
One day I decided to completely switch to the Linux as I found myself using it most ( 98 % ) of the time .
I removed the Windows XP and now Ubuntu is the only OS on my machine .
As a regular Bittorrent user I felt completely lost as I could not found the proper alternative to utorrent as I was addicted to it and I knew it completely from inside out .
Ubuntu came with transmission by default .
But I did not liked it much as it was not upto my expectations .
Then I tried few others and I found myself settled with the Vuze as I was familiar with it and I was getting decent speeds .
But one after an update it started to annoying me , It was eating my memory like a crazy and such a behavior is just not acceptable .
So i dumped it and started looking for something else .
One day at some forum I read a post about rtorrent and It actually attracted me as I feel quite comfortable with the command line .
So I installed it and started playing with it .
But my initial experience with it was not so good and it took me about one week to completely understand it and use it efficiently .
Now I am using rtorrent on daily basis without any problem and I was never been this much satisfied with a torrent client before .
It just blows away every other client with with its speed , efficiency and elegance .
I am going to write this tutorial so that others can benefit from my experience and they dont have face the problems that i faced .
My this tutorial will be mainly targeted towards Ubuntu users but it will be equally helpful for the users of any other Linux distro .
This tutorial is divided into 3 sections i.e. Installation , Configuration and Usage .
So here I go :
INSTALLATION :
Installation of rtorrent is very simple , simple follow the following steps
1. For Ubuntu and Debian users just issue the following command :
sudo apt - get update sudo apt - get install rtorrent
And this will install the rtorrent for you .
2. For Fedora users just issue the following command :
sudo yum install rtorrent
Now rtorrent is installed on your system .
3 . For those who want to install by compiling from source can download the latest version from here
If there is any problem installing it from source then ask me for help in the comments .
4 . To check if rtorrent is correctly installed you can run from terminal by typing
rtorrent
When you will first start it , it will show a warning that configuration file .rtorrent.rc not found .
Just ignore it .
I suggest that you never run rtorrent as a root .
CONFIGURATION :
Before we begin configuration you need to create few directories which will be used by rtorrent .
Suppose that your user name is foo .
Then the user foo will create the following directories .
1. Default directory to save the downloaded torrents .
Open your terminal and issue the following command without root ( sudo ) .
mkdir /home / foo/ rDownloads
The above command will create a directoy named rDownloads in your home directory where your dowloaded torrents will be saved automatically .
Remeber that you must change foo with your own username .
2. Default session directory .
This is very important as it will contain data related to your download , paused , completely torrents .
mkdir /home / foo/session
This will create a directory in your home directory of name session and it will be used by rtorrent to save its current session .
Alright now you have created the directories required so now we can move on to the actual configuration part .
So first of all download this files and save it on your computer .
Now open the file with your favorite text editor .
You will a long file with some stuff in it .
Well all this stuff is what we are going to configure now .
The first thing that you will see is something like this :
# Maximum and minimum number of peers to connect to per torrent .
# min_peers = 40 # max_peers = 100
Now change it to exactly as shown below
# Maximum and minimum number of peers to connect to per torrent .
min_peers = 50 max_peers = 80
Now the next thing to change is this :
# Maximum number of simultanious uploads per torrent .
# max_uploads = 15
change it to this :
# Maximum number of simultanious uploads per torrent .
max_uploads = 4
Now change this :
# Global upload and download rate in KiB. " 0 " for unlimited .
# download_rate = 0 #upload_rate = 0
Into this :
# Global upload and download rate in KiB. " 0 " for unlimited .
download_rate = 0 upload_rate = 50
Now change this :
# Default directory to save the downloaded torrents .
# directory = ./
Into this :
# Default directory to save the downloaded torrents .
directory = /home / foo/ rDownloads
( replace foo with your username )
Now change this :
# Default session directory .
Make sure you do n't run multiple instance # of rtorrent using the same session directory .
Perhaps using a # relative path ?
#session = ./session
Into this :
# Default session directory .
Make sure you do n't run multiple instance # of rtorrent using the same session directory .
Perhaps using a # relative path ?
session = /home / foo/session
( replace foo with your username )
Now change this :
# Port range to use for listening .
# port_range = 6890-6999
Into This :
# Port range to use for listening .
port_range = 60125-64125
Now change this :
# Start opening ports at a random position within the port range .
# port_random = no
Into This :
# Start opening ports at a random position within the port range .
port_random = yes
Now change
This :
# Check hash for finished torrents .
Might be usefull until the bug is # fixed that causes lack of diskspace not to be properly reported .
# check_hash = no
Into This :
# Check hash for finished torrents .
Might be usefull until the bug is # fixed that causes lack of diskspace not to be properly reported .
check_hash = yes
Now change this :
# encryption = allow_incoming , enable_retry , prefer_plaintext
Into This :
encryption = allow_incoming , try_outgoing , enable_retry
Now change this :
# dht = auto # UDP port to use for DHT .
# # dht_port = 6881 # Enable peer exchange ( for torrents not marked private ) # # peer_exchange = yes
Into This :
dht = auto # UDP port to use for DHT .
# dht_port = 63425 # Enable peer exchange ( for torrents not marked private ) # peer_exchange = yes
Alright now your configuration is complete .
Now save the file and copy the file into your home ( / home / foo ) directory .
And issue the following command .
mv rtorrent.rc /home/foo/.rtorrent.rc
This command is simply to hide the rtorrent.rc file
USAGE :
Now using rtorrent is very simple .
Open your terminal and write
rtorrent
without root and hit enter
you will see a screen like below
The above screenshot is having the following useful information .
To demonstrate the usage to rtorrent we will download the latest version of Ubuntu from here via torrent .
So download the torrent file and save it in your computer .
I downloaded the file and saved it in / home / harbhag / where harbhag is my username for the system .
Now hit ENTER and the above screen will change to the one like below :
Here you can see that in the end of the screen is load > , so here rtorrent is asking to load the torrent file to start download .
Now press TAB and you will a screen like the one below
Here it is showing the list of all the Directories and files present in my home directory .
Now you can see that in the end of the list it is showing torrent file that i just downloaded .
If you also saved the file in your home directory then you will also see this file ( ubuntu - 10.04 - desktop-i386.iso[www.tuxdistro.com].torrent) along with the other files and directories present in your home directory .
Now enter u ( first letter for the torrent file ) and hit TAB and it will automatically load the torrent file for you like below .
Now hit ENTER and your screen change to the one like below :
your torrent is loaded now but its not downloading yet to start the download press UP or DOWN arrow and you will see stars in front of the name of torrent you just added like below :
Now press
Ctrl key and s key together ( i.e. Ctrl+s ) and your torrent will start downloading and the numbers on the bottom of the screen will start changing .
Congratulations now your have successfully loaded your first torrent in the rtorrent .
To stop the downloading press Ctrl+d and your torrent will stop and if you press Ctrl+d the torrent will got deleted .
To quit the rtorrent first stop all the torrents you are downloading by pressing Ctrl+d and then press Ctrl+q to quit the rtorrent .
If you will press the RIGHT arrow key while the stars are in front of the torrent , then you will see a screen like below :
Here you can find lots of information regarding peers and trackers and many more .
To exit from this screen to go back to previous screen just press the LEFT arrow key .
So thats all for now .
If you have any problem regarding this tutorial or you are having slow speed or your are not able to do anything i explained here then you can ask me for help in the comments .
Good luck , cheers .
Improvements :
Well one of my reader ( Ellidi ) suggested me in comments that torrents should be loaded in to rtorrent automatically as adding them manually is little more overhead .
So now I am going to explain how to do it .
You need to change the file ( rtorrent.rc to make this feature work .
So open the file and change it as below :
gedit /home/foo/.rtorrent.rc
and change this :
# Watch a directory for new torrents , and stop those that have been # deleted .
# schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=./watch/*.torrent #schedule = untied_directory ,5,5, stop_untied=
Into this :
# Watch a directory for new torrents , and stop those that have been # deleted .
schedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=/home/foo/watch/*.torrent #schedule = untied_directory ,5,5, stop_untied=
And then create the watch directory
mkdir /home / foo/ watch
And dont forget to replace foo with you username .
So from now on rtorrent will automatically start downloading the torrents that you will save in watch ( / home / foo / watch ) directory .
And if you will delete the torrent from the rtorrent , it will be automatically deleted from the watch directory .

American doctors in the Middle East routinely approved the torture of captured suspects and denied them critical medications such as insulin , sometimes with lethal consequences , according to a documented report published in the " Utne Reader . "
In Dec. , 2002 , Defense Secy .
Donald Rumsfeld issued a directive allowing interrogators to withhold medical care in nonemergency situations so that " men with injuries including gunshot wounds were denied treatment as a way to make them talk , " writes author Justine Sharrock .
Although the directive was soon revoked , " the practice continued , " she said .
Interrogations conducted at the infamous Abu Ghraib correctional facility in Baghdad had to be preapproved by a physician and psychiatrist , and the CIA got like orders for the punishments it inflicted at its sites .
Sharrock quotes medic Andrew Duffy of the 134th medical company of the Iowa National Guard who told her the attitude of Abu Ghraib�s medical officers toward prisoners was " screw these guys " and who said he was ridiculed for trying to save one man�s life using CPR .
Long after the world - shaking Abu Ghraib photos were published in 2004 and the Pentagon vowed to stop abusing prisoners , " men were still being strapped into restraint chairs and left in the sun for hours or locked in cells too small to lie down in , " Sharrock writes .
" The medics regularly found prisoners dehydrated , wrists bloody from overtight handcuffs , ankles swollen from forced standing , joints dislocated from stress positions . "
( Abu Ghraib�s former commandant Gen. Janis Karpinski once estimated 90 % of the prisoners were innocent . )
In one instance involving detainee No. 173379 who appeared to need an insulin injection , medics were told to inject the man instead with saline solution using a 14 - gauge needle more than two millimeters in diameter of the sort that was used as punishment or to discourage prisoners from seeking care , MP�s doused him with pepper spray and stuck him in a tiny cell in the scorching heat , Sharrock writes , and he died the next day .
Duffy�s written complaint to his supervising captain disappeared .
Pentagon top health official doctor William Winkenwerder Jr. in 2005 allowed military physicians to participate in torture and share medical records with interrogators so long as a detainee wasn�t officially their patient , Sharrock writes .
Winkenwerder , she adds , got an award from the American Medical Assn. ( AMA ) that year for outstanding contributions " to the betterment of the public health . "
The AMA has refused to condemn Pentagon and CIA torture practices and made no response when in Feb. , 2006 , the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemned U.S. doctors for having " systematically " participated in detainee abuse .
Bioethicist Steven Miles of the University of Minnesota Medical School said the U.N. condemnation should have been " a call to arms " yet " the AMA said nothing . "
Sharrock said none of the AMA�s top officials she contacted would comment on her story .
Nor has any State licensing board , which have the authority to suspend licenses , " ever disciplined a doctor for assisting in military torture .
As for the American Psychiatric Assn. , in May , 2006 , its President Steven Sharfstein noted that psychiatrists " wouldn�t get into trouble " if they heeded military orders over the APA�s advice that members should not directly assist in interrogations , which he added should not be considered " an ethical rule , " Sharrock writes .

The Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah , after decades of anti-Israel and anti-U.S. violence , has decided to try something new and open an amusement park .
The million - dollar attraction , enticingly named " Museum for Resistance Tourism , " includes documentary videos , an aerial tramway , and a terrace called " The Abyss " that showcases remnants of Israeli tanks .
Located on the Lebanese mountain town of Mleeta , the museum is meant to cement Hezbollah , which was founded only in the 1980s , into the ancient and storied Lebanese culture .
ABC News ' Lara Setrakian visits the center that is sometimes called " HezbollahLand " :
Rami has a ready answer when asked if the museum advances terrorist propaganda .
" I believe it 's our right to have our own propaganda .
The important thing is that this is the sincere and true propaganda . "
Despite its militant edge , the museum is part of an effort to soften Hezbollah 's image .
It 's designed to be the centerpiece of a massive tourist development - dubbed " HezbollahLand " in the global press – capped with an aerial tramway offering scenic rides from Mleeta to an abandoned Israeli base on a nearby hill .
...
That , analysts say , is where the museum fits into Hezbollah 's overarching strategy : fighting Israel in times of war , and in times of peace , investing in ways that seal a bond with its followers .
Hezbollah runs hospitals and builds homes , partly under the umbrella of its " Construction Jihad " – hardening its constituents by giving them a social safety net and improving their quality of life .
Wired 's Spencer Ackerman adds some context on Hezbollah 's fighting on the culture front :
Hezbollah is hardly the only anti-Israel organization attempting to fight the Jewish state with pop culture and entertainment .
As Danger Room co-founder Sharon Weinberger has reported , Hamas has its own movie studio .
But “ HezbollahLand ” takes terror tourism to a whole new level .
“ We ’re going to build motels , playgrounds , camping areas , even spas or swimming pools so that all of the visitors — especially our people — can come here and spend their weekends or vacations , ” the guide says .
In case you decide against traveling to HezbollahLand , here 's a short video that should really be more than sufficient :

A Christchurch food bank wants volunteers to deliver its food parcels , but only if they are Christian .
Kerry Bensemann , a born - again Christian who runs the 0800 Hungry food bank , said he was unable to keep up with the demand because the church community was not behind him .
He said many of the 120 orders could not be delivered on Friday last week , and he had the same problem on Thursday .
Bensemann , a former truck driver , said that while the warehouse had adequate staff , the charity 's policy was that parcels could be delivered only by members of a church .
He said many church groups were unwilling to help when asked if they could deliver food in their area .
One group had told him it was too busy .
He said he had turned down help from non-religious people .
" I know it sounds really , really stupid , but you 've got to understand how we 're set up . "
He said the aim was to increase church involvement , and having the food delivered by non-religious volunteers would defeat the purpose .
" It 's like sending someone who plays ping - pong out to play for the All Blacks . "
He said he was not attacking church groups , but wanted to encourage them to do more .
Other food banks said they were thankful for any volunteers .
City Missioner Michael Gorman said the organisation had its roots in the Anglican Church , but it welcomed any volunteers .
A video of someone lighting their tap water on fire certainly grabs peoples attention and for good reason , this astonishing phenomena is what filmmaker Josh Fox shows time and time again in his Sundance Film Festival award winning documentary “ Gasland ” .
Focussing on the plight of people across the US whose water and land have become polluted to astonishing levels by companies like Halliburton using a technique called “ hydraulic fracturing ” to extract natural gas from thousands of feet underground .
The DVD is available now and Gasland has been showing on HBO intermittently since June 21st , if you have n’t seen it make sure you do , it makes the importance of a fossil fuel free future that little bit more clear .

Gasland The Movie

This amazing piece of machinery was the last of the purebred 50 cc Suzuki racebikes built in 1967 .
And it ’s a technological as well as aesthetic masterpiece : the engine was tuned to an extraordinary 350 hp per liter .
The RK67 motor was a two - stroke , water - cooled parallel twin , and the Japanese factory managed to squeeze a remarkable 17.5 hp out of it , with a redline of 17,300rpm .
To keep the bike in its extremely narrow power band , Suzuki fitted the bike with a 14 - speed gearbox .
The RK67 also sported an aluminum frame , and tipped the scales at a skinny 58kg ( 128lbs ) : in the hands of Suzuki ’s three factory riders , top speed was a healthy 176kph ( 109 m ph ) .
The 50 cc class was first run in 1962 , with Suzuki immediately setting the pace .
But strong competition from Honda during the mid 60s forced Suzuki to develop micro-masterpieces like the RK67 .
In 1967 , German rider Hans - Georg Anscheidt won the 50 cc World Championship aboard the RK67 , and with teammates Yoshimi Katayama and Stuart Graham , helped Suzuki lift the manufacturer ’s crown too .
Then the FIM announced in 1967 that it planned to limit future 50 cc racing engines to a single cylinder and six transmission speeds .
So Suzuki stopped the development of its next model , the 3 - cylinder RP68 , and withdrew from the World Championship at the end of 1967 .
However , Anscheidt ran the RK67 in the 50 cc class in 1968 , as a privateer — and once again won the Championship .
A fitting swansong to one of the most remarkable racing motorcycles of all time .

====================================
I do n’t have a dog in this fight , as this is between two people with opposing viewpoints , but I ’m happy to pass on this rebuttal from Christopher Monckton , who writes :
Professor Abraham , who had widely circulated a serially mendacious 83 - minute personal attack on me on the internet , has had a month to reply to my questions .
I now attach a ) a press statement ; b ) a copy of the long letter in which I ask the Professor almost 500 questions about his unprovoked attack on me ; and c ) the full subsequent correspondence .
I ’d be most grateful if you would circulate all this material as widely as you can .
The other side has had much fun at my expense : without you , I ca n’t get my side heard , so I ’d be most grateful if you would publicize this material .

============================================
From : The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley
I am most grateful to Anthony Watts for having allowed my letter asking Professor Abraham some questions to be circulated , and to so many of you for having taken the trouble to comment .
I have asked a good firm of MN libel lawyers to give me a hard - headed assessment of whether I have a libel case against Abraham and his university , or whether I ’m taking this too seriously .
I am charmed that so many of you are fascinated by the question whether I am a member of the House of Lords .
Perhaps this is because your own Constitution denies you any orders or titles of nobility .
Here is the answer I recently gave to the US House of Representatives ’ Global Warming Committee on that subject :
“ The House of Lords Act 1999 debarred all but 92 of the 650 Hereditary Peers , including my father , from sitting or voting , and purported to – but did not – remove membership of the Upper House .
Letters Patent granting peerages , and consequently membership , are the personal gift of the Monarch .
Only a specific law can annul a grant .
The 1999 Act was a general law .
The then Government , realizing this defect , took three maladroit steps : it wrote asking expelled Peers to return their Letters Patent ( though that does not annul them ) ; in 2009 it withdrew the passes admitting expelled Peers to the House ( and implying they were members ) ; and it told the enquiry clerks to deny they were members : but a written Parliamentary Answer by the Lord President of the Council admits that general legislation cannot annul Letters Patent , so I am The Viscount Monckton of Brenchley ( as my passport shows ) , a member of the Upper House but without the right to sit or vote , and I have never pretended otherwise . ”

In today 's Android - enabled world , QR codes play quite an important role because , face it , who wants to type that long , pesky URL on your phone 's keyboard when you can just quickly scan an image and have the URL decoded in a split second ?
Why do I say with such confidence that QR codes are now a commodity ?
Have a look at this awesome chart AppBrain posted yesterday .
See Barcode Scanner , whose primary purpose is to scan QR codes ?
A whopping 63.8 % of Android users have it installed on their phones - in fact it's the # 3 most installed application .
Every respectable Android site uses QR codes in one way or another - sites like AppBrain offer a QR code on every application page , and when we do app roundups , like this 8 Great Apps Every Rooted Android User Should Know About one , we try to include QR images as well .
Of course , Froyo has the ability to push links between your phone and your browser directly , as we discussed here , but Froyo will take some time to spread , and wo n't ever arrive to some phones .
Additionally , you 'd need to have an add - on or extension handy , which is not always the case .
Tip #
1
But enough introduction .
The tip here today lets you create QR images so mind blowingly fast that you will never have to type a long url into your phone 's browser again [ if you 're next to your computer ] .
The premise is simple : Google Charts API is awesome enough to include QR generating capabilities .
If you load up this url :
and append any url after it , you will instantly get yourself a nice QR code .
For example ,
produces :
If I read this image with Barcode Scanner , here 's what I get :
If you want to vary the size of the generated QR code , just adjust the chs parameter .
Follow this API link for more info about the rest of the parameters .
Excellent .
What I did at first was save the first URL above in a bookmark named QR in my Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar for quick access .
This worked great for a while , but still was n't good enough as it required 2 page loads - 1 to load the bookmark and 1 to reload it with the URL I want the QR code for .
Tip # 1 , meet tip # 2 .
Tip #
2
The second tip will speed up what we got in the first one to 0 clicks and a single operation .
However , it only works in Firefox , which you , hopefully , are already using .
Right click on the bookmark you 've created in tip # 1 , go to Properties , and add a Keyword " qr " .
Append " %s " at the end of the URL to produce this :
http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=150x150&chl=%s
Save your bookmark .
Now , whenever you need to generate a URL to a page , go to the Firefox URL bar and type in
" qr " , space , URL , Enter
where URL is the address you want to encode in the QR code .
Alternatively , if you 're already on a site you want to encode , just go to the URL bar
hit Home , " qr " , space , and Enter
Brilliantly simple , is n't it ?
Credit goes to this Reddit post for tip # 2 .

What is your best Android related tip ?
After the sexual assault allegation against Al Gore surfaced last month , a friend told me : “ I hope it ’s not true . ” I do n’t .
Here ’s why :
No one wants to believe that gender - based violence — - like sexual assault and domestic abuse — - happens .
And so , friends hope it ’s not true .
Neighbors hope it ’s not true .
Classmates hope it ’s not true .
Parents hope it ’s not true .
Football fans hope it ’s not true .
Liberals hope it ’s not true .
Anonymous Internet commenters hope it ’s not true .
People who happen to be attending a wrestling tournament at Seneca Valley High School hope it ’s not true .
Reporters hope it ’s not true :
The Frisky ’s coverage of the recent domestic abuse allegations against “ Family Matters ” star Jaleel
White included the line , “ We certainly hope this report is untrue . ”
To draw from one of the few “ Lost ” principles applicable to sexual assault reporting :
Whatever happened , happened .
Either a sexual assault occurred , or it did n’t .
The only thing “ hoping ” can influence is whose account is supported after the fact .
Commentators have hoped it ’s not true for the alleged perpetrator ’s sake and for the alleged victim ’s sake — - as if any amount of hoping could erase a sexual assault — - but “ hoping ” never helps a victim .
It only helps an onlooker who does n’t want to believe that bad things happen — - and a perpetrator who benefits from the assumption that they do n’t .
Victims of sexual assault frequently report being victimized twice .
“ That day in court was the day I fully understood the concept of being raped twice — - first during the act and then later during the court proceedings , ” Latoya Peterson writes in “ The Not - Rape Epidemic . ”
But hoping it ’s not true functions well outside the legal burden of proof .
It works to shut victims down before any evidence is presented , before the crime is reported , even while the assault is still happening —
- Gore ’s alleged victim says that she feared that “ if I made dissent with Gore , I could be in danger of being falsely arrested for false allegations of alleged soliciting or even attempted assault in his efforts to do damage control . ”
When we “ hope it ’s not true , ” we state our willingness to participate in this re-victimization .
We ’re not hoping that our criminal justice system works to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent .
We ’re hoping that the person who reported the sexual assault is a liar .
We ’re hoping that people who claim to be victims of sexual assault are all lying , that it never really happens .
We ’re hoping , in the end , that bad things do happen — - to good men who are victimized by bad women .

Balls - out 60 Minutes ( 1968 ) Producer Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino ) sniffs a story when a former research biologist for Brown & Williamson , Jeff Wigand ( Russell Crowe ) , wo n't talk to him .
When the company leans hard on Wigand to honor a confidentiality agreement , he gets his back up .
Trusting Bergman , and despite a crumbling marriage , he goes on camera for a Mike Wallace ( Christopher Plummer ) interview and risks arrest for contempt of court .
Westinghouse is negotiating to buy CBS , so CBS attorneys advise CBS News to shelve the interview and avoid a lawsuit .

In yet another terrifying expose , The Washington Post continues to lift the veil on just how massive the US government ’s spying operation has become .
Dana Priest — whose Pulitzer prize winning journalism exposed the existence ofÃ‚Â U.S. secret prisons abroad , continues in today ’s story to show just how much money is being shelled out to the private companies that now operate the lion ’s share of America ’s spy network .

It ’s not just AT&T that operates or once operated a secret call center in San Francisco intercepting your phone calls anymore :
From the road , it ’s impossible to tell how large the NSA has become , even though its buildings occupy 6.3 million square feet – about the size of the Pentagon – and are surrounded by 112 acres of parking spaces .
As massive as that might seem , documents indicate that the NSA is only going to get bigger : 10,000 more workers over the next 15 years ; $ 2 billion to pay for just the first phase of expansion ; an overall increase in size that will bring its building space throughout the Fort Meade cluster to nearly 14 million square feet .
More than 250 companies – 13 percent of all the firms in Top Secret America – have a presence in the Fort Meade cluster .
Some have multiple offices , such as Northrop Grumman , which has 19 , and SAIC , which has 11 .
In all , there are 681 locations in the Fort Meade cluster where businesses conduct top - secret work …
The existence of these clusters is so little known that most people do n’t realize when they ’re nearing the epicenter of Fort Meade ’s , even when the GPS on their car dashboard suddenly begins giving incorrect directions , trapping the driver in a series of U - turns , because the government is jamming all nearby signals …
Once this happens , it means that ground zero – the National Security Agency – is close by .
But it ’s not easy to tell where .
Trees , walls and a sloping landscape obscure the NSA ’s presence from most vantage points , and concrete barriers , fortified guard posts and warning signs stop those without authorization from entering the grounds of the largest intelligence agency in the United States .
Drinking or over - extending your credit card limit is a no-no .
Inside the locations are employees who must submit to strict , intrusive rules .
They take lie - detector tests routinely , sign nondisclosure forms and file lengthy reports whenever they travel overseas .
They are coached on how to deal with nosy neighbors and curious friends .
Some are trained to assume false identities .
If they drink too much , borrow too much money or socialize with citizens from certain countries , they can lose their security clearances , and a clearance is the passport to a job for life at the NSA and its sister intelligence organizations …

Training spies is a serious job , apparently :
That white van is followed by five others just like it .
Inside each one , two government agents in training at the secretive Joint Counterintelligence Training Academy are trying not to get lost as they careen around local roads practicing “ discreet surveillance ” – in this case , following a teacher in the role of a spy .
The real job of these agents from the Army , U.S. Customs and other government agencies is to identify foreign spies and terrorists targeting their organizations , to locate the spies within and to gather evidence to take action against them .

The white farmer who 's part of a controversy involving ousted Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod says he believes she 's been wronged .
" I hope she does get her job back -- if she wants it , " Roger Spooner told USA TODAY 's Gregory Korte .
" I do n't think they 've done it right .
But I can see where she 's undecided about what she wants to do , " Spooner said .
Sherrod , the USDA 's director of rural development in Georgia , said she was asked to resign by department officials on Monday after conservative bloggers posted an edited video of her saying that she initially did n't give a white farmer ( Spooner ) as much help as she could have 24 years ago .
At that time , Sherrod was working for a non -profit farm aid group and was not a federal employee .
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said today that he is reconsidering Sherrod 's dismissal and reviewing her case .
Sherrod told our Gannett colleagues at WXIA - TV that she is n't sure if she would go back to her Ag Department post -- even if she is asked .
In the videotaped speech , Sherrod said the farmer from Iron City , Ga. , " was trying to show me he was superior to me " when he first came to her non-profit group for help to save his property .
Later , she said , she and Spooner got to know each other and became friends .
" I do n't recall I had that attitude , " Spooner told USA TODAY .
" That was n't my thinking .
I was asking for help . "

Immigrant women also experience the U.S. immigration system in a way that is distinct to men , and often leaves them at a disadvantage .
In Miami in February 2009 , Rita Cote ’s sister called 911 to seek police protection after a domestic violence incident .
Ms. Cote ’s sister had lawful immigration status but had a limited capacity to speak English .
Law enforcement agents asked for identification for everyone at the scene .
Ms. Cote urged the agents to first address the domestic violence issue but they insisted that Ms. Cote ’s sister could only press charges by going to the police station .
After Ms. Cote showed her passport to the officers the officers arrested her , and took her away .
The domestic violence crime went unaddressed .
Stories such as this are far too common .
According to Sreeharsha , lawmakers and others often overlook the specific immigration reforms necessary to ensure that women are treated equally and fairly .
If not done right , CIR may inadvertently create new barriers to women and establish eligibility criteria that are beyond the reach of some immigrant women .
For example , a CIR package must include a path to legalization that values the contributions of immigrant women as part - time and informal workers .
Without immigration reforms , many immigrant women will continue to lack economic access , experience separation from their families , and be subjected to exploitation and criminal activity .
The report makes the following recommendations :
Legalization must equitably value women ’s work : Avenues for legalization that value work must recognize and ‘ count ’ the range of immigrant women ’s work in the informal economy such as domestic work , child care , and home health care .
Part - time and contract work , as well as work for multiple employers , must count toward legalization .
Because many recent legalization proposals have required full - time employment or schooling , they fail to take into account the unique barriers faced by many undocumented women .

Legalization fee structures must ensure incentives for immigrant families to apply for legal immigration status for all eligible family members .
High fees may limit the number of applications a family can afford , resulting in applications only being filed by and for male heads - of - household .
Fees must be on a sliding scale so that they are not cost - prohibitive for low - wage women workers .

CIR must reduce family visa backlogs :
Because women disproportionately immigrate through family - based channels , they are especially vulnerable to long backlogs , which heightens women ’s dependency on partners and increasing the likelihood of exploitation by family members and employers .
Measures to promote family reunification and reduce backlogs will thus particularly benefit immigrant women .

Improve personal security and autonomy by expanding access to independent immigration status :
When women attain legal status based upon a family relationship , other family members gain control over whether she ever attains legal status .
This dynamic can jeopardize women ’s autonomy and safety .
Immigrant women ’s economic and physical security is enhanced when they can independently obtain legal immigration status .

Eliminate local law - enforcement partnerships such as 287( g ) and Secure Communities :
These partnerships result in undocumented immigrant women being drawn into the immigration - enforcement system as victims and witnesses of domestic violence and other crimes .
Crime perpetrators , abusive spouses , and abusive and exploitative employers call DHS to report undocumented immigrant victims for deportation .
This very effective power - and - control tactic silences crime victims and keeps them from seeking help .

Reform the immigration detention system in order to not re-victimize vulnerable immigrant women detainees .
Such reforms must include meaningful access to health services .
All detainees should be screened and undergo a risk assessment that evaluates vulnerable immigrants such as crime victims , pregnant women , sole caretakers , and those with health conditions so that they can be allowed to seek alternatives to detention , humanitarian release , or release on their own recognizance .
Ultimately , the author concludes , only through a comprehensive immigration reform package — meaningful reform that values the contributions immigrant women make as mothers , wives and workers — can we reconcile these disparities .
Imagine that while a slick death spreads across the Gulf of Mexico , a group of respected reporters from America ’s best - known media companies attend a pool party hosted by the VP of British Petroleum .
Imagine that they take their kids to play with the kids of executives from BP and the oil industry , and that the journalists claim to have had a wonderful time and post pictures , and videos and tweets of their perfectly friendly interactions with the people who are responsible for the greatest environmental catastrophe in a generation .
Now imagine those journalists , a few days after the party , claiming that their integrity had not been compromised , and that they are perfectly capable of reporting accurately and aggressively on the doings of BP and the oil industry .
Would you believe them ?
Hold on to that answer , and consider this :
No such meeting happened with BP .
But on the grounds of the Naval Observatory last weekend , Vice President Joe Biden and the DNC hosted a pool party for their friends in the Washington journalism industry .
It was “ a nice way to spend a hot Saturday afternoon , ” according to the Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder .
It was also a great way for the journalists in attendance — Wolf Blitzer and Ed Henry of CNN , as well as David Sanger of the New York Times — to reveal that their integrity is water soluble .
Ambinder ’s defense is the stock defense of all those involved in this seamy underworld of co-optation :
This is how Washington works .
Power holders like to socialize , and journalists only stand to gain by getting as close to them as they can whenever an opportunity presents itself .
And in case anyone doubts that getting super - soaked by a boat - shoed Rahm Emanuel wo n’t lead to scoops that serve readers , well , what the hell do you know ?
Probably not as much as Ambinder , the editor of the politics channel at the Atlantic , a political consultant to CBS , and a former editor at ABC News .
And now a flack for the Obama White House .
According to Salon ’s Glenn Greenwald , “ All of this just helpfully reveals what our nation ’s leading ‘ journalists ’ really are : desperate worshipers of political power who are far more eager to be part of it and to serve it than to act as adversarial checks against it — and who , in fact , are Royal Court Spokespeople regardless of which monarch is ruling . ”
Ambinder does n’t see it that way .
“ A bunch of really good , hardened , news - breaking , interest - accountable holding reporters are in fact able to share more comfortable moments with people they cover . ”
In other words , only the best journalists are fit for “ convivial commingling ” with the powerful .
Lesser beings would come at the administration the next time around with a soft touch , a bashful smile and lowered eyes , like a recently deflowered newlywed facing his spouse for the first time in the post - coital light .
But not Sanger , who engaged in “ teasing banter ” with Emanuel .
And certainly not Ambinder , who still manages to eke out every now and again a piece with which the Obama administration is not completely happy .
These men , and their sycophantic ilk , are seasoned tramps who like the sex , but know they can get it anywhere .
When his readers took him to task Tuesday morning for brushing off potential questions of bias , Ambinder turned on his critics .
“ I think that attending a nice Biden event does less damage to the profession than not acknowledging the ambiguities inherent in trying to live life as a young reporter in Washington .
The reaction to my post has been uniformly negative , but then again , people rarely take the time to comment favorably . ”
This mentality is n’t new , but for the first time , it ’s news .
Yes , Al and Tipper threw Halloween parties ; Ted Kennedy threw Christmas parties , and the Cheneys threw occasional cocktail parties .
And thanks to the restraint of journalists of yesteryear , their readers and viewers in podunk shitholes never knew that a secret relationship existed between press and politician ; if they did know , they did n’t know to what extent .
They did not know about Anne Kornblut ’s submissively saccharine pool reports or Richard Wolffe ’s recurring acts of treason against the practice of honest journalism .
But they know now .
So perhaps Ambinder et al should be commended for voluntarily revealing the extent to which they ’ve been corrupted by Beltway culture .
The insidery pap that was on display last week at Biden ’s abode is n’t just bad for America , it ’s also killing journalism .
And reporters who ca n’t see the line in the sand can bet their bought - and - paid - for asses that having to drop their chickens parmigiana at a moment ’s notice wo n’t always be their biggest problem .

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said on Sunday that he was under pressure from the international community to begin direct negotiations with Israel .
He told the PA ’s Voice of Palestine radio station that he would enter direct talks only if progress was first achieved on the future borders and security of a Palestinian state .
Without “ clear and specific references , ” the negotiations would collapse from the beginning , Abbas said .
In an apparent reference to repeated statements by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu that he was willing to meet with Abbas in Ramallah or Jerusalem , Abbas said , “ We are not against meetings , whether in Ramallah or Tel Aviv , ” but that the “ reference for negotiations ” needed to be set .
“ After that , we are ready to go anywhere .
The entire world is asking us to go for direct negotiations , but going to negotiations without a clear reference might make them collapse from the first moment .
” Abbas has said repeatedly that he would enter into negotiations only if they were based on an Israeli commitment to a Palestinian state based on the pre-Six Day War lines .
On Sunday , he also reiterated his demand that Israel freeze construction not only in the West Bank settlements , but also in east Jerusalem .
Abbas said that in recent days he had received phone calls from the leaders of Britain , Germany and Italy urging him to agree to direct talks .
He is also expected to come under additional pressure when US envoy George Mitchell returns here later this week .
Arab League foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in Cairo on Thursday and discuss whether to support a resumption of direct talks .
Abbas gave the interview while on his way to Uganda to attend the 15th Assembly of the African Union .
Addressing the conference , he said that the Palestinians had chosen peace as a strategy , adding that Israel ’s policies undermined the twostate solution and would plunge the region into another cycle of violence .
Also on Sunday , Netanyahu met in his office with visiting Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim , fresh off the plane from a meeting earlier in the day in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki .
AFP quoted Mottaki as saying after the meeting that Iran was ready to immediately start talks with the Western powers over a nuclear fuel swap proposal that Turkey , Brazil and Iran signed in May .
World powers rejected that deal , saying it was too little , too late , and instead backed a fourth round of UN sanctions .
They did , however , leave the door open for talks on the matter .
Although Iran was believed to have been on the agenda during the Netanyahu - Amorim meeting , Israeli sources downplayed the significance of the foreign minister ’s visit , saying it was to a large extent an attempt by Brazil to raise its profile on the world stage .
Amorim is expected to meet later this week in Damascus with Syrian President Bashar Assad .
Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visited Israel in May .
The results of the Press Photographer 's Year 2010 were announced last night .

Is Afghanistan really the next El Dorado ?
Color me skeptical .
The past few weeks have seen a spate of news suggesting that the US / NATO effort in Afghanistan is n’t going well at all .
For starters , the assault on Marjah last spring failed to achieve any decisive strategic goals .
The much - heralded summer offensive in Kandahar has been delayed and downgraded , and U.S. officials have been steadily lowering expectations .
We learnt over the weekend that U.S. intelligence is increasingly focused on uncovering corruption , which means we are getting sucked back into " nation - building " instead of focusing our assets on destroying al Qaeda ( which is what President Obama said he ’d do when he ( foolishly ) decided to increase the U.S. commitment in Afghanistan .
The Taliban managed to bomb Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s semi-bogus " peace jirga , " and Karzai himself is said to be losing faith in our ability to prevail and hoping to cut a deal with the Taliban .
So today — surprise , surprise — comes news that Afghanistan is n’t a poor country whose primary strategic asset is its ability to grow opium poppies .
Nope , turns out Afghanistan is just brimming with iron ore , lithium , cobalt , copper , and other strategic minerals .
This report — which comes from " a small team of Pentagon officials and American geologists " may well be completely correct , but is n’t the timing of the release a mite suspicious ?
This looks to me like an attempt to provide a convincing strategic rationale for an effort that is n’t going well .
As Jack Snyder noted in his book Myths of Empire , the " El Dorado " myth is a common justification for imperial expansion .
Great powers often convince themselves they have to control some far - flung area because it is supposedly rich with gold , diamonds , oil , etc. , and that physical control is essentially to preserving access to them .
In most cases , however , the cost of trying to control these areas is n’t worth the resources they contain , and it usually is n’t necessary anyway .
Gulf
Oil used to pump oil from Marxist Angola , and those pesky Iranians would be happy to sell us oil and gas and give us fat development contracts for their petroleum industry if only we were willing to do business with them .
We do n’t need to control Afghanistan in order to gain access to whatever minerals do exist , because whoever is in charge is going to have to sell them to someone and wo n’t be able to prevent them from being sold to us ( even if indirectly ) if we want to buy ( that ’s how markets work ) .
And if we want to make sure that U.S. companies have the opportunity to compete for the opportunity to mine these resources some day , it might be a good idea if we did n’t spend the next decade blundering around and angering the local population .
An innocuous segment on KTLA about the best cars for road trips became a showdown between reporter Gayle Anderson and a parking attendant at a Santa Monica beach lot .
While live on camera , the attendant started writing up numerous tickets for the 11 vehicles KTLA parked at the lot .
Anderson claimed , while still on camera , that they had paid for the parking -- the meter maid was having none of it and continued dispensing tickets .
After some national gossip blogs picked up the hilarious video , the Santa Monica Police Department issued a public statement on this ( yes , Santa Monica does have bigger problems ) .
From Santa Monica PD : " On May 25 , 2010 , at 8:58 a.m. , traffic officers from the Santa Monica Police Department received a call for service from the parking manager of the 1550 beach lot ; Central Parking .
The caller reported that several vehicles were in the parking lot refusing to pay .
Upon arrival , a Traffic Service Officer was advised by the attendant that eleven vehicles were parked in parking spots and had not paid .
The attendant advised that his supervisor approached the news crew at 7:40 a.m. and advised them they needed to pay for the parking spots .
The news crew promised to pay for the spaces before 9:00 a.m .
When the attendant approached the news crew at 8:50 a.m. to pay for the parking spaces , they ignored him .
The parking attendant contacted his supervisor to call the Santa Monica Police Department .
A Traffic Service
Officer approached the news crew and advised them she was there to address the issue of not paying for the parking spaces .
A representative from the news crew stated they had already paid for the spaces and had a permit .
The traffic service officer asked the representative for the receipt and permits .
The representative walked away and did not come back .
At 9:20 a.m. , the traffic service officer issued four citations for failing to pay to the vehicles that were parked in parking spaces .
Although the news reporter stated on the live television broadcast that they had paid for the parking spaces at the time the officer was issuing the citations , the news crew actually paid for the parking spaces at 9:40 a.m. , after the citations were issued . "

One chief executive overboard , a $ 17bn loss over the past three months and $ 32bn in clear - up costs .
No doubt about it : BP has got off lightly for its part in the Gulf of Mexico disaster .
Think about it : the multinational is ultimately responsible for spewing anywhere between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels off the Louisiana coastline – every day for months .
The result has been a human tragedy , killing 11 workers and leaving others involved with the clear - up bill .
It has been an environmental disaster , with thousands of dead animals .
It has also been an economic catastrophe , leading to a seven - week fishing ban in an area with a huge fishing industry and to a plunge in tourism .
And it has caused a convulsion in American politics , with Barack Obama coming under heavy artillery for not being hard enough on the oil giant behind the entire tragedy .
It even blew up into a diplomatic issue , featuring in those initial discussions between the US president and David Cameron .
With a rap sheet like this , other companies would not just have racked up a multibillion - dollar loss ; they would have suffered the corporate equivalent of a public lynching and gone under .
None of this is to play down what has actually happened to BP .
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon will cause the oil giant to pay out billions in the months and years to come ( hence the setting aside of $ 32bn ) ; it will have to sell off its own holdings and will shrink as a result .
But having had a near - death experience , it now looks as if the worst is behind it .
That must certainly be the thinking of executives , or else they would not have dared to acclaim boss Tony Hayward as the " model of corporate social responsibility " , and packed him off with a year 's extra salary and benefits ( worth £ 1 m ) and a pension pot valued at about £ 11 m .
That must also be why they held on to chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg , whose invisibility as chairman during his company 's existential crisis was swiftly explained by the crassness of his comments when he did surface ( referring to the locals whose livelihoods were devastated by the Gulf oil spill as " the small people " , indeed ) .
If Mr Hayward 's exit from the top job is a case of career destruction by disastrous publicity and thoughtless comments ( " It may not have been a great PR success , " he said yesterday , which should go in the OED below the entry for " understatement " ) then Mr Svanberg surely deserves the same fate .
Despite BP 's attempt yesterday to draw a $ 32bn line underneath the Deepwater affair , there is still the possibility that it may haunt oil executives for a few more months .
If investigations into the oil rig's explosion find that BP has been guilty of gross negligence ( an accusation the company denies ) then the penalty payout will rocket .
And the multinational will have to work hard and long to repair relations with politicians , officials and customers in a market worth some 40 % of its business .
But in other respects it could have been so much worse for BP .
For a start , the US shows no sign of weaning itself off its addiction to oil , as demonstrated by the collapse last week of the Democrats ' plan for a bold new energy bill .
That just adds to the upward pressure on oil prices for the next 10 to 15 years , as sources of plentiful and cheap crude continue to dry up .
That is no bad result for oil - exploration companies like BP .
And it is also worth noting that other countries are perfectly willing to have Tony Hayward 's firm come and drill off their coasts ; by this Christmas , the big BP offshore - drilling project we will all be talking about will be Libyan , not American .
So a dreadful episode for one of the world 's biggest companies draws to a close , costing tens of billions of dollars , yet business carries on as usual .
The only lessons learned will be minor ones , about PR .
But we have still to learn the big one – that the world needs more alternatives to costly , disaster - prone oil exploration .
Yes , it is legal .
Metro Louisville ordinance clearly permits persons living on half an acre or less to keep one rooster and five hens in an enclosed area .
Yes please , and thank you .
Do n’t mind if we do .
That urban chicken keeping is a trend on the uptick now seems indisputable .
I ’m willing to bet most LEO readers have at least heard talk of , or know folks who are building coops and keeping chickens in their yard .
To the charge that it is simply a fad , I submit that , unlike tight - rolling the cuffs on your jeans or owning a pot - bellied pig , keeping chickens has significant foundational ethics , namely changing perceptions about food , self - determination and community .
Add to that the simple pleasure of hanging out in your yard , free eggs and , if you choose , a chicken dinner once in a while , and you ’ve got the makings of a phenomenon on your hands .
If you stare at a chicken very closely , I mean if you really look at the bird with the intention of seeing it , you ’ll recognize they ’re descended from dinosaurs .
They ’re old .
Really old .
The intimate cooperation between chickens and humans is old as well :
The birds were first domesticated in Asia around 8,000 years ago .
In this country , it was common for households to keep chickens until just after World War II when many Americans , enticed by the convenient offerings of post - war modernity , covered their victory gardens with patio furniture and turned their chickens loose .
But renewed economic challenges , skepticism of industrially produced foods whose origin is often unclear , and the longing - come - need for some measure of self - reliance are compelling more folks to start tending kitchen gardens the way their parents ’ and grandparents ’ generations did .
Likewise , more people are discovering that keeping chickens is an inexpensive and surprisingly manageable way to complete the cycle of successful small - scale gardening and greater food independence .
Ben Block of the Worldwatch Institute sums up the situation by saying , “ The chicken has become the mascot of the local foods movement . ”
Chickens will eat just about anything we call food and plenty of things we would n’t : corn cobs , rinds , bugs , seeds , stalks , grass clippings , etc .
What used to be called waste is now referred to as “ residuals ” in the green lexicon .
Chickens love residuals , and the dividends are paid in fresh eggs and rich fertilizer .
One chicken can consume up to 7 pounds of kitchen scraps per month .
That ’s 364 pounds of trash diverted from the landfill annually per bird .
Adding the resultant chicken poop to your compost will speed up the composting process , amp up the available nitrogen , and is worth its weight in gold in your garden .
Chickens do n’t know better than to work for next to nothing .
They ’ll turn your compost pile for you as they forage for scraps , and they ’re walking bug killers that help keep pests out of your garden , though they ’ll nibble on your crops given half a chance .
While chickens can live on kitchen scraps alone , their diet should be supplemented with some grain feed in the form of crumbles and scratch .
A 50 - pound bag of good feed costs between $ 10 and $ 15 and , in conjunction with lots of kitchen scraps , will feed four hens for a month or so .
How much did you spend on eggs last month ?
Do you know what the hens that laid those eggs were eating ?
As master gardener Steve Paradis says , “ It ’s not what you feed yourself that counts , it ’s what you feed your food . ”
Keeping chickens is a project that comes with a deluge of literature and advice , which can seem overwhelming and intimidating .
But the chicken owners I spoke with assured me that , as is the case with gardening , composting and “ other affairs of plain living , ” it ’s really not that difficult , and getting started is the biggest step .
On a mild evening a few weeks back , I took a walk in Shelby Park with a friend .
We passed by some kids playing in the fountain near the community center , and stopped for a minute to watch a football team running drills out on the turf .
It was a pleasant , if largely unremarkable , stroll through an inner city park .
Having grown up in Louisville in the ’ 80s , I recall seeing exactly zero live chickens in the city , but there , about 30 feet away from the sideline of the rumbling scrimmage , we found a small backyard with four tidy , raised garden beds , a children ’s play house , and a chicken coop bustling with activity .
On our walk around Shelby Park that evening , we found three homes where folks were keeping chickens .
After his tour in Iraq , Dane Beam and his wife , Kristy , moved to Louisville .
The couple and their three children have lived in the Shelby Park neighborhood for a year and half and bought their chickens from an Amish farmer last fall .
The Beams have three laying hens and a rooster , and are brooding two new hens in their kitchen to be introduced to the flock in a few weeks .
“ They say if you ’re going to have a rooster , you should have at least five hens .
These older hens are a little ‘ over - worked ’ right now , ” Kristy says , chuckling .
Just then , a large and distinctly oversexed Leghorn named Davy Crockett took the opportunity to peck , mount and generally harass his harem .
The Beams say they ’d get rid of the rooster if the neighbors ever complained about the noise .
So far , though , their neighbors have only said how much they love the sound of a rooster on the street , and the neighborhood kids come by often to check in on the birds .

When I asked them why they decided to raise chickens , the couple cites the economic recession and a growing distrust of the industrial model of food production as primary concerns .
“ We want access to higher quality food and nutrition , ” Kristy says .
“ But a family of our size , and we hope to grow , we ca n’t afford to buy all the organics we need . ”
The Beams feed their chickens all of the kitchen scraps they produce and are getting two - four eggs per day from the mature layers .
They plan to eat the hens when their laying days are over and are keeping a garden for the first time .
Knowing they can produce at least some of the food they need rather than “ going to the super market and getting it all from a box ” affords the couple a sense of security , says Kristy .
“ What are we going to do if we go to the grocery one day and there ’s no food on the shelf ?
You ’ve got a whole generation of people out there who do n’t know how to feed themselves . ”
Steve Paradis is the owner of Fresh Start Growers ’
Supply , a garden supply and feed store that specializes in organic seeds , fertilizer , feeds and tools for the urban gardener .
As Paradis sees it , he and the folks who come through his door are engaged in a food revolution that seeks to , “ Reclaim the food system from an industry that is profit motivated , not health motivated . ”
People who support community agriculture are interested in supporting both community and agriculture .
It could be said of the local food movement that getting good food into people ’s bellies is of secondary importance to creating community ties and allowing people the opportunity to know where their food comes from .
Paradis suspects a measure of food independence is n’t the only thing his customers are looking for when they come in to buy seeds , chicks or feed .
“ People are tired of feeling isolated , they ’re tired of the Internet and driving around in their cars , and they want some connectivity to nature , ” he says .
“ In a world that seems out of control , if you can control your food , it can be a remedy for the things that are so chaotic . ”
In gardening and keeping chickens , Paradis believes people engage in “ something meaningful , simple and gentle that you can share with your friends . ”
In addition to being an ecologist , an educator , and the founding member of the International Porch Sitters Union , Claude Stephens also is a husband , father and aspiring “ urban homesteader . ”
We spoke at his Irish Hill home recently where Claude , his wife , Erin , and their daughter Ruby keep four hens .
Like many people who want to be as self - sufficient as possible , Stephens figured he ’d end up in the country someday , owning and working a parcel of land , but his ideas about sustainability have led him to a belief that he can get more of what he wants here , in the city .
“ In the city , you have more face - to - face communication , easier access to people , ” he says .
“ There are walkable neighborhoods , restaurants .
There ’s community .
Everybody can’t have 40 acres .
There ’d be no space .
But you can farm in the city , and cities should try to feed themselves as close to the city as possible ”
Stephens sees keeping chickens as a means to some very utilitarian ends : eggs , meat , the ability to turn waste into food and the potential for a barter economy .
But he finds the greatest value to be something other than a measure of practical independence .
Stories and education are the real keystones .
“ In the South , we tell stories , that ’s how we pass on knowledge , ” he says .
“ In my line of work ( as a sustainability consultant and educator ) , I talk about sustainability all the time , and I always end up telling stories about my chickens . ”
Stephens makes sure to show me a short home movie of his 2 - year - old daughter feeding the chickens in their coop .
In the video , Ruby runs back and forth in a loop alternately squealing , petting the chickens and throwing more feed than they can possibly eat into a rough - hewn wooden trough .
She is visibly excited , totally in her element , and very much at home .
“ The most important thing is reconnecting kids with food , and the kids in my community already know more about chickens than their parents do , maybe not their grandparents , but more than their parents , ” Stephens says .
“ We ’ve taught Ruby that you have to lock the door to the coop when you leave .
If I ever forget to do that , she ’ll remind me .
She ’s learned . ”
The coop Stephens built for his hens is both practical and good - looking .
Inside the large enclosed run that ’s attached , he ’s got just about everything you ’d expect : a couple of cans of feed with tight - fitting lids , some hay , and a medicine cabinet mounted to the wall with a small bottle of whiskey inside , “ Just in case I have guests , ” he says .
I notice the feeding trough that I ’d seen in the video , and Stephens explains he built it himself using wood from a picnic table his grandfather built .
“ I ate at that table my whole life .
Three generations of my family ate at that table , ” which eventually became too worn for the purposes of dining .
“ I guess it ’s four now , if you count the chickens . ”
If you have been reading FILEnetworks for some time you probably already know about ‘ The . BZ ’ tracker family ( if you do n’t then read this article ) .
TBZ studios are the driving force behind four very unique trackers in the BitTorrent scene ; The Box , The Vault , The Place and The Occult .
This post however is not about any one of these sites ; it ’s about TBZ ’s latest project , ‘ The Empire ’ ( also known as TE ) .
The Empire is a private torrent tracker for TV and radio shows .
It however is not just another TV tracker indexing content you can already find on BMTV , TVT .COM and a dozen other sites .
TE specializes in shows from commonwealth countries – television shows from Canada , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand and other regions may be found here .
If you download TV shows over BitTorrent , you might want to keep an eye on this site – not only because it tracks rare content but because when it comes to creating specialized trackers , TBZ usually kick ass .
An announcement of TE ’s launch was made on its sister site ‘ The Box ’ .
Quoted below is a post by TBZ staff which explains the story behind ‘ The Empire ’ .
Behind the scenes at TBZ Studios , we 've been working on a new project that we 're finally ready to unveil to the world ...
TheBox has become one of the go - to places on the internet for your favorite British show cravings .
We got to thinkin ' : " Would n't that be great to provide this awesomeness to users in other countries ? "
Well , look no futher as we 're proud to present : http://www.TheEmpire.bz.
TheEmpire , or TE for us lazy typers , will be dedicated to the finest television and radio broadcasts from the commonwealth countries ; countries such as Canada , Australia , and New Zealand just to name a few .
Here 's a complete list of countries .
We 've opened up 5,000 slots for immediate signup and we 're offering it to users of TheBox first .
So if you like your Commonwealth TV and Radio , go ahead and reserve your slot today at http://www.theempire.bz/signup.php and help us make it a great site !
So please look around , upload some shows you 've got sittin ' on the computer , and play in the forums .
This should be a whole bunch of fun !
~ t.bz staff
Although just a few hours into the final launch , TE already indexes around 125 torrents .
Expect this number of rapidly increase in the coming days as news of the launch spreads in the BitTorrent community and TE ’s uploader team expands .
TV & radio shows including soaps , reality , travel , wildlife , documentaries , kids shows , drama , comedy , news , game shows , sports , talk shows , mystery , crime , etc from a number of different countries ( full list of allowed countries here ) will be indexed here .
The screenshot below captures some of the torrents already indexed on TE :
As stated in the forum post by TBZ SysOp ( quoted above ) , public signups for The Empire will be open until the site reaches 5000 users .
It ’s good to see them trying to start off with a decent user base instead of restricting new registrations – being ‘ too private ’ can also lead to the downfall of a new tracker .
Expect the free signup slots to be filled up pretty soon .
TE will have the backing of thousands of users who are already members of the TBZ family plus this is likely to be a hot topic in BitTorrent news forums and blogs , which will drive more members to this tracker .
Site Name : The Empire ( http://www.theempire.bz)
Signup URL : http://www.theempire.bz/signup.php
Special thanks to Peter Vig for sending us this news .
Note :
If you would like to be part of others sites in TBZ network , all trackers including The Box , The Vault and The Occult ( except The Place ) are currently open for signup .

Sen . David Vitter , that prostitute frequenting , diaper wearing , family values touting Republican joked Rachel Maddow not looking like a woman on a local New Orleans radio show .
Vitter later apologized , and Maddow classily accepted his apology , but this just furthers Vitter ’s trend of anti-gay and anti-woman behavior .
Here is the audio and transcript from Crooks and Liars :
Advertisements
MALE HOST : I wonder if Senator Vitter is ever going to post , like , maybe the video of the first time he was on the floor of the Senate .
FEMALE HOST : Yeah , that would be cool !
MALE HOST : …. If I have to show the way I looked the first time I was on TV , you should do that too .
VITTER :
We should go further back than that , how about high school yearbook ?
MALE HOST : Oh yeah .
VITTER : De La Salle marching band .
MALE HOST : That ’d be cool .
Well you know , with Rachel Maddow they had that picture of her …
FEMALE HOST : Looking like a woman .
MALE HOST : Yeah it was really bizarre .
VITTER : [ LAUGHS ] :
Must have been a long time ago .
ALL THREE : [ HEAVY LAUGHTER ]
I guess according to Vitter , Rachel Maddow because she does n’t have long flowing hair and do her MSNBC show in a dress and heels does not look like a woman .
What does it matter what Rachel Maddow looks or dresses like ?
I guess in “ Real America ” this is what passes for a woman :
According to Greg Sargent at the Washington Post ’s The Plum Line blog , Vitter sent Maddow a written apology :
Dear Rachel ,
Regarding my remark during a radio conversation today , I apologize .
The hosts made their comment and I obviously chimed in .
While we do not usually agree on the
issues , I do not think you deserved that comment .
Sincerely ,
David
Later Maddow accepted Vitter ’s apology :
Dear Senator Vitter —
As a former radio host who knows how on - air exchanges like that can escalate , I both understand how it happened , and appreciate the apology .
Thank you .
Best wishes ,
Rachel
Vitter is the foremost family values hypocrite in the Republican Party .
( Everyone knows about his appetite for prostitutes , and his diaper fetish , ) but he also kept on his staff for two years an aide who pled guilty in 2008 to the attempted stabbing of a girlfriend .
The aide was a legislative assistant for women ’s issues .
None of this has stopped Vitter from endlessly moralizing about Republican and family values .
On June 29th Vitter said , “ There are a lot of us from the South who hold those value , which I think the party is supposed to be about .
We strayed from them in the past few years , and that ’s why we performed so badly in the national elections . ”
Apparently those core Republican values involve gay bashing , marital infidelity , prostitution , and assault with a deadly weapon .
Rachel Maddow is to be commended for the way she handled Vitter ’s remarks , and maybe someday this nation will reach a point where intelligent and highly professional individuals like her can be judged on the basis of their work and ideas , not their sexual orientation .
As for Vitter , earlier this month at their national conference the National Organization for Women called on the Senate to censure and expel him , but in the old boys club that is the United States Senate , what ’s a little gay bashing , hooker loving , and woman hating among friends ?
Vitter is a disgrace but I would n’t hold my breath waiting for the US Senate or the voters in Louisiana to do anything about it .
SAGINAW — Edwyn W. Boyke Jr. , 64 , of Saginaw Township , said he hopes police will return property seized from his home during a raid April 15 — especially the family heirloom , an ought six hunting rifle that the father of Boyke 's deceased wife gave him 25 years ago .
Boyke ’s $ 600 , 42 - inch Toshiba , flat - screen TV , charcoal filter , dehumidifier and four guns , including three hunting rifles and an antique , non-working Russian gun , are still in the possession of the Saginaw County Sheriff ’s Department , 618 Cass in Saginaw — even though Boyke has thus far not been charged with any crimes — Saginaw County Sheriff William L. Federspiel said .
“ I told them they could have them others ones , just leave me that ought six , ” Boyke said .
Federspiel said the agency is holding the items on behalf and at the request of federal agents , who are conducting an investigation into the medical marijuana growing operation Boyke said he had in his basement .
“ Typically , we do n’t keep big screen TVs , ” said Joseph Schihl , Drug Enforcement Agency Resident Special Agent in Charge for the Saginaw Office .
“ We do n’t have any use for any of that ... ”
Schihl said his agency has n’t had time to review the items to make a determination whether they may be released to Boyke .
“ An agent will be going over there to review the evidence and taking what we need for the case , ” he said .
“ And then , when that will take place , I do n’t know .
“ This is not the only case we have going but that will take place in the near future . ”
The April 15 raid was conducted collaboration of the sheriff ’s department and federal agents , operating under a federal search warrant .
At the time , deputies also seized two lawn mowers , a leaf blower , generator and an air compressor from his garage , Boyke ’s 2008 Chevy Impala , $ 62 from his wallet , 52 marijuana plants , five jars of harvested marijuana , Boyke 's medical marijuana card , growing apparatuses , scales and a scales — as well as destroying about $ 7,000 in growing equipment , Boyke said .
Those items were returned following an agreement in which Boyke was required to pay the sheriff ’s department $ 5,000 in cash .
Boyke had a portion of his right temporal lobe removed because of a brain tumor in 1995 and was recommended as a medical marijuana patient to treat pain caused by a pinched nerve in his back .
Boyke admitted to having more plants than are allowed under Michigan law , but said he was n’t aware that dozens of clones that had n’t been transferred to soil counted towards his plant count .

It may be argued that some of the most mysterious , paradoxical art has been produced by reclusive souls .
There are many and I do not intend to list them all .
But some of these artists and literary figures whose work I return to again and again share this same quality .
Henry Darger , Fernando Pessoa , and Emily Dickinson are among my favorites .
Equally , we could say that Kafka , Whitman , and Thoreau ( while writing Walden ) cultivated their art amid the deepest solitudes .

Joseph Cornell is another artist who lived a fairly reclusive life .
His father died of a blood disease in Joseph ’s early teens , and his younger brother developed a severe form of cerebral palsy at age one .
Joseph devoted himself to taking care of Robert , his younger brother , until Robert died at age 54 .
The two siblings lived with their mother in a single - family home in Queens , New York .
Untitled ( Penny Arcade Portrait of Lauren Bacall ) ( 1945 - 46 ) Construction , 20 1/2 x 16 x 3 1/2 in
But there are different types of artist recluses , and Cornell most reminds me of the Portuguese writer , Fernando Pessoa .
Both recluses identified strongly with their urban environments ; the city was part of their solitude .
For Pessoa , it was Lisbon ; for Cornell , Queens and Manhattan .
In an insightful article on Cornell , Adam Gopnik from The New Yorker writes :
Though Cornell was isolated neither in his work ( more people came out to Flushing than visited Max Beerbohm in Rapallo ) nor in his art ( he had galleries and collectors from early on ) , he was isolated in another sense , by choice .
He had discovered the joys of solitary wandering .
Beginning in the early nineteen - forties , his life was structured by a simple rhythm : from Queens via the subway to Manhattan , where he walked and ate and watched and collected , and then back home to the basement and back yard in Queens , where he built his boxes , talked to his mother , and cared for his brother .
The flaneur and the recluse were equally intense .
Cornell chose to be that classic New York thing : a walker in the city .
Untitled ( Medici Boy ) ( 1942-52 ) , Construction , 13 15/16 x 11 3/16 x 3 7/8 in
But what is it about Joseph Cornell ’s boxes that provokes such deep curiosity ?
I ’ve been to the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago to view Cornell ’s boxes six or seven times .
It is not enough to say that these works are enchanting , though they are certainly that as well .
First we have to consider that these are not paintings , nor sculptures , they are not drawings or conceptual works .
The three dimensional box under glass is a singular medium .
Our unfamiliarity of it as a work of art may be the first thing that strikes a viewer .
Untitled ( Medici Princess ) ( c. 1948 ) , Construction , 17 5/8 x 11 1/8 x 4 3/8 in
Beyond that , the three dimensional box under glass is something we peer into rather than simply observe .
The box contains things , collage elements , found objects , various depths and surfaces , multiple textures .
The medium shares the quality of an artist ’s book in the sense that the viewer enters it ; concealment is as much a part of the work as its visible aspects .

Again I ’m going to refer to Fernando Pessoa to make a comparison to Cornell ’s art .
The mystery and paradoxical nature of both of their works ( and with Pessoa , I ’m referring to The Book of Disquiet ) stems from a major characteristic of the reclusive artist : deep and profound longing .
For Pessoa , it is an existential longing ; a longing to be someone else , someplace else .
The narrator ’s intense dream - life overlays his quotidian existence .
But Pessoa ’s ( or the main character , Bernando Soares ’ ) longing is not the sentimental kind ; it is burdened with a self - conscious awareness of his own illusions .
This passage epitomizes the complexity of Pessoa ’s impossible longing :
I myself , who just said I would like a cabin or a cave where I would be free of the monotony of everything , which is my own monotony , would I dare to leave for that cabin or cave , knowing beforehand that since the monotony is mine , I would always have it with me ?
I myself , who suffocate where I am and because I am , where would I breathe better , given the fact that the illness is in my lungs and not in the things that surround me ?
( p. 52 trans .

Pessoa ’s impossible longing , which is existential and literary , is not the same as Cornell ’s , which is emotional and nostalgic .
Cornell ’s longings grew out of his infatuation with the beautiful young girls he found on his solitary wanderings through New York .
Gopnik writes :
But he could fall in love with almost any woman .
His infatuations with the great ballerinas of the emerging City Ballet are famous ; Allegra Kent , who really was a fée , and nearly as original as he was , became a friend .
But he had the same feelings about some pretty improbable movie stars .
Lauren Bacall and Marilyn Monroe , O.K. , but he was also crazy about Sheree North , a now forgotten smoky - voiced soubrette of the fifties .

How did Cornell ’s longings take shape in his glass - covered boxes ?
Many of them were gifts to his favorite actresses ; perhaps shrines to his personal goddesses , or fairies ( as he called them ) .
Parallel to these motivations is the very nature of the boxes themselves .
They contain old things , they preserve found objects , they hold photographs , maps and constellations .
The glass - covered boxes seem to retain the present ; which has now become the past .
Verso of Cassiopeia 1
In The Book of Disquiet , during the brief interims of Bernando Soares ’ workaday life as an assistant bookkeeper , he dreams , he fantasizes , he imagines himself elsewhere .
He would like to be a celebrated writer , but knows this is pure fantasy .
He feeds these fantasies with internal monologues , and records these “ dreams ” in his diary .
But he ’s keenly aware of the brutal , mundane reality of the life he lives .
Similarly , Cornell created boxes filled with longings , spirits even , that could never escape ; could never become reality .
It ’s this living contradiction of the reclusive artist that unites them both .
Untitled ( Apollinaris ) ( c. 1954 ) , Construction , 15 15/16 x 9 3/4 x 4 3/8 in .
Gopnik sums it up brilliantly here :
What ’s nostalgic is that , behind glass , fixed in place , the new things become old even as we look at them : it is the fate of everything , each box proposes , to become part of a vivid and longed - for past , as real and yet as remote from us as the Paris hotel we never got to .

Reclusive artists build interior worlds so vast that their language is the paradoxical and mysterious language of life itself .
Both Joseph Cornell and Fernando Pessoa created art that dramatized our own impossible longings .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Calcium supplements , which many people consume hoping to ward off osteoporosis , may increase the risk of heart attack by as much as 30 percent , researchers reported Friday .
These tiny tablets which carry concentrated doses of calcium were also associated with higher incidences of stroke and death , but they were not statistically significant .
The researchers advised people consuming calcium supplements to seek advice from their doctors , take more calcium - rich foods and try other interventions like exercise , not smoking and keeping a healthy weight to prevent osteoporosis .
“ People regard calcium supplements as natural but they are really not natural at all , ” Ian Reid , professor of medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand , said in a telephone interview .
Reid and colleagues in Britain and the United States conducted a meta- analysis encompassing 11 studies that tracked nearly 12,000 elderly people over four years .
Half of them were given calcium supplements and the other half placebo or dummy pills with no therapeutic content .
The results were published in the British Medical Journal .
“ What we found was a 30 percent increase in heart attacks in the people who were randomized to take calcium , ” Reid said .
“ If you have 1,000 people taking calcium for five years , we will expect to find 14 more heart attacks , 10 more strokes and 13 more deaths in the people given calcium than they would have had if they had n’t been treated with calcium , ” Reid said .
“ That is 37 more adverse events and we expect 26 fractures being prevented .
So calcium is associated with more bad things happening than with bad things prevented . ”
While experts are not certain about the biological mechanism by which calcium supplements may damage the body , studies in the past have linked high levels of blood calcium to more heart attacks and damage to blood vessels , Reid said .
“ When you take calcium supplements , your blood calcium level goes up over the following four to six hours and goes up to the top end of the normal range , ” he said .
“ That does n’t happen when you have calcium to eat in your diet because the calcium from food is very slowly absorbed and so the blood calcium level hardly changes at all . ”
Higher blood calcium may lead to the formation of plaques in blood vessels , which can lead to heart attack , stroke and other cardiovascular diseases , Reid explained .
“ People have always focused on fat levels in the blood as driving that process ( plaque formation ) but there is increasing evidence now that calcium levels in the blood might drive that as well , ” he added .
The FBI says that one of the alleged spies accused of being part of a deep cover espionage ring in the US has confessed to working for Russian intelligence and to constructing a fictitious identity .
But he has refused to reveal who he really is and said that his loyalty to " the service " is worth more to him than his children .
The revelation by prosecutors came as nine of the alleged spies appeared in court yesterday looking dishevelled , sullen and very unlike the highly trained secret agents the US claims them to be .
One of their lawyers said that the evidence against them amounted to no more than proving they had infiltrated cocktail parties and the parent teachers ' association .
In a letter to the New York court , prosecutors said that Juan Lazaro , an academic arrested with his wife , Vicky Pelaez , a newspaper columnist , told investigators that he was in the pay of Russian intelligence and that he had used his wife to deliver information .
But Lazaro refused to disclose information about his true identity – he passed himself off as Uruguayan but FBI bugs heard him tell his wife about his family fleeing to Siberia during the second world war – or his work for Moscow .
" Although he loved his son , he would not violate his loyalty to ' the service ' even for his son , " the letter said in describing Lazaro 's statement .
The letter was submitted in opposition to bail for the alleged spies who made brief appearances at courts in Boston , New York and Virginia .
Prosecutors cited the case of another of the accused , Christopher Metsos , who jumped bail in Cyprus and is the subject of an international manhunt , in emphasising why the nine alleged spies should be kept in detention awaiting trial .
" The charges in this case have revealed that vast swaths of the conspirators ' lives in the United States have been , simply , fraudulent , " the prosecution said .
" There is little need here for speculation as to what will happen if the defendants are permitted to walk out of the court .
As Metsos did , they will flee . "
The 11 accused are charged under a rarely used law of working for a foreign government without registering with the US authorities .
If convicted , they face up to five years in prison .
Nine of them also face money laundering charges , which carry longer sentences .
First to appear at a court in Boston were a couple charged under their assumed names , Donald Heathfield and his wife , Tracey Lee Ann Foley .
Like the other defendants , they were addressed by the names they used as cover – in Donald Heathfield 's case stolen from a Canadian who died in 1963 at six months old – because the FBI has still not been able to establish their true identities .
As Foley entered the court in handcuffs and leg shackles , she smiled at her sons , Timothy , 21 , and Alex , 16 .
The boys waved back .
Their father acknowledged them only at the end of the hearing when he gave them a firm nod and they nodded back .
Heathfield 's lawyer , Peter Krupp , said afterwards that there is no substantial evidence against his client .
" It 's extremely thin .
It essentially suggests that they successfully infiltrated neighbourhoods , cocktail parties and the PTA .
My client looks forward to facing the charges , " he said .
Their bail hearing was postponed for a fortnight because the defence said it needed more time to prepare .
But later in the day the couple were allowed to meet for the first time since their arrest to discuss who should have custody of their younger son while they are imprisoned .
At a court in Alexandria , Virginia , another couple , Michael Zottoli and Patricia Mills , appeared in dark green jail garb with the word " prisoner " stamped on the back .
She stared straight ahead and said nothing to the man she had described as her husband and with whom she has two young children who are now in the care of social services .
Both appeared exhausted and subdued .
The judge agreed to postpone the bail hearing until today after a defence lawyer said he had just been told " new information from the government " which he did not disclose although sources later said it was not related to the prosecution 's letter .
Shortly afterwards another alleged spy , Mikhail Semenko , made a brief appearance .
Semenko , who lived in Arlington and drove a top end Mercedes , asked the court to appoint him a lawyer .
The New York court released Pelaez on $ 250,000 bail although she will be subject to house arrest and electronic monitoring .
Lazaro 's bail hearing was postponed at the request of his lawyers .
But the court denied bail for two alleged spies based in New Jersey , who called themselves Richard and Cynthia Murphy – and who attempted to establish ties to financial and political figures – because the judge said the evidence showed that their identities were fake and their real background a mystery .
However it is known that the Murphys have two young daughters who have been taken in to care .
As questions continued to dog a case that has been met with a mix of mirth , scepticism and outrage in the US , prosecutors in New York said that they had far more evidence against the Russian spy ring than had so far been published .
In their letter to the court , prosecutors said that they had so far revealed only a fraction of the incriminating evidence including scores more intercepted messages between the alleged spies their Russian handlers .
The revelation of further evidence may have been prompted in part by widespread doubts in the US that the supposed spy ring should be taken as a serious threat to national security .
Increasingly , the alleged Russian agents are seen as incompetent and out of date amid widespread questioning of why they used such elaborate undercover methods apparently in search of the kind of information that is often in the public domain .
Another alleged spy , Anna Chapman , was denied bail on Monday .
MI5 is continuing to investigate Chapman 's activities in Britain , according to government sources .
But officials said there was no evidence she posed a threat to the UK 's national security .

Early in his tenure as attorney general , Eric Holder got into hot water for a Black History Month speech in which he referred to America as “ a nation of cowards ” when it comes to racial issues .
The way he was blasted for his comments in some corners — a task made much easier by removing the quote from context — ironically underlined his point :
We could bicker over Holder ’s perceived lapse in patriotism while continuing to dodge the difficult conversation he wants us to have .
In truth , race comes up in the culture all the time — and by Holder ’s admission , in political discussion — but in language that ’s more coded than frank , and that does n’t necessarily cut to the heart of the matter .
It ’s the third rail of American discourse .
For all its flaws — and they are legion — Tony Kaye ’s 1998 firecracker American History X could never be condemned for its lack of candor on racial matters .
Until looking at it again for this column , I had n’t seen the film since its brief theatrical run , which was short - circuited in part due to the public battles between Kaye , his star Edward Norton , and New Line Cinema over the final cut .
( Kaye famously took out a full - page ad in Variety decrying the Norton - supervised cut that New Line favored , and tried to have his name removed from the credits and replaced with the “ Alan Smithee ” pseudonym .
When that failed , he suggested “ Humpty Dumpty . ” )
In the years since , I ’ve tried to account for why American History X took off in the culture , and made a few assumptions : that Edward Norton ’s performance as reformed skinhead Derek Vinyard was too magnetic to deny ; that the existence of a neo - Nazi group in a modern American city had a pulpy appeal , like the gangs in The Warriors or the anarchists in Fight Club ; or that its most sensationalistic scene — the “ curb - stomp ” — was one of those you - must - see - this moments that lead people to pass around DVDs and videotapes .
Advertisement
No doubt all those elements were contributing factors , but I think the cult of American History X , for better or worse , has to do with its frankness .
This is not a subtle film .
This is not a film of great depth or psychological complexity .
This is not a film with any discernible subtext ; it ’s all text .
But it does engage , albeit in the bluntest possible terms , in the kind of open conversation that Holder seems to be endorsing .
Derek ’s path from scared kid to charismatic neo -Nazi leader to changed man follows such a clear cause - and - effect pattern that the audience in the theater next door can follow it , but there ’s a power to that , too .
The racial discussion is n’t couched in code words or other niceties of language , but stated so plainly that we ca n’t wriggle out from under it .
And it happens around the dinner table — sometimes literally , as in this scene where Derek aggressively confronts his mother ’s liberal new boyfriend ( Elliott Gould ) over the rioting and looting after the Rodney King trial .
Note how closely Derek ’s argument dovetails with those of mainstream critics who condemned looting in the aftermath of Katrina or the fall of Baghdad :
Advertisement
“ Who would like some dessert ? ” says Derek ’s mother ( Beverly D’Angelo ) , trying to play peacemaker , and yet the conversation continues .
American History X just keeps on talking , at least when Kaye is n’t going overboard with slo - mo shower jets and other visual “ poetry . ”
David McKenna ’s script is loaded with pungent monologues and combustible melodrama , but even its structure does a lot of explaining , piling on long flashback sequences to account for Derek ’s journey and his influence on his brother Danny , played by Edward Furlong .
The title refers to an essay Danny ’s principal , Dr. Sweeney ( Avery Brooks ) , requires him to write after turning in a book report hailing the virtues of Mein Kampf .
Sweeney wants
Danny to write simply about his brother Derek — and within those broad parameters , a movie ( with scads of voiceover narration ) is born .
As Danny writes , his brother has served out the end of a three - year stint at Chino for voluntary manslaughter , having killed two African - Americans in response to an attempted car robbery outside his home in Venice Beach .
In the years since he ’s been in prison , Derek ’s white - supremacist views have calcified in Danny ’s mind , too , and the skinhead movement in Venice has flourished in his absence .
We learn the roots of Derek ’s racial hatred :
How his father , a fireman with prejudices of his own , was gunned down by a black man .
How his grief and anger were stoked by a local white - power nut ( Stacy Keach ) who recognized Derek ’s charisma and persuasiveness .
How Derek was able to seize upon the sense of disenfranchisement felt by many in his racially evolving neighborhood .
And how , finally , his rhetoric manifested itself in horrific violence .
In this scene , Derek masterfully spins a rant on immigration into a pep talk for ransacking a Korean grocer :
Advertisement
Kaye , who also served as cinematographer , shoots in black and white and color , which for practical purposes helps situate viewers in time , but also suggests ways of seeing the world .
The Derek of the past sees things starkly ; Derek post - incarceration has a more nuanced perspective .
But no matter where it stands in the timeline , American History X is strictly black and white .
It ’s not just that the script leaves no room for interpretation , but that its dramatic transformations are rarely all that plausible , especially in the scenes with Derek in Chino .
It makes sense that his disenchantment with his Aryan prison buddies starts with his observing their hypocrisy in moving drugs through Mexican gang members .
But Derek ’s relationship with a black inmate ( Guy Torry ) on laundry detail is pure hooey , staking Derek ’s hasty transformation on a handful of genial exchanges and a story about the racial injustice that led the inmate into the pen .
Reforming a hardened neo - Nazi like Derek — who is n’t a sheep - like follower of racist dogma , but a confident proselytizer of it — would take a hell of a lot more than some disarming jokes over the folding press .
( For a better example , look to The Believer , a superior film that turns to a much more profound source for conversion . )
Though overwrought and rigged like a Lifetime movie , American History X has a primal force that owes plenty to Norton ’s performance , of course , but also to Kaye ’s interest in American culture at its most extreme .
It ’s always fascinating when a foreign filmmaker comes to America , because their impressions are unique and telling , even when they ’re off - base or marred by awkward hiccups .
( Think Michelangelo Antonioni ’s Zabriskie Point , Bruno Dumont ’s Twentynine Palms , or Wim Wenders ’ various efforts here — none of them perfect by any measure , but they ’re singular and resonant even in their misjudgments . )
Kaye is drawn to the violent fringe of American society :
His extraordinary 2006 documentary Lake Of Fire , an epic ( and startlingly graphic ) look at the war over abortion rights , sought out the most dangerous zealot on the scene , including one man who would later be convicted for murdering a doctor .
The racially charged world of American History X is amplified a few notches above the real one , often to the film ’s detriment , but Kaye ’s in - your - face style does force viewers to confront tensions that tend to simmer more frequently than they explode .
There ’s a hyper-real , almost comic - book quality to Derek whipping off his shirt for a basketball game , ready to do battle against his African - American foes , wearing that Nazi tattoo emblazoned above his heart .
And his eventual victory is pure ecstatic fantasy , like the anti-Hoosiers .

Such a scene seems unlikely right out in the open , on a public court in the middle of a big city , but this is a film that wants to have that uncomfortable dinner conversation .
Much of the language Derek uses to persuade his skinhead followers and debate his adversaries is merely an n-word or two away from a modern talking head on cable news .
And at a time when the presence of a black president has brought out insidious sloganeering like “ Take our country back ” — who ’s “ our ” ?
And from whom ?— there ’s something refreshing about a film like American History X that puts everything on the table .
It does n’t make for convincing cinema , exactly , but cowardly it is n’t .
Attention Chicagoans : On Wednesday , July 28th at 7:30 p.m. , the New Cult Canon comes to the Music Box Theatre with a screening of David Lynch ’s Lost Highway .
I ’ll be there to introduce the film and lead a discussion afterward .
Three reasons to come :
It ’s a revelation on the big screen , shot in luscious Panavision with a particularly aggressive Lynch sound design .
It ’s better than you remember it being , especially in the wake of Mulholland Dr . If you show up in strong numbers , perhaps such an event could be replicated in the future .

1 1 . The Sleeper Cave House
Tucked into a 17,000 - square - foot hole left by a sandstone mine in Festus , Missouri is the spacious , beautiful home of William " Curt " Sleeper , his wife Deborah and their three kids .
The Sleepers almost lost their unique three - bedroom house to foreclosure , but they recently received backing from a private investor after media exposure .
" We feel that our home is eco- friendly , " Curt told The Daily Green .
He explained that he needs to run no heating or cooling , since the natural insulation of the cave walls keep the inside air 65 to 70 degrees year round .
The Sleepers constructed the façade of their dwelling out of 300 sliding glass doors purchased from a local resale shop .
" I stripped the aluminum and resold it to the local recycle center , " Curt adds .
" We pull more than 100 gallons of water per day from the air with our dehumidifiers and then pump that outside to water our gardens and feed chickens . "

In the previous articles in this series , I covered the conceptual basis of monads , but the discussion was pretty abstract .
Now that ( I hope ) you have a pretty good idea of what monads are and what they 're for , it 's time to get into the nitty - gritty details of how to actually derive the definitions of specific monads .
That means that we are going to have to define the correct instances of the type class Monad for the various notions of computation we talked about previously .
In our derivations , we will use our understanding of how monadic composition should work in each particular case to give us the definition of monadic apply ( the >>= operator ) , and we 'll use the monad laws to give us the definition of return .
The Maybe monad
The Maybe monad is often the first monad shown to new Haskell programmers in tutorials , because it 's very simple to use , to implement , and to understand .
To start with , let 's look at the definition of the Maybe data type :
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
This states that Maybe is a type constructor that acts on a particular type a to give a ( concrete ) data type .
We usually describe this by saying that Maybe is a " polymorphic " data type , but the meaning is the same .
So if a was Int , we'd have
data Maybe Int = Nothing | Just Int
except that we do n't have to define this directly , as the one definition given above suffices for all types .
A value of type Maybe a is either there or not there ; if it 's Nothing , it 's " not there " and if it 's Just x for some value x , it 's " just " the value x .
One way to think of this is as a container that either has zero or one elements .
( Remember that I said previously that monadic values were sometimes described , misleadingly , as containers .
This is a case in point . )
The Maybe polymorphic type is useful because we can use it to model a kind of " extended function " which can either produce a value as its output or fail to produce any output ( i.e. a function that can fail ) .
This can be written as follows :
f :: a ->
Maybe b
A function f of this type takes in an input value of type a , and either returns Nothing ( which indicates failure ) or a value Just x where x has type b .
Functions like f will be the ones that will be used in the Maybe monad , and composing two functions of this kind will look like this :
f :: a ->
Maybe b -- assume it 's defined elsewhere g :: b ->
Maybe c -- assume it 's defined elsewhere h :: a ->
Maybe c -- monadic composition of f and g h = f >=> g -- recall : >=> is the monadic composition operator
We said that all monads must be type constructors .
Maybe is a type constructor , so it qualifies in that sense .
But in order to make Maybe into a monad , we have to make it an instance of the type class Monad , which means that we have to fill out this definition :
instance Monad Maybe where ( >>= ) = {- definition of >>= for Maybe -} return = {- definition of return for Maybe -}
How do we define ( >>= ) and return for Maybe ?
First , let 's write a skeleton definition for the >>= operator , covering the two possible cases of a left operand of type Maybe a :
Nothing >>= f = {- to be defined -} Just x >>= f = {- to be defined -}
where x has type a .
It would also be legal to write the left - hand side of this definition as :
(>>=)
Nothing f = {- to be defined -} ( >>= ) ( Just x ) f = {- to be defined -}
but it looks better if we define it the way we use it , as an operator , and Haskell allows us to do this .
To complete this definition , consider how we want monadic composition to work in the Maybe monad .
Let 's take our example above with f and g composing monadically to make h :
f :: a ->
Maybe b g :: b ->
Maybe c h :: a ->
Maybe c h = f >=> g
If we pass an argument to f and it returns Nothing ( i.e. it fails ) , then what should h return on the same output ?
f x = Nothing h x = ( f >=> g ) x = ???
It seems apparent that if f x is Nothing , h x must also be Nothing , because if the first function ( f ) in the definition of h fails to produce an output , then h as a whole must also fail to produce an output .
The only way h could produce an output is if f produced an output ( call it y ) , passed it to g , and g y also produced an output .
If either f or g fails , then h fails too i.e. h x will evaluate to Nothing .
Putting this into our definition of h , we have :
h = f >=> g h = \x -> ( f x >>= g ) -- equivalent ( from the definition of >= > ) h x = f x >>= g -- equivalent -- assume f x == Nothing h x = ( Nothing >>= g ) = Nothing -- therefore : Nothing >>= g = Nothing
So we know how the ( >>= ) operator will work with an input of Nothing — it will just return Nothing :
Nothing >>= f = Nothing Just x >>= f = {- to be defined -}
Note that I changed g to f here , which is fine because the name of the function does n't matter in the definition .
In fact , where possible we leave off the name of the function entirely and use the _ wildcard operator as follows :
Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
We can't do this for the second equation because we 'll need the function f in the definition .
Now let 's look at the other case .
If f x does not fail , it will produce an output of the form Just y for some result value y .
We need to " unpack " a value from Just y to get the value y , which we will give as the argument to g , and g y will be what h x evaluates to :
h = f >=> g h = \x -> ( f x >>= g ) -- equivalent ( from the definition of >= > ) h x = f x >>= g -- equivalent -- assume f x == Just y h x = ( Just y >>= g ) = g y
This gives us the second part of our definition :
Nothing >>= f = Nothing Just x >>= f = f x
Note that I changed y to x and g to f in the definition .
Again , the variable and function names do n't matter as long as you 're consistent .
That completes the definition of the >>= operator for the Maybe monad .
Now we need to define the return function for this monad :
return x = ???
for an arbitrary value x .
What possibilities have we got ?
We could just say that
return x = Nothing
for any x .
If this were the case , however , we would violate our monad laws :
return x >>= f == f x Nothing >>= f == f x Nothing == f x -- WRONG !
Since we can assume that at least some f x values are not Nothing ( for instance , consider the monadic function f x = Just x ) , this can't be correct .
The obvious alternative is :
return x = Just x
which obeys the monad laws :
return x >>= f = ( Just x ) >>= f -- definition of return for Maybe monad = f x -- definition of >>= for Maybe monad -- correct according to monad law 1 Just x >>= return = return x -- definition of >>= for Maybe monad = Just x -- definition of return for Maybe monad -- correct according to monad law 2 Nothing >>= return = Nothing -- definition of >>= for Maybe monad -- correct according to monad law 2
This works , so let 's use it .
The complete definition of the Maybe monad is thus :
instance Monad Maybe where return x = Just x Nothing >>= f = Nothing Just x >>= f = f x
Woo hoo !
We 've just derived our first monad !
Just to be on the safe side , let 's check that our definition obeys monad law 3 , which is :
( mv >>= f ) >>= g == mv >>= ( \x -> ( f x >>= g ) )
First let 's check that it 's correct when mv is Nothing :
( Nothing >>= f ) >>= g -- left hand side =
Nothing >>= g -- definition of >>= = Nothing -- definition of >>=
Nothing >>= ( \x -> ( f x >>= g ) ) -- right hand side =
Nothing -- definition of >>=
OK , that checks out .
Now let 's see if it works when mv is Just v for some value v :
(( Just v ) >>= f ) >>= g -- left hand side = f v >>= g -- definition of >>= ( Just v ) >>= ( \x -> ( f x >>= g ) ) -- right hand side = ( \x -> ( f x >>= g ) ) v -- definition of >>= = f v >>= g -- normal function application ( beta reduction )
so this checks out too .
So it works !
This is the correct definition of the Maybe monad !
And the audience goes wild !
What 's the significance of this ?
It means that we can compose a bunch of monadic functions in the Maybe monad easily .
And why , you will certainly be asking yourself , is that important ?
It 's not hard to imagine having a bunch of Maybe monadic functions i.e. functions that can fail .
Let 's say that they all have type Int -> Maybe Int .
Here are three such functions :
f :: Int ->
Maybe
Int f x = if x `mod` 2 == 0 then Nothing else Just ( 2 * x ) g :: Int ->
Maybe
Int g x = if x `mod` 3 == 0 then Nothing else Just ( 3 * x ) h :: Int ->
Maybe
Int h x = if x `mod` 5 == 0 then Nothing else Just ( 5 * x )
We 'd like to compose them to get a final function :
k :: Int ->
Maybe Int
which is the result of applying f , then g , then h one after another , with Nothing returned if any of them failed .
All this does is multiply the input number by 30 unless the number is a multiple of 2 , 3 , or 5 ( in which case it fails i.e. returns Nothing ) .
If you 've followed the previous discussion it should be clear that you can define k using monadic composition as follows :
k = f >=> g >=> h
Or , if you want to use the >>= operator instead :
k x = f x >>= g >>= h
Or , if you like the do notation :
k x = do y <- f x z <- g y h z
Any way you slice it , though , it 's pretty simple .
Now , it 's perfectly possible to define h without using monads at all .
It looks like this :
k x = case f x of Nothing -> Nothing Just y -> case g y of Nothing -> Nothing Just z -> h z
This shows why the Maybe monad is important : it drastically cuts down on the boilerplate code we have to write to chain Maybe - producing functions together .
Imagine how grungy the non-monadic code would be if there were ten Maybe monadic functions in a row being chained together — it would be indented so far to the left that you would n't be able to read it , and the overall structure of the computation would be lost in a maze of case statements .
But with monads , you could write it like this :
f11 = f1 >=> f2 >=> f3 >=> f4 >=> f5 >=> f6 >=> f7 >=> f8 >=> f9 >=> f10
or ( using >>= ) :
f11 x = f1 x >>= f2 >>= f3 >>= f4 >>= f5 >>= f6 >>= f7 >>= f8 >>= f9 >>= f10
So monads have made composition of monadic functions just as easy as composition of regular ( non-monadic ) functions is .
The Maybe monad is very useful for illustrating basic concepts , but it may be confusing in one sense : many people mistakenly believe that the only reason for having monads in Haskell is to handle non-functional computations i.e. ones that do ( file or terminal ) I/O , alter global variables , etc .
And yet , here I showed you a monadic computation which can be done perfectly well without monads .
In this case , monads are not essential ; they 're just very convenient .
And that 's why I said that even though the original reason for adding monads to Haskell had to do with dealing with inherently non-functional kinds of computations ( like computations involving I/O ) , they turned out to have a far greater applicability .
That 's why they 're neat .
Now , on to our next monad .
The list monad
If you liked the Maybe monad , you 're going to love the list monad ;-)
We 're going to be filling in this instance definition :
instance Monad [ ] where ( >>= ) = {- definition of >>= for lists -} return = {- definition of return for lists -}
Note that we use the empty list [ ] to represent the list type constructor .
This is a bit of a hack ( lists have special syntactic support in Haskell ) .
Whatever .
As with all monads , the first task is to be clear about what the monad 's monadic function represents .
For the list monad , a monadic function f looks like this :
f :: a -> [ b ]
( where , of course , the notation [ b ] means " list of b " ) .
Recall that the generic definition of a monadic function is this :
f :: a -> m b
for some monad m which has to be a type constructor .
Lists are a plausible candidate for a monad because " list of " is a type constructor ( even though the syntax is hard - wired into Haskell ) ; if we wanted to , we could even define a list datatype ourselves :
data List a = Nil | Cons a ( List a )
and then the monadic function would look like this :
f :: a ->
List b
We 'll stick to the standard list syntax from now on .
What do functions of this sort represent ?
The normal way of thinking about them is that they take in an input value of type a , and produce a bunch of output values of type b , collected in one convenient container ( the list ) .
( Here again , we have a monad that seems to be a container . )
A different way of thinking about functions of this type is that they represent functions with multiple return values i.e. functions which can somehow return a bunch of different values " all at once " .
( I do n't want to say " in parallel " because that implies simultaneous processing which is n't going on here . )
The multiple return values are just the elements of the list .
This turns out to be a useful perspective when you have multiple functions of this type , for instance :
f :: Int -> [ Int ] g :: Int -> [ Int ]
Here , f and g both take in a single Int as an argument and return a bunch of Int s as results .
What if we wanted to take every result from f and apply g individually to each result , collecting all the results together ?
It would be great if we could do this directly , without having to unpack every element from the list of results that f returns and apply g to each one .
This is what the list monad will allow us to do .
Let 's flesh this out a bit with some example functions :
f :: Int ->
[ Int ] f x = [ x - 1 , x , x+1 ] g :: Int -> [ Int ] g x = [ - x , x ]
How would we " compose " these two functions ?
f x returns a list , so to apply g to each element of the list we will need the map function :
f 10 --> [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] map g ( f 10 ) --> [ [ - 9 , 9 ] , [ - 10 , 10 ] , [ - 11 , 11 ] ]
This new result may be interesting , but it can't be the composition of f and g because it does n't have the same type ( it 's a list of lists of Int s , not a list of Int s ) .
To turn it into a simple list of Int s , we can flatten the list of lists using the concat function ( which just concatenates a list of lists into a single list ) :
-- N.B. concat has the type [ [ a ] ] -> [ a ] concat ( map g ( f 10 ) ) --> [ - 9 , 9 , - 10 , 10 , - 11 , 11 ]
What this result represents is the collection of all the results obtained by applying f to an integer input and then applying g to one of the results .
If you think of f and g as functions which produce multiple results " all at once " , then this result is just the collection of all possible results of applying f and then g .
Diagrammatically , we can represent this as :
g | - 9 | 9 ----> | | | 9 | f | g | - 10 10 ----> | 10 ----> | | | 10 | | g | - 11 | 11 ----> | | 11
This shows that the composition of f and g is the collection of all paths through the f and g functions .
Interestingly enough , we 've just determined what the >>= operator has to be for the list monad !
It 's defined as follows :
-- mv :: [ a ] -- g :: a -> [ b ] mv >>= g = concat ( map g mv )
where mv is a monadic value in the list monad ( which is just a list of values of type a ) .
In the previous example , mv is just the result of evaluating f 10 and g is as it was before .
This definition even works if mv is the empty list [ ] , since mapping a function over the empty list just returns the empty list , and concat applied to the empty list returns the empty list as well .
So the definition of the >>= operator for this monad is very simple .
[ Note for GHC fans : The GHC Haskell compiler actually implements >>= for the list monad in a slightly different way which is ( I believe ) more efficient but which gives the same results . ]
How would we define return in this monad ?
Let 's think of the list monadic value as an " action " returning various values .
Let 's also recall that return should be the equivalent of the identity function in any given monad .
What would be the equivalent of the identity function in the list monad ?
It would take an input value and return an " action " which simply returns that value when " executed " .
So we know that return can't simply return the empty list , for instance .
A reasonable possibility is to define return as follows :
return :: a -> [ b ] return x = [ x ]
In other words , return just creates a list with a single value .
Let 's see if this is plausible by seeing if it obeys the monad laws :
-- f :: a -> [ b ] -- x :: a return x >>= f = concat ( map f ( return x ) ) -- definition of >>= = concat ( map f [ x ] ) -- definition of return = concat [ f x ] -- definition of map = f x -- definition of concat -- correct according to monad law 1 -- mv :: [ a ] mv >>= return = concat ( map return mv ) -- definition of >>= = concat ( map ( \x -> [ x ] ) mv ) -- definition of return --
Two cases : -- Case 1 : mv == [ ] = concat ( map ( \x -> [ x ] ) [ ] ) -- definition of mv = concat [ ] -- definition of map = [ ] -- definition of concat = mv -- definition of mv -- Case 2 : mv == [ v1 , v2 , ...] = concat ( map ( \x -> [ x ] ) [ v1 , v2 , ... ] ) -- definition of mv = concat [ [ v1 ] , [ v2 ] , ... ] -- definition of map = [ v1 , v2 , ... ] -- definition of concat = mv -- definition of mv -- correct according to monad law 2
OK , this works .
You might want to try other possible definitions for return in the list monad ( e.g. where return returns a list which contains 0 , 2 , 3 , or an infinite number of copies of its argument ) , and find out why they violate the monad laws .
This is a good way to get practice using the monad laws .
To prove that our list monad is really a monad , we still have to show that monad law 3 is obeyed .
This will be a lot harder , but let 's do it anyway .
It 'll turn out to be easier to do if we use the nice version of monad law 3 ( the one involving monadic composition ) .
To start , we need to define monadic composition in the list monad :
-- Monad law 3 ( nice version ) : ( f >=> g ) >=> h = f >=> ( g >=> h ) --
By definition : f >=> g = \x -> f x >>= g --
In the list monad , using the definition of >>= for lists : f >=> g = \x -> concat ( map g ( f x ) ) --
Using the composition operator (. ) , this can be written as : f >= > g = concat .
map g . f
In addition , I 'll be using several identities involving map and concat applied to lists .
You should just take these on faith for now , though I 'll show how to derive them below .
-- equation 1 : map ( f . g ) = map f . map g -- equation 2 : map f . concat = concat . map ( map f ) -- equation 3 : concat .
concat = concat . map concat
As I mentioned above , . refers to the ( pure ) function composition operator .
It has lower precedence than function application ( via concatenation ) , so an expression like map f . map g actually means ( map f ) . ( map g ) .
Haskell programmers usually prefer to leave out unnecessary parentheses when possible .
It 's also important to note that e.g. map f is a function even though map normally takes two arguments ( a function and a list to map the function over ) .
If you recall what I said about currying previously , then you 'll understand that map f is a function which takes a list as its only argument and returns a new list , which what you get when you apply the function f to all the elements of the original list and collect the results into a new list .
We 'll be using currying a lot below .
Given all that , here 's the derivation :
( f >=> g ) >=> h = ( concat . map g . f ) >=> h -- definition of >=> = concat .
map h .
( concat . map g . f ) -- definition of >=> = concat .
map h .
concat .
map g . f -- remove unnecessary parentheses f >=> ( g >=> h ) = f >=> ( concat . map h . g ) -- definition of >=> = concat . map ( concat . map h . g ) . f -- definition of >=> = concat . map ( ( concat . map h ) .
g ) . f -- equivalent = concat .
( map ( concat . map h ) ) . ( map g ) .
f -- equation 1 = concat . map ( concat . map h ) . map g . f -- remove unnecessary parentheses = concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) . map g . f -- equation 1
So we need to show that :
concat . map h .
concat .
map g . f = concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) . map g . f
which will be true if we can show that :
concat . map h .
concat = concat .
map concat . map ( map h )
Let 's do that :
-- add parentheses for clarity : concat . ( map h . concat ) = concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) -- use equation 2 : concat .
concat . map ( map h ) = concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) -- add parentheses for clarity : ( concat . concat ) . map ( map h ) = concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) -- use equation 3 : concat .
map concat . map ( map h ) = concat .
map concat . map ( map h )
and we 're done .
Whew !
In fact , Haskell programmers very rarely do derivations of this kind , but they are necessary to show that a purported monad really is a monad .
ASIDE : Deriving the map / concat identities ( equations 1 , 2 , and 3 ) Preliminaries :
To prove these identities , we will need to first prove a few simpler ones ( math is hard ! ) .
They are : -- Equation 4 : concat ( x:xs ) = x ++ concat xs -- Equation 5 : concat ( x ++ y ) = concat x ++ concat y -- Equation 6 : map f ( x ++ y ) = map f x ++ map f y Equation 4 follows from the definition of concat .
Equation 5 is easily proved by induction on the length of x and using equation 4 : -- base case : x is an empty list concat ( [ ] ++ y ) = concat [ ] ++ concat y concat y = [ ] ++ concat y -- definition of concat [ ] concat y = concat y -- definition of ++ -- OK -- inductive case : x is non-empty ; call its parts x1 ( head ) and xs ( tail ) concat ( ( x1:xs ) ++ y ) = concat ( x1 : ( xs ++ y ) ) -- definition of ++ = x1 ++ concat ( xs ++ y ) -- equation 4 = x1 ++ concat xs ++ concat y -- inductive hypothesis concat ( x1:xs ) ++ concat y = x1 ++ concat xs ++ concat y -- equation 4 -- OK , so Q.E.D. Equation 6 is proved similarly : -- base case : x is an empty list map f ( [ ] ++ y ) = map f [ ] ++ map f y map f y = [ ] ++ map f y map f y = map f y -- OK -- inductive case : x is non-empty ; call its parts x1 ( head ) and xs ( tail ) map f ( x ++ y ) = map f ( ( x1:xs ) ++ y ) = map f ( x1 : ( xs ++ y ) ) -- definition of ++ = f x1 : map f ( xs ++ y ) -- definition of map = f x1 : ( map f xs ++ map f y ) -- inductive hypothesis = ( f x1 : map f xs ) ++ map f y -- definition of ++ = map f ( x1:xs ) ++ map f y -- definition of map = map f x ++ map f y -- definition of x -- OK , so Q.E.D .
With that out of the way , let 's get to the proofs of equations 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Equation 1 : map ( f . g ) = map f . map g
Use induction on the length of the implicit list argument on both sides , as well as the definition of map : -- base case : empty list map ( f . g ) [ ] = [ ] ( map f . map g ) [ ] = map f ( map g [ ] ) = map f [ ] = [ ] -- OK -- inductive case : non-empty list map ( f . g ) ( x : xs ) = ( ( f . g ) x ) : ( map ( f . g ) xs ) -- definition of map = ( f ( g x ) ) : ( map ( f . g ) xs ) -- definition of .
( map f . map g ) ( x :xs ) = map f ( map g ( x : xs ) ) -- definition of .
= map f ( ( g x ) : ( map g xs ) ) -- definition of map = ( f ( g x ) ) : ( map f ( map g xs ) ) -- definition of map = ( f ( g x ) ) : ( ( map f . map g ) xs ) -- definition of . = ( f ( g x ) ) : ( map ( f . g ) xs ) -- inductive hypothesis -- OK , so Q.E.D. Equation 2 : map f . concat = concat . map ( map f ) Use induction on the length of the list argument : -- base case : empty list ( map f . concat ) [ ] = map f ( concat [ ] ) = map f [ ] = [ ] ( concat . map ( map f ) ) [ ] = concat ( map ( map f ) [ ] ) = concat [ ] = [ ] -- OK -- inductive case : non-empty list ( map f . concat ) ( x:xs ) = map f ( concat ( x :xs ) ) -- definition of .
= map f ( x ++ concat xs ) -- equation 4 = map f x ++ ( map f ( concat xs ) ) -- equation 6 = map f x ++ ( ( map f . concat ) xs ) -- definition of .
= map f x ++ ( ( concat . map ( map f ) ) xs ) -- inductive hypothesis = map f x ++ concat ( map ( map f ) xs ) -- definition of .
( concat . map ( map f ) ) ( x:xs ) = concat ( map ( map f ) ( x :xs ) ) -- definition of .
= concat ( map f x : map ( map f ) xs ) -- definition of map = map f x ++ concat ( map ( map f ) xs ) -- equation
4 -- OK , so Q.E.D. Equation 3 : concat .
concat = concat .
map concat
As usual , use induction on the length of the list argument : -- base case : empty list ( concat . concat ) [ ] = concat ( concat [ ] ) = concat [ ] = [ ] ( concat . map concat ) [ ] = concat ( map concat [ ] ) = concat [ ] = [ ] -- OK -- inductive case : non-empty list ( concat . concat ) ( x:xs ) = concat ( concat ( x : xs ) ) -- definition of . = concat ( x ++ concat xs ) -- equation 4 = concat x ++ concat ( concat xs ) -- equation 5 ( concat . map concat ) ( x:xs ) = concat ( map concat ( x :xs ) ) -- definition of .
= concat ( concat x : map concat xs ) -- definition of map = concat x ++ concat ( map concat xs ) -- equation 4 = concat x ++ ( concat . map concat ) xs -- definition of .
= concat x ++ ( concat . concat ) xs -- inductive hypothesis = concat x ++ concat ( concat xs ) -- definition of .
-- OK , so Q.E.D .
By now , I hope you 're fully convinced that the list monad is in fact a monad ;-)
A much more interesting question , of course , is this : what can we do with the list monad that was hard to do before ?
Here 's a simple example : find all pairs of numbers between 1 and 6 that sum to the number 7 ( the numbers might represent e.g. dice rolls ) .
With the list monad , this is trivial :
-- Using do - notation : do n 1 <- [ 1..6 ] n 2 <- [ 1..6 ] if n1 + n2 == 7 then return ( n1 , n2 ) else [ ] -- Result : [ ( 1,6 ) , ( 2,5 ) , ( 3,4 ) , ( 4,3 ) , ( 5,2 ) , ( 6,1 ) ]
This can also be written without the do - notation , though it 's less clear :
[ 1..6 ] >>=
1 -> [ 1..6 ] >>=
2 -> if n1 + n2 == 7 then return ( n1 , n2 ) else [ ]
How does this work ?
You should really sit down and work this out for yourself given the definitions of >>= and return for lists , but here 's a hand - wavy explanation .
Note that [ 1..6 ] is a monadic value in the list monad , so it delivers all of its values to n1 ( one at a time , of course ) , and then again to n2 , and then if the sum is correct all the pairs ( n1 , n2 ) will be returned .
So we 're doing a computation on all elements of a list as easily as if it were computations on only single elements .
That 's what the list monad buys you .
If you 've done any significant amount of Haskell programming , alarm bells are going off in your head right about now .
" But wait ! " I hear you cry .
" Ca n't you just use a list comprehension to do this ? "
Indeed you can , and it looks like this :
[( n1 , n 2 ) | n1 <- [ 1..6 ] , n2 <- [ 1..6 ] , n1 + n 2 == 7 ]
The list monad can in fact do anything that list comprehensions can do .
Which syntax one prefers is a matter of taste and may also depend on the particular problem .
In fact , Phil Walder , in the paper Comprehending Monads ( there 's a pun in that title , as there are in most of Phil 's paper titles ) suggested that the list comprehension syntax be extended to arbitrary monads .
That proposal was eventually rejected in favor of the current notation .
The list monad is more than just an alternate version of list comprehensions , though .
For one thing , there are many very generic functions that can work on instances of any monad ; having a list monad means that those functions can work on lists as well .
Furthermore , there is an extension to the Monad type class called MonadPlus which adds extra functionality to monads ( specifically , it defines a " zero " element for a monad as well as a way of " adding " two monadic values ) .
Lists turn out to be an instance of MonadPlus as well as of Monad , and this means that generic functions that work on all instances of MonadPlus will also work on lists .
( For instance , there is a generalization of the concat function called msum which works for any instance of MonadPlus , including lists . )
It 's better to have generic functions that can work on large numbers of datatypes than to have to define new functions for each particular datatype , so this is a clear win .
Next time
In the next installment I 'll look at monads to deal with error handling .
... on standardized intelligence tests , more males than females get off - the - chart test scores — in both directions .
The greater variance of males on intelligence tests is one of the best - established findings in psychometric literature .
More males are mentally deficient , and more are freakishly brilliant .
The difference in variation is n't huge , but it is large enough and consistent enough that a fair selection process should produce more boys than girls in a gifted and talented program .
The Bloomberg administration imposed a uniform and transparent admission process so that all applicants ( about 15,000 four - and five - year - olds ) now take the same two standardized tests .
Only children who score in the 90th percentile or above can enter the programs .
This approach leaves little room for parental lobbying .
The reformers believed this open and consistent procedure would yield a more ethnically diverse group of students .
So far it has not .
It has yielded more girls than boys .
As the Times reports ( and disgruntled mothers of boys say on websites like UrbanBaby ) , the test is “ more verbal than other tests ” and it plays to girls ’ strengths .
Boys are especially disadvantaged by the necessity to sit quietly for one hour and focus exclusively on the test .
Pre -kindergarten boys with mental abilities three or four standard deviations above the mean have astonishing talents .
But as Terry Neu , an expert on gifted boys , told me , sitting still for an extended period of time is not one of them .
The capacity to remain seated for a long test does not reliably measure brilliance , but requiring pre-K children to do it is a sure way of securing more places for girls than boys in a gifted program .
The developing gender gap in the gifted programs of New York City does not signal that girls are smarter than boys .
Rather , it exemplifies how well - intentioned government officials and educators can disregard boys ’ needs and abilities and unwittingly adopt policies detrimental to boys ’ well - being .
It is a small part of the long story of how American boys across the ability spectrum and in all age groups have become second - class citizens in the nation ’s schools .
The chart above is based on extensive research of a type that is no longer allowed by the PC Thought Police .
It reveals that males make up the majority of both geniuses and imbeciles .
The higher on the IQ chart you go , the more male geniuses there are , compared to female geniuses .
This is important , since most of the transformative sciences and technologies which distinguish the advanced world from the more primitive third world , are based upon work by males ( and a few females ) at the higher end of the IQ curve .
From Christina Hoff Sommers at American.com
There you have it .
To artificially create more girl geniuses than boys , start with a pre-pubertal population .
Then slant the cognitive tests to favour the strengths of the girls -- more verval skills , better able to sit still for testing , etc .
Before you know it , you have a population of gifted students on the fast track to success -- with a lot more girls included than boys .
Such a strategy spread across the curriculum has been successful in bringing the proportion of female college graduates in the US close to 60 % for Bachelor 's and Master 's degrees -- over 60 % for Associate 's degrees .
Just make school as unpleasant as possible for males , until many of them -- and some of the smartest -- give up in disgust .
You waste a lot of male talent that way , but you can get an awful lot of females through college and into the work force .
A radical feminist 's dream of gender payback .
Society pays a huge price for the politically and sociologically designed destruction of human capital .
But the policies which assure the continuation of this destruction are well entrenched , and not likely to be changed before the US government itself collapses .
Of course , at the rate Obama Pelosi is going , that may not take much longer .

Executive summary : Agitator behind Mexican revolution
Ricardo Flores
Magón spent most of his life publishing revolutionary newspapers and being arrested for what he wrote .
He was a critical anarcho - syndicalist thinker , writing many analyses of Bakunin and Marx .
During the end of the Porfiriato , Magón escaped to Texas where he continued to publish revolutionary newspapers for a Mexican audience .
He would spend most of the last two decades of his life in a foreign country , attempting to foment rebellion in his homeland while avoiding the dictator Porfirio Díaz 's assassins and kidnappers .
In Texas , Magón was an early spokesman for the expatriate political party PLM ( Partido Liberal Mexicano ) .
His newspaper Regeneracion , reborn after his printing presses were confiscated by the Mexican dictatorship , incited Mexicanos living in the US to smuggle arms , troops , and even conduct border raids against Diaz 's forces - thus opening another front of the revolution .
For his outspokenness , he was charged with violation of the US 's neutrality laws .
After the fall of the dictator and the subsequent lackluster presidential rule of Francisco Madero , Magón lead an anarchist revolt in Baja California , resulting in more prison time .
His final prison stint in the US was due to his writings against World War I -- he was charged with sedition and imprisoned under the Espionage Act .
He died in Leavenworth Penitentiary four years later of natural causes .
Emiliano Zapata 's Plan de Ayala is based on Magón 's writings , and indeed Zapata 's famous quote " Tierra y Libertad " is the name of one of Magón 's books .
" We are free , truly free , when we do n't need to rent our arms to anybody in order to be able to lift a piece of bread to our mouths . "
Washington ( CNN ) -- President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to end violence and discrimination against gays and lesbians at home and abroad Tuesday , as the Obama administration moves to extend further benefits to gays working in the federal government .
" It 's not right , it 's not who we are as Americans , and we 're going to put a stop to it , " Obama told a raucous White House reception honoring Gay and Lesbian Pride Month .
Earlier , Clinton received several standing ovations from a standing - room only crowd of several hundred during her address at an event co-hosted by the State Department 's Office of Civil Rights and GLIFAA , the organization for Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies .
" We are moving together in the right direction , " said Clinton .
" We reaffirm our commitment to protect the rights of all human beings . "
The White House event invited politicians and government officials as well as lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender American from across the country , including young people " who have stood up for equality , " said White House spokesman Shin Inouye .
At a similar event last year , six months after Obama took office , participants expressed frustration over what they called a lack of progress in confronting discrimination issues that the president had promised to resolve .
This time , Obama received loud applause , cheers and whistles as he cited steps his administration has taken , including a new hate crimes law , extending federal benefits to gay employees and a push for an employee discrimination bill .
The Obama administration is expected to announce Wednesday that gay workers will be able to take medical leave to care for the sick or newborn children of their same - sex partners as part of the Family and Medical Leave Act , which generally allows those working for companies with 50 or more employees to take 12 unpaid weeks off to care for newborns or children with serious health issues .
" And finally , we 're going to end " do n't ask , do n't tell , " Obama said Tuesday of the policy that prohibits openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service .
A bill that would repeal the policy after a Pentagon review is completed in December is before Congress , the president noted .
" We have never been closer to ending this discriminatory policy , and I 'm going to keep on fighting until that bill is on my desk , " he said to cheers .
Attending the event was Janice Langbehn of Lacey , Washington , who was denied hospital visitation rights when her partner of 18 years , Lisa Pond , was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm while on vacation in Florida .
Obama mentioned her story on Tuesday , calling the way she was treated " wrong " and " cruel . "
Earlier , Clinton said she is asking embassies in Africa and elsewhere to report on rights of the local lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities .
The State Department also is placing more attention on ensuring gays around the world have access to HIV / AIDS prevention and treatment , and providing grants to human rights activists who are persecuted either because they are gay or defend gay rights , she said .
" These dangers are not gay issues .
This is a human rights issue , " Clinton said .
She drew more rousing applause when she declared " human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights , " a variation on the phrase she famously delivered in Beijing 10 years ago declaring " women 's rights are human rights . "
Clinton said she is equally concerned about creating an environment at the State Department in which gay employees feel valued and " can give 100 percent . "
That is why , she said , she supported offering equal benefits to same - sex partners of State Department employees , a move that encouraged Obama to authorize such benefits for gays throughout the federal government .
She noted the State Department also has made it easier for transgender people to change their passports and , for the first time , the agency 's " equal opportunity statement " will include gender identity .
It already includes sexual orientation .

Three of the Allied Forces best fighter pilots in WWII .
The Condition :
We 've mentioned Bader and Maresyev before ; Bader for his uncanny ability to flirt his way out of multiple Nazi prison camps and Maresyev for his awesome inability to die .
But here 's the thing : neither of them had legs .
That 's right .
Both were decorated WWII pilots who racked up impressive records after crash landing their legs right the hell off .
It 's not just a bizarre coincidence .
Maresyev could probably have frowned an enemy pilot to death .

How It 's An Advantage :
Unlike the Cracked Summer Intern Post - It Eating Contest , pilots did n't fly " blind " because their superiors needed something hilarious to gamble on .
Being able to fly without actually seeing anything was a part of a fighter pilots job thanks to a little something called G - force .
As pilots and roller coaster enthusiasts will tell you , G - force is fine in moderation .
But ramp up the G's and that delightful tingle you get in your man pouch at the top of the first hill of a roller coaster can drain all the blood from your head , leaving you temporarily blind or , less temporarily , dead .

The fighter planes of the Second World War were capable of all kinds of airborne acrobatics that found pilots ' bodies moving in the opposite direction of their blood .
Dogfights were a constant balance between out - maneuvering the guy trying to turn you into confetti , and trying not to steer the sight out of your eyes .
One hairpin turn and you 'd find yourself with all the blood your brain needs for seeing down in your feet .
Or at least , that was a problem for people who had legs for their blood to drain into .

I apologize for not keeping this blog up to date ; I ’ve been suffering from Bloggers Block .
I have asked my Golden Retriever / Lab mix Duke to write today ’s column .
He does n’t have much writing experience , but he is a keen observer of human behavior , and I suspect that when I ’m at work he goes on line and chats with other neglected house pets around the world .
He is always eager to please me , so I know he ’ll come up with something good for the blog … .
Human Behavior
as observed and chronicled by Hrrhahhgggrhhah ( known by humans as “ Duke ” )
My primary human thinks that I am always eager to please him .
This is not true .
I am always eager to go outside and smell things .
I ca n’t work the doorknob , so I have to keep him happy to be let out .
Human peeing is perhaps the most mysterious of their behaviors .
They pee in a white container and the pee is taken away and replaced by drinking water .
Nobody knows why they get rid of perfectly good pee , which could be used to identify their yards .
Instead , they hire us to pee on their property .
Without our help , one would only have vague and unreliable visual clues as to where each human and dog family lived .
Humans constantly make noise .
They talk almost continuously , but they get very upset when dogs say anything at all .
They are the only ones allowed to talk .
Humans are completely blind to smells .
They can walk right by deer poop without even slowing down .
They do n’t even seem to smell each others ’ moods .
Humans almost always seem to have somewhere to go or some meaningless activity to engage in .
A good time to hang out with humans is when they are staring at bright boxes .
They are almost inert during these times .
Humans have almost no fur , which makes grooming them nearly impossible .
You should be able to clean their noses , ears and eyes , however , if you can get your tongue in place before they jump back .
Waking humans up in the morning should be done very carefully .
For best results , I recommend licking their elbow and panting .
If that does n’t work , shake your head if you have a collar with jingly things that make noise .
Pace around , pant louder , and lie down next to them making a disgruntled sighing sound .
Then start the whole routine over again until they get up .
Humans believe that their pets think that they are human .
This is a sign of monumental egoism .
You can use this to your advantage .
Look at them like you want something , even when you do n’t , and they will try to figure out what you want based on what they would want .
They will try treats , love , and other good things .
You never know what they ’ll try to keep you happy , but it ’s fun to watch them struggle .
When they blog , they like to make their lists have 10 items .
In tribute to humans , I end this list with a 10th item .
See you on line !
Remember , they will always come home to feed you !

Click on this daisy for some observations by a human about dogs & other matters :
Turkey has closed its airspace to Israeli military flights following a deadly raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship , the Turkish prime minister and officials said Monday .

Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Toronto that Turkey imposed the ban after the May 31 raid on a Turkish ship that was part of a six- vessel international aid flotilla , according to the state - run Anatolia news agency .
The prime minister , who is in Canada to attend a summit of the Group of 20 major industrial and developing nations , did not elaborate .
On Sunday , Israeli media reported that Turkey had not allowed a plane carrying Israeli military officers , en route to a tour of memorial sites in Auschwitz , Poland , to fly over Turkish airspace .
The transport plane , with more than 100 commissioned and noncommissioned officers on board , was forced to make a detour , the reportsaid .
According to reports , the Israel Defense Forces refrained from responding officially to the event so not to exacerbate the rift in relations .
Turkish aviation officials were not immediately available for comment .
Eight Turks and a Turkish - American were killed in the raid that drew Turkish outrage and widespread international condemnation .
The aid ships were sailing to Gaza to break an Israeli blockade imposed to keep weapons and other military components out of the hands of Gaza militants who have attacked Israel with bombs , rockets and mortars for years .
Israel insists troops involved in the deadly raid acted in self defense after being attacked by some of the activists on board .
Turkey , which had a close alliance with Israel until the three - week Gaza war , which ended in early 2009 , withdrew its ambassador and canceled joint military drills in response to the raid .
It has said it will not return its ambassador and will reduce military and trade ties unless Israel apologizes for the raid .
It also wants Israel to return the seized aid ships , agree to an international investigation and offer compensation for the victims .
" Up to now , we have done whatever is necessary within the rules of law - whether national or international - and we will continue to do so , " Anatolia quoted Erdogan as saying , adding that ties with Israel could return to normal if Israel meets Turkey 's demands .
" We are not interested in making a show .
We do n't desire such a thing and we have been very patient in the face of these developments , " he said , according to Anatolia .
Israel has objected to an international inquiry into the operation and has set up its own investigative commission that includes two foreign observers .
Illinois legislators tend to plead victim to economic circumstance , and the state ’s maladies are considerable .
In 2006 , the Illinois unemployment rate stood below 5 percent ; now it is near 11 percent , and the percentage of long - term unemployed exceeds the national average .
Major manufacturers have eliminated thousands of jobs , and the state ranks in the top 10 nationally in foreclosures .
Five years ago , the Chicago suburb of Tinley Park issued about 650 home building permits ; last year it processed one .

The lakeshore condo towers in Chicago bespeak affluence , but there are so many foreclosures on the bungalow blocks of southern and western Chicago that “ for sale ” signs sprout like sunflowers .
Few budget analysts are surprised to see Illinois , with a limping economy and broken political culture , edge close to the abyss .
Two of the last six governors have served jail terms , and a third is on trial .
“ We are a fiscal poster child for what not to do , ” said Ralph Martire of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability , a liberal - leaning policy group in Illinois .

He said the state had not come through with an expected $ 2.2 million , which is about six months of arrears .
He has laid off and recalled employees three times in the last two years .
“ Two weeks ago , I had days to meet my $ 420,000 payroll and all I was looking at was a $ 200,000 line of credit from a bank , ” recalled Mr. Troy .
“ I drove down to Springfield and said , ‘ Hey , you owe us $ 3 million . ’
They said : ‘ Oh , that ’s nothing .
We owe another agency $ 10 million . ’ ”

But the favorites among the junior players both suffered setbacks .
Ray Robson , the top seed and the only grandmaster in the tournament , barely managed to draw against Eric Rosen , a master and the lowest - ranked player in the event , while Samuel Shankland , an international master and the No. 2 seed , lost to Parker Zhao , another master .
Shankland ’s loss may not have been as surprising as it appeared .
Though he is only 18 , he has said recently that he is done with playing chess competitively and he is “ retiring ” after this tournament .
The two championships are 10 - player , round - robin events in which each player faces all the other competitors once .
Though there are large differences in the rankings of the top and bottom players in both events , the early struggles by the top juniors suggests the tournaments could be quite competitive .
And if the high number of decisive results in the first round is any indication , the tournaments will also be very entertaining .
The games can be followed live online .
Round 2 on Sunday is at 2 P.M. , central daylight time .
UPPER MONTCLAIR , N.J. –
The secret is out , Mac .
Growing up , Red Bulls attacker Macoumba Kandji idolized Thierry Henry .
Kandji said that he often watched Henry when the Frenchman played for Arsenal , catching the forward in Champions League action on television .
He loved the way Henry attacked and played smoothly on the ball .
“ But do n’t tell him that I idolized him , ” Kandji said with a laugh .
The fact is , Henry is having a huge impact on the team , even though he has n’t played a game yet .
Beyond the inevitable boost in ticket sales , jersey purchases and media attention , Henry is raising the intensity of practice .
His teammates want to be the one to get a tackle on him , strip the ball , intercept his pass or make a move by him .
The practice field is certainly buzzing these days .
Head coach Hans Backe has taken note .
He praised Henry for his intensity on the field , even when no one is looking .
Backe said that when the team returned from Columbus this weekend – Henry traveled with the team but did not play – the forward left the bus and went for a personal session with the team ’s trainer .
All with the postseason in mind .
“ It ’s going to be vital to arrive into the playoffs in shape , ” Henry said .
Henry , a fan of “ all American sports , ” said that MLS is unique from any league he ’s been in before in terms of the playoff structure .
While he said he wants the team to finish top of the table , he realizes from MLS experiences in the past that it ’s the hot team that lifts MLS Cup .
In fact , he cites the NBA as the perfect example .
“ [ The Boston Celtics ] got into a rhythm in the playoffs and nearly won it , ” Henry said .
Backe also praised Henry for his role in the training session on Monday when he was working with his teammates .
“ He ’s already helped the young players with the small details , ” Backe said .
Henry stayed after practice on Monday for nearly 40 minutes to work on fitness and shooting .
He said that the work rate and extra effort that has become the trademark of his game is something he brings with him to his new club .
As far as leaving his mark on the younger players , Henry said it part of being a professional , plain and simple .
There are no ulterior motives .
“ I ’m not doing this to leave a legacy , ” Henry said .
“ I ’m doing this because the game asked it of me . ”

A Twist for Scoliosis
Everyone has scoliosis , a side curve of the spine , to some degree or another .
Mostly this goes unnoticed , but for others , this can really be a pain in the back .
When the curve is in the thoracic spine , the part associated with the chest , a yoga pose can be used to help bring natural back pain relief .
Spinal Curve Development
There is n’t much curve in the spine when we are born .
Natural and abnormal curvature both develop as we grow .
For example , when we start to walk gravity helps form the curve in the low back .
Most people go their whole life never knowing they have scoliosis .
I have surprised a few though when I pointed out that they had a curve , especially when it conecided with an area of their back that always had a ‘ knot ’ or uncomfortable place .
I teach them how to put it back in using Self Adjusting Technique , and give them a spine straightening method such as the one below , and they are fine .
What Can Be Done
The first thing to do is make sure the vertebra are in alignment .
This is n’t essential , but you may not be able to work deeply into the pose if it hurts .
And , you do n’t want to push past the pain .
So , if it hurts either get an adjustment or get my e-book and you can adjust it yourself .
This area is easy to self adjust .
When the scoliosis is in the thoracic spine , a simple twist can be used to push the spine back the other way .
In the thoracic spine , the ribs connect to the spine .
Twisting into the curve causes the ribs to push the spine back the way it came .
For example , if the spine is curved to the right , then the twist would be to the right .
The twist naturally engages the ribcage which connects to the spine in that area to push the spine to the left .
There are hundreds of good spinal twist , and most will work .
Try this Simple Twist
The description and photo are for a scoliosis to the right side , so if your scoliosis is to the left , then you would twist to the left .
Start sitting in a chair with a high back .
Sit so the chair back is to your right side with your thigh brased against it .
Use your hands on the chair back to help you into the twist .
First , take a deep breath as you lengthen your spine .
With the exhale pull yourself into the twist using the chair back to help .
Continue to breath into the pose working deeper into it when each exhale .
When you inhale , the lungs will fill pressing against the ribcage causing you to naturally unwind a little .
Allow this to happen , you might even draw your torso almost fully forward .
This allows you space to flow back into the twist .
Remember , you are trying to help the spine back the way it came .
It is n’t necessary to force although you may find yourself naturally drawing deeply into the pose .
Pay close attention to the sensations in your body .
Get to know what is going on and you will learn what you need to do to help .
Pay close attention to pain .
Pain is there to tell you that you have gone far enough , and to warn you not to overdo it .
Some stretches have a feel good kind of pain that might happen when doing a twist .
That ’s okay , as long as the pain is n’t such that you resist .
Pushing through resistance is a good way to injure yourself .
It is good to do poses such as this twist on both sides .
And , yoga classes will do twists on both sides .
When twisting to the left side , avoid drawing deeply into the pose .
Instead , work on lengthening the spine as you inhale and relaxing into a very gentle twist on the exhale .
You might even work the pose to the right again .
Conclusion
Back care for scoliosis in the thoracic spine can be found with yoga poses .
The key to good back health is consistency .
All it takes is persistence in practicing the twist .
Scoliosis can be helped with the use of yoga poses .
In some cases the progression of scoliosis was stopped .
In some , in time , there was a measurable reversal .
Border Patrol agents arrested two Los Angeles women in June 2009 after finding 166 pounds of marijuana hidden in their minivan .
The arrests happened when the women stopped at the Border Patrol checkpoint on westbound Interstate 8 east of Pine Valley .
When agents searched the vehicle , they found dozens of bricks of marijuana hidden in storage compartments in the rear .
Authorities estimated that the drugs had a street value of more than $ 100,000 .
The women were carrying two children in the Dodge Caravan

With The Avengers coming in 2012 , the idea of a team - up movie featuring big - name superheroes will finally take root .
But there 's still never been a superhero buddy movie .
Here are 10 pairings we 'd love to see on the big screen .
Advertisement
A superhero buddy movie might be the greatest thing ever .
For one thing , it would provide a cool central relationship for the film to revolve around .
For another , Hollywood knows how to do buddy movies , and some of the best action - comedies have featured an odd couple who have to work together to survive .
And let 's face it , beyond the ubiquitous origin story , Hollywood has n't ever really known what to do with superheroes .
There 's a reason why non -origin - focused superhero movies are so uneven — the other thing that Hollywood seems to be able to pull off is the " superhero almost quits but then does n't " story , like Spider - Man 2 , Superman II and so on .
Marrying the superhero genre with the buddy - movie genre would give Hollywood screenwriters a ready - made template for a new kind of superhero film .

Plus superhero comics offer some really great team - ups .
Here are our faves :
Power Man and Iron Fist
This is really the classic superhero buddy series .
Both Power Man and Iron
Fist were starring in their own comics , and doing perfectly well on their own .
But together ?
They just kind of sparked something .
And with Power Man , aka Luke Cage , taking a central place in the Marvel Universe lately ( including a starring role in the New Avengers ) , lots of people are already talking about his movie potential .
Put these two rough - and - tumble characters together , though , and you 've got a killer movie .
Power Man is an ex-con ( he was innocent ) who got himself some steel - hard skin in a prison experiment .
Iron First is a rich guy who studied martial arts in the mystic land of K'un Lun and gained the ability to channel his Qi into his fist until it 's ( say it with me ) " like unto ... a thing of iron ! "
Anyone can hire them to go bust some heads , because they 're the Heroes For Hire .
Plus their love interests , Misty Knight and Colleen Wing , are also totally cool .

Superman / Batman
It 's probably a good thing that the Superman Vs. Batman movie that was being floated a decade ago never happened — it sounded like the reasons for the two to fight were kind of contrived .
And we'd much , much rather see the two of them team up than fight — except for the epic showdown in The Dark Knight Returns , it 's hard to think of a cool storyline in which it would actually make sense for Clark and Bruce to come to blows .
But a Superman / Batman team - up movie could be all kinds of awesome — as you can see by reading some of the old World 's Finest issues .
Or , for that matter , Joe Kelly 's Superman / Batman annuals .
The occasionally tense friendship between these two has always been close to the heart of the DC Universe , and a Justice League movie will never work unless you get the Superman / Batman relationship right first .
So maybe a Superman / Batman team - up movie could be the intermediate step before a JLA film ?
Just a thought .

Green Lantern and Green Arrow
So we already have a Green Lantern film , coming next year , and it looks like it 's going to be pretty awesome .
Ryan Reynolds looks like he 's going to be the perfect Hal Jordan — kind of cocky , a little bit immature , but a really solid guy who comes through in a tough spot .
But assuming that the Green Lantern film is a hit , how do you follow that up ?
How about giving
Hal a thorn in his side , in the form of the Emerald Archer ?
While I do n't think it would necessarily be a good idea to redo the " two guys take off in a van to Find America " storyline , the dynamic between the straight - arrow Hal and the angry hippie Ollie would be a total thrill to see on the big screen .
Plus now that Ollie 's one of the main supporting characters in Smallville , he needs his movie debut .
But skip the O'Neil / Adams " traveling across America " issues , as lovely as their art is , and go straight to the O'Neil / Grell issues , where Green Lantern and Green Arrow go into space and fight monsters !

Hercules and Amadeus Cho
If you missed the recent run on The Incredible Hercules , which started up after World War Hulk , then you missed out on the most awesome pairing of two oddball heroes we 've seen in forever .
I admit we 're unlikely ever to see a big - screen Hercules and Amadeus Cho feature , but that just proves the universe is insufficiently awesome .
Amadeus Cho is the seventh smartest person in the world , and he 's also a total smartass .
Who has a coyote pup tucked into his jacket , and can use the power of Math to make any situation go his way .
Hercules is , well , Hercules .
A mythological demi-god who stumbles through life getting drunk and brawling , and uses his fists to handle any situation that may arise .
Except for his daddy issues , which are immune to fisticuffs .
Together , they 're ... totally dysfunctional and awesome .
It would be an all - time epic .

Spider - Man and the Human Torch
Seriously , if the movie version of the Marvel Universe ever really becomes one unified entity , then this is a movie that deserves to happen .
The comics rivalry between the Friendly Neighborhood Spider - Man and the Fantastic Four 's most hot - headed member is legendary , and whenever they meet up , it always gets totally insane .
Their team - up miniseries , written by Dan Slott , was one of the funniest superhero runs we 've read in forever .
And they 've got so many fascinating contrasts — the Human Torch is rich and successful , part of a superhero team that everybody loves , while Spider - Man is an outcast who can barely afford to pay his rent .
Johnny Storm is a rockstar who has women all over him , while Spider - Man is stuck being married to a supermodel , until the Devil retcons his marriage .
( Okay , maybe that last contrast does n't quite work . )
Still , if a film featured Spidey and the Human Torch as young heroes , trying to prank each other but eventually teaming up , it would rule .
Advertisement
Cable and Deadpool
Mostly , we 're just hoping a Deadpool movie actually gets made , with Ryan Reynolds ' busy schedule and all .
But if Deadpool does become the big - screen sensation he deserves to be , a good followup would be this recent series where he becomes pals with Nathan Summers , the son of Scott Summers who 's traveled back in time to save the world from itself .
The totally amoral , bugshit Deadpool winds up becoming part of Cable 's plans to redeem the world , including weird storylines where they get infected with a virus that turns everyone blue , and then their DNA gets mixed together .
The ways in which writer Fabian Nicieza keeps bringing Cable and Deadpool together , even though their outlooks on the world are so completely different , get cleverer and weirder as the series goes along .
And really , the totally immoral Deadpool needs a super - idealist foil to bounce off of , at least sometimes .

Quantum and Woody
This comic was the greatest superhero send - up of all time , for my money .
But it was also the greatest story of an unlikely friendship between two guys who get superpowers and do n't know what to do with them .
I 've re-read my copies of the trade paperbacks so many time , they 're practically just tatters .
Basically , Eric and Woody are childhood friends , until Woody disappears one day , leaving Eric feeling betrayed .
Years later , they meet up again , and get caught in a weird experiment that their fathers set up .
The experiment leaves them with quantum - based superpowers — but it also means they have to be physically together at least once a day , or they 'll both dissipate into nothingness .
So they have no choice but to team up and become the world 's worst superhero team .
( Eventually they actually do become pretty effective , taking down the supervillain Magnum . )
The publisher went under before we got to see how this series was going to turn out , but the existing issues would make for a fantastic movie about repairing a damaged childhood friendship .
Make it happen , Hollywood !

Kitty Pryde and Wolverine .
Thanks to Project Thanatos for suggesting this one !
The pairing of Kitty Pryde and Wolverine , in the mid-1980s , was an important one for both characters .
It helped to establish Wolverine as a mentor to younger mutant heroes , who could help them to discover their inner strength to go along with those mutant powers .
And it helped develop Kitty Pryde from a cute " kid sister " to a more complex character .
Without this team - up miniseries , Kitty Pryde probably would n't be the beloved character she was today , and maybe Joss Whedon would n't have felt the need to get rid of her .
( Just kidding ! )
Seriously , though —
Wolverine has starred in one solo movie and three X - Men movies already , and he 's still kind of a one - dimensional character .
What would really give Hugh Jackman a chance to stretch out would be to give him a younger hero to mentor and grow .
Plus since this miniseries ties in with Wolverine 's Japanese soujourn and his whole " Bushido " phase , it could be a follow - up to Wolverine 's upcoming Japanese adventure movie .
Captain America and the Falcon
From 1971 to 1978 , the de facto name of Captain America 's comic book was Captain America and the Falcon , and it featured the World War II hero teaming up with the inner-city savior .
( There was an attempt to relaunch this concept in the mis-2000s , from the writer of Quantum and Woody , but it failed hideously and is best forgotten . )
The friendship between Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson is one of the coolest partnerships in mainstream comics —
Cap inspires the Falcon to become a better hero and rise above , but they 're also true equals who depend on each other .
Advertisement
Birds of Prey .
Okay , so this is more than two characters , but in its classic version it 's still less than the usual superhero team .
A Birds of Prey movie that featured just Black Canary and the Huntress going on missions while Oracle outsmarts their opponents and hacks into every computer on the planet would be pretty nifty .
It would have to be based on the early issues of Gail Simone 's run , featuring Black Canary getting captured by a psychopath and having to bust out despite being horribly injured .
Bonus : The Ambiguously Gay Duo .
It 's Steven Colbert and Steve Carrell , and we just saw the other night how great those two are together .
Yes , SNL sketches that turn into big - screen movies are usually disastrous and unbearably unwatchable .
But this would be different !

Taking a look at algae ’s green credentials ( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features )
BUBBLING green tubes filled with algae gobbling up carbon dioxide and producing biodiesel may sound like the perfect way to make clean fuel , but it could generate nearly four times the greenhouse emissions from regular diesel .
How we farm algae is crucial to making algal biodiesel environmentally viable , says Anna Stephenson at the University of Cambridge .
She has developed a computer model that calculates the carbon footprint of producing , refining and burning algal biodiesel .
 Making algal biodiesel in clear tubes has a carbon footprint nearly four times that of producing diesel …
Bootstrapping a prototype - based object - model in 44 lines of code .
Until a few weeks ago I had always thought that writing a language required some crazy voodoo , but it turns out that once you start digging into the fundamentals they are actually fairly easy to understand and , under certain circumstances , fairly easy to implement as well .
In this short example we are going to implement a prototype - based object - model in Ruby .
To make it a valid exercise we will not be using any of Ruby 's object - oriented features .
The final mini-language we create will not be pretty , but it will work .
Making it pretty will require syntactical sugar for things like sending a message to an object , which is not something we will tackle just yet .
The first thing we need is a way to store the structure of our objects .
For this purpose we are going to use a Hash like so :
The ' slots ' in this hash will store the methods / data that are associated with the object .
The ' parent ' will be a pointer to the object 's parent if it has one , and the ' size ' will simply keep track of how many key / value pairs are stored in ' slots ' .
Next we need to define functions for sending a message to an object , and for creating a new object that inherits the behaviour of a previous one :
The ' send ' function depends on the fact that each object is required to define or inherit a ' lookup ' method .
The ' lookup ' method defines how an object reacts when it is sent a message .
If the send function cannot find a ' lookup ' method defined on the current object then it follows the chain of inheritance upwards ( via ' parent ' ) until it finds one , or until the inheritance chain is exhausted .
The ' derive_from ' function simply creates a new object with an existing object as it's ' parent ' .
This provides a way to create a new object that inherits behaviours from an existing object , this layout is technically known as ' single inheritance ' .
Next up we need to manually create the initial ' lookup ' method for our basic object :
The ' lookup ' method is very similar to the ' send ' function in that it traces the chain of inheritance looking for a slot with a key which corresponds with the ' message ' .
If it finds a match then is simply returns the value of the slot so that ' send ' can execute it as a method .
If it cannot find a corresponding slot anywhere in the inheritance chain then it raises an error .
Next we need to give ourselves a way of adding new methods to an object .
We 'll do this by manually defining ' add_method ' :
' add_method ' simply copies an anonymous function into the object slot that corresponds with the method name .
It also increments the object 's ' size ' parameter so we can easily keep track of how many occupied slots the object has .
Lastly we will manually set the size of ' basic_object ' to account for the methods we have manually created :
And we 're effectively done !
We can now start using our brand - new object model .
Let 's start by creating a new object based on ' basic_object ' and adding a method to return the size of the object :
And then we can call our new method like so :
So as it turns out there is no voodoo involved after all !
Obviously this is a very short example and it's a long road from here to a useful language , but it 's quite amazing how short the minimal case is .
It 's worth noting that the exact same principal can be applied to bootstrap a similar object model in any procedural language that supports either pointers to functions or anonymous functions , I just used Ruby in this example because it's what I know best .
If you 're interested in learning more I highly recommend reading Open , extensible object models [ pdf ] by Ian Piumarta and Alessandro Warth , where they cover an implementation of this model in C as well as further features like Traits .

" It 's a Takkuri .
Run !
This bird steals your items !
C'mon !
What are you doing just standing around ? ! " —
Tatl
Takkuri are recurring enemies from the Legend of Zelda series .
While the appearance of Takkuri varies between appearances , they always steal items from Link 's arsenal .
Contents show ]
Appearances
There is only one Takkuri encountered in Termina .
It resembles a large vulture or condor with a bald purple head .
It can be found in Termina Field near the entrance to Milk Road , flying around slowly .
When far away from it , it appears as a red dot on Link 's map .
When it is in view , the red dot moves , mirroring its location .
When it sees Link , it dives down and attempts to steal something from him .
If the attack is successful , Takkuri deals damage to Link and tries to steal one of his items .
The attack can scatter Rupees , Bombs , or Arrows , which the Takkuri will then try to collect before Link does .
The attack can also directly steal Link 's Sword ( including the Great Fairy 's Sword ) or a Bottle , after which the Takkuri flies straight towards Clock Town and disappears out of sight , and can not be damaged .
The major items ( sword and bottle ) stolen by Takkuri can be bought back in the Curiosity Shop , indicating that the Takkuri is being used by the Man from the Curiosity Shop to steal items to sell , or else the Takkuri is selling them to him for its own profit .
If the Takkuri steals a major item from Link , it does not respawn after Link leaves the area , but will reappear once the stolen item is purchased .
A Bottle can be bought back for 20 Rupees , the Kokiri Sword , Razor Sword , and Gilded Sword sword for 50 Rupees , and the Great Fairy 's Sword for 100 Rupees .
Takkuri is extremely hearty , requiring many hits to defeat .
Each hit causes it to drop one to three Rupees .
If Link successfully defeats the Takkuri , it drops an Orange Rupee , worth 200 Rupees , along with any Rupees it stole before it was killed .
If Link is riding Epona , the Takkuri cannot damage him or steal his items .
Tatl 's Note
“ Run !
This bird steals your items !
C'mon !
What are you doing just standing around ?! ”
Takkuri are nearly identical to Crows in appearance , differentiated only by their red plumage .
They reside in Royal Valley where they swoop out of trees to attack Link just as Crows do , but on contact , they cause Link to drop many of his Rupees , which will disappear quickly .
Takkuri are very nimble , but can be defeated with one sword strike .
At one point , a Takkuri steals a key which opens the door to the Royal Crypt .
Link must locate the tree it lands in and charge that tree with his Pegasus Boots to make the Takkuri drop the key .
Etymology
" Takkuri " seems to be a portmanteau of the words " take " and " your " .
The " i " at end may be used for the word " item . "

Ivory Coast and Chelsea star Didier Drogba was substituted 15 minutes in to a friendly match against Japan with what appeared to be a small injury to his right side resulting from a normal high tackle .
Drogba was then rushed to a hospital with what was later revealed to be a broken arm .
This injury will likely force the powerful striker to miss the World Cup Finals although his coach Sven - Goran Eriksson insists that Drogba ’s return is “ still a possibility ” .
With this injury , Drogba is the fourth Chelsea star that will miss ( or is likely to miss ) the upcoming Finals despite .
The list also includes Jose Bosingwa , Michael Ballack , Michael Essien who all suffered injuries during the club season .
I ’m not entirely sure of FIFA ’s rules when it comes to playing with a cast but I can assure you that the Ivory Coast will explore every possibility to have Drogba back on the pitch .
The 2010 EPL Golden Boot winner is the best player on that team if not the best player on any African squad both in and out of the World Cup .
If he is to miss the Finals , which are likely to be his last , then any hopes the Ivory Coast had of an impressive showing will be severely lessened .

But while most of the attention focused on transportation the first two years , the program this year will also emphasize entertainment , like the New York International Fringe Festival , and recreation , highlighted by the new pools .
“ While they have been lovingly referred to as Dumpster pools , do n’t let the name fool you , ” said Janette Sadik - Khan , the city ’s transportation commissioner .
“ These are clean , compliant mobile pools that will put even more ‘ park ’ into Park Avenue .
It will almost be like a Park Avenue boardwalk . ”
Each pool will be roughly 8 feet wide and 22 feet long , with a sloped bottom between 3 and 5 ½ feet deep  bigger than the typical Dumpster .
There will no diving boards .
No baby pool , either .
At no cost to the city , Macro - Sea , the Brooklyn company that designed the Dumpster pools , is converting the containers , which will be cleaned and have protective liners .
As is the case with any other above - ground pool , a water filtration system will be installed , and the Department of Health will need to sign off on a permit , said David Belt , president of Macro - Sea .
Crunch , the fitness gym , will donate lifeguards , Ms. Sadik - Khan said .
At the end of each Saturday , the deck will drop to the sides and the pools will be covered by a heavy - duty mesh .
The containers will then sit curbside , as if they were Dumpsters at a construction project  except that there will not be debris , but rather water , inside .
The containers will be locked .

Christopher Hitchens Hitch - 22 --> reviewed by Christopher Caldwell -->
I n one of the odder passages in his memoir , Hitch - 22 , the prolific Anglo - American journalist Christopher Hitchens defines a meaningful life as one that includes “ friendship , love , irony , humor , parenthood , literature , and music , and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others . ”
This does n’t add up .
Battling for the liberation of others is a vocation for those who are committed , unbending , and ( too often ) humorless ; irony is the mood of the wit , the cynic , the fellow who is putting you on .
For four decades , Hitchens has tried both .
He writes lapidary , aphoristic , and even hilarious essays on questions that he presents as no laughing matter .
So which is the real Hitchens ?
The salon wag or the Jeremiah ?

Primary care patients prescribed an antibiotic for a urinary tract or respiratory infection consistently developed resistance to that antibiotic lasting as long as one year , a British meta - analysis revealed .
In five studies that included 14,348 patients treated for urinary tract infections , within one month of receiving an antibiotic an individual patient ’s odds ratio having a resistant pathogen was 4.40 ( 95 % CI 3.78 to 5.12 ) , according to Céire Costelloe , PhD , of the University of Bristol , and colleagues .
By 12 months , a “ small but important residual association ” remained ( OR 1.33 , 95 % CI 1.15 to 1.53 ) , the researchers reported online in BMJ .
In seven studies of various respiratory pathogens that included 2,605 patients , the odds ratio for resistance within two months of exposure was 2.37 ( 95 % CI 1.42 to 3.95 ) , and remained at 2.37 at 12 months ( 95 % CI 1.25 to 4.50 ) .
However , patients in studies who were not exposed to antibiotics had a pooled odds ratio of 0.08 for resistance in the first two months .
Among the 24 studies of antibiotic prescribing reviewed for the meta - analysis , evidence was also found for a dose - response relation for two commonly prescribed first line antibiotics in primary care , amoxicillin and trimethoprim .
One of the most threatening problems faced by worldwide healthcare services is the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance , but there are many barriers to the appropriate and limited use of antibiotics , including the perception among clinicians and patients that the risk is limited or theoretical .
This erroneous perception may relate , at least in part , to the fact that some studies have examined the association of antibiotic overuse and resistance at the population level , but not at the individual , level .
“ Consequently for clinicians , whose primary concern is the unwell individual , the impact of antimicrobial use on the prevalence of societal resistance may not be an important consideration , ” they wrote .
Costelloe and colleagues undertook the meta- analysis of studies examining antibiotic resistance among individual patients to highlight the effect of antibiotic prescribing on emergent resistance on the individual level .
Escherichia coli was the organism seen in all of the studies of antibiotic resistance among urinary tract bacteria .
In these studies , the drugs involved included nalidixic acid in addition to trimethoprim and amoxicillin .
Bacterium found in the studies of resistance among respiratory pathogens included strains of Streptococci and Haemophilus , and the drugs involved included amoxicillin , azithromycin , and clarithromycin .
One prospective study evaluated resistance to respiratory tract streptococci at multiple specific time points .
The pooled odds ratios were :
* At one week , 12.22 ( 95 % CI 6.76 to 22.10 )

That study provided strong evidence of a time trend for resistance to macrolides ( β coefficient − 0.25 , 95 % CI − 0.39 to − 0.11 , P=0.004 ) , according to the researchers .
In discussing their findings , Costelloe and colleagues explained that resistance is not simply a characteristic of the pathogen , but also affects the individual because plasmids and integrons can be transferred from invading bacteria to commensal organisms .
“ And because both transmission of commensal organisms between individuals and antibiotic prescribing in the community remain frequent events , even a transient effect of antibiotic use on the carriage of resistant organisms by an individual could have a major impact on the endemic level of resistance in the population , ” they cautioned .
The likelihood that resistant bacteria would be isolated from a patient was related to the number or duration of antibiotic courses prescribed in the previous 12 months ; the more courses or doses of a drug , the more likely resistant bacteria would be found .
They concluded that the fewest courses of antibiotics should be used in primary care , and if patients are treated and develop another infection within a year , consideration should be given to choosing a different antibiotic for that infection .
The researchers noted some positive publication bias in the urinary tract infection studies , but they were unable to assess publication bias in the respiratory tract studies .
In an accompanying health systems perspective analysis , Chantal M. Morel , PhD , and Elias Mossialos , PhD , of the London School of Economics and Political Science , addressed how financial incentives might help persuade pharmaceutical companies to develop more new antibiotics .
“ Incentives to develop new antibiotics should be designed with some early funding to ignite interest and appropriate rewards for the high risks of research and development , ” Morel and Mossialos wrote .
They added that such actions should be accompanied by efforts to dismantle incentive structures that lead to overuse of antibiotics .
An editorial that also accompanied the meta- analysis further addressed future needs in combating infectious disease .
“ Much more can be done to bolster diagnostics and surveillance of resistance patterns , reduce demand from patients for unnecessary antibiotics , and help standardize optimal dosing regimens and treatment times , ” stated Anthony D. So , MD , of Duke University in Durham , N.C. , and colleagues .
The United States and the European Union have established a task force on antimicrobial resistance to improve the therapeutic use of antibiotics in the medical and veterinary communities , to prevent drug - resistant infections , and to help move more new drugs to the market .
“ The EU - US Transatlantic Task Force must rise to this complex challenge and define its solution in global terms .
Nothing less than the future of medicine , from organ transplants to chemotherapy , is at stake , and there will be no second chances , ” So and colleagues warned .

In May 2003 , the Transocean drillship Discoverer Enterprise , under contract from BP , was getting ready to pull out of a nearly - completed development well for the Thunderhorse project in the Gulf of Mexico , about 40 miles south of the current ( 2010 ) spill at the Macondo prospect .
For some reason , the ship was dragged off its position such that the riser reaching down 6000 feet to the well at the seafloor was snapped off in two places .
In this case , a blind - shear ram blow out preventer ( BOP ) did its job , sealing off the well below and preventing what could have been the largest U.S. oil spill .
As it was , the only thing spilled was the drilling mud remaining in the various riser pieces dangling from the ship , buried in mud , or stuck vertically into the seafloor .
After rehabilitating the well and then taking stock of the fact that the unthinkable could have happened , BP and Transocean apparently decided not to think about it too much more .
Do n't Push That Button !
Drilling a well in thousands of feet of water from surface vessel is tricky business , and accidents do happen .
For a good survey of the various ways in which blowouts can occur , see this rather extensive report .
Also , the US Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , which oversees oil and gas extraction in the northern Gulf of Mexico , makes available on its web site reports of assorted accidents .
A number of cases involve the riser becoming disconnected from the wellhead and spilling drilling mud into the water .
It can be necessary to do this intentionally , or as part of an automated sequence , if the drillship cannot maintain its position directly above the well within some tolerance due to weather or strong currents .
For example , here is one incident from 2005 :
On July 5 , 2005 , an unplanned riser disconnect was initiated on the Ensco 7500 semi- submersible rig , which had been engaged in exploratory drilling activities , because of unfavorable sea and wind conditions associated with an approaching tropical depression .
While the riser volume was being displaced with seawater in preparation for the disconnect operation , the rig was no longer able to maintain station adequately enough to complete the operation .
As a result , the riser was disconnected from the Lower Marine Riser Package ( LMRP ) , at which time 710 barrels of synthetic - based mud was released from the riser into the GOM .
At the time of the disconnect , there were no open hole hydrocarbons exposed below the casing depth .
Here is a case where the disconnect became necessary due to bad data :
On December 2 , 2007 at approximately 1300 hours with well completion operations in process , the Dynamic Positioning Operator ( DPO ) was performing a routine preventive maintenance procedure for the Dynamic Positioning ( DP ) system when the riser Emergency Disconnect Sequence ( EDS ) was activated .
The disconnect was below the Lower Marine Riser Package ( LMRP ) where it connects to the BOP stack on top of the wellhead and resulted in the discharge of approximately 550 barrels of Sodium Bromide brine into GOM waters .
For this procedure , DP functional control was transferred from the primary console to the secondary console and the primary console was subsequently shut down .
DP functional control using the secondary console was observed to be normal .
The primary console was restarted approximately three minutes later and the data backup function was initiated by the DPO .
This function transfers control data from the online master console , at this time the secondary console , to other DP consoles to ensure correct synchronization between all consoles .
The data transfer from secondary console to primary console was completed but some of the data transferred was corrupted and the DPO did not observe this .
Functional control was then transferred from the secondary console to the primary console .
The DPO recognized there was a discrepancy for the rig position shown on the both the primary and secondary consoles .
In an attempt to correct the error , the DPO performed a second Initialize Backup function from the now master console , the primary console .
This caused corrupt data to be transferred back to secondary console which now gave both the primary console and secondary console corrupt control data .
The DPO , along with the Captain , observed the difference between the primary and secondary consoles and began trying to identify the fault .
This was done by changing position references , transferring control capability between the control consoles , and enabling / disabling different position reference sensors .
This resulted in another position reference sensor inadvertently becoming the master reference sensor and reset the apparent rig position such that the rig began to move further away from location when the DP system was trying to correct the rig position by moving the rig back on location .
This led the DP system to chase after an erroneous position causing the rig to move outside its watch circle and exceed the riser angle limit , thus leading to the initiation of the EDS by the DP system which took approximately 58 seconds to complete .
The process was initiated at the Driller Control Panel after confirmation was given by the DPO .
The ROV was launched to inspect the wellhead , subsea tree , and BOP stack .
The rig was moved to a safe location for the DP system to be analyzed and corrected .
This sequence of events is rather comical .
But better still are the cases due directly to human error ( although other humans contributed with poor design ) .
Here is one :
Investigation of Riser Disconnect and Blowout , Mississippi Canyon Block 538 , OCS -G 16614 Well # 2 , February 28 , 2000
The Ocean Concord was in the process of running a liner on drill pipe when the lower marine riser package ( LMRP ) was inadvertently disconnected from the blowout preventer ( BOP ) stack .
The disconnect resulted in the discharge to the sea of approximately 806 barrels of synthetic mud from the riser and 150 barrels of synthetic mud and 150 - 200 barrels of crude oil from the wellbore .
Some findings : The SSE [ Subsea Engineer ] was installing the panel guards on the Riser Connector function button on the remote panel at 1410 hours on February 28 , 2000 .
The remote panel cover was open and the face of the panel was pulled out at the time of the incident .
The SSE inadvertently contacted the LMRP disconnect button while he was drilling mounting holes in the BOP panel .
while he was drilling mounting holes in the BOP panel .
The SSE was unaware of the LMRP disconnection until he heard the alarms sounding , indicating low accumulator pressure .
The SSE stated during the Diamond SIR meeting that he did not follow any lockout / tagout procedures to de-energize the BOP control panel prior to working on the panel .
The light bulbs for the LMRP latch / unlatch functions were burned out at the time of the panel modifications .
The following information was provided to the panel by Diamond from their post - accident SIR meeting :
The SSE stated that he did not realize it was possible to lock out the remote panel until after the incident .
The SSE had never been to well - control training .
He had worked for another contractor as a roughneck and had recently trained with both subsea engineers on the Concord .
The SSE stated that additional training may have helped him prevent this incident .
The OIM stated that this was the SSE ’s second hitch on his own on the Concord .

He had worked for another contractor as a roughneck and had recently trained with both subsea engineers on the Concord .
The SSE stated that additional training may have helped him prevent this incident .
The OIM stated that this was the SSE ’s second hitch on his own on the Concord .
The SSE stated that he knew that if the riser unlatched that there would be a loss of mud from the riser , but he did not know that the well would flow .
The SSE also stated that he did not consider " any such risk prior to the job " of installing the panel guards .
Here is yet another problem involving a Sea Surface Engineer pushing buttons by mistake .
It can be found in the MMS reports here .
The incident date was January 19 , 2000 .
The rig 's subsea engineer was function testing the blind shear rams .
The weekly function test was performed from the remote blowout preventer ( BOP ) panel in the offshore installation manager 's office .
Instead of testing the blind shear rams , the engineer inadvertently pushed the LMRP button on the panel which unintentionally activated and disconnected the lower marine riser package ( LMRP ) .
The control panel buttons for the lower marine riser package ( LMRP ) did not have enough security to prevent activating the wrong function .
It was determined that 2,400 barrels of 60 % synthetic - based drilling mud ( SBM ) leaked into the Gulf of Mexico .
It is estimated that the lost SBM contained approximately 1,440 barrels of synthetic base oil .
Based on the block ( 822 ) , this would be an early well in the Thunderhorse field .
However , the first well in that block was n't completed until 10 months later , based on the development history of the field .
Thunder Horse 2 was drilled in Block 822 .
It reached its total depth of 29,060 ft in November 2000 .
The well was drilled by the Discoverer Enterprise in 6,300 ft of water , 1.5 miles south - east of the discovery well .
It encountered 675 ft net of pay in three primary intervals .
The discovery well Thunderhorse 1 was completed in 1999 in a different block , leading to the strong probability that this well is indeed Thunderhorse 2 -- and that it took another ten months to finish .
This document seems to confirm this identification ( see Appendix Table H - 2 ) , indicating the drilling started in December 1999 .
In any case , it brings us back to the broken riser incident we started with as the drillship involved above was also the Transocean Discoverer Enterprise .
BP 's currently underperforming Thunderhorse endeavor seems to have had a storied beginning as well .
Failure to Disconnect
Here is a brief MMS report on the riser break incident :
The spill occurred at Mississippi Canyon ( MC ) 778 , latitude 28.19 degrees N. and longitude 88.49 degrees W. It occurred as the Discoverer Enterprise was pulling out of the wellhole with bottom location at MC 822 .
At the time of the incident , conditions were 2 - 3 ft seas with a 1.9 knot current .
The drilling vessel was in the process of pulling of of the hole when it experienced wave action heaving and jarring .
The riser parted in two places at approximately 3,200 ft an 5,087 ft. water depths .
There was a release of 2,450 barrels of 58 % Accolade synthetic - based drilling mud ( SBM ) .
It is estimated that the lost SBM contained approximately 1,421 barrels of Accolade synthetic base oil .
I found more details , also apparently from MMS , here .
While drilling in approximately 6,000 feet of water , a drillship recently experienced a catastrophic failure of the marine riser .
The drillship was equipped with a dual derrick , and dual activity was being conducted at the time of the incident .
On the forward rotary , where the marine riser was installed , the rig crew was in the process of pulling out of the hole from total depth .
On the aft rotary , the rig crew was in the process of running 20 - inch casing for an adjacent well .
The failure of the flanged marine riser occurred when drillpipe had been pulled a couple hundred feet off - bottom .
At that time , the rig experienced a heave motion followed by a strong jarring action .
The ROV , which had been launched to observe the running of the 20 - inch casing , was dispatched to examine the marine riser .
When the ROV reached approximately 3,200 feet of water , it was determined that the riser had separated between riser joint 39 and 40 and was unloading the synthetic - based mud that was in use at the time .
The drillpipe was observed to be intact at this depth .
As the ROV traced the drillpipe deeper , it was found penetrating the lower section of buoyant riser that was free - standing from the seafloor to approximately 1,000 feet from the mudline .
The remainder of the riser was found scattered on the seafloor surrounding the wellhead and BOP stack .
As the ROV scanned the BOP stack , it was determined that the riser was cleanly parted about one foot above the lower marine riser package .
There was no flow observed from the well .
When the riser parted , the " dead man " system activated , and all fail safe valves , casing shear rams , and lower blind shear rams were closed .
The drillpipe was successfully sheared by this activation .
At a later point , the ROV used a hot stab to activate a second set of upper blind shear rams to provide another barrier on the wellbore .
Although the well control equipment functioned as designed , the parting of the marine riser resulted in a release of an undetermined amount of synthetic based mud .
The subject accident is currently under investigation by MMS .
Upon its completion , the investigation report , as well as a possible follow - up Safety Alert , will be made available to the public .
Your attention is directed to our conditions of approval for Applications for Permit to Drill involving the use of subsea BOP stacks .
The approval outlines our requirements for the shut - in capability of the well in the event of an unplanned disconnect of the lower marine riser package or the parting of the marine riser .
It should be noted again that , in this incident , the " deadman " system functioned properly and prevented the release of well bore fluids into the water column .
Shown below is a comparison of the Lower Marine Riser Package ( LMRP ) for the 2003 Thunderhorse well ( with the riser " parted " ) with that for the 2010 BP Macondo well after the bent riser was cut off with a saw .
In the case of the former , the LMRP was disconnected from the BOP using the hot stab panel .
For the Macondo well , this must not have been possible , since the " Containment Cap " to collect the oil was apparently designed to be sealed around the existing LMRP .

The Afterspill , and What Could Have Been
The final MMS report on this incident was rather inconclusive as to why the riser was ripped apart .
Fate and Effects of a Spill of Synthetic - Based Drilling Fluid at Mississippi Canyon Block 778
In particular , the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico was exonerated :
The Loop Current did not directly affect the MC 778 drill site on May 21 , 2003 .
Currents were weak in the upper 1,100 m ( 3,609 ft ) .
Current speeds below 1,100 m ( 3,609 ft ) are not known because measurements taken by the operator and made available to MMS did not extend from 1,100 m ( 3,609 ft ) to the seafloor at 1,841 m ( 6,040 ft ) .
However , one report on this incident , excerpted in the TAMU spreadsheet , reads as follows :
At the time of the incident , conditions were 2 - 3 ft seas with a 1.9 knot current .
The drilling vessel was in the process of pulling of of the hole when it experienced wave action heaving and jarring .
The riser parted in two places at approximately 3,200 ft an 5,087 ft. water depths .
What differentiates this incident ( along with many other cases of riser separation ) from the 2010 Macondo spill is that the BOPs did what they are supposed to in 2003 .
Most importantly , the blind - shear BOP engaged , cutting through the drillstring and closing off the well .
Shear blades to cut through the DP and seal the well ( Varco )
What if this had n't happened ?
BP definitely thought about this , and worked with the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration to consider the potential impact .
The top connector of the BOP was damaged , with one joint leaning against the BOP , dangerously close to the control lines ....
Loss of well containment would result in more oil spilled in a week than occurred during the whole of the T/V Exxon 's Valdez oil spill .
From : COMBINING MODELING WITH RESPONSE IN POTENTIAL DEEP WELL BLOWOUT : LESSONS LEARNED FROM THUNDER HORSE
NOAA performed modeling to gauge the consequences of such a large spill in deepwater , but many unknown parameters prevented definitive conclusions .
Indeed , the realization of the scenario with the Macondo spill has provided many surprises with regards to the fate of the oil and gas .
Heck of a Job , BP
Other paperwork which emanated from the near - spill seems less contemplative , but rather more inwardly focused on what went right in a corporate sense .
First , we have an article in the Society of Professional Engineers ( SPE ) journal , which is available in this preview :
Thunder Horse Drilling - Riser Break — The Road to Recovery
Here are the " Major Learnings " :
Show Leadership Commitment .
Implement Project - Management Practices Quickly .
Secure the Right External Technical Expertise .
Get the Right Support Staff .
Get People in the Right Places .
Plan How To Communicate Internally and Externally .
Also , BP funded a study by the School of Psychology at the University of Aberdeen , King ’s College , Aberdeen , Scotland .
Following the initial message from the rig to the Operations Manager , an Incident Management Team ( IMT ) was assembled in the Houston office .
The IMT immediately began to assess the situation , take steps to give instructions to the rig to assess and control damage , and to plan a longer - term response .
The IMT was faced with a challenging situation , one which had never been experienced before especially in such depths of water .
Fortunately neither injuries , nor environmental leakage had occurred .
A number of separate sub -teams were established and tasked with dealing with issues such as Operations , Riser recovery , Blow Out Preventer ( BOP ) operability , Well integrity , Well re-entry , and Relief well planning .
The task for the IMT was to assess and respond to any potential threat to people , wildlife or the environment , to secure the remaining riser section , to recover scattered riser pieces ( on the sea bed ) , and eventually to re-attach the pipes connecting the rig to the well - head .
After a period of 68 days , with a financial cost of $ 100,000 per day , the rig was re-attached to the well head and the well was stabilised without any leakages to the environment
From : INCIDENT COMMAND SKILLS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AN OIL INDUSTRY DRILLING INCIDENT
The Missing Memo
While such self - reflection is useful , recent events suggest that something is missing .
The difference between a cost of $ 6.8 million plus 68 days delay , and a cost of untold $ billions plus environmental disaster , was the last line of defense , the blowout preventer .
In the 2003 spill , and in many similar cases , the fact that the blind - shear BOP functioned as intended is not a sign that the system worked , for a truly fail - safe system would be where the last line of defense from disaster is never reached .
MMS did note the alarming trend in this 2005 memo :
Human Engineering Factors Result in Increasing Number of Riser Disconnects
A significant number of accidental riser disconnects have been experienced in deepwater operations during the last five years .
Each event had the potential for causing serious well - control issues .
So here we are five years later , and we finally hit paydirt with a failed BOP and a spill for real .
We can ponder about what would have transpired if the oversized wire cutters would have worked on the Deepwater Horizon , stopping the Macondo spill before it started .
A few internal studies by those involved .
Another MMS report of a drilling mud leaking from a severed riser .
Louisiana fishermen still working .
Snip .
Recently , reports have emerged that Patriots receiver Wes Welker would participate in training camp from Day One , and that coach Bill Belichick would apply caution , holding Welker out of some drills .
As it turns out , Belichick will be holding Welker out of all of them .
Mike Reiss of ESPNBoston.com reports that Welker will land on the Physically Unable to Perform list to open camp .
Because he’s on the “ active ” version of the list , Welker can join practice at any time .
If / when he does , however , the team will be required to count him toward the 80 - man roster .
Until then , Welker ca n’t practice with the team , in any way .
Two years ago , the Colts ran afoul of that rule by letting Peyton Manning participate in walk - through drills while still on PUP .
No action was taken .
( So , basically , maybe Welker can practice with the team before exiting the PUP list . )
A player can remain on the PUP list through camp and into the regular season .
If on PUP to start the regular season , the player is not eligible to join the active roster through Week 6 .
Welker suffered a torn ACL and MCL in the 2009 regular - season finale , against the Texans .
Expectations that he would be ready for the start of camp were fueled by his unexpected participation in at least one day of offseason practices .
I said I only want to be shot from the right
The Matrix is a great movie but a poor expression of Baudrillard 's philosophy .
The Matrix is quite straightforward , there 's no confusion , no paradox : you 're either in the Matrix , or you 're in the real world .
You may not know you 're in the Matrix , but that does n't change the fact that you are , or are not , in it .
A true Baudrillard Matrix would be a single fake world that became so real that you no longer needed the original .
The whole world becomes a fake ; there is no recourse to the real world .
You 'll know it happened when you look at a copy of something , the original of which you have had no actual knowledge , and say , " oh , that 's so authentic . "
face
I 'll start at the end : the top will fall .
Take a moment .
How do you feel ?
You 're probably not satisfied , whether you agree or not .
There 's no relief to it , no " aha ! " moment , no catharsis .
That 's because the top does n't matter .
You are looking at the wrong thing .
To explain how this can be known , you have to consider three metaphors that Nolan makes explicit .
A. First , Oh , look , a maze .
And Ariadne auditions for Cobb by drawing mazes , and builds model mazes ; and of course her name is neck deep in the metaphor of the maze .
But then nowhere in the movie is there anor metaphorical maze .
Arthur says they need a maze to better hide from the projections , but they do n't actually do this , right ?
When Ariadne draws her mazes for Cobb , he rejects the square mazes and is satisfied / stumped only by the circular classical labyrinth .
And anyway , mythological Ariadne did n't construct the Minotaur 's labyrinth -- Daedalus constructed it for her -- she merely showed Theseusof it .
But she did n't need to : a classical labyrinth does n't have multiple dead ends ; it is awinding path that leads either in or out .
But Theseus , like the audience , upon being shoved inside would n't have known theof the labyrinth -- dead ends or single path ?
So to be able to find the Minotaur , he needed to know which way to go , and Daedalus told him :
B. And so it becomes clear : it 's not an actual , it 's a , which brings us to the second metaphor :
A single path , that ends up back on itself .
The staircase defies geometry because it is fixed in a single perspective .
If you alter that perspective , then the illusion is revealed .
Hence , Arthur and Ariadne can walk around and around the stairs passing the woman who had dropped her papers ; and Arthur could sneak up on his attacker by going down the stairwell .
When the perspective changed , then Ariadne and Arthur had to stop walking ; then the surprised attacker could be pushed off a ledge .
But each of those times requiredby Arthur to " see " the staircase from another perspective .
Seeing it from a different perspective changed the reality .
Cobb 's not trapped in a maze , he 's trapped in a paradoxical staircase , covering the same ground over and over .
He does n't need Ariadne to lead him out ; he needs her tohim into another perspective .
II .
The third metaphor seems to be the wedding ring .
When he's in a dream , he wears a ring ; when he is in real life there is no ring .
So easy ?
Then why did Cobb insist on using the top -- something that Mal had touched and hence defeats the purpose of a totem ?
Why not just look at his ring ?
Well , give it a try yourself :
Pay close attention to how difficult it isCobb 's left hand .
Right hands abound ; left hands are hidden in pockets , under tables , in shadows .
Now that I 've said it , you 'll be astonished at how obviously deliberate it is that DiCaprio is hiding his left hand from us -- except at certain moments .
Nolan is actively frustrating your attempts at determining whether it's a dream or not .
Why so many long gun battles and fight scenes ?
Ca n't they just dream of being at the safe or past the bad guys ?
No .
That 's how we signify ( male ) conflict in movies ; on the way to catharsis , you have to fight .
All of this is the expression of the third metaphor , which is really the theme of the movie : III .
Doesn remind you ofbrothers wanted you to reference Baudrillard 's idea of a simulated reality substituting for " real " reality .
However , their execution was flawed .
The dream does not have an external reference , it is not an illusion of reality , but a simulation not based on anything real .
Cobb is specific about this when teaching dream architecture to Ariadne - do n't use memories ( which reference reality ) .
What becomes real for Cobb and every other dreamer is the simulation .
The dreamer merges their memory of reality with the architect 's imagination into the symbolic .
Only death is beyond the scope of the simulation -- and even that , levels deep , was a real possibility .
Other than that the simulation becomes the reality .
Fischer never reconciled with his dad , but Eames set him up to dream that he did , and upon waking behaves as if he did .
He was shown a simulation of a reconciliation and merged into it his memories and wishes .
Is that not real ?
Cobb had the same catharsis .
He dreamt -- four levels down -- a catharsis with his wife that never actually happened " in real life . "
But that does n't matter , not for Cobb or his kids .
What makes the film so perplexing is precisely the ambiguity necessary to get across the point about simulation .
If the narrative clearly identified totems , who was dreaming , and how many levels down we were , it would be clear to us the audience the difference between simulation and reality .
But that 's not the point of the narrative , indeed , it tries to frustrate that inclination .
The point is catharsis .
IIIb .
The problem with making the distinction " dream vs. not dream " is that it fails to get you off the staircase .
It 's debatable , but probably likely , that Cobb was on the phone with his kids in real life , and dreaming when with Ariadne in the cafe .
And that a Japanese tycoon can alter a gigantic criminal justice bureaucracy with a ten second phone call ?
Why does n't he just move his kids out to Paris ?
It 's more plausible that " the police want to get me " is a projection of his guilt ; Looked at from this , what 's dream and what 's not is irrelevant to Cobb .
If it matters to you , that 's your own baggage .
You want to know what 's real ?
His wife is still dead .
That 's real , very real , everything else in the world , no matter how real , is less real than .
But they had their time together , ( however brief and incomplete it may have been in real life , however sudden and savage and wrong was her death . )
It 's time to let her go .
What 's keeping you on the staircase is the fear that getting off the staircase means you 'll never see her again .
IV .
In the warehouse , Cobb explains that Mal was possessed " by the idea that their world was n't real . "
Adriadne tries to comfort him : " you 're not responsible for the idea that killed her . "
But of course he thinks he was .
He implanted that idea into her head in their 50 year dream life , she lay on the tracks with him so they could die / wake up , but that idea stuck into her real life -- so she jumped from a building .
That event gave him his guilt .
It is irrelevant whether her jumping happened in a dream or in real life -- he still carried a guilt around with him .
The top is n't the totem , and the wedding ring is n't his totem .
The totem is his guilt -- " this is my fault . "
It is his origin .
It is his inception .
He incepted himself .
V. Miscellany : many trains , Kyoto , freight train in the street , Cobb and Mal 's suicide train , the train underneath the moving bridge which Yusuf drives off .
Train is a common metaphor for thought , one track mind , train of thought , get back on track .
Water : stream of consciousness , put under , sleep deeply .
Symbol of the unconscious : fear death by water .
VI .
If you 're busy looking for what 's dream and what 's not , you 're just trapped running the staircase .
You need to change the perspective .
Cobb has Fischer hostage in the warehouse ; he tosses Eames disguised as Browning next to him and says , " you have one hour ! " ( to figure out " the combination " to the safe . )
Exactly one hour later ( yes , I timed it ) , Fischer and the real Browning escape from the submerged van and swim to the shore , where Fischer proclaims he will break up the company .
Yay , the plan worked , inception worked .
But if that dream time matches our ( the audience 's ) real time , then are we dreaming ?is also an allegory of filmmaking or narrative construction .
It 's a movie about it 's own making .
It describes how the simulation ( movie ) is constructed and manipulated so as to become the reality .
So change the perspective .
Forget about the top , forget about the ring , look elsewhere .
The children are wearing black shoes throughout the movie , until the final scene where they are wearing white sneakers .
But be careful , that does n't tell you what 's dream and what 's not , it tells you that they have changed .
That 's what 's important .
It may be a dream or it may be real , but they are now different -- they are n't aOthers have observed that in imdb , the children are played by two pairs of actors , two years apart .
In a movie about narrative structure , are we supposed to ignore the structure of that movie ?
I know just the gal ; and I 'll throw in a kid , for free . )
So either he is truly awake at the end and about two years have passed since Mal 's death ; or he 's still asleep , but has moved past staricasing memories and moved into new dreamspace .
It does n't matter to Cobb .
What matters is n't whether the top stopped spinning ; what matters is that Cobb did n't bother to find out .----
ISP Filter Trial May Have Been Illegal
Despite the fact that there are a lot of people out there who openly oppose the mandatory internet filter proposed by the current Labor government , most are unable to argue their case from a purely technical standpoint .
Fortunately they do n’t need to , thanks to outspoken critic and engineer Mark Newton , who is now claiming that the ISP filter trials held last year may have been illegal .
According to Ben Grubb over at ZDNet , Newton has been talking to the government for a year over how they conducted the trial , believing that some of the equipment used would have intercepted customers traffic , which would breach section 7 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Telecommunications ( Interception and Access ) Act 1979 .
The key item in question is the Marshall M3000 , which according to Newton received a complete transcript of all internet data from the trial period , which would contradict the Telecommunications Act
Despite the process taking over a year , Newton still has n’t received the answers to his questions , only a statement from the Government claiming they did no wrong .
He ’s now hoping that the matter will be investigated by law enforcement .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Obama on Thursday signed legislation to fund his troop surge in Afghanistan , even though it was stripped of money for domestic stimulus programs .
Congress passed the bill on Tuesday and Obama signed it without public remarks in a low - key Oval Office session .
Democratic leaders had to rely on Republican support to pass the $ 59 billion measure , which provides money for 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan and other programs .
With Pentagon leaders warning that money for the troops could run out as early as Aug. 7 , the House accepted the Senate 's pared - down measure .
POLITICS : More Dems oppose new war funding
The bill favored by the House would have included billions of dollars to help keep teachers on the job , provide aid for college students and enhance border security .
With the new war spending , the total amount of money that Congress has allotted for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan surpasses $ 1 trillion .
The signing took place just says after the unauthorized release of thousands of classified documents on the war that revealed some of the problems with the mission and with the Afghanistan government .
Obama had urged for quick passage of the emergency funding despite the publication of the sensitive battlefield reports that reignited debate over the war .
The funding was requested by Obama in February .
After the Senate passed it in May , the House on July 1 approved its own version tacking on more than $ 20 billion in domestic spending .
The Senate last week rejected that approach , falling 14 votes short of what was needed to break a GOP - led filibuster .
The bill includes more than $ 33.5 billion for the additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and to pay for other Pentagon operational expenses , $ 5.1 billion to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief fund , $ 6.2 billion for State Department aid programs in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq and Haiti , and $ 13.4 billion in benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange .
In addition to stripping out money for teachers and student aid , the final bill does not provide more than $ 4 billion requested by the administration to finance settlements of long - standing lawsuits against the government , including $ 1.2 billion to remedy discrimination by the Agriculture Department against black farmers and $ 3.4 billion for mismanaging Indian trust funds .

The controversial decision , the first of its kind in the 210 - year history of U.S. representative government , was , according to Justice David Souter , " a response to the clear , demonstrable incompetence and indifference of the current U.S. citizenry in matters concerning the operation of this nation 's government . "

As a result of the ruling , the American people will no longer retain the power to choose their own federal , state and local officials or vote on matters of concern to the public .
" This decision was by no means easy , but it unfortunately had to be done , " said Justice Antonin Scalia , who penned the majority decision in the case .
" The U.S. Constitution is very clear :
In the event that the voting public becomes incapacitated or otherwise unfit to carry out its duties of self - governance , there is a danger posed to the republic , and the judicial branch is empowered to remove said public and replace it with a populace more qualified to lead . "

" In light of their unmitigated apathy toward issues of import to the nation 's welfare and their inability to grasp even the most basic principles upon which participatory democracy is built , we found no choice but to rule the American people unfit to govern at this time , " Scalia concluded .
The controversial ruling , court members stressed , is not intended as a slight against the character of the American people , but merely a necessary measure for the public good .

" The public 's right to the best possible representation is a founding principle of our nation , " Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told reporters .
" If you were on a jet airliner , you would n't want an untrained , incompetent pilot at the controls , and this is the same thing .
As federal justices , we have taken a solemn oath to uphold every citizen 's constitutional rights , and if we were to permit an irresponsible , disinterested public to continue to helm the ship of state , we would be remiss in our duties and putting the entire nation at risk . "
Just some of the millions of empty voting booths that can be seen across America each November .

The ruling brings to an end a grueling 10 - month process , during which more than 100 Supreme Court hearings were held to determine the public 's capacity for self - governance .
Despite the fact that these hearings were aired on C - SPAN , a majority of U.S. citizens were unaware of them because coverage was largely eclipsed by the Clinton - Lewinsky scandal , the retirement of NBA legend Michael Jordan , and the release of Titanic on home video .
The Supreme Court found that , though 78 percent of U.S. citizens have seen the much - anticipated Star Wars prequel trailer , only one in 200,000 were aware that the multibillion - dollar " Star Wars " missile - defense system had been approved by Congress .
Additionally , while 62 percent of citizens correctly identified the cast of Suddenly Susan , only .01 percent were able to identify Attorney General Janet Reno beyond " some woman Jay Leno always says looks like a man . "
Further , only .0003 percent could correctly identify the ancient Greek city - state of Athens as the birthplace of the concept of an educated citizenry participating in democratic self - rule .

But the final straw , Supreme Court justices said , came last week when none of the 500,000 random citizens polled were aware that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had threatened global thermonuclear war in response to NATO air attacks in Yugoslavia .
" I mean , come on , " Justice William Rehnquist said .
" Global thermonuclear war ?
It 's just ridiculous .
There was just no way we could trust such a populace to keep running things after that . "

Populations currently being considered to fill the leadership void until the American people can be rehabilitated and returned to self - governance include those of Switzerland , Sweden and Canada .
" I 'm willing to do what I can to help out in this time of crisis and make sure that my vote counts , " said Stockholm resident Per Johanssen .
" I 've been reading up on America a bit , just to get a general idea of what needs to be done , and from what I can tell , they really need some sort of broad - based health - care reform over there right away . "

In a provisional test of the new system , the Canadian province of Saskatchewan will hold primaries next Tuesday to re-evaluate last fall 's gubernatorial election in Minnesota .
The lone dissenting vote came from Justice Anthony Kennedy , who , in his minority opinion wrote , " Although the American people are clearly unable to make responsible decisions at this time , it is not their fault that they are so uninformed .
Rather , the blame lies with the media interests and corporate powers that intentionally keep them in the dark on crucial issues . "

Kennedy concluded his opinion by tendering his immediate resignation and announcing his intent " to move to a small island somewhere . "
Thus far , reaction to the ruling has been largely indifferent .
" The people ruled unfit to govern ?
Yeah , I I think I might 've heard something about that , " said Covington , KY , sales representative Neil Chester .
" I think I saw it on the news or something , when I was flipping past trying to find that show about the lady sheriff . "

" At least now I 'm free to do my soap - opera - trivia crossword puzzles in peace , without all that distraction about who 's running for Second District Alderperson and what - not . "
Despite the enormous impact the ruling would seem to have , many political experts are downplaying its significance .

" It does n't really change anything , to be honest , " said Duke University political - science professor Benjamin St. James .
" The public has n't made any real contributions to the governance of the country in decades , so I do n't see how this ruling affects all that much . "
" I would n't worry about it , " St. James added .
" It 's not that important . "
Sharron Angle , the Republican trying to unseat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , made herself an easy political target when she told an interviewer that cutting unemployment benefits was the right thing to do :
RALSTON : How would you have voted on that bill to extend unemployment benefits ?
ANGLE : I would have voted no , because the truth about it is that they keep extending these unemployment benefits to the point where people are afraid to go out and get a job because the job does n't pay as much as the unemployment benefit does .
And what we really need to do is put people back to work .
To be fair , though , Angle is n’t the first conservative to make this suggestion .
And her argument has a certain intuitive appeal : Would n’t generous unemployment benefits discourage people from finding work ?
In fact , a 1990 study of unemployment benefits by Lawrence Katz and David Bruce Meyer suggested as much :
They found a significant link between how long people could receive payments and how long people stayed unemployed .
( For each five to six weeks of extra benefits , people would stay unemployed one additional week . )
Katz and Meyer also noticed that people stopped being unemployed at the same time as their benefits ran out — proof , it would seem , the more generous benefits encourage people to stay jobless .
But subsequent research showed otherwise .
A 2007 study from David Card , Raj Chetty , and Andrea Weber took a closer look at what happens to people when their unemployment benefits run out .
They do n’t magically find jobs , it turns out .
Rather , they simply stop submitting the information that would cause the government to count them as unemployed .
Remember , to be officially “ unemployed , ” you have to be seeking work .
And unemployment benefits are only available to people who declare they are hunting for a job .
Once the benefits run out , people no longer bother to make that declaration .
( Why go to the trouble , if you ca n’t get the benefits anyway ? )
So the statistics stop counting them as jobless even though , as the researchers found , only a tiny fraction of workers return to the workforce right when benefits run out .
Typically , migraine is considered to be an episodic disorder with discrete attacks of headache .
But new research by Dr. Till Sprenger and his team from UCSF Headache Group and Technische Universität München found increased network activity -- stronger functional connectivity -- bilaterally in the visual , auditory and sensorimotor network in migraineurs .
" There has been increasing evidence that the processing and perception of sensory stimuli is abnormal even outside of attacks , " said Dr. Sprenger .
" Now our findings underline that abnormal brain activity in migraineurs is not restricted to attacks -- that there is an extensive alteration of functional connectivity in multiple networks reflecting the migrainous phenotype , emphasizing that migraine is a disorder of the brain . "
Findings are being presented at the American Headache Society 's 52nd Annual Scientific Meeting in Los Angeles .
" This research has been anticipated for some time and is absolutely fundamental to our understanding of migraine , " said David Dodick , M.D. president of the American Headache Society .
" It is likely that the observed interictal abnormalities of brain activity and connectivity explains the predisposition to spontaneous attacks , as well as the vulnerability of migraineurs to a myriad of external and endogenous triggers .
It may also explain the persistence of headache in some sufferers and the persistence of symptoms in between attacks of pain ( e.g. sensitivity to light ) . "
More than 200 scientific papers and posters are being presented during the AHS meeting which is expected to draw some 500 migraine and headache health professionals including doctors , researchers , and specialists .

The crisis continues in the new world financial order with no end in sight and no real solution being put forth .
Ben Bernanke , the head of America 's central bank , admitted as much in comments before Congressional committees last week .
Austrian economists , investors and analysts have been saying this since before and after the global financial crisis hit the world in mid-2007 .
More government regulation and more fiat currency will not fix what ails the world economy notwithstanding any of Bernanke 's comments to the contrary .
" We are ready and will act if the economy does not continue to improve , if we do n't see the kind of improvement in the labor market that we are hoping for and expecting . "
Bernanke said in comments before the Financial Services Committee of the United States House of Representatives .
This comes as concern continues in the halls of Congress of a Democratic bloodbath in November 's mid-term elections .
The politicians are not concerned about the world economy and its impact on consumers and investors .
The politicians and their staffs are concerned about their jobs , power and influence as unemployment continues to remain at 9.5 % ( using a broader government index the rate is 16.5 % ) , the housing industry remains in a slump , the economy slows and fears of a double - dip recession accelerate notwithstanding the Federal Reserve and US government having spent $ 3.7 Trillion since July 1 , 2009 .
Some international politicians have already been shown the door for their inability to handle the global financial crisis .
Gordon Brown in the UK and Kevin Rudd in Australia are two major examples and the off - year elections in America indicate no better fate for many Democrats in Congress come November .
Various governments in Europe are also under threat as the crisis spreads to governments which are effectively insolvent .
The GFC is a crisis in the ruling elites ' government - run and - supported financial system which threatens the world economy but it is not a crisis of the free market as so many pundits in the media suggest in their effort to place the blame other than where it belongs — government warfare and welfare expenditures , taxation and intervention in the financial system through central banks and fractional reserve banking .
After having created and spent trillions of fiat dollars , pounds , euros and yen on bailouts , nationalizations and stimuli it still has not worked .
Bernanke 's only tired solution is more of the same .
The market wants a correction of the malinvestments caused by the excessive debt and spending which caused the problem in the first place .
This is why unemployment remains high , the recovery is very slow and the threat of a double - dip recession looms on the horizon .
Liaru2019s Poker ( Nort ... Michael Lewis Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 6.50 ( as of 03:10 EST - Details )
The global financial crisis is the correction of the credit bubble 's malinvestments .
In early August 2007 when the correction commenced ( and before the Federal Reserve had time to actively intervene ) the markets began an immediate correction — commodity prices began to fall dramatically , the stock market began to fall and the value of some overvalued currencies such as the Australian dollar began to fall .
We will never know how rapidly and in what form the unfettered real correction would have taken place since the Federal Reserve and then other central banks preempted the functioning of the market when they actively intervened .
The slide ( correction ) in stock markets , commodity prices and overvalued currencies stopped .
What appeared to be a “ recovery ” for the financial community ( but not for the consumer ) took place .
Commodity prices soared and the stock market went sideways .
All the experts cheered but not the consumers .
Oil reached new all - time highs as it approached US $ 150 per barrel ( some predicted it would hit $ 200 per barrel or more ) on international markets and gasoline topped $ 4 a gallon while hitting a high of A$ 1.65 per liter in Australia .
The swift correction and real recovery demanded by the market was deferred and replaced by central bank and government intervention .
Over the next 14 months the Federal Reserve lowered the target federal funds rate seven times , dramatically increased the money supply and intervened 34 times in the financial markets , primarily providing U.S. Treasury securities ( for which there is a market ) to investment banking firms in exchange for those firms ' holdings of mortgage - backed securities ( for which there was no market ) .
The sub - prime meltdown spread like a wildfire throughout the financial industry in September 2008 with what were then unprecedented central bank and government interventions and bailouts attempting to put out the fire storm .
Trillions of dollars , pounds , Euros and other currency were wiped off the value of share markets and the holdings of shareholders around the world in just one week ( in addition to the values that were wiped out since August 2007 ) .
Despite the intervention the market was not to be denied the correction it demanded and soon the first major steps toward unwinding of the malinvestments began to occur — the correction was underway notwithstanding the efforts of central bankers and governments .
Events unfolded like a chapter out of Ayn Rand 's popular novel , Atlas Shrugged .
Countrywide Financial was taken over by Bank of America and Bear Stearns was taken over by J P Morgan in March 2008 with some help from their friends at the Federal Reserve Bank .
Bear Stearns was a major participant in the private derivatives market ( the risk market ) of credit default swaps ( referred to in the industry as CDS , private contracts “ insuring ” against the defaults of securities ) .
When it became apparent that Bear Stearns could not cover the risk it insured and that its default would thereby bring down the house of cards , the Federal Reserve stepped in and pushed Bear Stearns into the arms of J P Morgan .
The politicians and bureaucrats as well as their organs of propaganda , the establishment 's news media , told us not to worry .
Congress passed a new housing bill to provide relief to hundreds of thousands of mortgagees thereby raising the debt ceiling $ 800 billion to $ 10.6 trillion .
Then in early September Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were hastily restructured from being quasi-nationalized to being completely nationalized .

Then in September 2008 Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail and go into bankruptcy ( another government created procedure for reorganizing companies ) and within a week the bankruptcy court allowed Barclays Bank to acquire the core assets of the 158 - year - old Lehman Brothers .
Merrill Lynch an icon of the American financial industry for 94 years was taken over by Bank of America .
Then American International Group ( AIG ) also in the business of insuring against defaults similar to Bear Stearns pleaded for a lifeline of $ 40 billion from the Federal Reserve to save it from bankruptcy ( and more importantly as we later learned to save Goldman Sachs from bankruptcy since it was at risk for billions were AIG to fall into bankruptcy ) .
The next day the Federal Reserve generously bailed out AIG with much more than AIG requested .
Halifax Bank of Scotland ( HBOS ) was pushed by the British government ( Prime Minister Gordon Brown personally intervened ) into the arms of Lloyds TSB as HBOS ' stock crashed .
In reaction to the AIG bailout Goldman Sachs whose stock was in free fall issued a note to its clients indicating that “ The rescue package for AIG could mean that systemic concerns are going to moderate from very elevated levels . ”
With hindsight we now understand the significance of Goldman Sachs ' statement — significant to Goldman Sachs ' survival .
But the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury were only getting warmed up .
Trillions of more fiat dollars were created to act as capital for the insolvent new world financial order 's banks and financial institutions , thereby avoiding a run the likes of which the world had never seen .
Then General Motors and Chrysler were nationalized as was the US health care industry at a cost of billions more and the United States continues its military efforts in Iraq and is poised to increase its military efforts in Afghanistan , the world 's largest producer of poppies .
Europe is bailing out the governments of Greece , Spain , Portugal and who knows what other governments despite these governments having all breached their prior budget agreements with the EU .
Nothing has changed except the billions have morphed into trillions of fiat dollars created by central bankers around the world and still there has been no real recovery from the GFC .
One can only speculate on the outcome three years later had the market correction and liquidation of the malinvestments which started in August 2007 not been thwarted by the intervention of governments around the world .

As chief banker to the government Mr. Bernanke should have advised the Congressional committees last week that continuing along the same path as he and the other central bankers have done is not working and that an alternative solution should be applied — dramatically reduce government welfare and warfare expenditures , shelve the nationalized health care program , end the participation of the United States ' involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , dramatically reduce federal taxes , sell the shares the government holds in nationalized businesses , return the United States dollar to a gold standard , allow private currencies to trade freely in the marketplace with Federal Reserve notes , eliminate the Federal Reserve 's banking and financial cartel and end the deposit insurance system .
As Frank Shostak , the eminent Austrian economist from Australia , has pointed out in Mises Daily government and central bank intervention through taxation and inflation destroys savings ( wealth ) and shrinks the pool of savings available for real investment in real projects ( versus the malinvestments created by central banks inflation ) demanded by consumers .
What is needed is more savings to create more wealth for more investment and the cessation of the theft of savings and wealth through government taxes and central bank depreciation of the currency .
More savings and wealth is what is needed for a recovery to begin not more central bank and government intervention .
Many popular books and documentaries have been released about the GFC and its causes .
They all tend to have the same theme ; the crisis was caused by the failure of the free market to function as promised by the regulators .
Inadequate government regulation and Wall Street greed are to blame they say never pointing a finger at the Federal Reserve or other central banks ' creation of trillions of fiat dollars and other fiat currencies .
They do not have any understanding of the root cause of the crisis or they do but as part of the ruling elite 's propaganda ministry are compelled to shift the responsibility away from the root cause .
The politicians and bureaucrats love this — crisis and conflicts and government intervention is the game in which they thrive as they take on “ responsibility to solve the problem ” ( the problem government caused in the first instance ) .
An overhaul of the financial industry is needed they say and so they pass another law .
More power is given to the central bank and government .
Except for the Austrian economists , libertarians and Ron Paul few if any place the responsibility where it belongs — government intervention in the marketplace .
So what more should governments and central banks do to aid in the correction and recovery ?
Absolutely nothing Mr. Bernanke !

The Best of Jacob Steelman
Why so much noise about so little ?
Why is Ed Balls bellowing , teaching unions wailing and Lib Dem rebels moaning about a bill that does nothing much at all ?
Like a child with a nightmare the left has worked itself up into a terrible agitation about the academies bill , although the measure has hardly more substance than an imagined ghost under the bed .
Michael Gove 's law , which will finish its parliamentary stages today , concedes no new powers of any importance .
It makes no difference to present rules on funding or selection .
It compels nothing .
The bill merely tweaks control over the curriculum and greatly accelerates the process by which good schools can transfer to a status that already exists .
This is incremental legislation : reform by photocopy ; a Xeroxed repeat in darker print of the plan that the last government worked towards – and that its wiser members , in the Lords , still support .
Free schools , started by parents ?
They can create them already if they really try .
Selection ?
Banned before , banned now – unless your school is one of those grammars that no one dares abolish .
Primaries to become academies ?
The 2002 act allowed that .
Taking academy status without consulting parents and pupils ?
That can happen under Labour 's legislation .
Outside sponsorship ?
The prospects were fading already ;
Gove is recognising reality by dropping the requirement for successful schools .
English secondary education has undergone more reconstruction than the M1 , endless diversions around selection , comprehensives , localism , centralism , and a bit of everything – which is where we are now .
This bill introduces no new brand of school ; no extra cash ; no anything , really , except the extension of what we already have , which was anyway the aim of the last government when Tony Blair promised " every school an independent school " .
That was before it became inconvenient for Labour to take the side of consumers over providers .
In the Lords , Andrew Adonis , who created academies , and still supports them ( and who was an education minister under Gordon Brown ) cavilled at some aspects of Gove 's new bill ; but the flavour of his opposition is illustrated by one of his worries : that Gove 's free schools should be called academies , too .
And in fact it seems they will .
No wonder – given the meagreness of substance – that objectors have turned questions of process , complaining at the speed with which the legislation has been introduced and – today – will be passed .
They omit to mention that in 1997 Labour abolished assisted places with equal haste and used the same parliamentary contrivance , a committee debate on the floor of the Commons .
The bill is indeed being rushed through for effect .
But Labour can't see the trick .
The rush hides not the enormity but the thinness of the measure ; opposition outrage enhancing the impression that something big must be under way .
All that 's under way is a carrying forward of an idea and policy born under the last government .
Labour is now scorning its own achievement .
Blair saw , in a speech in 2005 , the danger that his party might reject academies as a backdoor route to privatisation and middle - class exclusivity , distrusting all it cannot control .
Balls – a brilliant oppositionalist – has convinced the left that this will be the outcome .
But the left did n't take much convincing , since centralism and fear of freedom run deep in its DNA .
It appears impossible for anyone associated with the Labour party in its present mood to believe anything other than that every problem needs a state - directed answer , and that even a mild lifting of government will result in mayhem and inequality .
So it wants good schools to be directed not just by local authorities ( victims of both Labour and Tory plans ) but by the centre .
Almost all the freedoms that come with academy status – flexibility over wages , hours , the curriculum – arise from a lifting of Whitehall control .
It is from the loss of local authority input – nearby help when a tree falls through the roof , or in managing admissions – that problems arise .
A wise Labour party would be challenging the government on this point : a brave one would call for the abolition of England 's interfering department for education , rather than boosting it into some mini-me Brownite empire , as Balls attempted to do .
An engaged opposition would also understand that Gove 's law ( and the similar policy Lib Dems set out before the election ) will stand or fall on the size of the pupil premium , giving schools a financial incentive to include disadvantaged pupils and penalise middle - class ones .
This reeks too much of the market for Labour to endorse it , but if set high enough it could have an astonishing and positive effect .
It is , in fact , the only revolutionary part of coalition education policy , which is presumably why it has been so little discussed .
Gove must be worried the Tory party might notice .
Labour is too tied up in protecting teachers ' pay and conditions to care .
Yet everything depends on a financial number : the size of the premium .
The number is n't in the bill .
Some details will come in a written statement today .
That is what Labour should be obsessing about , rather than restaging its own debate about academies from a decade ago .
The party is defining itself once again as the defender of the same old state .
This battle is nominally about schools ; but the intellectual parameters will shape everything in this parliament .
Well , count JPMorgan analyst Pavan Wadhwa among those who think the stress tests were a joke and that only bad can come now .
Here are the key bullet points :
The European bank ' stress ' tests were anything but ;
just 7 banks failed with a paltry € 3.5 bn total capital
shortfall …
• … due to a lack of rigour in macroeconomic stresses ,
leading to low portfolio loss rates …
• …and the fact that sovereign haircuts were applied
only to trading books and not to accrual books
• Our estimates show that the lack of rigour in CEBS
stress scenarios resulted in a 1.7 % upward bias to
Tier I capital ratios …
• …and the focus on Tier I ( not core Tier I ) resulted
in a 1.2 % lower capital hurdle …
• … for a total bias of 2.9 % in Tier I capital ratio
estimates
• Eliminating this bias suggests that 54 banks would
have failed a more stringent stress test , generating a
capital shortfall of €60 - 75bn
• We believe that the stress test results will fail to
restore financial confidence , leading to lower yields ,
wider spreads , lower EONIA , and a flatter EONIA
curve

The elderly receive a large amount of government assistance – an amount that is not commensurate with their numbers .
The total annual income in the United States ( national income , as economists call it ) is about $ 12.5 trillion , or about $ 40,000 per person per year .
The egalitarian view of government is that it taxes persons with annual incomes more than $ 40,000 , and pays benefits to persons with less than $ 40,000 , so that those with less than average incomes could enjoy living standards closer to the average .
For reasons that I began to explain last week , our government actually does the opposite .
The vast bulk of government spending goes to the elderly , whose average living standards are significantly above $ 40,000 per year .
Social Security , Medicare and government employee retirement ( federal , state and local ) are government funds paid to people aged 62 and over ( aged 65 and over , in the case of Medicare ) , and total about $ 1.5 trillion in the current fiscal year .
Annual Medicare spending is $ 12,000 per person aged 65 and over , and growing .
Annual Social Security and government employee retirement payments are $ 21,000 per person aged 62 and over .
Medicaid , hospital and other public health programs are open to persons of all ages , although those programs spend more per participant on the elderly than on the others .
I estimate that , on average , these health programs are annually spending $ 7,000 per American aged 65 and over .
Combined , the public pension and public health programs are spending an average of $ 40,000 per elderly American per year .
Thus , even if elderly Americans could rely on no other income source , on average they could have living standards of $ 40,000 per year .
Moreover , many of the elderly have significant private incomes and wealth in their homes , which means that elderly average living standards actually far exceed $ 40,000 and thereby exceed the living standards of the average American .
How is it possible that so much government spending goes to persons with above average living standards ?
This is one of the great puzzles in economics and political science .
Some ( including commenters on last week ’s blog entry ) have argued that elderly Americans vote more frequently , and with more attention to Social Security and health policies .
However , that does not explain why nondemocratic governments – where leaders were not chosen by free and competitive elections – also pay at least as much to their elderly citizens .
Another explanation is that the marketplace is far from egalitarian , and it is difficult for the government to be much different .
If a family thinks it is appropriate for grandfather to have a higher living standard than his grandchildren , then they probably would not support a government that attempted to reverse that pattern .
The question for the future of Medicare is this :
Are families ready to triple their spending on the health care of their highest - income members ?

Dave Weagle was just recently awarded the US patent for his latest design suspension design , thesystem .
Inside you can read all the details , as well as “ Wow , what a trip this one has been .
Since I launched the existence of this design publicly in May of 2007 , I ’ve been inundated by requests from bike brands interested in partnering up to develop new Split Pivot frames .
I feel like I ’ve chosen some great brands to welcome into the Split Pivot family , brands that have their own individual flavor and ideas , and who really complement each other .
It ’s been a crazy ride getting the Split Pivot design to this point , and I ’m thrilled for my partners to finally be able to show off that patent number proudly on their bikes .
We ’ve been testing prototypes from different brands for some time , and I know the member companies of the Split Pivot family are excited for the world to see the benefits of our collaborations and hard work .
We ’ve discussed , designed , tested , and refined , and we feel like the bikes that we ’ll be bringing to the market with Split Pivot technology showcase a level of suspension refinement that riders of any skill level can appreciate on the trail .
It ’s has been so difficult keeping the existence of new prototype models secret for so long so I am glad that part is nearly over and that it ’s time for the world to see how good this design can really be when dialed in .
I think that riders are really going to enjoy this system .
It allows for atypical main pivot placement that works great for acceleration and bump absorption , and the concentric dropout pivot lets me tune braking forces and leverage ratios to a high degree at the same time .
Basically the Split Pivot design helps us to make bikes that are a lot of fun to ride .
” Split Pivot is a patented suspension system for high performance bicycles , where traction , efficiency , maneuverability , and frame stiffness are important factors on the track and trail .
Split Pivot ’s ( ) , a pivot at the rear wheel axle joining the seatstays and chainstays on a bicycle , is the heart of this new design .
Shaped by Dave Weagle 's competition proven engineering and testing process , each unique Spilt Pivot frame is engineered to combine the best performance traits of single pivot and long arm linkage suspensions .
Split Pivot is all about having fun on the trail , and each unique suspension layout is designed to offer a ride that will make you smile no matter what your riding style or ability level .
Split Pivot ’s concentric dropout pivot design separates acceleration forces from braking forces in the suspension .
The system reduces excess suspension reaction to acceleration forces , and at the same time reduces excess reaction to braking forces .
Braking neutrality can be tuned independently of acceleration characteristics , and suspension feel can be tuned by varying leverage ratio curves in a wide range of options .
It ’s no secret that mountain bikers like individuality , and the Split Pivot design lends itself to a wide range of different looking and performing designs .
With so many possible mechanical layouts , not every Split Pivot bike looks or performs the same .
Shock layout can be vertical , horizontal , floating , or even driven by a rate modifier link .
This variability lets
Dave tune the suspension performance and feel to each manufacturing partner ’s preference , giving each Split Pivot bike its own personality unique to each brand .
Split Pivot bikes are tools for having fun , and each is carefully engineered to offer a ride that will make you want to be on your bike more often .
Currently there are six licensees of the patented Split Pivot technology worldwide .
2011 Split Pivot models will be available in late 2010 from four USA and International brands .
Two of the six brands have already announced their collaboration with Dave Weagle and Split Pivot .
Seven Cycles , one of the world ’s premier custom fabricators , will be offering a full line of Split Pivot suspension frames , including .
A product of Seven ’s leadership in custom bike fit and design and Dave ’s work in human ergonomics and suspension tuning , each Seven Split Pivot frame is custom tuned to accentuate an individual ’s specific riding style , ability level , and body type .
Legendary East Coast brand Spooky Cycles will be offering two models in 2011 , a downhill race model reviving the Project X moniker and a 145 mm trail bike for aggressive XC called Mothership .
Eurobike and the UCI World Championships will see the launch of full Split Pivot MTB lines from two highly respected International mountain bike brands that have yet to be announced .
Weagle to date has designed some of the most race proven bicycle suspensions on the market , and it is expected that Split Pivot will see the same pedigreed success as its predecessors .
Riders can learn more about the Split Pivot design , and those with too much time on their hands can download and read the Split Pivot 7,717,212 patent , at www.split-pivot.com .
The Split Pivot design has additional patents pending in the USA , Asia , and Europe .
Split Pivot , Split - Pivot.com , and Ride for fun ! are pending trademarks of Split Pivot Inc .

UPDATE : Check out this note we received from David Mastio , Deputy Editorial Page Editor at The Washington Times :
SUBJECT : poor silly newspapers I hope you ’ll be forgiving when they come crawling back .
Feel free to link us however you like .

You might have noticed that the principal authors of Colorado Pols have not cited The Denver Post , or several other newspapers in the state , for some weeks .
We ’re sorry to tell you it ’s not an oversight or laziness on our part , but the result of legal action threatened against us by MediaNews ( owners of the Post , Boulder Daily Camera , Ft. Morgan Times , Lamar Ledger , and Sterling Journal - Advocate ) , Freedom Communications ( Colorado Springs Gazette ) , and Swift Communications ( owners of a number of small - market papers in Colorado – all are listed at the bottom of this post ) .
We stopped citing these sources soon after receiving a “ cease and desist ” letter , while we evaluated our options and sought legal advice .
You can read the entire letter here , or follow along as we go through some of the key excerpts .
In essence , the Denver Post and 16 other Colorado newspapers have opted to take their ball and go home because they do n’t want to play with us anymore .
Here ’s the blow - by - blow from the “ cease and desist ” letter , and our response .
( Pols Note :
The letter is addressed to Jason Bane , who is listed as the point of contact for the ColoradoPols.com LLC .
There have always been multiple authors writing under the “ Colorado Pols ” moniker )
We are writing today to lodge notice with you of our clients ’ objection , and their intent to seek relief if no corrective action is taken , to your firm ’s flagrant and persistent theft of our clients ’ intellectual property by the Colorado Pols website at www.coloradopols.com.
Your publication ’s wholesale , and unjustified , use of the news content published by our clients , which is produced at significant expense by them and from which your firm is deriving advertising revenue everyday without our clients ’ permission and without any compensation to our clients by your firm , constitutes multiple violations of our clients ’ rights under the federal Copyright Act and the common law doctrine of hot news misappropriation .
Without getting too far into the legal mumbo- jumbo , our understanding of the law expressed in this letter ( which comes from actual lawyers , not us reading Wikipedia ) suggests they are incorrect .
There are a number of reasons why they are incorrect , but here are some of the main points :
First off , you ca n’t steal something that is already given away for free .
This would be like Westword accusing you of stealing their newspaper by taking it out of one the FREE bins located all over town .
We ’re not going behind any paid system or other kind of firewall and offering up content that you would otherwise have to pay for online .
We would understand complaints if we had been repeatedly cutting and pasting entire articles , but we ’ve always avoided doing that and have made that point to other posters on multiple occasions .
Not only are we posting only a few paragraphs from stories THAT ARE ALREADY FREE FOR EVERYONE ONLINE , we have gone out of our way to name the publication , highlight the author in particular , and provide a clear link to the story .
Legally speaking , we do n’t actually need to do any of this , but we ’ve always tried to be symbiotic Internet purveyors and give credit where credit is due ( incidentally , the Post almost never links to us or even mentions Colorado Pols when we have a story before they do , which happens all the time , but we do n’t go all “ attack of the killer attorneys ” on them ) .
What ’s more , the case law this letter cites pertains to some obscure spam site that was republishing AP news stories in their entirety without attribution .
After the efforts we have always made to properly credit the cited publication as well as the story ’s author in boldface , such a comparison is insulting in the extreme .
Second , the idea that The Denver Post or any other outlet owns “ hot news ” is absurd .
Twenty years ago the only way you could get your local news was to subscribe to a newspaper or watch one of the network TV stations ’ nightly news broadcasts .
That , of course , is no longer the case .
By and large , the stories that we have referenced from the Post are not “ exclusive stories , ” and thus they have no claim to the “ hot news doctrine . ”
If we reference a Denver Post story about the winners at the state convention , we ’re doing so as a way to quickly catch up a reader at Colorado Pols as to a subject we are about to discuss .
But we could just as easily do the same thing by using another news outlet as the source , or by not using another news outlet at all .
It ’s not exactly a big secret when the winners are announced at the Democratic or Republican state conventions , and we get all the same press releases they do .
We also get a tremendous amount of breaking news and inside information directly , just like the Post and other news outlets .
It appears that the entire business model of the Colorado Pols website is built upon flagrant copying of the hard work of all manner of news media organizations , including not just our clients listed above but others of this firm ’s clients , including the New York Times , Associated Press , and CNN .
That ’s cute that they think we have a “ business model , ” but the idea that people come to Colorado Pols so they can read The Denver Post is , in a word , stupid .
People come to Colorado
Pols to find out what politicos in the state are discussing , which is unrelated entirely to which news outlet we decide to reference on a given story ; for example , it ’s not unusual for a daily “ open thread , ” which includes zero content from us , to end up with more than a hundred comments from people just discussing whatever issue they choose .
People come to Colorado
Pols to be part of a large and growing online community interested in Colorado politics .
People come to Colorado
Pols because they know that elected officials , staffers and journalists also read Colorado Pols on a daily basis .
If Colorado Pols succeeded only because of what other news outlets were doing , it would stand to reason that the closing of The Rocky Mountain News in 2009 would have caused us serious damage .
Obviously that did n’t happen , and in fact , we ’ve consistently added readers for years now .
One of the neat things about the Internet is that we do n’t have to make assumptions here – we can actually show you whether or not referencing the Post is vital to our “ business model . ”
In April 2010 , the last full month that we referenced the Post or any of the outlets included in this letter , Colorado Pols generated 617,661 page views .
If it were true that our very existence depended upon the Post and similar news outlets , it would stand to reason that our traffic would drop dramatically once we stopped talking about them , right ?
We ’ve told you what kind of traffic we received in April , and we ’ll tell you what kind of traffic we have once the month of July is completed – an entire month of no references to the Post or others listed in the letter , from either us or others posting diaries or comments .
We are fully confident that our traffic wo n’t decrease because we are n’t referencing the Post , because we know that our success has absolutely nothing to do with the Post , the Lamar Ledger , or any other news site .
People come to Colorado
Pols to read ( wait for it ) Colorado Pols .
It ’s not any more complicated than that .
Each of the instances of infringing copying listed above involved the unauthorized appropriation of the heart of a breaking or highly newsworthy story , taking the lead and the principal substance of the underlying reporting .
We love this part of the letter .
Apparently we only link to the Post or one of the other mentioned news outlets if it is “ a breaking or highly newsworthy story . ”
Like the May 9 , 2010 edition of the Lamar Ledger : “ Jane Norton makes campaign stop in Lamar . ”
We ’ll never forget that story - that was one SMOKING hot scoop .
In fact , people are still buzzing about it today .
Everywhere we go , we hear someone talking about that Jane Norton visit to Lamar .
Moreover , because none of the postings by Colorado Pols generated any appreciable traffic at the websites of the underlying publishers , it is beyond dispute that this copying by Colorado Pols harmed the market value and revenue generating potential of the infringed works .
Indeed , MediaNews Group has been monitoring the traffic to its sites from Colorado Pols during the listed time period , and the links inserted by Colorado Pols in the infringing excerpts of MediaNews Group ’s stories are generating no more than zero to five clicks to the underlying stories at The Denver Post ’s website .
1 [ Pols emphasis ]
This pattern of a lack of any appreciable traffic from Colorado Pols is the same for Swift and Freedom .
The explanation for this lack of traffic is quite obvious : Colorado Pols is taking so much of our clients ’ reporting that no reader need ever click through to the underlying story that Colorado Pols has copied ; Colorado Pols has taken anything , and everything , of value in the reporting by our clients .
1 . And even these numbers are overstated because they include my own click - through ’s to monitor Colorado Pols ’ activities .
Before we begin discussing this section of the letter , let us offer a profound apology .
We had no idea that Colorado Pols was somehow responsible for damaging the revenue potential of The Lamar Ledger .
If only we could go back in time and stop people from not reading The Lamar Ledger !
And while we ’re at it , we ’re also sorry for causing BP to spill all of that oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
Sorry about that .
Really .
Oh , and for the Denver Broncos trading several draft picks in order to take Tim Tebow in the first round of the NFL Draft … no , nevermind .
We ’re not taking that blame for that one .
Anyway , our bigger beef with this paragraph is the completely ridiculous statement that a link from Colorado Pols produces “ no more than zero to five clicks to the underlying stories at The Denver Post ’s website . ”
Now , we ca n’t explicitly prove this to be false , because our stats do n’t provide a complete picture of outbound links or “ click - thru rates , ” but we can show the likelihood of this claim to be pretty close to zero .
Let ’s go back to April 2010 , the last full month in which we would have linked to stories in The Denver Post .
In April , Colorado Pols generated 617,661 page views .
According to this letter , The Denver Post is lucky if 5 people clicked on a link posted at Colorado Pols on any given day .
If this were true , it ’s more likely that you know someone who speaks Yiddish than it is that you know someone who clicked on one of our links to The Denver Post .
Please be advised that our clients hereby demand that Colorado Pols cease and desist from any and all unauthorized literal copying from our clients ’ newspapers or websites , i.e. , from any of the publications operated by MediaNews Group , Freedom Communications , and Swift .
Our clients reserve all their rights with respect to this matter , including their right to seek injunctive relief to halt your website ’s unlawful conduct .
Well , then , consider us ceased and desisted , so as not to be injunctively relieved .
As we mentioned earlier , we do n’t believe these claims to be accurate , nor do we believe that they would stand up in court .
But we also do n’t believe that we actually gain anything from referencing The Denver Post or The Lamar Ledger , so it ’s no big deal for us to just stop talking about them altogether .
Note that the letter is not asking us to stop providing links or to stop mentioning their name – they just do n’t want us to use “ blockquotes ” and repeat any part of any of their stories at Colorado Pols .
What they want , of course , is for us to continue to link to them , but only in such a way as to make sure that more people go to their website .
So here ’s what we are going to do :
Not only are we going to stop referencing passages from The Denver Post and other news outlets listed in this letter , but we ’re going to go one step further .
We ’re going to go out of our way to not even mention these news outlets at all .
We ’ll just link to our partners at The Washington Post , or other local news sites , or any other of the thousands of other potential sources out there .
We reserve the right to discuss something that might appear in one of these papers , but we ’ll just do what traditional media outlets like the AP have done for decades – we ’ll just say , “ Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall today , according to The Denver Post , ” and then continue on with our own writing .
But for the most part , unless it is a truly important exclusive story that no other news outlet is reporting , you wo n’t again see us talking about The Denver Post or the other news outlets listed below .
We are n’t overestimating our own importance to say that not linking to the Post will have a major impact on their traffic , but it certainly wo n’t help .
The bigger point is that we lose absolutely nothing by deciding to cease from pulling a few paragraphs out of one of their stories , but the Post and their quality reporters lose plenty of exposure that comes from other links – which , of course , is the lifeblood of the Internet .
The Post and these other news outlets do n’t understand that their real problem is not something they can fix with a letter from an attorney .
Heck , it ’s not something they can fix , period .
As we started to discuss earlier , the Internet has forever removed the one thing they had a premium on : Distribution .
They may think that trying to sequester their own content will somehow make it more valuable , but that horse has long since left the barn , and there ’s no way to put it back .
Newspapers used to have a monopoly on distribution , because if you wanted to know what was happening in your state , your country and around the world , you did n’t have a lot of options outside of your daily newspaper .
But now that you can find the same story from numerous other outlets online , their monopoly on distribution of the news just does n’t exist .
By now , some of you are probably asking , “ So what ’s really going on here ? ”
We do n’t claim to know everything that motivated MediaNews CEO Dean Singleton and these lesser papers to take this action , but we do have a theory .
An obscure memo from Singleton to MediaNews employees in May 2009 provides a clue .
We will begin to move away from putting all of our newspaper content online for free .
Instead , we will explore a variety of premium offerings that apply real value to our print content .
We are not trying to invent new premium products , but instead tell our existing print readers that what they are buying has real value …
This statement is remarkable for a number of reasons , but the biggest problem with what Singleton is proposing is it is totally counterintuitive to how marketplaces work .
The market determines the clearing price of a product , not the owners of that product .
Attempts to force the market to give you a bigger profit …well , they end in disaster .
Every time .
The idea that the Post will suddenly become more valuable if it is not offered for free online does n’t fix the fundamental problem that the news in general is already offered online , everywhere , for free .
It does n’t make the print version of a newspaper more valuable or more relevant if you have to pay to read it online ; all it does is make the newspaper more complicated to read , and thus , less attractive to most potential readers ( and advertisers ) .
In going to a paid online model , what they will be doing is saying , “ you ca n’t get our version of the news for free anymore . ”
In response , most people will just shrug and visit other websites instead , just like we are doing in response to this letter .
The only way this approach could possibly succeed–and we emphasize possibly — is if every news outlet in the country decided to do the same thing , thus forcing readers to pay for something if they wanted coverage from the “ traditional media . ”
But even that would n’t likely succeed because of the prevalence of so many new media outlets and blogs–many of which already get more readers than their local “ news media ” counterparts ( incidentally , Colorado Pols receives more traffic than a lot of the newspapers listed below already ) .
Having committed to this line of action , Singleton goes ever further :
We will build a new local utility site ( Local.com ) , which is an ecosystem of local information , resources , user content , shopping guides , and marketplaces .
This site will be focused on a younger audience as well as other targeted audiences based on demographics which are attractive to our current and potential advertisers .
Got that ?
First they ’re going to try to make you pay for stuff you can already get for free …and then they ’re going to try to replace the popular local blogs and websites that people already read with a new , souped - up version of the moribund YourHub.com .
And to make sure it works , they ’re going to send nasty cease - and - desist letters to local websites beforehand , thus fraying relationships that would lead to future links that would elevate their popularity over time .
Sounds like a recipe for smashing success , do n’t you think ?
As we have sought advice ( both legal and otherwise ) on this matter , it has been suggested to us that Singleton , and some like - minded newspapers , may be using our blog as a test case for a much larger assault on independent new media in general , and blogs and “ feedreaders ” in particular .
Somebody at the Post could have just , you know , called us instead , but maybe it ’s good for the economy to give more work to lawyers .
If we ’re the guinea pig in this little experiment , then so be it .
Nobody wins in this silly confrontation , but we certainly do n’t lose , either .
It ’s no secret that traditional media executives like Singleton blame “ the blogs ” for much of their recent decline , but what they should really be blaming is the Internet in general .
We did n’t change the rules or the reality – the Internet did that all in one big bang .
What ’s done is done , and there ’s no going back to the days before Al Gore built the Internet tubes .
There are really two ways to deal with the advent of new media and ‘ uncontrolled ’ distribution of the news : you can either accommodate this new reality and find ways to mutually benefit ( and increase your online traffic ) like our partners at The Washington Post and National Journal have gainfully done , or you can break out the lawyers and try to retreat into a paid firewall content cave .
The first approach is useful in increasing website traffic and generating new links , which leads to more online traffic , and so on .
We honestly can’t tell you the benefit of the latter .
We submit to you , our loyal readers since 2004 , that only one of these approaches will result in survival for the print newsrooms we all greatly respect and value .
Look , we have no desire or interest in seeing the demise of local newspapers , and we had no interest in blocking out the Post and these other newspapers from Colorado Pols .
Sending us threatening legal letters may make the bean counters at The Post and these other outlets feel better , but it accomplishes basically nothing .
You do n’t want us to use excerpts from your website ?
Whatever .
Today , we are just one less online source sending readers to The Denver Post and the other mentioned news sites .
Maybe this will benefit the Post , and maybe it wo n’t .
Either way , tomorrow will look pretty much like yesterday from where we ’re standing .
What This Means for Colorado Pols Users
The good news for Colorado Pols users is that this does n’t change much for you .
The main thing to understand is that diaries should not include excerpts from any of the news outlets listed below , and no diary that includes a link to any of the outlets listed below is likely to be promoted to the front page .
As we said , you ’re free to discuss stories that appear in these publications , just like the AP has done for years reporting the work of other news services .

July 16 , 2010 - TF2 Team
Just a quick , but excited note : TF2 maps.net has opened their doors on their new Art Pass Contest .
It 's a fantastic opportunity for everyone involved : you get a chance to show us how much better at detailing maps than we are , and our ( ex ) art team gets a chance to find new jobs at companies that still need their kind !
The agency has regularly faced criticism for undertaking politically motivated inquiries , especially those involving opposition politicians .
It has also prosecuted scientists and academics for what it has contended were illegal transfers of classified information abroad .
And now , the Kremlin seems bent on making the F.S.B. even stronger .
Parliament , controlled by Mr. Putin ’s party , is in the process of approving legislation that would allow F.S.B. agents to warn people that their activities were “ unacceptable ” and leading toward a crime .
The K.G.B. once employed a similar practice against Soviet dissidents .
The F.S.B. would not comment on Ms. Kazakova .
Regional prosecutors said her arrest had nothing to do with the security agency ’s resort .
But they could not explain why in many other municipal corruption cases in the region , the F.S.B. was not involved , and defendants were treated far more leniently .
“ There are laws in Russia , but the security services are beyond any laws , ” said one of Ms. Kazakova ’s lawyers , Dmitri Dmitriyev .
“ They act with total impunity .
They can undertake special inquiries , collect information on people , violate fundamental human rights , put people in prison , keep them there as long as they want , manipulate judges and manipulate prosecutors .
This case is just a demonstration of all this . ”
Ms. Kazakova ’s longtime companion , Dmitri Matveyev , 40 , who had lived with her for years , wanted to marry her after her arrest , but the judge in the case would not allow it .
After Mr. Matveyev gave an interview to The Times , he said he was visited by two F.S.B. agents , who instructed him not to speak to The Times again .
“ I told them that I am not going to listen to them , ” Mr. Matveyev said .
“ It has been two and a half years , and that has been a long enough period of silence .
That is why I am going to talk . ”
Getting Things Done
Ms. Kazakova made her fortune operating hotels and markets in Irkutsk , earning praise for her savvy all the way to the Kremlin .
She then turned her attention to Listvyanka , a downtrodden fishing village on Lake Baikal , an environmental masterpiece that by some estimates has 20 percent of the world ’s fresh water .
OnLive Turned On
By Kris Graft
For Steve Perlman ’s OnLive , the moment of truth arrives this week .
On June 17 , just after the conclusion of the E3 convention in Los Angeles , the long - awaited cloud - based gaming service will finally go live for the initial influx of OnLive subscribers .
Originally announced at Game Developers Conference 2009 , some have heralded the service as an industry game - changer -- gaming on a cloud means that data is bounced back and forth between a remote server and a user ’s machine .
High - powered data centers handle the brunt of a PC or Mac game 's system requirements , and all a gamer needs to play high - end games is a good internet connection and a screen .
It can theoretically reduce the hardware barrier , at the same time providing game makers a direct link to consumers .
But there are still many who are skeptical if OnLive can deliver -- that it can change the way we receive and play games .
The company has demoed the service and amassed support from prominent game makers , but onlookers want to see OnLive in the wild to see if it really works .
In the ramp - up to launch , we caught up with OnLive CEO Perlman , who does n’t promise to change gaming as we know it , but rather expresses a somewhat cautious approach to a brand new way to deliver games , in terms of tech and business .
And he ’s tired of talking about lag ( but he still talks about it at length anyway ) .
So , the launch date is June 17 , and that 's official .
Steve Perlman : Yes .
It 'll be open , I think , about an hour after E3 closes .
What kind of marketing push is OnLive putting behind the service 's launch ?
And how are you guys getting the word out beyond the core gamer ?
SP : We 're starting out everything with a ramp .
One thing we 've learned with beta is this is different from anything else that 's ever been done before .
We just got a lot of questions in the beginning .
Some are really , really basic .
Some people are conceptual .
You know , " What 's going on ? "
It 's not something people have seen before .
Plus , we just added a boatload of new games .
Any time you 've got many thousands of anything hooked up together , you want to take it a little bit slow .
We had this pre-registration program , and we invited 25,000 people that subscribed .
So , we finally cut off and said , " That 's it . "
What we 're going to do is let the first - come - first - serve in the pre-registration .
Let 's get out and get onto the service .
We 're going to gradually roll that out over a series of days .
The people that sign up starting on June 15th , when is when this AT&T program is set up to start , then [ after ] we 'll begin again making it through that list of people .
So , we will be running it well below maximum capacity on June 17th when we open up the doors .
It 's just sort of a necessary step .
We want to see if there 's any systematic bugs or errors or something crept in , maybe if it was something we did , or whatever .
We 'd rather do that with 10,000 rather than with a 100,000 people .
Then , we need to go in with ramping it up .
This is like introducing a new kind of very large jetliner in a way , and we expect the takeoff to initially have some turbulence -- you know what I mean .
Just some bumpy stuff .
Once we 've got to cruising altitude and it's smooth -- then , at that point , we will , for example , start a larger marketing campaign with the service .
As soon as we feel like things are really solid , then we 'll roll out the MicroConsole [ which will allow OnLive to play on televisions ] .
How far into the future do you expect to do this ramp - up before you get to cruising altitude ?
SP : Well , I do n't know .
The very important qualification is it 's going to depend on how things go .
The other thing is what demand there is .
We ended up having more people in the pre-registration [ than expected ] .
So , we 'll see .
How many people were in the beta ?
SP : Well , we had hundreds of thousands of people that signed up , but not every single person got invited because we had [ for example ] 10 people who were on the same ISP , the exact same area , the same block , it does n't do us much good to have multiple ones testing , you know what I mean .
So , it was pretty spread across the country .
We cycled through them .
For example , you have a new group of people who are updated now .
I saw an email kind of fly through , " By the way , it 's time for your beta , now that it 's a week before launch . " [ laughs ]
The particular configurations were something we had to bug everyone to make sure that everyone we had and were able to verify .
So , it 's kind of like that .
The people who were nice enough to go and sign up , we have a large pool to draw from .
That 's what we 've done .
I do n't know how many thousands we 've gotten in .
I have to actually go through our records to figure it out .
The pool is hundreds of thousands that we drew from
Different people tend to do different things at the same time .
We actually have had several different , we 'll call them " farms " , server farms , set up .
We 're testing MicroConsoles , and we 're testing a version of MicroConsoles .
So , we 're testing Macintosh , different versions of the algorithm .
The compression algorithm that we use , integrates both what in traditional terms we call " error correction " but more appropriately is " error concealment " because when you have a very , very good network connection going into a university or a business , it has packet loss for all the packets that get dropped .
And certainly consumer connections have a lot .
So , most of what we 've been doing over the last few years and most of the stuff that has been going on in beta has been going just through tens of thousands of homes .
I do n't know what the number is , but I guess at this point thousands of different models of computers going through all the different compatibility scenarios .
I guess it 's hundreds of ISPs .
I 'm pulling these numbers out of my head , a vision of where are numbers are now .
Very large number of ISPs .
There are a million things that could go wrong .
SP : Yes .
So , when we go live , we now have over a hundred algorithms that are actually deployed depending on the particular scenario you have .
We keep adding them .
We added a couple more last week , for example .
It worked fine for those people ; it just worked better with these tweaks .
And we 'll continue to evolve it .
In fact , when you 're connected , for example , as soon as you start playing at 3 PM and 5 to 6 PM comes round , and a lot of people get onto your cable connection , you 'll get a different algorithm for us .
We swap the compression algorithm , so you probably wo n't notice it , but it actually is streaming differently because of course it needs to overcome different obstacles .
You guys had a recent announcement with BT .
SP : Yes .
Now you have a new partnership with AT&T .
Are you currently in talks with companies like AT&T , Comcast , Verizon about bundling OnLive with their services [ to get OnLive in more homes ] ?
SP : In the U.S. , we have all different kinds of discussions with U.S. operators as well .
I think you can take the fact that AT&T decided to partner with us in launch and offering this promotion , and the promotion works across with any connection , needless to say ...
What they 're demonstrating so far is in addition to being an investor , they are also a strategic partner .
That 's part of why they wanted to be with us as we roll out from the very beginning .
Their brand is associated with OnLive on the consumer side .
And Verizon and Comcast ...
Bigger providers might be taking a wait - and - see approach and see how it goes ?
SP : Well , we have n't announced anything with those providers .
What I can say is the following , that in our data centers , we have about a dozen different connections coming in from different providers .
They 're called T1 providers .
The reason we do this ...
I 'm giving you a little bit of the ingredients .
When we connect to your home , if we just go through the internet , we might get a route that is very , very roundabout , right .
You know , it might not be direct from our data center to your home .
So , what we do is we actually go and connect you through a number of different providers in order to find a route that is minimal latency , minimal congestion , and best throughput .
So , what we 've ended up doing is partnering with I think most -- I guess at this point , yeah -- most of the major ISPs in the United States .
So , we actually have relationships with all these ISPs in addition to AT&T .
AT&T is one of them .
We 're able to go and make direct routes to people 's homes .
So , again , it 's not a consumer announcement .
If we were to make an announcement about that , it'd be more like our Dell announcement , you know what I mean .
It 's a business announcement because it's on the data center side .
But the impact it has on the consumer is that we 're able to find better routes and get into your home .
And frankly , we can't get to every ISP .
There 's a lot of little ISPs out there , you know .
But we can certainly get into , at this point , the majority of broadband connections in the U.S. with a direct route .
I see that you guys are partnering with Dell .
The quality of the service kind of relies on how close the data center is , right ?
SP : The biggest issue is actually not how close the data center is .
The biggest issue is what sort of latency you are having in what we call the last mile , the connection between your ISP 's either central office , in the case of a telephone operator , or the head end in the case of a cable operator .
We have a data center in Silicon Valley in Santa Clara .
At this point , we 've overflowed the data center , so we have multiple data centers .
But anyway , so we have this cluster of data centers -- that 's a better way to describe it -- in the Bay Area .
So , suppose you 're in , I do n't know , in Sunnyvale , which is extremely close to these data centers .
You might have a 20 millisecond lag if you have sort of a worst case ISP in that last mile .
And somebody else , who is , for example , in Las Vegas is hundreds of miles away from a data center .
If they have an ISP that only has a five or ten millisecond delay ...
The delay in the internet is probably less than 10 milliseconds or less from Las Vegas to Silicon Valley .
So , that person would actually have a lower latency connection than somebody who is closer and has a higher latency last mile .
So , a lot of people do n't realize that .
A thousand miles on the internet , using the techniques that OnLive is using to find an optimal route ...
I mean , obviously , that 's as the crows fly a thousand miles , right .
If you 're routed a roundabout way , then you much further than a thousand miles .
But a thousand miles on the internet is about 21 milliseconds , okay .
The worse case we see pretty much is around 25 milliseconds .
Are you getting tired yet about people asking you about lag and OnLive ? [ laughs ]
SP : I am .
So , the other thing is we 're going to be putting out facts .
There 's a lot of misconceptions about latency .
It 's a brand new technology , and it 's fair for people to ask .
We 're going to need to understand this , right .
For example , we 've measured monitors that have 80 milliseconds of latency .
The monitor . [ laughs ]
In fact , we spoke to that monitor manufacturer , who will remain nameless [ laughs ] , and they understood what we were doing .
They got excited about it , and they came out with a new line of monitors that have 9 milliseconds of latency .
They 're some of the best monitors out there now , okay .
So , people just do n't think about it .
But you know , if you have an 80 millisecond monitor , anything you 're playing on it , a local game , you 're going to see some lag in a local game .
But people do n't think about it because they figure , " Okay , it 's local , so lag is not on my agenda to thing about . "
Some of the mice you can get that are 15 milliseconds of latency , or you can get mice with 1 millisecond of latency , you know what I mean .
It 's a huge swing .
So , what we 're going to do is put the facts .
We 're going to say , " Look .
Here are the kind of things that introduce latency .
Please let us know .
If you 're going to be on a lagging experience , come tell us .
Tell us what your system is so we can go and try to test that equipment . "
Then what we 're going to try to do is put up a list of different equipment and how we 've measured it .
Not every laptop , but most laptops have pretty low latency screens .
So , you know , again , not every trackpad , but trackpads are probably not the best thing to use for gaming .
But nonetheless , at least it 's built in , and there 's a good chance the latency is not too bad on it , right .
So , give that a go before you kind of condemn the whole system .
[ laughs ]
These are things that we need to educate people on .
The bottom line is this : if you have a good connection to OnLive and your gear is low latency , you have a low latency experience .
It works .
It really does .
It 's never going to be low latency as having the exact same computer capability locally , right .
I think that 's an obvious thing , right .
There 's a load of latency introduced by the internet .
But the thing that we need to get across to people is that the latency is not exactly what you expected .
Sometimes the latency is actually not the internet .
Most of the latency is in the last mile .
Actually , most of the latency , if you do n't have optimal equipment , is in your gear , your monitor , and your mouse .
And then the next place you look is in the last mile .
And actually , the third place you look is in the internet .
Moving on from latency , there is the business model .
So , I 'm just going to quote Dave Perry [ head of cloud - based gaming company Gaikai ] .
People compare Gaikai and OnLive , but really , to me , they seem like quite different things at this point as far as the business models go .
Anyway , back in March , he was criticizing your business model .
He was saying you 're " paying $ 15 only to have the opportunity to buy the games .
So , $ 15 gives you no games .
If you decide , ' I do n't want to keep paying that subscription , ' you 've just lost access to your games bought at full price . "
What would your argument be about that ?
SP : What we said in March is we were going to charge $ 15 a month at a maximum , and then we would announce promotions before we launched .
And in fact we did .
So , OnLive is free , and then after the first year , if you want to stay , and it 's completely optional , it 's $ 4.95 a month , and it 's month to month .
Plus , it 's not in the press release , but it 's in our terms of service .
You can suspend anytime you want .
So , if you were going on vacation for three months and you 're not going to have internet service or something , we will hold onto your games and your game saves and anything else you 've got , right .
So , I do n't think there 's any real cost to using OnLive , and I do n't think there 's any real risk .
I think in retrospect , I probably should not have even said anything about pricing .
We had a lot of people pushing us to say what kind of price it would be .
So we said , " Look .
How are we going to tell you how much it wo n't be more than , and then say that it expects to be less than that ? "
The reason we had to be very cautious about announcing a price back in March is that until then , beta only had back catalog games .
So , we looked at usage patterns , but we really did n't know what usage patterns would be if you have a brand new game that someone 's likely to play through the end , right .
And the other thing is we had a bunch of different equipment that we were doing from an engineering point of view , and we expected that to go through to reduce the cost , but you really do n't know and you can't really get a quote on components , on servers , and you know , we have custom silicon in there , until you get to very large volumes .
So , we said , " Alright .
Let 's go put out a very cautious number . "
We figured nobody would be too upset if the price came down .
So , in fact , we were able to bring the price way down .
And so here we are .
And to the point where AT&T is really happy to sponsor the first year .
So , I think that concern that you need to spend money in order to use OnLive evaporates .
First of all , demos are free , so there is really no cost in that .
And again , for the first year , actually for the first two years , I think you can take $ 4.95 a month , you know , for 12 months , which would be the second year , and amortize it over two years , it 's less than the cost of Xbox Live if you get Xbox Live on an annual basis .
And you can't cancel that on a month to month basis .
A lot of the concerns that people have about the cost of the service , month to month , probably should have evaporated at this point .
In some ways , you 're asking me a question about , " How you would respond to a misconception about old news ? "
At this point anyway , [ the free year is ] a promotional thing , and we might be talking two years from now .
It sounds like you guys want to keep it as low as possible , possibly through other sponsorships or partnerships in the future .
SP : There will be such amazing announcements coming .
So , we 're not worried about people thinking OnLive is too expensive .
That 's fair to say .
[ laughs ]
You know , we have a zero million unit install base right now , so publishers need to be concerned about maintaining consistency across all the different places where they sell their games .
Games usually are priced the same as they are with other things , with Steam - type systems and so on , or Direct2 Drive , etcetera , or retail .
But the opportunity with OnLive to package games in many different ways that are difficult to do through either downloads or physical media .
So , you 'll see things like , instead of a rental for some number of days , you 'll see , if you will , you can pay for a certain number of levels .
" Oh , you really do like the game ?
Well , how about some more levels . "
What today we think of downloadable content , you know , DLC , I think you 're going to begin to see as like these are just option packs that you click and they go right away , you know what I mean .
There 's no downloading .
And then there 's going to be , you know , models like they have with Facebook and Zynga , where the games themselves are free and they 're paid for by in - game purchases .
I mean , you 'll see ad - supported games where there 's no cost at all .
They 're promoted with ads .
And you 'll see ads that become games -- somebody has a product or an offering , and you actually get to try it out .
I mean , an example would be like a new car , and you click on it , and you take the car for a drive , and it looks just like the real car , you know what I mean .
" I think I 'll try it with a larger engine option , " and see how that happens .
Or try different tires and see how well it corners on a really serious race track .
The ways we can package the OnLive experience are just innumerable .
There are many , many different possibilities .
You know , we are a start - up company .
[ laughs ]
We 're not Sony or Microsoft .
With Sony or Microsoft , or Nintendo , they have enough money in the bank that they can go and say , " Alright .
It 's going to be three months before launch , it is going to be free for the first people , then $ 4.95 .
Then after that , we 're going to have this program .
Then after that , we 're going to have that program . "
Unfortunately , I do n't have the privilege to do that .
I have to kind of wait until all the ducks are lined up before I say , " Okay , here 's the promotion that we have . "
I think people should take what they 're seeing with this announcement on June 15 as an indication of the direction OnLive is going .
Like you said , it 's a new technology and people have questions , but I think one of the best things that you guys are doing is saying , " Hey , we 've got Konami .
We have Capcom .
We 've got Epic and all these game publishers . "
It kind of gives people an indication that maybe you guys are onto something here if they 're agreeing .
Can you kind of describe in general how OnLive went about convincing these publishers to release their games on the service ?
And how did that go in convincing them to support and put their games on OnLive ?
It seems like they 've been receptive .
SP : There 's been secret data centers that we 've set up .
[ laughs ]
And we announced one of them with BT .
People do n't realize that damn thing has been up since 2009 .
All this time , we 've been in Europe .
What we did is we certainly talked to publishers , but you do n't really push this one through the publishers .
It was the developers .
It came from the bottom up with the publishers .
The developers , we gave them test accounts on these private servers .
And it was kind of funny because we had to maintain confidentiality between each of them .
So , they 're all going to be surprised with this announcement .
They have no idea how many publishers are coming because we kept them all separate up until this point .
So , the way OnLive was picked up by the developers is very simple .
They got on , and they started to play it .
That 's it .
They started to use .
And that answered every question they had .
They took the thing home .
They tried it from their own connections .
They used it .
They hammered on it .
They asked us questions .
They dug into it .
Some of them put in network impairment simulators , which would go and add packet loss , add latency and the equivalent of congestion , jitter , etcetera .
And that 's why .
You know , this is their brand .
Their reputations are going along with these games , right ?
They 're not just going to throw them out there on anything .
And so it was after that that , one by one , they came in .
The developers are bubbling over .
And the business guys who are running the companies , are bit more cautious .
You know , they 're sensible .
They have to maintain their existing relationships , and they should .
But the developers , what they 're like is , " Not only do I get rapid distribution but I can watch people while they 're beta testing .
I can actually see people while they 're playing my game . "
Which is so cool .
And then the developers , they spoke to their parent companies .
SP : They said , " This is cool .
We should be on this thing .
We should try it . "
And then we talked to the parent companies .
The business proposition is very good for them .
The thing with used games ...
Before the days of GameStop , the publishers have always had bargain bins .
When games get older , they charge less for them .
The difference now with GameStop is those dollars , when the price goes down , do n't go to the people taking the risk on creating the content .
They 're going into GameStop , which certainly has some retail risk and so on , for overhead , that 's certainly true .
But none of it is going to the publisher .
They do n't have a problem with online games being cheaper , you know .
It 's whatever the market will bear .
They 're not going to charge more for a game than people will pay .
But what they want to be able to do is make it so that the tail of the life of these games comes back to them .
Because otherwise , they 're very , very motivated to make games that have very short experiences , so they can make as much money as they can before it enters the used game market .
With OnLive , it gives them an opportunity to do that where you can't copy the game .
There 's no piracy .
There 's no used games .
It gives them the opportunity and makes it so that the dollars that are paid for for games funnel into game development .
They 're still subject to competitive forces .
If there 's a better game out there , people will go to the other game .
And if people stop playing the game , they 're going to have to lower the price .
So , the market will determine the price of the game , and they have to create a game .
So , it 's not going to change anything from the point of the consumer and the cost of games to them .
It will change things from the point of view of how many games they 're going to get , what kind of risk the publishers are willing to take on new ideas , and how sophisticated those games are going to be .
That 's what 's going to change over the next year or two .
You have n't revealed the pricing for the actual games yet .
SP : No , I can tell you .
The range is from about $ 5 to ...
We have one game that 's $ 60 that 's a brand new , very hot game .
But most of them are in the middle .
It looks just like you 'd expect .
It 's a smorgasbord of games .
You 're going to find some casual games , a couple casual games , and then ...
Some very high - end new games .
And then there 's a bunch of demos that are free .
And then there are some games available for rental , too , which is kind of cool .
And you can keep extending the rentals , if you want .
So , if you rent the game and you want to play a game because you 've got a whole weekend to spend or something , go for it .
So , it 's another way to get into a game that 's less expensive .

The Gentle People By Nadya Labi The Last Lord Chancellor ?
By William Goodhart Man and the Machines By Benjamin Soskis Suspect Memories By Jascha Hoffman Common Denominator By Nicholas Thompson Money Talks By Andrew Goldstein
The Gentle People
Impressed by their piety , courts have permitted the Amish to live outside the law .
But in some places , the group 's ethic of forgive and forget has produced a plague of incest and let many perpetrators go unpunished .
By Nadya Labi
When she wrote the letter that she hoped would protect her sister , Mary Byler was lying on a twin bed , surrounded by rainbow - colored walls and a sky - blue ceiling decorated with bright white clouds .
A stereo sat on the floor beside her .
There were no signs of the Amish upbringing she had left behind no plain wood furniture or chamber pot .
Nothing except a stuffed doll that had belonged to her 6 - year - old sister .
The little girl had put the doll 's bonnet on backward .
Mary fingered her long brown hair as she thought of her sister .
And she thought about her older brother , Johnny , and his refusal when she 'd asked him to go to therapy the day before .
She started writing .
" When I was 4 years old , I was molested , when I was 6 , I was sexually abused ( rape ) from then on till I was 17 , " the 19 - year - old put down .
" There was nothing I could do about this abuse as it was incest . "
Mary gave the letter to a friend , who drove 30 minutes northwest of the house where Mary was staying in the Wisconsin town of Viroqua , past a couple of dirt roads , a string of red barns , and frozen cornfields .
He waited until nearly midnight on a cold evening last February , and then put the letter in the mailbox at the white shingled home of Sam Mast , an Amish minister in the community where Mary 's family lived during her teenage years .
Mary 's father was killed in a buggy accident when she was 5 ; she remembers him pulling her onto his lap and fondling her at their home in the small town of Sugar Grove , Pa .
After her father 's death , Mary 's family moved 100 miles south to New Wilmington , Pa. , another small town , where the back roads are filled with brown buggies and white shingled homes .
There , Mary 's two older cousins and brothers began molesting her .
Johnny told the police that his cousins encouraged him , " as far as breaking her in . "
( The cousins denied that , but admitted to molesting Mary . )
By the time Mary was in her teens , she was being raped regularly by Johnny , who is seven years older , and her brother Eli , who is four years older .
Once , Eli climbed on top of her while Johnny held her down .
There was no escape .
Mary was grabbed in the bedroom , in the barn , in the outhouse , milking the cows in the morning , and on her way to school .
" It did not matter how hard I tried to hide , " Mary would explain in her letter to Mast , which she also sent to other Amish clergy .
" If I ran upstairs to go to bed or to hide because I was at home with the boys , I 'd be locking my door and turn around and there was someone crawling through my window .
So my windows were always locked . . .
Then they started taking off my door . "
To the hordes of tourists who travel to Pennsylvania Dutch country each year to go to quilting bees and shop for crafts , the Gentle People , as the Amish are known , represent innocence .
They are a people apart , removed in place and arrested in time .
They reject the corruptions of modernity the cars that have splintered American communities and the televisions that have riveted the country 's youth .
The Amish way of life is grounded in agriculture , hard work , and community .
Its deliberate simplicity takes the form of horse - drawn buggies , clothes that could have come from a Vermeer painting , and a native German dialect infused with English words .
The myth of the Amish is amplified in movies like Witness and television shows like Amish in the City .
It 's also fed by a series of practices that reinforce the group 's insularity .
The Amish want to be left alone by the state and to a remarkable extent , they are .
They do n't fight America 's wars or , for the most part , contribute to Social Security .
In 1972 , noting their " excellent record as law - abiding and generally self - sufficient members of society , " the Supreme Court allowed the Amish to take their children out of school after eighth grade .
The license the Amish have been granted rests on the trust that the community will police itself , with Amish bishops and ministers acting in lieu of law enforcement .
Yet keeping order comes hard to church leaders .
" The Amish see the force of law as contrary to the Christian spirit , " said Donald Kraybill , a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania and an expert on the group .
As a result , the Amish shy away from sending people to prison and the system of punishment of " the English , " as the Amish call other Americans .
Once a sinner has confessed , and his repentance has been deemed genuine , every member of the Amish community must forgive him .
This approach is rooted in the Amish notion of Gelassenheit , or submission .
Church members abide by their clergymen ; children obey their parents ; sisters mind their brothers ; and wives defer to their husbands ( divorce is taboo ) .
With each act of submission , the Amish follow the lesson of Jesus when he died on the cross rather than resist his adversaries .
But can a community govern itself by Jesus 's teaching of mercy alone ?
It is sinful for the Amish to withhold forgiveness so sinful that anyone who refers to a past misdeed after the Amish penalty for it has ended can be punished in the same manner as the original sinner .
" That 's a big thing in the Amish community , " Mary said .
" You have to forgive and forgive . "
In some church districts , which encompass only two or three dozen families scattered along back roads , there appear to be many crimes like Johnny and Eli's to forgive .
No statistics are available , but according to one Amish counselor who works with troubled church members across the Midwest , sexual abuse of children is " almost a plague in some communities . "
Some police forces and district attorneys do their best to step in , though they are rarely welcomed .
Others are slow to investigate or quick to let off Amish offenders with light punishments .
When that happens , girls like Mary are failed three times : by their families , their church , and their state .
KATHRYN BYLER , WHO COUNTS MARY AND HER FAMILY AS DISTANT KIN , lives more than 600 miles from them , in Morrow County , Ohio .
The Amish do n't own phones ( some use them only for emergencies ) .
Still , news gets around .
Kathryn knew Mary 's story .
Before her father 's death , Mary told her mother , Sally , that he was molesting her .
At first , Sally did n't believe her daughter .
Mary said that her mother told her , " He says he 's sorry and you have to forgive him . "
After her husband 's death , Sally raised Mary and her eight sons on her own .
Her household was n't the tidiest , and the children did n't always listen to her .
Sally got particularly frustrated with Mary , who had inherited her large almond - shaped eyes and tendency to talk out of turn .
When Mary 's brothers began raping her , she turned to her mother again .
Sally scolded the boys and gave them what Eli described as a light " mother 's tap . "
She also gave them an herb that she hoped would reduce their sex drives .
When the abuse resumed and Mary went back to her mother , she said Sally responded , " You do n't fight hard enough and you do n't pray hard enough . "
" The boys were doing bad things and the mother knew , " Kathryn said .
" What mother would allow that to happen in her house ? "
And yet , it happened in her house as well .
When I knocked on her screen door on a recent autumn afternoon , Kathryn was boiling two large pots of water for her husband Raymond 's bath .
His white shirt hung near the wood - burning stove , along with his spare straw hat .
Raymond was out doing carpentry work .
Kathryn tied on a black bonnet as she came to answer the door .
I had already encountered Kathryn in court documents .
This was the mother who had tried to shield her husband from prosecution , after the boyfriend of one of her three daughters reported to the Ohio police that Raymond was molesting two of the girls .
The abuse began when the older girl was 5 or 6 ; it lasted more than a decade , and included repeated rapes .
( The girl grew up in Pennsylvania near Mary Byler , and told Mary that her father was raping her . )
" I may have been to blame , too , " Kathryn Byler said in court at her husband 's sentencing in December 1998 .
In earlier interviews with detectives , Byler faulted herself for failing to sexually satisfy her husband .
Like Sally , she talked about administering an herbal remedy to reduce his sex drive .
" She knew what was going on .
It was almost , ' Take my daughter by the hand and let 's go to the barn , ' " said Sergeant Paul Mills , who helped investigate the case .
" ' So sayeth her husband , ' and whatever he says is the way it has to be . "
While we talked , Kathryn sat in a rocking chair , which she 'd polished to a high shine .
She wore metal - frame glasses and a dark green dress , pinned together because her church does n't allow zippers .
Beneath her black bonnet , her face was plain and open .
As her religion dictates , she wore no makeup or jewelry .
Though she was afraid to talk and spoke softly , fear did n't stop the words from rushing out of her .
It felt good , she said as she settled into her chair .
Kathryn does n't see her husband as a bad man .
She smiled when she showed me a picture of a lighthouse that Raymond had painted , and she praised him for coming home early that day to help can tomatoes .
Still , he has a nasty temper .
Kathryn hates the foosball table that sits in the middle of her living room , an eyesore of miniature yellow and black men that was a gift from an English friend .
But she has stopped asking Raymond to take it away .
When he gets upset , he shouts , and then she cries .
She has learned to be careful with him .
Years before his arrest , Raymond confessed to molesting one of his daughters and , as Kathryn put it , " made things right in church . "
Kathryn said that she believed he had stopped the abuse , though when her husband sent her out of the house on errands , a part of her wondered .
" I knew he wanted me to go away a lot , but I trusted him , " she said .
" I guess I trusted him too far . "
When their trust is betrayed , women like Kathryn and Sally see themselves as having little recourse .
In 1996 , Sally remarried a man named William Kempf , whom she 'd met on a bus ride .
The cabinetmaker , who is now 78 , had a mean streak , and he took to hitting Sally , Mary , and Mary 's younger half - sister .
" Sally lived eight miles from the nearest police station , " Sally 's lawyer , Russell Hanson , said to explain why his client , who declined to be interviewed , did n't report her sons .
" I was told by one of the elders that women are not permitted to take their horses to town . "
Yet in a shed one door down from the Kempfs ' house sits a white phone .
It 's registered in an English neighbor 's name but is used by the Amish .
Sally did n't call the police because she'd been taught to defer to the men in her household , even if they were her sons , and because she belongs to a community that believes the greater threat comes from without , not within .
Kathryn , for her part , has borne her husband six children .
Four older sons and daughters have left home the oldest girl got married and the middle girl lives with herbut their mother works hard to take care of Raymond and the young son and daughter who still live with them .
Even if the church allowed divorce , Kathryn would n't want one .
She 'd like Raymond to take medication to help calm his temper .
He wo n't , though , so she takes pills to ease her own sadness .
" We 're supposed to forgive , but that 's hard to do , " Kathryn said .
" The only way I can ever truly forgive him is when he dies .
Those were our children , and look what he did . "
THE AMISH CHURCH TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE 16TH CENTURY , when a group of Swiss dissidents decided the Protestant Reformation was moving too slowly .
They embraced baptism of adults rather than children , a practice that was seen as a threat to the civic order and punished by execution .
The Amish faced persecution and torture , which they relive in their prayers and hymns every other Sunday , when they worship in each other 's homes .
Today , most of the church 's 200,000 members live in the United States , and about half of them are in Pennsylvania and Ohio , concentrated in rural counties that are the heart of Amish country .
There is a sameness to much of the region , with its white shingled homes , dark buggies , and repeating surnames .
As Donald Kraybill explains in his book The Amish and the State , there are two kingdoms in Amish theology : the kingdom of Christ , inhabited by the Amish , and the one in which everyone else lives .
To maintain the boundary between the two worlds , the Amish hold themselves apart from the secular state as much as they can .
In the mid-1900s , dozens of Amish fathers went to prison rather than agree to send their kids to public schools with non-Amish children .
The community opened its own one - room schoolhouses , where the curricula ignored subjects like science and sex education .
A woman who now lives near the Amish in Ohio's Guernsey County reports that many of her neighbors were n't taught that the earth was round .
" A lot of Amish will tell you they do n't want their kids to be educated , " she said .
" The more they know , the more apt they are to leave . "
The Amish tightly circumscribe their world in other ways as well .
For the most part , they do n't file lawsuits , serve on juries , run for political office , or vote ( despite Republican efforts to enlist them in the 2004 election ) .
In 1993 , Martin France , the district attorney in Wayne County , Ohio , prosecuted a case against a driver who killed five Amish children .
France got little support from the victims ' families .
" They did n't want anything to do with me .
They would just say , ' This was God 's will and we 're not going to interfere , ' " he recalled .
An Amish woman who lived next to the site of the accident told France that while she was pinning up her laundry , she saw the driver 's car race down a hill and hit the children , who flew as high as a nearby telephone pole .
But the woman refused to testify ; her bishop would n't allow it .
That bishop was a man in his late 20s who worked in his family 's chair factory .
Amish church leaders are chosen by lotor , as the faithful believe , by the unseen hand of God .
The bishop is the highest clergyman in the hierarchy of each church , and he oversees two ministers and a deacon .
Men and women propose candidates for minister and deacon , and in most districts any man with two or three nominations is considered .
The " elected " clergy is chosen according to a biblical method of casting lots : each man chooses from a pile of identical hymnals , and the one who chooses the book marked with a piece of paper bearing a verse from the Bible becomes a church leader .
The bishop , who is chosen the same way from a field of three ministers , has awesome authority .
He interprets the Ordnung , the unwritten rules that govern each church district , stipulating everything from the size of a man 's hat brim to the paint color on the outside of a house .
When a church member violates the Ordnung , the bishop determines the punishment .
When she turned 17 three years ago , Mary Byler joined the church , as Amish adults must do .
Johnny had stopped raping her when he got married in 1998 .
Mary thinks her new status as a church member protected her from Eli because it meant she had a duty to confess to fornication .
She tried to forget what had happened with her brothers , but she could n't .
When she was 19 , Mary sought succor from her minister , Sam Mast .
As she stood awkwardly in his workshop , Mast said he saw that she was " heavy - hearted . "
But Mary could n't bring herself to tell him what Johnny and Eli had done .
Mast suggested that she confess her sins in church .
" I said , ' Why do n't you go to somebody and just empty it out ? ' " he told me recently .
To some degree , Johnny had confessed his own a few years earlier , when he was 21 .
But he admitted to fornication without saying that he had committed rape or that his victim had been his sister .
The church elders did n't probe .
Bishop Dan Miller listened to Johnny 's confession , and later Mast gave him the letter Mary had written .
But when I spoke with him , Miller said he had " no sense of what was going on . "
He did n't connect Johnny 's confession with Mary 's plea for help .
Johnny 's punishment for his confessed sins lasted two weeks .
During that period , he was shunned , the traditional Amish punishment for serious transgressions .
As if sin were contagious , the community erects a metaphorical fence around the sinner .
Johnny was n't allowed to leave his home except to attend church .
After his punishment , he returned to working in his harness shop .
Mary 's punishment , by contrast , lasts forever .
When she wrote to Mast , Mary hoped that he and Miller would protect her younger sister , who had said things about another brother , David , then 17 , that worried Mary .
" It was little things like , ' David is bad to me , but Mom tells me he 's sorry and I have to forgive him , ' " Mary said .
" I said , this is my voice coming out of her . "
Mary warned the ministers that she would press charges unless something was done .
Nothing happened .
So Mary went to the police .
After the detectives came knocking , the community voted unanimously to excommunicate Mary .
Mast took a break from hammering in his workshop to explain the concept of excommunication to me .
When Mary left her home , she broke her vow to uphold the Ordnung .
The Amish believe that anyone who breaks that vow is damned and must be shunned .
Church members may talk to her only to admonish her to repent and return , Mast said .
He stroked his full beard as he struggled for the right English words .
" We would tell Mary that we think she done wrong and tell her to come back , " he said .
" We could n't take her word for anything .
We would have nothing to do with her . "
As for Mary 's brothers , Miller declared that Johnny and Eli would be shunned for periods of four and six weeks .
" They told us they wanted to quit and were sorry about what happened , " the minister said .
IN THE SHADOW OF A PEELING WHITE HOUSE IN GUERNSEY COUNTY , OHIO , sits a rusty shed .
Its wooden door had swung open on an afternoon in October , revealing black letters that spelled out the name N - O - R - M - A - N B-Y - L - E-R .
Now 72 , Norman was diagnosed a few years ago with depression and the beginnings of dementia .
A photograph of him at the time reveals thin features accented by a coarse white beard and dark , penetrating eyes .
Norman has a history of pedophilia that dates to the 1970s , when he allegedly molested several of his eight daughters and at least one young woman outside his family .
During that period , he confessed in church , repented , and was banished for four weeks .
Aware of her father 's problem , Norman 's youngest daughter " went to great lengths to make sure he was n't alone " with kids , said his public defender , Diane Menashe .
In 1995 , the daughter and her husband , Tobie Yoder , let Norman move onto their property .
Four years later , the Yoders discovered that Norman was molesting three of his granddaughters , ages 3 , 5 , and 8 .
Tobie went to Bishop Moses Miller and the elders in his Swartzentruber district .
That denomination falls on the most restrictive end of the spectrum from Old Order to New Order Amish .
( The New Order allows brighter colored clothing and more modern appliances . )
Bishops like Miller actively police their congregations .
The sins multiply quickly .
Driving a car , using a tractor , masturbating , and drinking alcohol can all trigger the maximum six - week ban .
( At the same time , some Swartzentrubers make allowances , like permitting tobacco and " bed courtship " :
On Saturday nights in Moses Miller 's district , teenage boys are allowed to steal into the rooms of girls their age .
The teens are supposed to keep their clothes on , but the boy is n't expected to leave until milking time the next morning .
Many parents encourage bed courtship because it often leads to early marriages , which make young people less likely to leave the church . )
Moses Miller responded to Tobie Yoder 's appeal by scolding Norman , who told him that in molesting his granddaughters , he was acting " no different than the cows in the field . "
Norman was shunned for six weeks .
But he remained out of control , so volatile that adults in the area feared for their safety .
Eventually Bishop Miller took the unusual step of allowing Yoder to take his father - in - law to a hospital .
Despite Norman 's recurring problems , other bishops say they would not have made the decision that Miller did .
" We have to deal with the sin if it 's once , twice , or thrice , " said Chris Kauffman , the most respected bishop in the Mt. Gilead area of Ohio's Morrow County .
Yet Levi Schwartz , who lives in Mt. Gilead , said the church 's reliance on repentance failed him .
" Sometimes I went into the bedroom and cried because of my sin , " he recalled .
In 1989 Schwartz started molesting one of his daughters .
He kissed the girl , rubbed her , and bared himself to her until she grew old enough to date , and then he moved on to her younger sister .
On a late fall night in his cavernous living room , the 52 - year - old , who has since left the Amish , talked about his past with unnerving ease while one of the daughters he molested sat on a nearby couch .
" I confessed in church a number of times , " Schwartz said .
" I wanted to be clean , so I took it to the ministers .
I thought that would give me grace , and the power to overcome it . "
Schwartz said his bishop , Eli Raber , discouraged Schwartz 's sporadic attempts to get counseling .
( Raber declined to comment . )
In 1994 , Schwartz 's son Benjamin began touching his sisters ; he confessed in church and was shunned for two weeks .
Levi Schwartz , however , was losing faith in the church 's method of punishment .
After one of his daughters started crying while he was molesting her , Schwartz checked himself into Oaklawn Psychiatric Hospital in Indiana .
He asked the girl to pray for him , and she did .
When Norman Byler 's family sent him to Mercy Medical Center in Ohio , he received a week of counseling and was given antipsychotic medication and antidepressants , which he burned instead of taking .
Still , Yoder believes the " doctoring " helped his father - in - law .
" I felt like we had him half decent under control , " he said .
But pedophilia is a hard disease to treat .
Deborah Love , an English neighbor who lived next to the Yoders , saw Norman take his 3 - year - old granddaughter into his woodshed on a fall day in 1999 .
She knew that one of Norman 's daughters had recently moved her family to Iowa after saying that Norman had asked to sleep with one of her girls .
" He was with me enough .
He was n't going to be with my daughter , " Love said the woman told her .
A day after Norman took the 3 - year - old into his shed , Love noticed some dried blood on the girl 's leg .
She called Guernsey County Children 's Services .
The Amish accused Love of lying , and she said she has felt their anger .
When some of the men passed her house , they raised their hats and turned them sideways to avoid looking at her .
Love 's husband said that one young Amish man warned him during hunting season that , " Accidents do happen , so you 'd better be careful . "
In the spring of 2000 , the Loves moved out of the neighborhood .
LAST MARCH , A DETECTIVE IN WISCONSIN phoned trooper Janice Wilson to tell her about statements that Mary and her family had made about rampant incest in the Amish community in which they grew up .
That community is in New Wilmington , Pa. , near where Wilson works .
When she started investigating , she was stunned to hear reports of extensive sexual abuse , and of births resulting from incest .
Amish insiders say the problem is so common that a bishop in the area has preached against it .
Johnny Byler said that , growing up in Lawrence County , he thought it was normal to have sex with his sister .
" Other kids would talk about it , " Johnny said .
When I asked Mary 's cousin , David Wengerd , whether he had molested his sister in addition to Mary , as Mary has charged , he responded , " I 'd rather not answer . "
Janice Wilson and I drove through New Wilmington , past a string of buggies heading to the home of a local Amish man , who was marrying off his daughter .
The white houses we passed had pale blue doors , the only touch of color allowed by the church .
Wilson was despairing over the cases she 'd been unable to crack because no victim would come forward .
Her supervisor , Lieutenant Peter Vogel , echoed her frustration , saying , " The moment we approach them as police , they shut up , the whole clan . "
When the police identify a perpetrator , however , their work in one sense becomes easy .
The Amish ethic of confession extends to answering questions asked by outsiders .
With little prompting from the detectives who questioned him , Norman Byler admitted to manually penetrating his 8 - year - old granddaughter .
He said that he hurt the child to get back at her father , who had refused to take Norman to the hospital to treat a torn muscle .
( Most Swartzentrubers resort to Western medicine only in emergencies . )
Raymond Byler , Levi and Benjamin Schwartz , and Johnny , Eli , and David Byler confessed with similar readiness .
Johnny and Eli were each charged with five counts of sexual assault and pleaded guilty , to two counts and one count , respectively .
David pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his little sister .
In September , a month before his sentencing , Johnny said he sometimes felt suicidal and could n't understand why he might go to prison .
" Johnny thinks , ' I did a terrible thing but I 've tried to make it right , ' " said Jack Buswell , his attorney .
" He feels let down . "
Yet the confessions of Johnny and other Amish offenders have n't elicited heavy penalties .
Levi Schwartz got probation and his son has not been prosecuted .
The district attorney in Lawrence County said he had not decided whether to prosecute Mary 's cousins , Chris and David Wengerd .
Raymond Byler was sentenced to four years , even though the judge in his case found that he posed " the greatest likelihood of recidivism . "
Norman Byler faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , but prosecutor Keith Plummer recommended that he serve no time beyond the two years he had waited to go on trial .
The judge set aside the plea , saying he was unwilling to countenance such leniency for an offender who had shown " no genuine remorse . "
Norman was sentenced to five years ; before his release last month , he wrote to the Yoders to say he wanted to come home .
The relatively light sentences meted out to these men stand out at a time when sex offenders are punished with increasing harshness .
The fear that many pedophiliacs can't be stopped has led Congress to lengthen sentences for child sex offenders and has persuaded some states to use involuntary civil commitment laws to keep them behind bars indefinitely .
Why did these Amish , by contrast , receive only mercy ?
District attorneys and judges appear to be quick to forgive in the counties that have the largest Amish populations .
The 92,000 Amish who live in Ohio and Pennsylvania generate hundreds of millions in annual tourism revenue .
Brent Yager , who prosecuted Levi Schwartz , would never say that he spared Schwartz to protect the appeal of Pennsylvania Dutch country .
But prosecutors and judges are as steeped in the myth of the Gentle People as anyone .
" Is Schwartz getting a break because he 's Amish ? "
Yager said .
" In some ways , yes .
Is he going to reoffend ?
I do n't think so . "
In Wisconsin , where only 10,000 Amish live , Timothy Gaskell took a harder line in prosecuting Johnny , Eli , and David Byler .
Gaskell also brought misdemeanor charges against Mary 's stepfather , for beating her , and against Sally , for failing to report the abuse of her daughter .
As a result of Gaskell 's efforts , the Kempfs were put on probation , David got a four - year prison sentence , and Eli got eight years in prison .
Johnny , however , was ordered to spend one year at the county jail , and mostly at night .
During the day , the judge said , he could work to keep his farm running .
A crowd of 150 Amish turned out to support Johnny at his sentencing .
IT IS HARD TO THINK OF MARY BYLER AS LUCKY , but in one respect she was :
The state responded when she asked for help .
Anna Slabaugh has a different story .
Anna , who is the eighth of nine children , remembers reading books with her mother as a child .
Fannie Slabaugh taught school when Anna was young , and though reading books was strongly discouraged by the family 's Swartzentruber district , she could n't bear to get rid of the books she had found in an abandoned schoolhouse .
Maybe it was the Nancy Drew mysteries , but Anna never felt she belonged with the Swartzentrubers .
She got upset when her father cut off the tails of the pigs or pulled out the horns of the goats .
She liked to draw , which violated the Ordnung .
And she did n't like the constant dimness :
The church allowed only kerosene , which gives off less light than gas , and candles had to be kept at a low glow .
Whether for wearing her cap too far back on her head or for " acting around " in church , Anna was often in trouble .
Her father was in poor health , because he refused to take insulin for his diabetes , but he knew how to give a good beating .
Sometimes he used the strap , a foot - long piece of rubber common in Amish homes ; at other times , he took Anna " to the woodpile " and hit her with a piece of wood .
When Anna turned 11 , she told me , her 19 - year - old brother began molesting her , stopping just short of intercourse .
When he moved away , another 17 - year - old brother started raping her .
( The court documents involving Anna 's family are sealed . )
Anna did n't try to stop her brothers at first .
" You do n't tell your brothers , who are so much older than you , No , " she said .
But when she got her period at 13 and realized she could have a baby , she started fighting back .
" He would make sure he put a lot of pressure on my top so I could n't breathe , " she said of the younger brother .
Anna wanted help , but she did n't think she would get it from her church .
So she began dropping hints about the abuse to English neighbors .
When they did n't pick up on her cues , she got bolder .
In 2001 , while cleaning house for her family 's landlord , Anna used the phone to call a battered women 's shelter in Mt. Vernon , Ohio .
The counselors on the other end of the line did n't take her seriously .
But after a month of calls , the shelter alerted Children and Family Services Division of Knox County .
When a social worker visited Anna 's home , Anna told her about the sexual abuse .
She also reported that her parents were moving the family to Pennsylvania .
Laurie Roberts , one of the social workers on Anna 's case in Ohio , said she was taught in training that sexual abuse among the Amish is pervasive , and seldom reported .
( The problem is significant enough that the counties near Knox publish a pamphlet to educate the Amish about sexual abuse . )
Yet the county left Anna in her home .
" Oh Gosh , I wish I could get it in those C.S. people that my parents will absolutely kill me now , " Anna wrote at the time to a cousin who had left the Amish .
The social workers " say you 'll have to be hurt by them before we 'll do anything about it , " she continued .
Anna tried to run away .
But when her parents figured out where she was and called the woman who was sheltering her , Anna was sent home .
Fannie began locking Anna in her room .
The family moved to Tionesta , Pa. , where Fannie tried to get her daughter declared mentally ill .
She took Anna to a doctor who found that Anna 's eardrum had collapsed from blows to her head and seemed doubtful that the damage had been caused by buggy accidents as he'd been told .
Fannie next tried a massage therapist , Barbara Burke .
Noticing scars on Anna 's legs , Burke called Children and Youth Services in Clarion County .
On a later visit , Burke massaged Anna 's father while CYS secretly interviewed Anna in the basement .
The agency later visited Anna at her home .
But it did n't take her into protective custody .
( CYS declined to comment . )
When Fannie found out about the CYS visit , she and Anna went with 13 other kids to the home of John Yoder , an Amish dentist who lived an hour and a half away in the town of Punxsutawney .
Yoder 's living room had a recliner with a tin pan and some needles next to it .
Anna watched as the other kids each had one or two bad teeth pulled .
When it was her turn , Yoder shot some novocaine into her upper gum .
She shook her head and told him that two of her lower teeth had cavities .
He shot the lower gum , and asked Fannie which teeth should go .
Anna 's mother answered , " Take them all , " and Yoder pulled along the upper gum , along the lower gum , until every tooth was gone .
" After he had pulled the last tooth , " Anna remembered , " my mom looked at me and said , ' I guess you wo n't be talking anymore . ' "
Anna bled for three days .
Her family ignored her , except to periodically hand her a drink .
She could n't talk , but that did n't matter , because Anna had nothing left to say .
At church , she looked away when other kids pointed at her mouth .
Fannie Slabaugh told me that Anna had asked for her teeth to be pulled .
But the detective who investigated the case , Trooper Michael Pisarchic , said that the other kids who went with Anna to see Yoder said that Anna was being punished .
Meanwhile , CYS was continuing to investigate .
A court date was set for the spring of 2002 .
The bishop in Anna 's district , Moses Shettler , called Barbara Burke and asked her to testify that Anna had mental problems .
Burke refused .
On the Friday before Anna was scheduled to appear in court , soon after her teeth had been pulled , Shettler and a group of elders visited Anna 's parents .
Anna said her parents threatened two days later to take her out to the woodpile , or worse , unless she told her lawyer that she took back her accusations against her brothers .
Stripped of faith in the state to protect her , Anna did as she was told .
Neither Anna 's parents nor John Yoder were ever charged with abuse .
The judge in Anna 's case allowed the younger brother to remain under Amish supervision as long as he had no contact with Anna .
But Anna said he returned home on the day of the hearing .
" They do n't believe it 's any of our business , " said Roberts , Anna 's Ohio social worker , of the Amish attitude toward child abuse investigations .
But it 's the job of social workers , police , and prosecutors to make child abuse their business .
The state 's duty to push past the barriers thrown up by parents and the community can't hinge on the religion they practice .
Its role becomes more essential , not less , when adults wall off children from the outside world .
While the authorities idled , Anna was being watched constantly .
One of her chores was taking the family 's horses out to pasture , within view of the house .
On a morning in June when the animals seemed frisky , Anna clapped her hands .
The horses scattered and she pretended to chase them , cutting across the field to a mailbox , where she dropped off a letter she 'd written to Burke .
" Are you still willing to help , or am I not welcome ? " she wrote .
" I need to get out of here . "
She asked Burke to put a message in a plastic bottle for her and leave it in a ditch by the mailbox .
Two days later , Anna spooked the horses again , and a message was waiting .
" Our arms are open to you and so are our doors , " Burke promised .
Anna burned the note with a lighter and went home .
It was her turn to make supper .
She lit the stove , began heating water , and sat down to write a letter to her family .
The sun was falling when she finished .
Anna climbed out of the kitchen window and ran .
WHEN MARY BYLER LEFT HOME , SHE THREW HER WHITE CAP onto Sam Mast 's driveway and screeched off in the car of a woman who took her in .
In the two years since , Mary has driven by her mother 's house a few times in a black Grand Prix .
" If Mary wants to get away , " Sally asked Eli 's lawyer , Greg Lunde , " why does she keep coming back ? "
When I caught up with Mary , six months after she left the Amish , she insisted that her mother and her brothers were dead to her .
But in the kitchen of the spotless trailer she rents next to Wisconsin 's La Crosse River , she could n't stop talking about them .
Cracking eggs into a mixing bowl to make sugar cookies never mind that it was after midnight she dwelt on how much Johnny , Eli , and David loved her baking .
Though Mary can't quite leave her family behind , she ran from the church and did n't look back .
She pierced her ears last March , earned a GED in April , and got a driver 's license in May .
A friend bought her the Grand Prix , and Mary paid him back on the $ 8 - an - hour salary she earns cleaning a hospital in La Crosse .
Mary took me out to her car to play a Loretta Lynn cassette .
Dressed in shorts and a tight pink T - shirt with a white angel on the front , she shifted a Doral cigarette from her right hand to her left so that she could jab more effectively at the seek button on the car stereo .
She was looking for one song : " Hey , Loretta . "
When it started , Mary jerked her head to the beat .
" Goodbye tub and clothesline , goodbye pots an ' pans , " she belted out , flinging her hair and pounding her right leg .
Her nails painted a matching pink and a silver necklace hanging from her neck , Mary did n't care how many Ordnung rules she was breaking .
She was drunk on freedom .
Nadya Labi is a senior editor at Legal Affairs .
When she wrote the letter that she hoped would protect her sister , Mary Byler was lying on a twin bed , surrounded by rainbow - colored walls and a sky - blue ceiling decorated with bright white clouds .
A stereo sat on the floor beside her .
There were no signs of the Amish upbringing she had left behind no plain wood furniture or chamber pot .
Nothing except a stuffed doll that had belonged to her 6 - year - old sister .
The little girl had put the doll 's bonnet on backward .
Mary fingered her long brown hair as she thought of her sister .
And she thought about her older brother , Johnny , and his refusal when she 'd asked him to go to therapy the day before .
She started writing .
" When I was 4 years old , I was molested , when I was 6 , I was sexually abused ( rape ) from then on till I was 17 , " the 19 - year - old put down .
" There was nothing I could do about this abuse as it was incest .
" Mary gave the letter to a friend , who drove 30 minutes northwest of the house where Mary was staying in the Wisconsin town of Viroqua , past a couple of dirt roads , a string of red barns , and frozen cornfields .
He waited until nearly midnight on a cold evening last February , and then put the letter in the mailbox at the white shingled home of Sam Mast , an Amish minister in the community where Mary 's family lived during her teenage years .
Mary 's father was killed in a buggy accident when she was 5 ; she remembers him pulling her onto his lap and fondling her at their home in the small town of Sugar Grove , Pa .
After her father 's death , Mary 's family moved 100 miles south to New Wilmington , Pa. , another small town , where the back roads are filled with brown buggies and white shingled homes .
There , Mary 's two older cousins and brothers began molesting her .
Johnny told the police that his cousins encouraged him , " as far as breaking her in . "
( The cousins denied that , but admitted to molesting Mary . )
By the time Mary was in her teens , she was being raped regularly by Johnny , who is seven years older , and her brother Eli , who is four years older .
Once , Eli climbed on top of her while Johnny held her down .
There was no escape .
Mary was grabbed in the bedroom , in the barn , in the outhouse , milking the cows in the morning , and on her way to school .
" It did not matter how hard I tried to hide , " Mary would explain in her letter to Mast , which she also sent to other Amish clergy .
" If I ran upstairs to go to bed or to hide because I was at home with the boys , I 'd be locking my door and turn around and there was someone crawling through my window .
So my windows were always locked . . .
Then they started taking off my door .
" To the hordes of tourists who travel to Pennsylvania Dutch country each year to go to quilting bees and shop for crafts , the Gentle People , as the Amish are known , represent innocence .
They are a people apart , removed in place and arrested in time .
They reject the corruptions of modernity the cars that have splintered American communities and the televisions that have riveted the country 's youth .
The Amish way of life is grounded in agriculture , hard work , and community .
Its deliberate simplicity takes the form of horse - drawn buggies , clothes that could have come from a Vermeer painting , and a native German dialect infused with English words .
The myth of the Amish is amplified in movies likeand television shows like .
It 's also fed by a series of practices that reinforce the group 's insularity .
The Amish want to be left alone by the state and to a remarkable extent , they are .
They do n't fight America 's wars or , for the most part , contribute to Social Security .
In 1972 , noting their " excellent record as law - abiding and generally self - sufficient members of society , " the Supreme Court allowed the Amish to take their children out of school after eighth grade .
The license the Amish have been granted rests on the trust that the community will police itself , with Amish bishops and ministers acting in lieu of law enforcement .
Yet keeping order comes hard to church leaders .
" The Amish see the force of law as contrary to the Christian spirit , " said Donald Kraybill , a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania and an expert on the group .
As a result , the Amish shy away from sending people to prison and the system of punishment of " the English , " as the Amish call other Americans .
Once a sinner has confessed , and his repentance has been deemed genuine , every member of the Amish community must forgive him .
This approach is rooted in the Amish notion of , or submission .
Church members abide by their clergymen ; children obey their parents ; sisters mind their brothers ; and wives defer to their husbands ( divorce is taboo ) .
With each act of submission , the Amish follow the lesson of Jesus when he died on the cross rather than resist his adversaries .
But can a community govern itself by Jesus 's teaching of mercy alone ?
It is sinful for the Amish to withhold forgiveness so sinful that anyone who refers to a past misdeed after the Amish penalty for it has ended can be punished in the same manner as the original sinner .
" That 's a big thing in the Amish community , " Mary said .
" You have to forgive and forgive .
" In some church districts , which encompass only two or three dozen families scattered along back roads , there appear to be many crimes like Johnny and Eli's to forgive .
No statistics are available , but according to one Amish counselor who works with troubled church members across the Midwest , sexual abuse of children is " almost a plague in some communities . "
Some police forces and district attorneys do their best to step in , though they are rarely welcomed .
Others are slow to investigate or quick to let off Amish offenders with light punishments .
When that happens , girls like Mary are failed three times : by their families , their church , and their state .
KATHRYN BYLER , WHO COUNTS MARY AND HER FAMILY AS DISTANT KIN , lives more than 600 miles from them , in Morrow County , Ohio .
The Amish do n't own phones ( some use them only for emergencies ) .
Still , news gets around .
Kathryn knew Mary 's story .
Before her father 's death , Mary told her mother , Sally , that he was molesting her .
At first , Sally did n't believe her daughter .
Mary said that her mother told her , " He says he 's sorry and you have to forgive him . "
After her husband 's death , Sally raised Mary and her eight sons on her own .
Her household was n't the tidiest , and the children did n't always listen to her .
Sally got particularly frustrated with Mary , who had inherited her large almond - shaped eyes and tendency to talk out of turn .
When Mary 's brothers began raping her , she turned to her mother again .
Sally scolded the boys and gave them what Eli described as a light " mother 's tap . "
She also gave them an herb that she hoped would reduce their sex drives .
When the abuse resumed and Mary went back to her mother , she said Sally responded , " You do n't fight hard enough and you do n't pray hard enough . "
" The boys were doing bad things and the mother knew , " Kathryn said .
" What mother would allow that to happen in her house ?
" And yet , it happened in her house as well .
When I knocked on her screen door on a recent autumn afternoon , Kathryn was boiling two large pots of water for her husband Raymond 's bath .
His white shirt hung near the wood - burning stove , along with his spare straw hat .
Raymond was out doing carpentry work .
Kathryn tied on a black bonnet as she came to answer the door .
I had already encountered Kathryn in court documents .
This was the mother who had tried to shield her husband from prosecution , after the boyfriend of one of her three daughters reported to the Ohio police that Raymond was molesting two of the girls .
The abuse began when the older girl was 5 or 6 ; it lasted more than a decade , and included repeated rapes .
( The girl grew up in Pennsylvania near Mary Byler , and told Mary that her father was raping her . )
" I may have been to blame , too , " Kathryn Byler said in court at her husband 's sentencing in December 1998 .
In earlier interviews with detectives , Byler faulted herself for failing to sexually satisfy her husband .
Like Sally , she talked about administering an herbal remedy to reduce his sex drive .
" She knew what was going on .
It was almost , ' Take my daughter by the hand and let 's go to the barn , ' " said Sergeant Paul Mills , who helped investigate the case .
" ' So sayeth her husband , ' and whatever he says is the way it has to be .
" While we talked , Kathryn sat in a rocking chair , which she 'd polished to a high shine .
She wore metal - frame glasses and a dark green dress , pinned together because her church does n't allow zippers .
Beneath her black bonnet , her face was plain and open .
As her religion dictates , she wore no makeup or jewelry .
Though she was afraid to talk and spoke softly , fear did n't stop the words from rushing out of her .
It felt good , she said as she settled into her chair .
Kathryn does n't see her husband as a bad man .
She smiled when she showed me a picture of a lighthouse that Raymond had painted , and she praised him for coming home early that day to help can tomatoes .
Still , he has a nasty temper .
Kathryn hates the foosball table that sits in the middle of her living room , an eyesore of miniature yellow and black men that was a gift from an English friend .
But she has stopped asking Raymond to take it away .
When he gets upset , he shouts , and then she cries .
She has learned to be careful with him .
Years before his arrest , Raymond confessed to molesting one of his daughters and , as Kathryn put it , " made things right in church . "
Kathryn said that she believed he had stopped the abuse , though when her husband sent her out of the house on errands , a part of her wondered .
" I knew he wanted me to go away a lot , but I trusted him , " she said .
" I guess I trusted him too far .
" When their trust is betrayed , women like Kathryn and Sally see themselves as having little recourse .
In 1996 , Sally remarried a man named William Kempf , whom she 'd met on a bus ride .
The cabinetmaker , who is now 78 , had a mean streak , and he took to hitting Sally , Mary , and Mary 's younger half - sister .
" Sally lived eight miles from the nearest police station , " Sally 's lawyer , Russell Hanson , said to explain why his client , who declined to be interviewed , did n't report her sons .
" I was told by one of the elders that women are not permitted to take their horses to town .
"
Yet in a shed one door down from the Kempfs ' house sits a white phone .
It 's registered in an English neighbor 's name but is used by the Amish .
Sally did n't call the police because she'd been taught to defer to the men in her household , even if they were her sons , and because she belongs to a community that believes the greater threat comes from without , not within .
Kathryn , for her part , has borne her husband six children .
Four older sons and daughters have left home the oldest girl got married and the middle girl lives with herbut their mother works hard to take care of Raymond and the young son and daughter who still live with them .
Even if the church allowed divorce , Kathryn would n't want one .
She 'd like Raymond to take medication to help calm his temper .
He wo n't , though , so she takes pills to ease her own sadness .
" We 're supposed to forgive , but that 's hard to do , " Kathryn said .
" The only way I can ever truly forgive him is when he dies .
Those were our children , and look what he did .
" THE AMISH CHURCH TRACES ITS ROOTS TO THE 16TH CENTURY , when a group of Swiss dissidents decided the Protestant Reformation was moving too slowly .
They embraced baptism of adults rather than children , a practice that was seen as a threat to the civic order and punished by execution .
The Amish faced persecution and torture , which they relive in their prayers and hymns every other Sunday , when they worship in each other 's homes .
Today , most of the church 's 200,000 members live in the United States , and about half of them are in Pennsylvania and Ohio , concentrated in rural counties that are the heart of Amish country .
There is a sameness to much of the region , with its white shingled homes , dark buggies , and repeating surnames .
As Donald Kraybill explains in his book , there are two kingdoms in Amish theology : the kingdom of Christ , inhabited by the Amish , and the one in which everyone else lives .
To maintain the boundary between the two worlds , the Amish hold themselves apart from the secular state as much as they can .
In the mid-1900s , dozens of Amish fathers went to prison rather than agree to send their kids to public schools with non-Amish children .
The community opened its own one - room schoolhouses , where the curricula ignored subjects like science and sex education .
A woman who now lives near the Amish in Ohio's Guernsey County reports that many of her neighbors were n't taught that the earth was round .
" A lot of Amish will tell you they do n't want their kids to be educated , " she said .
" The more they know , the more apt they are to leave .
" The Amish tightly circumscribe their world in other ways as well .
For the most part , they do n't file lawsuits , serve on juries , run for political office , or vote ( despite Republican efforts to enlist them in the 2004 election ) .
In 1993 , Martin France , the district attorney in Wayne County , Ohio , prosecuted a case against a driver who killed five Amish children .
France got little support from the victims ' families .
" They did n't want anything to do with me .
They would just say , ' This was God 's will and we 're not going to interfere , ' " he recalled .
An Amish woman who lived next to the site of the accident told France that while she was pinning up her laundry , she saw the driver 's car race down a hill and hit the children , who flew as high as a nearby telephone pole .
But the woman refused to testify ; her bishop would n't allow it .
That bishop was a man in his late 20s who worked in his family 's chair factory .
Amish church leaders are chosen by lotor , as the faithful believe , by the unseen hand of God .
The bishop is the highest clergyman in the hierarchy of each church , and he oversees two ministers and a deacon .
Men and women propose candidates for minister and deacon , and in most districts any man with two or three nominations is considered .
The " elected " clergy is chosen according to a biblical method of casting lots : each man chooses from a pile of identical hymnals , and the one who chooses the book marked with a piece of paper bearing a verse from the Bible becomes a church leader .
The bishop , who is chosen the same way from a field of three ministers , has awesome authority .
He interprets the , the unwritten rules that govern each church district , stipulating everything from the size of a man 's hat brim to the paint color on the outside of a house .
When a church member violates the , the bishop determines the punishment .
When she turned 17 three years ago , Mary Byler joined the church , as Amish adults must do .
Johnny had stopped raping her when he got married in 1998 .
Mary thinks her new status as a church member protected her from Eli because it meant she had a duty to confess to fornication .
She tried to forget what had happened with her brothers , but she could n't .
When she was 19 , Mary sought succor from her minister , Sam Mast .
As she stood awkwardly in his workshop , Mast said he saw that she was " heavy - hearted . "
But Mary could n't bring herself to tell him what Johnny and Eli had done .
Mast suggested that she confess her sins in church .
" I said , ' Why do n't you go to somebody and just empty it out ? ' " he told me recently .
To some degree , Johnny had confessed his own a few years earlier , when he was 21 .
But he admitted to fornication without saying that he had committed rape or that his victim had been his sister .
The church elders did n't probe .
Bishop Dan Miller listened to Johnny 's confession , and later Mast gave him the letter Mary had written .
But when I spoke with him , Miller said he had " no sense of what was going on . "
He did n't connect Johnny 's confession with Mary 's plea for help .
Johnny 's punishment for his confessed sins lasted two weeks .
During that period , he was shunned , the traditional Amish punishment for serious transgressions .
As if sin were contagious , the community erects a metaphorical fence around the sinner .
Johnny was n't allowed to leave his home except to attend church .
After his punishment , he returned to working in his harness shop .
Mary 's punishment , by contrast , lasts forever .
When she wrote to Mast , Mary hoped that he and Miller would protect her younger sister , who had said things about another brother , David , then 17 , that worried Mary .
" It was little things like , ' David is bad to me , but Mom tells me he 's sorry and I have to forgive him , ' " Mary said .
" I said , this is my voice coming out of her . "
Mary warned the ministers that she would press charges unless something was done .
Nothing happened .
So Mary went to the police .
After the detectives came knocking , the community voted unanimously to excommunicate Mary .
Mast took a break from hammering in his workshop to explain the concept of excommunication to me .
When Mary left her home , she broke her vow to uphold the .
The Amish believe that anyone who breaks that vow is damned and must be shunned .
Church members may talk to her only to admonish her to repent and return , Mast said .
He stroked his full beard as he struggled for the right English words .
" We would tell Mary that we think she done wrong and tell her to come back , " he said .
" We could n't take her word for anything .
We would have nothing to do with her .
" As for Mary 's brothers , Miller declared that Johnny and Eli would be shunned for periods of four and six weeks .
" They told us they wanted to quit and were sorry about what happened , " the minister said .
IN THE SHADOW OF A PEELING WHITE HOUSE IN GUERNSEY COUNTY , OHIO , sits a rusty shed .
Its wooden door had swung open on an afternoon in October , revealing black letters that spelled out the name N - O - R - M - A - N B-Y -L- E - R. Now 72 , Norman was diagnosed a few years ago with depression and the beginnings of dementia .
A photograph of him at the time reveals thin features accented by a coarse white beard and dark , penetrating eyes .
Norman has a history of pedophilia that dates to the 1970s , when he allegedly molested several of his eight daughters and at least one young woman outside his family .
During that period , he confessed in church , repented , and was banished for four weeks .
Aware of her father 's problem , Norman 's youngest daughter " went to great lengths to make sure he was n't alone " with kids , said his public defender , Diane Menashe .
In 1995 , the daughter and her husband , Tobie Yoder , let Norman move onto their property .
Four years later , the Yoders discovered that Norman was molesting three of his granddaughters , ages 3 , 5 , and 8 .
Tobie went to Bishop Moses Miller and the elders in his Swartzentruber district .
That denomination falls on the most restrictive end of the spectrum from Old Order to New Order Amish .
( The New Order allows brighter colored clothing and more modern appliances . )
Bishops like Miller actively police their congregations .
The sins multiply quickly .
Driving a car , using a tractor , masturbating , and drinking alcohol can all trigger the maximum six - week ban .
( At the same time , some Swartzentrubers make allowances , like permitting tobacco and " bed courtship " :
On Saturday nights in Moses Miller 's district , teenage boys are allowed to steal into the rooms of girls their age .
The teens are supposed to keep their clothes on , but the boy is n't expected to leave until milking time the next morning .
Many parents encourage bed courtship because it often leads to early marriages , which make young people less likely to leave the church . )
Moses Miller responded to Tobie Yoder 's appeal by scolding Norman , who told him that in molesting his granddaughters , he was acting " no different than the cows in the field . "
Norman was shunned for six weeks .
But he remained out of control , so volatile that adults in the area feared for their safety .
Eventually Bishop Miller took the unusual step of allowing Yoder to take his father - in - law to a hospital .
Despite Norman 's recurring problems , other bishops say they would not have made the decision that Miller did .
" We have to deal with the sin if it 's once , twice , or thrice , " said Chris Kauffman , the most respected bishop in the Mt. Gilead area of Ohio's Morrow County .
Yet Levi Schwartz , who lives in Mt. Gilead , said the church 's reliance on repentance failed him .
" Sometimes I went into the bedroom and cried because of my sin , " he recalled .
In 1989 Schwartz started molesting one of his daughters .
He kissed the girl , rubbed her , and bared himself to her until she grew old enough to date , and then he moved on to her younger sister .
On a late fall night in his cavernous living room , the 52 - year - old , who has since left the Amish , talked about his past with unnerving ease while one of the daughters he molested sat on a nearby couch .
" I confessed in church a number of times , " Schwartz said .
" I wanted to be clean , so I took it to the ministers .
I thought that would give me grace , and the power to overcome it .
" Schwartz said his bishop , Eli Raber , discouraged Schwartz 's sporadic attempts to get counseling .
( Raber declined to comment . )
In 1994 , Schwartz 's son Benjamin began touching his sisters ; he confessed in church and was shunned for two weeks .
Levi Schwartz , however , was losing faith in the church 's method of punishment .
After one of his daughters started crying while he was molesting her , Schwartz checked himself into Oaklawn Psychiatric Hospital in Indiana .
He asked the girl to pray for him , and she did .
When Norman Byler 's family sent him to Mercy Medical Center in Ohio , he received a week of counseling and was given antipsychotic medication and antidepressants , which he burned instead of taking .
Still , Yoder believes the " doctoring " helped his father - in - law .
" I felt like we had him half decent under control , " he said .
But pedophilia is a hard disease to treat .
Deborah Love , an English neighbor who lived next to the Yoders , saw Norman take his 3 - year - old granddaughter into his woodshed on a fall day in 1999 .
She knew that one of Norman 's daughters had recently moved her family to Iowa after saying that Norman had asked to sleep with one of her girls .
" He was with me enough .
He was n't going to be with my daughter , " Love said the woman told her .
A day after Norman took the 3 - year - old into his shed , Love noticed some dried blood on the girl 's leg .
She called Guernsey County Children 's Services .
The Amish accused Love of lying , and she said she has felt their anger .
When some of the men passed her house , they raised their hats and turned them sideways to avoid looking at her .
Love 's husband said that one young Amish man warned him during hunting season that , " Accidents do happen , so you 'd better be careful . "
In the spring of 2000 , the Loves moved out of the neighborhood .
LAST MARCH , A DETECTIVE IN WISCONSIN phoned trooper Janice Wilson to tell her about statements that Mary and her family had made about rampant incest in the Amish community in which they grew up .
That community is in New Wilmington , Pa. , near where Wilson works .
When she started investigating , she was stunned to hear reports of extensive sexual abuse , and of births resulting from incest .
Amish insiders say the problem is so common that a bishop in the area has preached against it .
Johnny Byler said that , growing up in Lawrence County , he thought it was normal to have sex with his sister .
" Other kids would talk about it , " Johnny said .
When I asked Mary 's cousin , David Wengerd , whether he had molested his sister in addition to Mary , as Mary has charged , he responded , " I 'd rather not answer .
" Janice Wilson and I drove through New Wilmington , past a string of buggies heading to the home of a local Amish man , who was marrying off his daughter .
The white houses we passed had pale blue doors , the only touch of color allowed by the church .
Wilson was despairing over the cases she 'd been unable to crack because no victim would come forward .
Her supervisor , Lieutenant Peter Vogel , echoed her frustration , saying , " The moment we approach them as police , they shut up , the whole clan .
" When the police identify a perpetrator , however , their work in one sense becomes easy .
The Amish ethic of confession extends to answering questions asked by outsiders .
With little prompting from the detectives who questioned him , Norman Byler admitted to manually penetrating his 8 - year - old granddaughter .
He said that he hurt the child to get back at her father , who had refused to take Norman to the hospital to treat a torn muscle .
( Most Swartzentrubers resort to Western medicine only in emergencies . )
Raymond Byler , Levi and Benjamin Schwartz , and Johnny , Eli , and David Byler confessed with similar readiness .
Johnny and Eli were each charged with five counts of sexual assault and pleaded guilty , to two counts and one count , respectively .
David pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting his little sister .
In September , a month before his sentencing , Johnny said he sometimes felt suicidal and could n't understand why he might go to prison .
" Johnny thinks , ' I did a terrible thing but I 've tried to make it right , ' " said Jack Buswell , his attorney .
" He feels let down . " Yet the confessions of Johnny and other Amish offenders have n't elicited heavy penalties .
Levi Schwartz got probation and his son has not been prosecuted .
The district attorney in Lawrence County said he had not decided whether to prosecute Mary 's cousins , Chris and David Wengerd .
Raymond Byler was sentenced to four years , even though the judge in his case found that he posed " the greatest likelihood of recidivism . "
Norman Byler faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in jail , but prosecutor Keith Plummer recommended that he serve no time beyond the two years he had waited to go on trial .
The judge set aside the plea , saying he was unwilling to countenance such leniency for an offender who had shown " no genuine remorse . "
Norman was sentenced to five years ; before his release last month , he wrote to the Yoders to say he wanted to come home .
The relatively light sentences meted out to these men stand out at a time when sex offenders are punished with increasing harshness .
The fear that many pedophiliacs can't be stopped has led Congress to lengthen sentences for child sex offenders and has persuaded some states to use involuntary civil commitment laws to keep them behind bars indefinitely .
Why did these Amish , by contrast , receive only mercy ?
District attorneys and judges appear to be quick to forgive in the counties that have the largest Amish populations .
The 92,000 Amish who live in Ohio and Pennsylvania generate hundreds of millions in annual tourism revenue .
Brent Yager , who prosecuted Levi Schwartz , would never say that he spared Schwartz to protect the appeal of Pennsylvania Dutch country .
But prosecutors and judges are as steeped in the myth of the Gentle People as anyone .
" Is Schwartz getting a break because he 's Amish ? "
Yager said .
" In some ways , yes .
Is he going to reoffend ?
I do n't think so .
" In Wisconsin , where only 10,000 Amish live , Timothy Gaskell took a harder line in prosecuting Johnny , Eli , and David Byler .
Gaskell also brought misdemeanor charges against Mary 's stepfather , for beating her , and against Sally , for failing to report the abuse of her daughter .
As a result of Gaskell 's efforts , the Kempfs were put on probation , David got a four - year prison sentence , and Eli got eight years in prison .
Johnny , however , was ordered to spend one year at the county jail , and mostly at night .
During the day , the judge said , he could work to keep his farm running .
A crowd of 150 Amish turned out to support Johnny at his sentencing .
IT IS HARD TO THINK OF MARY BYLER AS LUCKY , but in one respect she was :
The state responded when she asked for help .
Anna Slabaugh has a different story .
Anna , who is the eighth of nine children , remembers reading books with her mother as a child .
Fannie Slabaugh taught school when Anna was young , and though reading books was strongly discouraged by the family 's Swartzentruber district , she could n't bear to get rid of the books she had found in an abandoned schoolhouse .
Maybe it was the Nancy Drew mysteries , but Anna never felt she belonged with the Swartzentrubers .
She got upset when her father cut off the tails of the pigs or pulled out the horns of the goats .
She liked to draw , which violated the .
And she did n't like the constant dimness :
The church allowed only kerosene , which gives off less light than gas , and candles had to be kept at a low glow .
Whether for wearing her cap too far back on her head or for " acting around " in church , Anna was often in trouble .
Her father was in poor health , because he refused to take insulin for his diabetes , but he knew how to give a good beating .
Sometimes he used the strap , a foot - long piece of rubber common in Amish homes ; at other times , he took Anna " to the woodpile " and hit her with a piece of wood .
When Anna turned 11 , she told me , her 19 - year - old brother began molesting her , stopping just short of intercourse .
When he moved away , another 17 - year - old brother started raping her .
( The court documents involving Anna 's family are sealed . )
Anna did n't try to stop her brothers at first .
" You do n't tell your brothers , who are so much older than you , No , " she said .
But when she got her period at 13 and realized she could have a baby , she started fighting back .
" He would make sure he put a lot of pressure on my top so I could n't breathe , " she said of the younger brother .
Anna wanted help , but she did n't think she would get it from her church .
So she began dropping hints about the abuse to English neighbors .
When they did n't pick up on her cues , she got bolder .
In 2001 , while cleaning house for her family 's landlord , Anna used the phone to call a battered women 's shelter in Mt. Vernon , Ohio .
The counselors on the other end of the line did n't take her seriously .
But after a month of calls , the shelter alerted Children and Family Services Division of Knox County .
When a social worker visited Anna 's home , Anna told her about the sexual abuse .
She also reported that her parents were moving the family to Pennsylvania .
Laurie Roberts , one of the social workers on Anna 's case in Ohio , said she was taught in training that sexual abuse among the Amish is pervasive , and seldom reported .
( The problem is significant enough that the counties near Knox publish a pamphlet to educate the Amish about sexual abuse . )
Yet the county left Anna in her home .
" Oh Gosh , I wish I could get it in those C.S. people that my parents will absolutely kill me now , " Anna wrote at the time to a cousin who had left the Amish .
The social workers " say you 'll have to be hurt by them before we 'll do anything about it , " she continued .
Anna tried to run away .
But when her parents figured out where she was and called the woman who was sheltering her , Anna was sent home .
Fannie began locking Anna in her room .
The family moved to Tionesta , Pa. , where Fannie tried to get her daughter declared mentally ill .
She took Anna to a doctor who found that Anna 's eardrum had collapsed from blows to her head and seemed doubtful that the damage had been caused by buggy accidents as he'd been told .
Fannie next tried a massage therapist , Barbara Burke .
Noticing scars on Anna 's legs , Burke called Children and Youth Services in Clarion County .
On a later visit , Burke massaged Anna 's father while CYS secretly interviewed Anna in the basement .
The agency later visited Anna at her home .
But it did n't take her into protective custody .
( CYS declined to comment . )
When Fannie found out about the CYS visit , she and Anna went with 13 other kids to the home of John Yoder , an Amish dentist who lived an hour and a half away in the town of Punxsutawney .
Yoder 's living room had a recliner with a tin pan and some needles next to it .
Anna watched as the other kids each had one or two bad teeth pulled .
When it was her turn , Yoder shot some novocaine into her upper gum .
She shook her head and told him that two of her lower teeth had cavities .
He shot the lower gum , and asked Fannie which teeth should go .
Anna 's mother answered , " Take them all , " and Yoder pulled along the upper gum , along the lower gum , until every tooth was gone .
" After he had pulled the last tooth , " Anna remembered , " my mom looked at me and said , ' I guess you wo n't be talking anymore . '
" Anna bled for three days .
Her family ignored her , except to periodically hand her a drink .
She could n't talk , but that did n't matter , because Anna had nothing left to say .
At church , she looked away when other kids pointed at her mouth .
Fannie Slabaugh told me that Anna had asked for her teeth to be pulled .
But the detective who investigated the case , Trooper Michael Pisarchic , said that the other kids who went with Anna to see Yoder said that Anna was being punished .
Meanwhile , CYS was continuing to investigate .
A court date was set for the spring of 2002 .
The bishop in Anna 's district , Moses Shettler , called Barbara Burke and asked her to testify that Anna had mental problems .
Burke refused .
On the Friday before Anna was scheduled to appear in court , soon after her teeth had been pulled , Shettler and a group of elders visited Anna 's parents .
Anna said her parents threatened two days later to take her out to the woodpile , or worse , unless she told her lawyer that she took back her accusations against her brothers .
Stripped of faith in the state to protect her , Anna did as she was told .
Neither Anna 's parents nor John Yoder were ever charged with abuse .
The judge in Anna 's case allowed the younger brother to remain under Amish supervision as long as he had no contact with Anna .
But Anna said he returned home on the day of the hearing .
" They do n't believe it 's any of our business , " said Roberts , Anna 's Ohio social worker , of the Amish attitude toward child abuse investigations .
But it 's the job of social workers , police , and prosecutors to make child abuse their business .
The state 's duty to push past the barriers thrown up by parents and the community can't hinge on the religion they practice .
Its role becomes more essential , not less , when adults wall off children from the outside world .
While the authorities idled , Anna was being watched constantly .
One of her chores was taking the family 's horses out to pasture , within view of the house .
On a morning in June when the animals seemed frisky , Anna clapped her hands .
The horses scattered and she pretended to chase them , cutting across the field to a mailbox , where she dropped off a letter she 'd written to Burke .
" Are you still willing to help , or am I not welcome ? " she wrote .
" I need to get out of here . "
She asked Burke to put a message in a plastic bottle for her and leave it in a ditch by the mailbox .
Two days later , Anna spooked the horses again , and a message was waiting .
" Our arms are open to you and so are our doors , " Burke promised .
Anna burned the note with a lighter and went home .
It was her turn to make supper .
She lit the stove , began heating water , and sat down to write a letter to her family .
The sun was falling when she finished .
Anna climbed out of the kitchen window and ran .
WHEN MARY BYLER LEFT HOME , SHE THREW HER WHITE CAP onto Sam Mast 's driveway and screeched off in the car of a woman who took her in .
In the two years since , Mary has driven by her mother 's house a few times in a black Grand Prix .
" If Mary wants to get away , " Sally asked Eli 's lawyer , Greg Lunde , " why does she keep coming back ?
" When I caught up with Mary , six months after she left the Amish , she insisted that her mother and her brothers were dead to her .
But in the kitchen of the spotless trailer she rents next to Wisconsin 's La Crosse River , she could n't stop talking about them .
Cracking eggs into a mixing bowl to make sugar cookies never mind that it was after midnight she dwelt on how much Johnny , Eli , and David loved her baking .
Though Mary can't quite leave her family behind , she ran from the church and did n't look back .
She pierced her ears last March , earned a GED in April , and got a driver 's license in May .
A friend bought her the Grand Prix , and Mary paid him back on the $ 8 - an - hour salary she earns cleaning a hospital in La Crosse .
Mary took me out to her car to play a Loretta Lynn cassette .
Dressed in shorts and a tight pink T - shirt with a white angel on the front , she shifted a Doral cigarette from her right hand to her left so that she could jab more effectively at the seek button on the car stereo .
She was looking for one song : " Hey , Loretta . "
When it started , Mary jerked her head to the beat .
" Goodbye tub and clothesline , goodbye pots an ' pans , " she belted out , flinging her hair and pounding her right leg .
Her nails painted a matching pink and a silver necklace hanging from her neck , Mary did n't care how manyrules she was breaking .
She was drunk on freedom .
