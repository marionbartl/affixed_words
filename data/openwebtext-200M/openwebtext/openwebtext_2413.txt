Clinton , Obama seal the deal
It ’s finally official : President - elect Obama will appear with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) in Chicago on Monday as he names her secretary of state , a remarkable reunion of once - bitter rivals .
The news conference at a Chicago hotel is scheduled to begin at 10:40 a.m. Eastern .

Also attending will be Robert M. Gates , President Bush 's Defense Secretary , who will remain at the Pentagon .
Clinton and Gates are part of a national security team stocked with some of the best - known names in government .
The officials said that Obama is also naming Eric H. Holder Jr. , the former number - two - official at the Justice Department , as attorney general ; Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as secretary of Homeland Security ; Susan E. Rice , the Obama campaign 's senior foreign policy adviser , as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations ; and retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser .
The “ Team of Rivals ” war cabinet is very experienced and will have great credibility with the military and with allies abroad , but it constitutes several distinct power centers that could lead to clashes in tough times .
Obama ’s transition team gave the green light to Clinton ’s nomination after lawyers worked out a remarkable agreement addressing potential conflicts of interest for former President Bill Clinton , who has extensive financial ties abroad .
Most remarkably , the former president agreed to release the long - secret list of 208,000 donors to his presidential library and foundation .
As one of nine concessions , he has promised to put out the list by the end of the year .
“ It speaks to President Clinton 's willingness to do more than what 's asked of him , " said a Democratic official familiar with the protracted negotiations between Clinton emissaries and Obama transition aides .
The agreement was negotiated by Cheryl Mills , Bruce Lindsey and Doug Band on the Clinton side and John Podesta and Todd Stern on the Obama side .
Here are the provisions :
— The Clinton Foundation will publish the names of everyone who has contributed since its founding in 1997 ( this year ) .
— Should Senator Clinton be nominated and confirmed as Secretary of State , during her time of service , the Foundation will also publish the names of everyone who contributes going forward on an annual basis .
— The Foundation will separately incorporate CGI [ the Clinton Global Initiative ] from the Foundation ; President Clinton will continue to host CGI gatherings , such as the one in NYC and its meetings for college and university students , as Founding Chairman of CGI .
— Although President Clinton will continue to invite participants to CGI events ( which involves normal registration fees ) , he will not solicit ' sponsorship ' contributions for CGI .
— CGI will also not host annual events outside the US and CGI will not solicit or accept foreign government contributions .
— Given the extensive and life - saving work of the Clinton Foundation 's HIV / AIDS Initiative which can and should continue , the Foundation will continue to fulfill its commitments funded by foreign governments ( including , among others , Sweden Norway , France , Great Britain ) .
In the event an existing contributing country chooses to substantially increase its commitment , or a new country , or government - owned entity , decides to contribute , the Foundation will share such proposed contributions with the State Department ethics officials .
State may also share the issue to the WH Counsel 's office for review .
To whatever extent there are conflict of interest concerns raised about such potential contributions related to Senator Clinton 's service as Secretary , they will be conveyed to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation for appropriate action .
— Same procedure to be followed for any foreign country contributors to CCI [ Clinton Climate Initiative ] , CGSCI [ Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative ] and CHDI [ Clinton Hunter Development Initiative ] .
— Regarding President Clinton 's private work , during her tenure , President Clinton will share proposed hosts of speeches with the State Department ethics officials for their review , and as appropriate for review by the White House Counsel .
Again , should there be conflict of interest concerns related to the Senator 's anticipated service as Secretary , they will share those concerns with Senator and President Clinton for appropriate action .
— During her tenure as Secretary of State , should she be nominated and confirmed , President Clinton will share any proposed consultant relationships with State Department ethics officials , and the same procedures outlined above will apply here as well .
CHAMPAIGN , Ill . --
Men should already know that sex with multiple partners , especially unprotected sex , can increase their risk of contracting HIV and various venereal diseases .
They also can add that it may raise their odds of getting prostate cancer in middle age , according to a study published in a recent issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology .
The study , titled " Sexual Factors and the Risk of Prostate Cancer , " was written by Karin Rosenblatt , a professor of community health at the University of Illinois ; and Janet Stanford and Kristine Wicklund , researchers in the Program in Epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .
In it , the authors wrote that their findings " suggest that there is a direct positive relationship between the number of lifetime female sexual partners and the risk of prostate cancer in middle - aged men . "
The findings are consistent with several previous studies , they noted , and " suggest that sexual behavior and associated exposure to sexually transmitted agents enhance the risk of prostate cancer . "
The study was based on a population - based interview survey of 1,456 men ages 40 - 64 in King County , Wash .
The study group consisted of 753 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1993 and 1996 .
They were identified by the Seattle - Puget Sound cancer registry , part of the National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER ) Program .
The control group of 703 men was chosen using random - digit telephone dialing , with an age distribution similar to that of the study group .
The analysis showed a linear relationship between risk and number of female sexual partners , with those having 30 or more sexual partners shown to have more than twice the risk of having prostate cancer .
( The respondents were asked to estimate their number of partners within the following ranges : 1 , 2 - 4 , 5 - 14 , 15 - 29 , and 30 or more . )
The authors established that relationship after controlling for factors such as age , age at first intercourse , race , family history of prostate cancer , and number of prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) tests in the past five years .
They found no relationship between prostate cancer and frequency of intercourse .
Rosenblatt pointed out that though the numbers were cause for concern , they should not be overplayed .
" I 'm not sure we 've figured out the mechanism with this , and also some studies do n't show any association and some studies do , so I think there needs to be a little more research in this area . "
Similar studies on other cancers , however , such as cervical cancer , have shown even greater risk with the increase in number of sexual partners .

SEPTEMBER 11 ?
Do n't get Karen Johnson started about September 11 .
" I simply do n't buy that terrorists took the twin towers down , " says the Arizona state senator , a 12 - year Republican veteran of the legislature .
Johnson laughs and sighs .
" Come on !
World Trade Center Building
Seven was n't even hit by an airplane !
To me , 9/11 was a big cover - up .
" It 's the afternoon of June 18 , and Johnson has been having a pretty good day .
Hours earlier , Democratic Gov. Janet Napolitano signed House Bill 2677 into law , making Arizona the 20th state to adopt a resolution or statute opting out of the Real ID Act of 2005 , which mandated that all 50 states and the District of Columbia switch to a standardized , database - compatible driver 's license by May 11 , 2008 .
Arizona 's anti-ID law , penned by Johnson , has teeth .
State bureaucrats are required to " report to the governor and the legislature any attempt by agencies or agents " of the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to cajole some kind of compliance .
Gov. Napolitano , elected in 2002 , is a rising Democratic star who was reportedly vetted by Barack Obama 's campaign as a potential vice president .
Johnson 's relationship with her own party is somewhat less cozy .
She voted against John McCain , Arizona 's favorite son , in the state presidential primary and endorsed Ron Paul instead .
She has been pilloried for her connections to the ultraconservative John Birch Society and for her very public suggestions -- one of them made on the floor of the state Senate - - that 9/11 was an inside job .
The anti-conspiracy Web site Screw Loose Change calls her a " kook . "
Johnson can take it :
She calls herself a " rightwing nut .
" Deride them all you want , but the nuts are winning real victories for liberty , assembling a ragtag coalition that has managed to beat back one of the most egregious recent assaults on individual privacy .
" I think Real ID is done in Arizona , " says Mary Lunetta , an American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) liaison who worked with Johnson on HB 2677 .
" It 's over " Michael Hough , a coordinator for the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council , thinks Real ID will meet a similar fate at the federal level .
" Even the administration has backed off of implementing Real ID , " Hough says .
" It 's not going to happen as it stands now .
" The left / right , mainstream / fringe hydra of a movement to defeat Real ID in Arizona is a template that has worked in state after state .
These strange , sweet victories are a sign that the United States is rediscovering its civil libertarian roots after the momentous disruption of 9/11 .
A Skeptical TraditionAmericans probably would never have suffered through a debate over national ID cards -- much less a bill mandating them -- but for the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Biometric identification cards have been rejected by panel after panel , pol after pol , pitchfork - wielding mob after pitchfork - wielding mob , ever since the technology came online .
In 1973 , the year that the 12 - digit Universal Product Code made its debut , the House of Representatives ' Health , Education , and Welfare Advisory Committee rejected a national ID system on the grounds that it " would enhance the likelihood of arbitrary or uncontrolled linkage of records about people .
" As the years passed , the consensus held .
In 1977 the congressionally mandated Privacy Protection Study Commission , confronting the problem of identity theft , warned that a national ID and database of personal information would create more problems than they solved .
It recommended that bureaucrats " halt the incremental drift toward creation of a standard universal label and central population register " until legislators found a way to keep the information secure .
In part , the commission 's reluctance reflected the post - Watergate cynicism and paranoia of the 1970S .
But its decision was also rooted in a historical and uniquely American aversion to having the central government issue -- and demand on request -- uniform ID cards .
That cantankerous tradition flared up again in the early 1990s , when the Clinton administration 's health care plan was attached to a system of biometric cards .
Add to that the objections by affected interests such as state governments and " sin " industries , and opposition to a national ID scheme seemed etched in concrete .
Then came 9/11 .
During 2004 hearings held by the congressionally created National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States , centralized ID made a comeback .
The 9/11 commission ended up recommending some sort of biometric standardization of identification to prevent terrorists from collecting fake IDs the way some of the 19 hijackers had , although that recommendation was one of the few that did n't make into the December 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act .
The law did , however , authorize a Real ID Advisory Committee to research possibilities for national standards .
States , tech companies , and congressional staffs started cobbling together ideas .
" This was a state function that we were trying to keep a state function , albeit with national standards , " recalls David Quam , a researcher at the National Governors Association who worked on the project .
Other advocates shared Quam 's localist approach .
" The goal was to put the states in charge " says Brian Zimmer , who ran interference on the project between states and legislators on behalf of the House Judiciary Committee before becoming president of the lobbying group the Coalition for a Secure National ID .
" The Department of Homeland Security , ideally , would n't even be involved with this .
" But then the House of Representatives circumvented the process by pushing Real ID to the front of the legislative line .
The impetus had little to do with terrorism and much to do with the incendiary politics of immigration .
Swept in by a TsunamiIn January 2005 , Rep. David Dreier ( R - Calif . ) called for a Social Security card that would contain a biometric photo ID to prevent illegal immigrant day laborers from using bogus Social Security numbers to get jobs .
Dreier , a powerful and telegenic congressman first elected back in 1980 , had nearly lost his long - safe seat two months earlier thanks to a national and - immigration backlash headquartered in his own Orange County district .
Chastened , he vowed to crack down on illegal immigrants by making Social Security cards much harder to get , although not , he promised , to the point of transforming them into national ID cards .
To allay such fears , Dreier promised to stamp them with a disclaimer : " This is not a national ID card .
" The proposal did n't make it to a vote , but the idea was n't dead .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner ( R - Wis. ) had a more effective strategy .
In January 2005 he introduced the Real ID Act , watched it pass the House by a vote of 261 to 161 , but saw it die on the way to the Senate .
So Sensenbrenner , who had been pushing for some sort of biometric national ID card since the 1990S , attached Real ID to an $ 83.6 billion March 2005 emergency supplemental spending bill to fund relief in Pacific nations devastated by the December 2004 tsunami .
The House passed the package by a vote of 388 to 43 , the Senate authorized a version by a vote of 99 to o , and within two short months Real ID was signed into law by President George Bush .
States had three years to develop IDs with machine - readable data ( such as a bar code ) , verified by local departments of motor vehicles , linked together with databases that could be accessed by all other states .
[ ILLUSTRATION OMITTED ] Real ID had problems unrelated to civil liberties .
It demanded compliance from the states on a series of hard , nonnegotiable deadlines , the first one coming in May 2008 , when citizens of states with below - compliance IDs would run into problems when they boarded planes or crossed state lines .
It mandated a national database of biometric information , a technical undertaking for which no federal agency was ready .
There was never any serious estimate of how much money states would have to spend to bring their driver 's licenses into compliance , and no federal money was allocated for the purpose .
States would have to dig into their own funds to radically reform their own ID systems .
Two days after Bush signed the law , the National Governors Association , which had long been lobbying for a national ID card , came out against it .
" Several of the requirements included in the Emergency Supplemental , " it complained in a statement , " particularly those having to do with verification of documents used to acquire an ID , are either technologically or fiscally prohibitive . "
The National Conference of State Legislators weighed in against the law too .
So the two largest associations of politicians who would have to implement Real ID had hardened into dedicated opponents .
[ ILLUSTRATION OMITTED ]
Sensenbrenner , the DHS , and their allies in the tech industry still seemed to have the upper hand .
The tone of the press coverage , like the mood among state legislators , was resigned .
" Like it or Not , National IDS Are Coming , " read a typical headline in the Austin - American Statesman .
A Connecticut woman named Mary Long wrote to USA Today in favor of the idea , saying , " I certainly do n't mind standing in line longer or providing multiple documents to obtain my driver 's license in the interest of a more secure country .
" But the new system required more than slightly longer lines .
Congress had not appropriated the money needed to initiate the transition from many divergent state IDs to one national standard , a change requiring the root - and - branch transformation of thousands of motor vehicle departments .
" The government had no idea what it was getting into , " says Quam .
" They thought this would cost $ 100 million , total , and they did n't even give confidence that the money would be coming soon " Live Free or DieAt the beginning of 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security offered New Hampshire and Tennessee $ 3 million each for a test of Real ID .
New Hampshire was exactly the wrong place to begin .
The Live Free or Die state , home to the libertarian Free State Project , was rife with anti-Real ID activists .
The Granite State ID Coalition , a grab bag of groups ranging from the state Libertarian Party to the liberal Democracy for New Hampshire ( founded by the remnants of Howard Dean 's presidential campaign ) , had launched a word - of - mouth effort against the law .
Among the gaggle of local libertarian - leaning politicians , it seemed likely that one would arise to carry the anti-Real ID standard .
In March , Rep. Neal Kurk ( R - Weare ) , already a Real ID skeptic , was strolling between the State Capitol in Concord and his office when he ran into a fellow Republican , Rep. Richard Marple of Hookset .
" He was an oddball , " Kurk remembers , " but I overheard him talking about the Real ID Act and asked what he was working on . "
Marple showed Kurk his draft of an anti-Real ID bill , a rambling document that listed all of Marple 's constitutional objections to the law .
" I explained to him that this would never pass , " Kurk says , " and that if he wanted it to , I should rewrite it .
" Kurk composed a bill opting the state out of Real ID and turning down the $ 3 million grant --" the bribe , " he called it .
In committee , his proposal failed by a vote of 12 to I .
On April 14 , when the bill was scheduled to be read in the House ( despite the vote ) , Kurk took to the floor to make his pitch .
Yes , he acknowledged , if the Real ID deadline passed without New Hampshire 's compliance , the federal government might make good on its threat to bar residents from traveling on airplanes using their driver 's licenses for identification .
Yes , the state would be turning down a sizable pile of money .
" I do n't believe that the people of New Hampshire elected us to help the federal government create a national identification card , " he said .
" We care more for our liberties than to meekly hand over to the federal government the potential to enumerate , track , identify , and eventually control us .
" The speech was effective .
On May 3 , 2006 , the New Hampshire legislature passed HB 1582 , a bill creating " a commission to study " Real ID and prohibiting compliance until the study was completed .
" That $ 3 million bribe was tempting , " says state Sen.
Peter Burling ( D - Cornish ) , who sponsored the Senate version of the bill .
Later that month , Kurk and his allies got a hallelujah from U.S. Sen.
John Sununu ( R - N.H. ) .
" The REAL ID Act replaced sound policy with bad policy , " Sununu wrote in a column for the conservative Manchester Union Leader .
Kurk 's success emboldened the nation 's Real ID opponents , who had been nervous about responding to federal threats with constitutional arguments .
" I 'd point to that speech as the turning point , " says Jim Harper , the director of information policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute , and a key player in barnstorming against the law .
" It was a good speech " Kurk says today .
" I freely admit that .
But do n't give me all the credit !
" Noam Biale , a lawyer who helped launch the ACLU 's anti-Real ID project in late 2005 , says the measure had " two Achilles ' heels "
The first was the cost on the federal level .
" The second , " Biale says , " was state implementation , which gets thorny for a number of reasons , and the civil liberties issue was the big one . "
In its search for allies , the mostly liberal ACLU often found that activists on the right had started the work already .
The Revolt SpreadsBefore Neal Kurk 's rebellion began -- even before Real ID became a law - - a more marginalized segment of the coalition was emerging .
Endtime magazine , a 35,000 - circulation , Dallas - based periodical published by the eschatological Endtime Ministries , had been churning out cautionary articles about computer ID chips for years .
When Real ID passed , Endtime clicked into high gear .
" The Real ID card , " says Endtime Managing Editor Craig Treadwell , " plays right into the hands of the Beast .
" According to Treadwell 's apocalyptic theology , during the end days a " mark of the beast " will be forced onto mankind .
Millions of Christians avidly believe in this ; fear of the mark has girded opposition to UPC symbols , to health ID cards , and to any proposal for a global or national ID card .
In mid-2006 , Endtime printed a special issue that went well beyond its subscription base .
Copies , Treadwell says , were mailed to every member of Congress and every state legislator in the nation .
In Oklahoma one copy went to state Sen. Randy Brogdon ( R - Owasso ) , who soon found some secular reasons to oppose Real ID .
" Congress has no authority over what we do with our driver 's licenses , " Brogdon says today .
" It 's a flagrant violation of the roth Amendment .
And it blows away the First Amendment rights of my constituents .
I have constituents who believe that in the end times , we will have to bear a special mark that will be foisted upon us by the government " Brogdon 's party was n't very supportive at first .
Former Oklahoma Rep. Ernest Istook , a Republican who lost the race for governor in 2006 and then found a sinecure at the Heritage Foundation , attacked politicians who wanted to opt out of Real ID .
" When you are out of step with the rest of the country " Istook said in January 2007 , " it is not reasonable to think Congress is going to change the law just for you " Brogdon sold statehouse members on opting out of Real ID by pushing a combination of fiscal concerns and privacy fears .
" Congress passed this thing without any debate " he argues .
" I just think that 's despicable " Even as the state was passing an anti-illegal immigration bill , Brogdon 's Real ID revolt sailed through .
From state to state , the same pattern emerged .
In Idaho , Republican Rep. Phil Hart , based in the rural area around Coeur d'Alene , was already getting " incredibly negative " feedback from his constituents about the law .
To build support for his opt - out bill , Hart invited Cato 's Jim Harper to a public forum .
Harper took his seat and listened to the speaker before him , state Homeland Security Director Bill Bishop .
Harper was stunned .
" I 'm there , dressed to the nines to give this speech based on material I 've worked on for months , " Harper says .
" Here 's this guy - - a great Western guy , with a sheriff mustache - - saying it all .
Cost overruns .
Civil liberties .
The flawed national database .
That was a point when I realized how pervasive the understanding of this issue was , and how oppositional it was " The ACLU and Cato became the public face of Real ID opposition , but much of the grunt work was done by activists on the political fringes .
Katherine Albrecht is a conservative long active in opposing radio frequency identification ( RFID ) chips -- electronic tracking gizmos that can be implanted in virtually anything .
When Albrecht heard about the Real ID Act , she hit the campaign trail , writing articles for websites and magazines like Endtime , giving anti-Real ID presentations to legislatures in states as far - flung as Alaska .
" I got a lot of ' wow ' and ' that can't be true ' kind of reactions , " she remembers .
The John Birch Society contacted its members in every state , provided information for them to dog their legislators , and published anti-Real ID journalism in its New American magazine .
Not even James Sensenbrenner 's Wisconsin stomping grounds were safe from Real ID rebels .
Republicans controlled the state legislature , but state Rep. Jeff Wood ( R - Chippewa Falls ) was against Real ID from the start .
" I thought it did nothing to prevent terrorism , " Wood says .
" The only thing you can ever predict is bad legislation , and this took the cake as far as that 's concerned .
" Wood found a liberal ally in state Rep. Louis Molepske ( D - Stevens Point ) , whose initial worries about Real ID grew as he talked to federal officials .
" I was on a conference call with the undersecretary of DHS , " he remembers , " and I asked pointed questions he could not answer . "
Molepske was prodded by his left - leaning constituents to research Real ID and to pass a corrective bill .
" I 'm blessed to represent a district with a university , with a lot of really smart people who educated me " he says .
Wood and Molepske drafted legislation that took Wisconsin out of Real ID .
Sensenbrenner , fuming , said he would travel district to district and campaign against any Republican who opposed the federal law .
" I said ' go ahead , ' " says Wood .
" I offered to pay for his gas " Wood and Molepske are n't feeling much heat before their September primaries ; by the time Sensenbrenner made his threat , no one could mistake which way the wind was blowing .
The Governors ' RebellionBy the start of 2008 , 18 states -- Arkansas , Colorado , Georgia , Hawaii , Idaho , Illinois , Maine , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , and Washington -- had passed laws opting out of Real ID or demanding extensions past the May deadline .
The Bush administration responded by buckling .
On January II DHS pushed back the Final deadline for compliance by five years , from 2012 to 20l7 .
The central concept of a national database was scrapped for financial and technological reasons :
It was just too much for the department to manage , even if a full - scale revolt had n't been thwarting it at every step .
But Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer , a Democrat , was n't satisfied .
On February II he sent ( and made public ) a letter to 12 fellow governors .
The message : Hang tough .
" Please do not accept the Faustian bargain of applying for the DHS extension , " Schweitzer wrote .
" If we stand together , either DHS will blink or Congress will have to act to avoid havoc at our nation 's airports and federal courthouses " South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , a Republican , did n't need the pep talk .
He had opposed a national ID card for years , starting when he was a congressman in the mid-1990s .
" Illegal immigration was used as the trojan horse back then , " Sanford remembers .
" The new ingredient is post - 9/11 fears .
" On May 31 Sanford sent DHS his own seven - page letter excoriating the program .
Like Schweitzer , he made it public .
" Does it make any sense to begin a de facto national ID system without debate ? "
Sanford wrote .
" As a practical matter , this sensitive subject received far less debate than steroid use in baseball "
He concluded by telling DHS to be " mindful not to fight yesterday 's battle and to always remember that America 's greatest homeland security rests in liberty .
" DHS responded by pretending Sanford had said something else entirely .
" Based on your assurances , " Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote , " it seems clear that South Carolina is well on the way to meeting requirements comparable to those required by the final Real ID regulation .
I will therefore treat your letter as a basis for an extension and hereby grant it .
" It was all that Chertoff could do .
The May II deadline for Real ID compliance had come and gone , and all So states had missed it .
At the Wisconsin GOP 's annual convention in May , Sensenbrenner ( who declined to be interviewed for this article ) delivered a petulant attack against Assembly Speaker Michael Huebsch ( R - West Salem ) for stopping Real ID compliance in the state .
" We need to act like Republicans and vote like Republicans , " Sensenbrenner said .
Huebsch , speaking a little later , referred to the Real ID author only obliquely .
" We as Republicans " he said , " do not place our faith in government but in each other " Bucking the SystemArizona did n't play a special role in the death of Real ID .
It looked like the other rebellious states ; when the momentum shifted from the go - along , get - along ID supporters to people like Karen Johnson , it merely echoed what was happening elsewhere .
But it was in Arizona where Real ID opponents proved they 'd achieved the upper hand in this debate .
Johnson 's coalition brought together every group in the sprawling pro-privacy tent .
The ACLU sent letters imploring its 3,000 state members to lobby for an opt - out bill .
Bryan Turner , an organizer for the John Birch Society , talked to his own members and twisted arms on Capitol Hill .
Citizens who walked into a March 2008 town hall meeting at the University of Arizona heard the ACLU and Katherine Albrecht join Johnson in making the point - by - point , they 're - coming - for - your - rights case against Real ID .
" It was a wonderful cross- party kind of union , " remembers Mary Lunetta , the state ACLU 's activism director .
How much of the rebels ' victory was their own , and how much was due to the federal government 's poor sales pitch ?
Real ID opponents readily admit that the failure of the reds to offer grants to pay for compliance proved crucial .
The reds ultimately offered Arizona $ 9o million , but it came much too late , the day after the governor signed the noncompliance bill .
Johnson does n't think it would have been enough to change the outcome .
" It would n't [ have been ] unanimous anymore , " she says .
" But we 'd still have the majority .
" Johnson and others who defeated Real ID have confronted the national security state before and lost , badly .
They 've watched other unfunded mandates get forced onto states as legislators and governors grumbled , then meekly assented .
But this time the states did n't assent .
" This is a major shift we 've been seeing " says the ACLU 's Noam Biale .
" We saw this kind of resistance first with the PATRIOT Act , but this was bigger , and this was more successful .
There is a willingness to challenge the national security state that was n't there six years ago . "
To the surprise of Biale , it was a challenge that came from libertarians and the religious right as much as -- maybe more than -- the left .
"
We 're not Russia , " says Neal Kurk , the New Hampshire Republican who played a crucial role in the Real ID fight .
" We 're not Germany .
We 're not Japan .
There are too many people in this country who buck the system for a scheme like this to succeed " David Weigel ( dweigel@reason.com ) is an associate editor of reason .

Mr Yusuf blamed parliamentarians for the failure of the cabinet talks Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed has said Islamist insurgents now control most of the country , and have advanced to the edge of Mogadishu .
Mr Yusuf said there was no effective government in Somalia , and that insurgents were now able to carry out attacks in the capital at will .
The president was speaking to Somali parliamentarians in Kenya , a day after talks on forming a new cabinet failed .
Last month , regional grouping Igad set a deadline of 12 November for a deal .
The mandate of the Transitional Government of Somalia ( TFG ) , formed in late 2004 , is set to expire in August 2009 .
Call for unity President Yusuf was at his gloomiest on Saturday , addressing Somali MPs in neighbouring Kenya .
The government controls Mogadishu and Baidoa and people are killed there every day
Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed
He said the Islamist insurgency , which looked as though it had been crushed two years ago following intervention by the Ethiopian army , was now as strong as ever .
Members of the al - Shabab group now controlled most of the country and had advanced to the suburbs of Mogadishu , as well as Baidoa , the home town of the parliament , he said .
" The government controls Mogadishu and Baidoa and people are killed there every day , " Mr Yusuf told the meeting in Nairobi .
" Islamists have taken over everywhere else , so if I ask you parliamentarians : do you know the situation we face ?
Who causes all these problems ?
We are to blame . "
Mr Yusuf said the al - Shabab group now controlled most of the country President Yusuf lamented that at this vital time when unity is needed , talks on forming a new transitional government had ended in failure .
He and Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein have been unable to agree on the make - up of a new cabinet , missing a deadline issued by the Inter - Governmental Authority on Development ( Igad ) last month .
In the meantime members of al - Shabab , which the US believes to be linked to al - Qaeda , have consolidated their hold on southern Somalia , meting out punishments on the population based on their interpretation of Islamic law .
They whipped 25 women and seven men for holding a traditional dance , which they said was forbidden .
In October , a girl was stoned to death in a crowded stadium in the port city of Kismayo .
Aged just 13 , she had been convicted of adultery after complaining she had been raped .

UK Officials Are Hoping To Shift Their Genetically - Modified Crop Trials To Secret Military Locations In Order To Prevent Their Destruction By Anti-GMO Extremists .
UK officials are hoping to protect genetically - modified crops from the actions of anti-gm extremists .
Opponents have targeted almost all of the 54 GM crop trials since 2000 .
For example , recently more than 400 potato plants were destroyed on a farm at the University of Leeds in June .
Officials also hope to prosecute the groups in the same manner as they do animal rights extremists — good .
While I understand and agree with their position , the action is completely hypocritical .
It ’s like the anti-abortionists who protest the slaughtering of babies by slaughtering doctors .
Currently , scientists must disclose the location of such trials on a government website .
Awesome , whomever came up with that legislation must be an opponent to GM crops .
One site for consideration is Porton Down near Salisbury , which carries out military research and includes a science park where they could be securely developed away from the public .
But the question remains : do GM foods hold the key to global food shortages and rising prices ?
Though officials are trying to protect these efforts they do want to have a new conversation about GM crops with the public .
But Gordon Brown is moving cautiously because of strong opposition from previous trials .
A government source added : “ We need to review the security arrangements .
The rules are a charter for people who want to stop the experiments .
A lot of information has to be put in the public domain and that makes it very easy for people to trash them . ”
Leeds University — showing they are suckers for punishment — plans to make one final attempt .
They hope a government funded fence and security cameras will thwart any attempts at sabotaging the experiment .
Good luck with that .
Professor Tim Benton , research dean at its Faculty of Biological Science , said yesterday : “ We need to find a way to do crop trials in a safe way and to minimize the environmental risk .
We cannot carry on for the next 20 or 30 years saying it ’s too scary , the public is too frightened , it is politically too dangerous .
There is absolutely no way we can move towards a world with food security without using GM technology .
The amount of food we need could double because the population is growing , climate change will reduce yields and we will take land out of food production for biofuels . ”
Officials are trying to draw strong parallels between anti-GM protesters and those that oppose experiments on animals .
In 2005 the law was changed to give police the power to prosecute such extreme actions after Huntingdon Life Sciences was targeted and attacked by animal rights activists .
Huh .
Maybe there is a GM - centric division of PETA ?

TORONTO -- Hacking into systems ( albeit for testing purposes ) is apparently getting easier with the upcoming open source Metasploit 3.2 framework , according to its creator .
During a packed presentation at that SecTor conference here yesterday , Metasploit creator H. D. Moore detailed some of the new features in the upcoming Metasploit 3.2 release .
They include names such as Browser AutoPwn , Metasploit in the Middle and the Evil Wireless Access Point .
" For http we do a whole bunch of evil things to a browser , " Moore said , addressing an audience of security and networking professionals from sectors such as government and leading corporations .
Many attend the conference in order to stay up to date on vulnerability assessments and how hackers exploit networks .
Metasploit is an open source attack framework first developed by Moore in 2003 .
With the Metasploit 3.0 release , the project has moved to an all Ruby programming base , which Moore credits with quickening development and exploits .
Take the context map payload feature , which encodes attack shellcode .
Moore claimed that the new feature will make it even more difficult to detect attack code .
Getting attack code onto a target machine will also be easier on Metasploit 3.2 with improvements to the Raw Packet Tools function .
A new library call PacketFu is expected by Moore to achieve packet injection for both wired and wireless end points .
It also provides improved support for exploiting multi-core CPU machines , which had been more difficult to attack with previous versions of Metasploit .
Metasploit is also able to take exploit code and weaponize it in an .EXE ( executable file ) that can be deployed by an attacker .
Moore said the EXE template that created EXE attacks has been improved in Metasploit 3.2 in order to defeat AntiVirus vendor signature detection .
Moore boasted that he is using the same resources that the anti-virus vendors are using to identify virus signatures to ensure that the Metasploit EXE template is not identified .
If that was n't enough , Metasploit 3.2 will include a new super weapon that will make exploiting browsers a trivial matter .
The new Browser Autopwn feature is a client side auto attack system that will fire up exploits automatically against a user 's browser with the goal of providing a shell into the browser .
The Road Photos
Brand new movie stills from the upcoming Post Apocalyptic thriller “ ” by directorand starringandhave been released .
John Hillcoat directs “ The Road ” from a script byA father ( Viggo Mortensen ) and his son ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) walk alone through burned America .
Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind .
It is cold enough to crack stones , and , when the snow falls it is gray .
The sky is dark .
Their destination is the coast , although they do n’t know what , if anything , awaits them there .
They have nothing : just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road , the clothes they are wearing , a cart of scavenged food and each other .

Simple Solver for Boolean Satisfiability
This module implements the Davis - Putnam - Logemann - Loveland ( DPLL ) algorithm that computes satisfying assignments for Boolean formulas .
It is written in a way that supports the use of Pandoc for rendering .

Boolean Formulas and Partial Evaluation
Boolean values are parameterized over the type of variable names .
> data Boolean v
> = Var v |
Yes |
No
> | Not ( Boolean v )
> | Boolean v :&& : Boolean v
> | Boolean v : || : Boolean v
> deriving ( Eq , Show )
Apart from variables , we define the primitive booleans Yes and No ( to avoid a name clash with Prelude .
True and Prelude .
False ) and compound booleans , viz. , for negation , conjunction and disjunction .
> evalPrim :: Boolean v ->
Boolean v
> evalPrim = asLongAsPossible elim
> where
> elim ( Not Yes ) = Just No
> elim ( Not No ) = Just Yes
> elim ( No :&& : _ ) = Just No
> elim ( Yes :&& : x ) = Just x
> elim ( _ :&& : No ) = Just No
> elim ( x :&& : Yes ) = Just x
> elim ( Yes : || : _ ) = Just Yes
> elim ( No : || : x ) = Just x
> elim ( _ : || : Yes ) = Just Yes
> elim ( x : || : No ) = Just x
> elim _ = Nothing
We can partially evaluate formulas by eliminating primitive booleans ( i.e. Yes and No ) from compound formulas .
The result after this step will be a primive boolean or a compound formula without primitive booleans .
The function makes use of an auxiliary function that applies a given transformation as long as it does not yield Nothing everywhere in a Boolean formula .
The given transformation will yield Nothing on every subexpression of the result .
> asLongAsPossible :: ( Boolean v -> Maybe ( Boolean v ) ) ->
Boolean v ->
Boolean v
> asLongAsPossible f = everywhere g
> where g x = maybe x ( everywhere g ) ( f x )
>
> everywhere :: ( Boolean v -> Boolean v ) -> Boolean v ->
Boolean v
> everywhere f = f . atChildren ( everywhere f )
>
> atChildren :: ( Boolean v -> Boolean v ) -> Boolean v ->
Boolean v
> atChildren f ( Not x ) = Not ( f x )
> atChildren f ( x:&&:y ) = f x :&& : f y
> atChildren f ( x : ||:y ) = f x : || : f y
> atChildren _ x = x
Conversion to CNF
As the DPLL algorithm expects Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form ( CNF ) , we need to transform arbitrary formulas into a conjunction of disjunctions of literals .
> type CNF v = Conjunction ( Clause v )
> type Clause v = Disjunction ( Literal v )
> type Conjunction a = PQ a
> type Disjunction a = [ a ]
> data Literal v = Pos v | Neg v
> deriving ( Eq , Show )
>
> litVar :: Literal v ->
v
> litVar ( Pos x ) = x
> litVar ( Neg x ) = x
>
> inv :: Literal v ->
Literal v
> inv ( Pos x ) = Neg x
> inv ( Neg x ) = Pos x
>
> isPos :: Literal v ->
Bool
> is Pos ( Pos _ ) = True
> is Pos _ = False
>
> insertClause :: Clause v -> CNF v -> CNF v
> insertClause clause = insertQ ( length clause ) clause
>
> singleClause :: Clause v -> CNF v
> singleClause clause = singletonQ ( length clause ) clause
>
> cnf :: Eq v =>
Boolean v -> CNF v
> cnf Yes = EmptyQ
> cnf No = singleClause [ ]
> cnf formula
> = mergeQs
> . map ( singleClause . map literal . flatDisjunction )
> . flatConjunction
> . asLongAsPossible distribute
> . asLongAsPossible pushNots
> $ formula
> where
> pushNots ( Not ( Not x ) ) = Just x
> pushNots ( Not ( x:&& : y ) ) = Just ( Not x : || : Not y )
> pushNots ( Not ( x : || : y ) ) = Just ( Not x :&& : Not y )
> pushNots _ = Nothing
>
> distribute ( x : | | : ( y : && : z ) ) = Just ( ( x : ||:y ) : && :( x : ||:z ) )
> distribute ( ( x:&&:y ) : ||:z ) = Just ( ( x : ||: z ) : && : (y : ||:z ) )
> distribute _ = Nothing
>
> literal ( Var x ) = Pos x
> literal ( Not ( Var x ) ) = Neg x
First , we push down negations to variables according to de-Morgan 's rules and then use distributivity to eliminate disjunctions of conjunctions .
Finally , we flatten conjunctions and disjunctions and use literal notation for variables and negated variables .
The following two functions flatten conjunctions and disjunctions .
> flatConjunction :: Boolean v -> [ Boolean v ]
> flatConjunction b = flat b [ ]
> where flat ( x:&& :y ) = flat x .
flat y
> flat x = ( x : )
>
> flatDisjunction :: Boolean v -> [ Boolean v ]
> flatDisjunction b = flat b [ ]
> where flat ( x : ||:y ) = flat x .
flat y
> flat x = ( x : )
The Constraint Store
Now we are ready to define a constraint store for Boolean constraints .
Unlike the original formulation of the DPLL algorithm , we are not restricted to backtracking but can search in an arbitrary instance of MonadPlus .
We obtain backtracking if we use the list monad .
Usually , backtracking is sufficient , because the search space is finite if we only consider Boolean formulas .
However , if we want to combine the solver for Boolean constraints with another solver with a possibly infinite search space then we should resort to a fair search algorithm in order to obtain all possible solutions .
> newtype DPLL ( m :: * -> *) v = DPLL ( CNF v)
>
> instance ( MonadPlus m , Eq v ) => CStore ( DPLL m v )
> where
> type Constraint ( DPLL m v ) = Boolean v
> type Solver ( DPLL m v ) = WriterT [ ( v , Bool ) ] m
>
> noConstraints = DPLL EmptyQ
> assert formula = liftDPLL ( updCNF formula )
> labeling = liftDPLL solveCNF
>
> liftDPLL action = do
> DPLL clauses <- get
> newClauses <- lift ( action clauses )
> put ( DPLL newClauses )
The constraint store for implementing the DPLL algorithm processes constraints of type Boolean v for some variable representation v that supports an equality check .
During constraint solving we want to compute satisfying substitutions and we use the writer monad transformer to do so in the background .
The operations assert and labeling simply lift corresponding operations that are defined in the following .
> updCNF :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v )
> => Boolean v -> CNF v -> WriterT [ ( v , Bool ) ] m ( CNF v )
> updCNF formula clauses = propDet ( mergeQ ( cnf ( evalPrim formula ) ) clauses )
In order to add a Boolean formula to the constraint store , we convert it to CNF , add the resulting clauses to the store and propagate deterministic information in the constraint store .
The DPLL algorithm employs two different operations to propagate deterministic information :
unit propagation and
pure literal assignment .
Unit propagation looks for clauses that contain only a single literal , deterministically assigns a value to the corresponding variable and propagates this information to the other clauses .
Pure literal assignment looks for variables that occur either always positive or always negative and deterministically assign them a value .
For example , if a variable occurs always positive , it is assigned the value true and all clauses that contain it are eliminated .
However , there might also be solutions if we assign the value false .
For example , in the following formula both variables occur always positive :
Var ' x ' : || : Var 'y '
However , the formula is still satisfiable , if we assign false to either of the variables .
In order to obtain all possible solutions , we do not assign pure literals .
Unit Propagation
When it is possible to propagate deterministic information , the we do so even when asserting constraints -- not only when solving them .
> propDet :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v ) => CNF v -> WriterT [ ( v , Bool ) ] m ( CNF v )
> propDet EmptyQ = return EmptyQ
> propDet clauses = do
> let ( n , c ) = headQ clauses
> guard ( n > 0 )
> if n == 1 then propagate ( head c ) clauses >>= propDet
> else return clauses
>
> propagate :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v )
> => Literal v -> CNF v -> WriterT [ ( v , Bool ) ] m ( CNF v )
> propagate lit clauses = do
> tell [ ( litVar lit , is Pos lit ) ]
> return ( foldQ prop clauses )
> where
> prop c | lit `elem` c = id
> | otherwise = insertClause ( filter ( inv lit / = ) c )
To eliminate a literal , we eliminate all clauses that contain it and eliminate all inverse occurrences from the remaining clauses .
Search
After propagating deterministic information , we need to perform search .
> solveCNF :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v ) => CNF v -> WriterT [ ( v , Bool ) ] m ( CNF v )
> solveCNF EmptyQ = return EmptyQ
> solveCNF clauses = do
> let var = selectBranchVar clauses
> proceed ( Pos var ) `mplus` proceed ( Neg var )
> where
> proceed lit = propagate lit clauses >>= propDet >>= solveCNF
We choose a variable , split the search space by assigning it true or false non-deterministically , propagate this binding , simplify the resulting clauses by propagating unit literals , and continue to solve the remaining clauses .
> selectBranchVar :: Eq v => CNF v -> v
> selectBranchVar clauses
> = fst .
head
> . sortBy ( \ ( _ , n ) ( _ , m ) -> compare m n )
> $ foldr count [ ] vars
> where
> ( n , c ) : ncs = queueToList clauses
> vars = map litVar ( c ++ concatMap snd ( takeWhile ( ( n== ) . fst ) ncs ) )
>
> count x [ ] = [ ( x , 1 ) ]
> count x ( ( y , n ) : yns )
> | x == y = ( y , n +1 ) : yns
> | otherwise = ( y , n ) : count x yns
We choose a variable that occurs most frequently in the shortest clauses hoping to produce many unit clauses .
> guardB :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v ) => Boolean v -> Constr ( DPLL m v ) ()
> guardB = guardC
>
> substitution :: ( MonadPlus m , Eq v ) => Boolean v -> m [ ( v , Bool ) ]
> substitution formula = execWriterT $
> evalStateT ( solution ( guardB formula ) >> labeling ) noConstraints
Finally , we define a specialized version of the guardC function and use it to compute satisfying substitutions for Boolean formulas in an arbitrary instance of MonadPlus .
Syntactic Sugar
We define auxiliary functions for constructing Boolean expressions in order to be able to make the data type abstract .
> booleanVar :: v ->
Boolean v
> booleanVar x = Var x
>
> true , false :: Boolean v
> true =
Yes ; false = No
>
> neg :: Boolean v ->
Boolean v
> neg x =
Not x
>
> (.&&. ) , (.||. ) :: Boolean v -> Boolean v ->
Boolean v
>
> (.&&. ) = ( :&& : ) ; (.||. ) = ( : | | : )
We also define shortcuts for other Boolean operators .
> (.==>. ) , (.<==. ) , (.==. ) , (./=. ) :: Boolean v -> Boolean v ->
Boolean v
>
> x .== >. y = neg x .||. y
> x .<==. y = y .== >. x
> x .==. y = x .== >. y .&&. y .== >. x
> x ./=. y = ( x .||. y ) .&&. ( neg x .||. neg y )
Priority Queues
We store clauses in a priority queue implemented as pairing heaps ( cf. Okasaki ) in order to be able to choose the shortest clause efficiently .
ST . PAUL 
The nominee ’s friend described him as a “ restless reformer who will clean up Washington . ”
His defeated rival described him going to the capital to “ drain that swamp . ”
His running mate described their mission as “ change , the goal we share . ”
And that was at the incumbent party ’s convention .
After watching two political conclaves the last two weeks , it would be easy to be confused about which was really the gathering of the opposition .
As Senator John McCain accepted the Republican nomination for president , he and his supporters sounded the call of insurgents seeking to topple the establishment , even though their party heads the establishment .
This was , of course , part Mr. McCain ’s nature and part political calculation .
It was also part history .
For the first time since 1952 , the party holding the White House has nominated someone other than the sitting president or vice president , someone without a vested interest in running on continuity , and at a moment when the party finds it difficult to defend its record from the last eight years .
The effort to position Mr. McCain and the Republicans as the true agents of change benefited this week from his selection of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate .
Known for taking on her own state party over corruption and wasteful spending , Ms. Palin projects the image of the ultimate Washington outsider , literally from more than 2,800 miles outside the Capital Beltway .
And she would be the first woman to serve as vice president .
The Bank of England has made a shock one - and - a - half percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 3 % , the lowest level since 1955 .
The size of the cut - the most dramatic since 1981 - signals the Bank 's concern the UK is heading for a long recession , the BBC 's economics editor says .
Mortgage lenders are now under pressure to pass the cut on to borrowers .
But due to the unexpected size of the cut , most banks have not yet decided how much of it to pass on .
" I think it 's essential that the banks do pass on the benefit of lower interest rates to people and to businesses , " Chancellor Alistair Darling said .
" Banks need to understand that they need to help their customers . "
' Bigger than expected '
The BBC 's economics editor Hugh Pym said the Bank of England was clearly concerned about the possibility of a prolonged recession in the UK .
This was evident from the Bank 's use of terms such as " very marked deterioration in the outlook " and " severe contraction " , he said .
Did n't we the taxpayers bail out the banks ?
Were n't we told that in return the Treasury had demanded strict conditions ?
Nick Robinson , BBC political editor
Read Nick Robinson 's blog ' No rush ' on mortgage costs Bank of England statement Size of cut welcomed IMF cuts growth forecast Shadow chancellor George Osborne said : " This is a shot in the arm for the economy , but it shows how sick the patient is . "
Traders on the London market were also concerned about the message the cut conveyed .
As a result , the FTSE 100 share index closed down 5.6 % , or 255 points at 4,275.7 .
The UK cut was followed by a less dramatic move from the European Central Bank , which lowered eurozone interest rates from 3.75 % to 3.25 % , to try to boost economic growth in the region .
What 's more , the global financial body the IMF sharply revised down its forecasts for economic growth around the world in 2009 .
It predicted that developed economies as a whole would contract next year for the first time since World War Two .
Mortgage fears
The hefty cut will automatically reduce monthly repayments for those with tracker deals that are linked to the Bank rate by about £ 134 on an average £ 150,000 mortgage .

However , there have been concerns that a cut in the Bank of England 's base rate might not be passed on to other borrowers .
Given the surprise level of the Bank rate cut , mortgage lenders will take their time to decide whether they will pass on cuts to standard variable rate ( SVR ) mortgage holders , which account for up to 10 % of total home loans .
The major lenders said rates were " under review " , however Lloyds TSB has promised to pass on the rate cut in full to its standard variable rate mortgage customers .
The group , which also lends through Cheltenham & Gloucester , said its SVR , currently 6.5 % , would never be more than 2 % above Bank of England base rate .
Abbey has also passed on the cut in full to SVR customers .
Customers on fixed - rate deals - about 50 % of the market - will see no change to their repayments until they come to the end of their current deal .
But major lenders have been withdrawing nearly all tracker rate deals for new borrowers as they wait to see how the industry reacts to the cut .
The cut is likely to hit savers who face a reduction in the interest rates they receive from their deposits .
' The right call '
The move has been broadly welcomed by business bodies and trade unions .
Lenders ' latest mortgage decisions Richard Lambert , CBI director - general , said : " This is a bold and welcome move by the Monetary Policy Committee , and achieves what the CBI had been calling for . "
He added : " This cut should help to ease conditions in the credit markets , and allow banks to pass the benefits on to their customers . "
The TUC 's head of economics Adam Lent said the move was " the right call " .
" It shows the Bank now understands that the problem is recession not inflation . "
Meanwhile , the Institute of Directors ( IoD ) said interest rates could touch record lows of 2 % or less by this time next year .
" The sooner we get interest rates down the less is the risk of a long and deep recession , " said IoD chief economist Graeme Leach .
Manufacturing decline
The Bank of England 's interest rate move came after a series of figures released this week provided further evidence that the UK economy is sliding towards recession .
New figures from the Halifax showed house prices fell by another 2.2 % in October , pushing the drop in house prices to 13.7 % over the past year .
Activity in the service sector , the backbone of the UK economy , shrank in October for the sixth month in a row .
According to an index compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchase and Supply output from services was at its lowest level since its poll began in 1996 .
Also , the Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing output fell for a seventh month in September - the longest run of monthly declines since 1980 .
Manufacturing output fell by 0.8 % in September , much worse than analysts ' expectations , making output 2.3 % lower than a year earlier , the sharpest decline since May 2003 .

Universities can start collecting the fee from July and , in return , will have to comply with government benchmarks on the type and quality of non-academic services they provide .
To soften the impact on students and parents , the Government will provide HECS - style student loans to cover the fee , and repayment will be deferred until students enter the workforce .
But in the most contentious element of the scheme , the $ 250 fee will also be used to fund student representation and advocacy on campus .
Critics will argue this is a new form of compulsory student unionism .
The National Union of Students welcomed the plan last night but called for the funds to be directed to campus student organisations rather than be controlled by university administrations .
Voluntary student unionism , introduced in 2006 , barred universities from imposing compulsory fees for non-academic activities including membership of student associations and unions .
The compulsory fees had ranged from $ 100 to $ 600 .
Ms Ellis says the ban stripped $ 170 million out of university funding and , in some cases , forced the closure of vital health , counselling , employment , assault , child care and welfare services .
A government review found many universities had since dipped into funds for academic work or raised the price of food and drinks to pay for services .
" As promised at the last election , the Rudd Government has delivered a balanced , practical solution to rebuild important student support services and amenities , " she said .
Universities would still be prohibited from requiring students to be members of student organisations , she said .
The national president of the The National Union of Students , Angus McFarland , said : " If you are going to charge students , the best people to provide the services are the student bodies because they are more aware of the quality of student services than middle - aged bureaucrats . "
Ms Ellis said the fee would be capped at $ 250 but adjusted each year by an indexation formula .
The new funding is likely to cover food and drinks , meeting rooms , sports and recreation , child care , counselling , health care , legal advice , housing , employment , arts , debating , student newspapers and overseas student support .
A spokesman for Ms Ellis said any student representation to be funded would not allow partisan political activities .
Winning Senate approval could be made easier by the Nationals ' Senate leader Barnaby Joyce , who opposed voluntary student unionism because of the impact on regional universities .
First Dude Todd Palin has said he and some “ buddies ” built his lakefront home in Wasilla , Alaska , but an investigation by the Village Voice connects the home ’s construction , if circumstantially , to the beneficiaries of a local boondoggle championed by his wife .
( h/t : DailyKos / Stef )
Village Voice :
THE $ 12.5 MILLION sports complex and hockey rink that is the lasting monument to Palin ’s two terms as Wasilla mayor is also a monument to the kind of insider politics that dismays Americans of both parties .
Six months before Palin stepped down as mayor in October 2002 , the city awarded nearly a half - million - dollar contract to design the biggest project in Wasilla history to Kumin Associates .
Blase Burkhart was the Kumin architect on the job — the son of Roy Burkhart , who is frequently described as a “ mentor ” of Palin and was head of the local Republican Party ( his wife , June , who also advised Palin , is the national committeewoman ) .
Asked if the contract was a favor , Roy Burkhart , who contributed to her campaign in the same time frame that his son got the contract , said : “ I really do n’t know . ”
Palin then named Blase Burkhart to a seven - member builder - selection committee that picked Howdie Inc. , a mostly residential contractor owned at the time by Howard Nugent .
Formally awarded the contract a couple of weeks after Palin left office , Nugent has donated $ 4,000 to Palin campaigns .
Two competitors protested the process that led to Nugent ’s contract .
Burkhart and Nugent had done at least one project together before the complex — and have done several since .
A list of subcontractors on the job , obtained by the Voice , includes many with Palin ties .
One was Spenard Builders Supply , the state ’s leading supplier of wood , floor , roof , and other “ pre-engineered components . ”
In addition to being a sponsor of Todd Palin ’s snow - machine team that has earned tens of thousands for the Palin family , Spenard hired Sarah Palin to do a statewide television commercial in 2004 .
When the Palins began building a new family home off Lake Lucille in 2002 — at the same time that Palin was running for lieutenant governor and in her final months as mayor — Spenard supplied the materials , according to Antoine Bricks , who works in its Wasilla office .
Spenard actually filed a notice “ of its right to assert a lien ” on the deed for the Palin property after contracting for labor and materials for the site .
Spenard ’s name has popped up in the trial of Senator Stevens — it worked on the house that is at the center of the VECO scandal as well .

Last week , Maureen Lipman admitted that in the 1960s she took LSD and cannabis .
Well , would you believe it ?
Maureen Lipman !
The 1960s !
Taking drugs !
An actress taking drugs in the 1960s !
I 've never heard of such a thing !
What 's the next headline - grabbing revelation going to be ?
David Tennant wore flares as a child ?
John Sergeant once threw up during his student days ?
Keith Chegwin took two bottles into the shower ?
Lipman 's admission ( to be broadcast in a documentary series starting tomorrow night on Five ) may have created a new unit of measurement - a Maureen - for the smallest , most unremarkable piece of news it is possible to record : it 's about a tenth of a celebrity divorce or half a failed traffic - calming measure .
Lipman's is just another tiny voice in a titanic chorus of prominent people saying that they dabbled with drugs , did n't really like it and moved on .
Could n't we just assume that they 'd all had a go unless they specified otherwise ?
After all , in 2000 , when loads of the shadow cabinet were coming out as having smoked cannabis , the only thing I found memorable was Ann Widdecombe saying she had n't .
The nation 's dealers must have been rubbing their hands :
Ann Widdecombe , the face that launched a thousand shipments .
If she cared about our nation 's youth , she 'd have kept quiet .
But the fact that everyone from Helen Mirren to Francis Maude has had a druggy phase presents a problem for anti-drugs campaigns - because most of these people are clearly fine .
They did n't go through ' drugs hell ' and they did n't die .
They had a go , it did n't take for whatever reason and then they went off and were successful .
' By all means , try it but you probably wo n't like it ' is n't quite the message that government agencies want to put out .
Unfortunately , those who tried it , loved it and were destroyed by it do n't seem to get interviewed on chat shows very often .
Time for my own drugs admission : part one , I smoked cannabis a few times at university .
I treasure the idea that anyone is scandalised by that .
They 've got a life - full of shocks coming if they are , because I am a very timorous , conventional , largely law - abiding man and , if I 've smoked marijuana , then almost everyone else of my generation must have done if they 've got a mouth .
That 's certainly a bad thing - we'd all be either better or no worse off if we had n't - but if anyone 's still lumping pot-smoking in with dirty needles then they 're living in an episode of Quincy .
It 's more something a married couple of solicitors might do in their garden ( not indoors - it makes the curtains smell ) while they discuss moving to be near a good school .
( Public Service Announcement : I 'm talking about normal cannabis here rather than skunk which , I 'm reliably informed , both is , and can get you into , serious shit . )
Part two of my drugs admission is even more shaming : I have never been offered cocaine .
And that 's not just hurtful , it 's annoying .
I long ago decided , you see , that I would refuse .
I already drink too much , so why would I risk adopting another harmful habit ?
If I tried cocaine , the worst outcome would be that I liked it and the best that I did n't .
When not liking something is the most you can hope for from consuming it , that 's a good reason to abstain .
Do you like my logic ?
I was pleased with it and looked forward to delivering it to the twat I imagined offering me a ' line ' ( I lack the confidence to type that without inverted commas ) at a party .
But not once have I been given the chance !
Clearly , I come across as too square even to be worth attempting to corrupt .
I 'm just not cool .
' Cool ' is the key to all this .
That 's why the celebs are happy to make their admissions .
They 're boasting that they were the kind of people who were cool enough to be approached , to get involved , to try stuff .
They were creative and experimental and dangerously unwise and there 's no one alive who , at some point , did n't want to seem like that .
Except maybe Ann Widdecombe .
This is also the problem with anti-smoking campaigns .
They persist in trying to persuade kids that smoking is n't cool .
Come off it .
Look at Sean Connery as James Bond or Béatrice Dalle in Betty Blue .
We 're trying to stop millions of young people from doing something that may kill them and we kick off with a demonstrable lie .
Smoking is cool .
Addiction is n't ( people huddling outside offices in the rain do n't look cool so much as cold ) and cancer certainly is n't , but smoking when isolated from these things obviously is .
No , there 's a harder but ultimately more persuasive message we need to find some way to convey : being cool does n't really matter .
We should n't let ' cool ' become a direct synonym of ' good ' .
The problem is that to the marketing and advertising companies this is heresy .
Invoking ' cool ' is how you make people do things they otherwise would n't : buy electric shavers that jizz moisturiser , endlessly drink mini-yogurts , douse themselves in a smell Kate Moss has reportedly made .
Cool is why they 're smoking , so it must be why they 'll stop .
We 'll never stop the young from wanting to be cool and it's worth promoting uncarcinogenic ways they can do this .
But we might as well spend some time trying to undermine being cool as an aim , rather than pretending we know better than them what constitutes it .
It irritates me when teenagers in bad dramas or adverts say things such as : ' Your mum 's cool ' to mean : ' I like your mum . '
The correct response should be : ' No , my mum is not cool - she does n't wear sunglasses indoors or weird clothes .
She is a middle - aged woman who is nice and good and wise and worrying about what 's cool is beneath her . '
Unfortunately the reply to this would inevitably be : ' Cool ! '
Student indicted after scare at Elmhurst College
A DuPage County grand jury indicted a Muslim student at Elmhurst College on suspicion she lied when reporting a masked gunman assaulted her on campus , hours after she spoke at a diversity rally urging tolerance .
Safia Z. Jilani , 19 , of Oak Brook is expected to plead not guilty Monday when arraigned on a felony charge of filing a false police report .
If convicted , she faces a possible sentence of probation or up to three years in prison .
Prosecutors said Jilani told police her assailant beat her with a pistol about 8:30 p.m. Oct. 9 after she entered a washroom in the Schaible Science Center , where the masked man had scribbled racial slurs on the walls .
One week earlier , she reported finding anti-Muslim slogans and a swastika written inside of her locker .
She said the incident prompted her to speak at the Oct.
9 diversity rally , where she read a poem advocating peace and understanding despite the actions against her .
Police investigated both reports as a hate crime , which caused a stir on campus , but they ended up arresting Jilani one week later after accusing her of making up both allegations to garner attention .
A grand jury indicted Jilani Thursday , according to court records released Friday .
She is free on bond pending Monday 's arraignment before DuPage Circuit Judge Kathryn Creswell in Wheaton .

It 's generally never a good idea to try and outrun the the local constabulary , but that would be particularly true if you happen to be in Italy within the jurisdiction of Prefect Antonio Manganelli .
Manganelli heads up the Italian State Police and he just took delivery of the latest police package special from the crew at Lamborghini .
This time around the Bolognese automaker added the decals and lights to its new Gallardo LP560 - 4 .
Somehow the Lamborghini techs have managed to integrate all the gear that modern police officers regularly use into their diminutive supercar .
The car is equipped with a video recording system so officers can record evidence and provide entertainment for the boys in blue back at the station by transmitting it wirelessly in real time .
The usual array of gun racks and radio equipment is also supplemented by a cooler in the front compartment that can be used to transport separated body parts to the local emergency room , or that finger you just shot off a " potential " suspect .
The Rome police have been using a Gallardo cruiser for the last five years and accumulated 87,000 apparently problem - free miles while the Bologna police have racked up 62,000 miles in another example .

24/10/2008 Lamborghini donates the new " Gallardo LP560 - 4 Polizia " to the Italian State Police
A private ceremony was held today at the Viminale Palace where Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. donated a police version of the company 's newest super sports car , Gallardo LP560 - 4 Polizia , to the head of the Italian State Police , Prefect Antonio Manganelli .
The new Gallardo LP560 - 4 Polizia , which replaces the previous Gallardo in use by the Italian police force since 2004 has a 560 horsepower engine that can reach speeds of up to 203 mph .
The car will begin service with the Lazio Highway Police Department in order to continue accident and crime prevention to sustain security on the Italian roads .
Proof of outstanding reliability
Its predecessor is proof of Lamborghini 's outstanding product quality .
Since 2004 , Rome 's police force has had the first - generation Gallardo in regular police service .
The sports car has clocked nearly 87,000 miles of patrol duty on the motorways of central and southern Italy , as well as on emergency medical transport detail .
A second Gallardo , painted in blue and white police colors , has been in service around Bologna , Italy since 2005 .
Its odometer already shows more than 62,000 miles .
Aside from regular servicing , neither of the super sports cars has required major repairs .
In addition to the clearly effective deterrent offered by the presence and visibility of a Lamborghini on the highway , the technological equipment on board these vehicles makes them highly effective in the control of hazardous behaviour on the roads ( high speeds , driving in the emergency lane , dangerous over - taking ) ; the automatic recognition of number plate tracking and real - time transmission of images to the control rooms .
High - tech video system with real - time retrieval
The cabin of the super sports car is fitted with the latest advancements in police technology to immediately document the evidence of any transgression .
The video system is positioned in the center of the cabin with a camera fitted next to the rear view mirror and a computer and recording equipment behind the seats .
As soon as police officers discover a suspicious driver , they activate the " Proof Video Data System . "
With the help of GPS data , the device can calculate the location , direction of movement and speed of the Lamborghini .
This combined with the distance and time before intercept , accurately determines the speed of the vehicle being pursued .
Using radio data transmission , the video system in the Gallardo Polizia transfers its images in real time to the relevant police station .
There , the videos are stored and used for automatic number plate retrieval .
This information can be used for immediate identification of stolen vehicles .
The " classic " array of police equipment on board too
In addition to its high tech equipment , the Gallardo is also fitted with the " classic " array of police equipment , such as a gun holster , police radio equipment and the " Paletta , " the traditional hand - held stop sign used to advise motorists and traffic offenders to pull over .
Officers can then use a removable screen to show offenders their misdeeds immediately , complete with an overlay of all the associated data .
Rapid response in medical emergencies
The Lamborghini is used regularly for urgent medical transportation too .
The luggage compartment in the front of the vehicle is equipped with a specialized refrigeration system for safe transportation of donor organs .
For extreme emergencies , there is also a defibrillator used to restore a normal heart rhythm to patients by delivering an electrical shock to the heart to stop massive cardiac arrhythmia or ventricular fibrillation , and thus save lives .
Officer training
The 30 police officers permitted to drive the Gallardo Polizia receive special training in the use of the Gallardo 's medical equipment .
Each person on the special operations team – which includes three women – has undertaken several days of driver training with Lamborghini , under the leadership of the Lamborghini test drivers .
The basis of trouble - free everyday operation is the exceptional safety of the Gallardo LP560 - 4 with its permanent all - wheel drive and its refined chassis , which maintains stability even at the highest speeds .
Lamborghini 's extremely high standards for product quality and reliability ensure that the Gallardo LP560 - 4 Polizia is always ready for duty .
Even the blue light is designed for speed
Now the successor is ready – a new generation Gallardo LP560 - 4 with the very latest in special equipment .
The Lamborghini wears its uniform with pride , painted in accordance with requirements in " blu Polizia " – whereby the white stripes and lettering follow the Gallardo 's dynamic design angles .
Its main patrol beat will once again be central and southern Italy , primarily on the motorway between Salerno and Reggio Calabria .
The police beacon on the roof of the Gallardo had to be aerodynamically optimized being that the new police car reaches a considerably higher top speed than regular service vehicles ..
Despite the extremely flat construction of the signal lighting , blue LEDs are fitted round the base to ensure the visual signal cannot be missed .
The roof - mounted lighting is supported by further blue LED signals on the front , sides and rear of the light 's aluminium shell .
A total of four sirens integrated into the front and rear of the Gallardo generate unmistakable audible warning signals .
On duty even in New York
Just like its predecessor , the new Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 - 4 Polizia is destined to be not only the fastest , but also the most famous police car – even beyond Italian borders .
The Italian State Police uniform , and the unquestionable attraction of the Lamborghini brand , continue to arouse curiosity and interest .
Thousands of citizens have the possibility to see the car for themselves during the many events organized to promote the vehicles in use .
Alongside its daily operational duties , the Gallardo also has regular public appearance obligations , such as its role as parade leader every year in Rome 's traditional " Festa di Polizia , " or its escort responsibilities at events with historical vehicles , like the Targa Florio and the Milan – San Remo Rally .
Its predecessor even represented the Italian police in New York City at the 2005 " Columbus Day " parade .
The cellphone system access fee may be heading toward extinction with reports that Rogers Communications Inc. is relaunching its Fido discount brand without the hated charge .
The Toronto - based company will relaunch Fido on Tuesday , according to the National Post , with new plans and a new logo .
Rogers will also scrap the $ 6.95 monthly system access fee on postpaid customers .
Prepaid Rogers and Fido customers already do not pay the fee .
Liz Hamilton , a spokesperson for Rogers , declined to comment .
" We do n't predict future pricing either on specific plans or rate cards , " she said .
Industry observers said the company 's move is likely to spell the end of the system access fee , which is thoroughly hated by consumers .
" It 's the No. 1 complaint about cellphones , " said John Lawford , counsel for the Public Interest Advocacy Centre .
" People are getting a little more traction with their pushback in a lot of telecom issues now . …
We just might see the end of it .
We 'll see them slowly disappear . "
Lawford warned , however , that the removal of the fee may not necessarily translate into lower monthly bills .
At the very least , he said , the bills will be more transparent and easier to understand .
" If their bill is n't split into a thousand pieces , people will be able to see that , " he said .
The relaunch would be an effort to head off increased competition from new cellphone providers that are starting up across Canada next year .
Toronto - based Globalive Communications Inc. , which operates long - distance and internet provider Yak , has announced it will launch a network across the country except in Quebec , in the second half of 2009 .
Montreal - based Quebecor Inc. has also announced it will launch a network servicing Quebec through its Vidéotron subsidiary within 12 to 18 months .
Another newcomer — BMV
Holdings , a firm backed by several high - profile investors — last week said it will roll out service next year to Ontario and Quebec .
Halifax - based Bragg Communications Inc. , which operates cable provider Eastlink , is also expected to announce its own cellphone network in a few weeks .
Toronto entrepreneur John Bitove may also launch service in major Canadian cities through his company Data & Audio - Visual Enterprises .
All of the newcomers won spectrum during the government 's auction of airwaves this summer .
All are expected to offer lower - cost services than Canada 's existing three national players , Rogers , Bell Canada Inc. and Telus Corp. , and none will charge customers a system access fee .
BMV , for example , last week said it will offer unlimited talk and text service for $ 40 a month with no additional fees .
The market is set to go from what the government last year deemed uncompetitive to crowded next year , and existing providers are being forced to lower prices and make services more transparent to prevent an exodus of customers when the newcomers launch .
Telus scrapped fee with Koodo
Vancouver - based Telus was the first major provider to scrap the system access fee for postpaid customers when it launched its discount brand Koodo in March .
The company still charges the $ 6.95 fee to its own Telus - branded postpaid customers , as does Rogers with its core offering .
Bell charges all of its customers system access fees on its core and Solo discount brands , ranging from $ 3.95 for prepaid service to $ 8.95 on some postpaid plans .
Julie Smithers , a spokesperson for the company , would not comment on whether the company had any plans to drop its fees .
" We 'll always be competitive in our markets , " she said .
" But we do n't comment on future plans . "
The Montreal - based company on Monday announced it would allow customers to carry over unused minutes from one month to the next , although the feature is only available to customers who sign a three - year contract before the end of the year .
A number of smaller airtime resellers , including Virgin Mobile and President 's Choice , also do not charge a system access fee .
Canada 's existing cellphone companies — Rogers , Bell and Telus , as well as MTS Allstream and SaskTel — are currently embroiled in a class - action lawsuit over system access fees .
Regina - based lawyer Tony Merchant claims the companies have misrepresented the charges as government - mandated fees for years and is seeking a repayment of nearly $ 20 billion .
Merchant 's lawsuit was certified as a class action last year and is still before the courts .
The fee began as a government licensing charge in the 1980s to cellphone providers for using public airwaves .
In 1986 , the government transferred the collection of the fee to cellphone providers , who were to incorporate them into their monthly charges .
Instead , the carriers opted to keep them separate .
The cellphone companies say the charges , which no other carriers in the world break out separately , are for ongoing maintenance and investment in their networks .
Merchant also this summer launched another class - action against the cellphone companies for their 911 fees .
The companies are required to collect this fee by Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , but the mandated rate is a maximum of 11.5 cents per month .
The carriers , which are charging 95 cents , are therefore profiting from a government - mandated charge , Merchant says .

Israel gave serious thought this spring to launching a military strike on Iran 's nuclear sites but was told by President George W Bush that he would not support it and did not expect to revise that view for the rest of his presidency , senior European diplomatic sources have told the Guardian .
The then prime minister , Ehud Olmert , used the occasion of Bush 's trip to Israel for the 60th anniversary of the state 's founding to raise the issue in a one - on - one meeting on May 14 , the sources said .
" He took it [ the refusal of a US green light ] as where they were at the moment , and that the US position was unlikely to change as long as Bush was in office " , they added .
The sources work for a European head of government who met the Israeli leader some time after the Bush visit .
Their talks were so sensitive that no note - takers attended , but the European leader subsequently divulged to his officials the highly sensitive contents of what Olmert had told him of Bush 's position .
Bush 's decision to refuse to offer any support for a strike on Iran appeared to be based on two factors , the sources said .
One was US concern over Iran 's likely retaliation , which would probably include a wave of attacks on US military and other personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as on shipping in the Persian Gulf .
The other was US anxiety that Israel would not succeed in disabling Iran 's nuclear facilities in a single assault even with the use of dozens of aircraft .
It could not mount a series of attacks over several days without risking full - scale war .
So the benefits would not outweigh the costs .
Iran has repeatedly said it would react with force to any attack .
Some western government analysts believe this could include asking Lebanon 's Shia movement Hizbollah to strike at the US .
" It 's over ten years since Hizbollah 's last terror strike outside Israel , when it hit an Argentine - Israel association building in Buenos Aires [ killing 85 people ] " , said one official .
" There is a large Lebanese diaspora in Canada which must include some Hizbollah supporters .
They could slip into the United States and take action " .
Even if Israel were to launch an attack on Iran without US approval its planes could not reach their targets without the US becoming aware of their flightpath and having time to ask them to abandon their mission .
" The shortest route to Natanz lies across Iraq and the US has total control of Iraqi airspace " , the official said .
Natanz , about 100 miles north of Isfahan , is the site of an uranium enrichment plant .
In this context Iran would be bound to assume Bush had approved it , even if the White House denied fore - knowledge , raising the prospect of an attack against the US .
Several high - level Israeli officials have hinted over the last two years that Israel might strike Iran 's nuclear facilities to prevent them being developed to provide sufficient weapons - grade uranium to make a nuclear bomb .
Iran has always denied having such plans .
Olmert himself raised the possibility of an attack at a press conference during a visit to London last November , when he said sanctions were not enough to block Iran 's nuclear programme .
" Economic sanctions are effective .
They have an important impact already , but they are not sufficient .
So there should be more .
Up to where ?
Up until Iran will stop its nuclear programme , " he said .
The revelation that Olmert was not merely sabre - rattling to try to frighten Iran but considered the option seriously enough to discuss it with Bush shows how concerned Israeli officials had become .
Bush 's refusal to support an attack , and the strong suggestion he would not change his mind , is likely to end speculation that Washington might be preparing an " October surprise " before the US presidential election .
Some analysts have argued that Bush would back an Israeli attack in an effort to help John McCain 's campaign by creating an eve- of - poll security crisis .
Others have said that in the case of an Obama victory , the vice - president , Dick Cheney , the main White House hawk , would want to cripple Iran 's nuclear programme in the dying weeks of Bush 's term .
During Saddam Hussein's rule in 1981 , Israeli aircraft successfully destroyed Iraq 's nuclear reactor at Osirak shortly before it was due to start operating .
Last September they knocked out a buildings complex in northern Syria , which US officials later said had been a partly constructed nuclear reactor based on a North Korean design .
Syria said the building was a military complex but had no links to a nuclear programme .
In contrast , Iran 's nuclear facilities , which are officially described as intended only for civilian purposes , are dispersed around the country and some are in fortified bunkers underground .
In public , Bush gave no hint of his view that the military option had to be excluded .
In a speech to the Knesset the following day he confined himself to telling Israel 's parliament : " America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran 's nuclear weapons ambitions .
Permitting the world 's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world 's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations .
For the sake of peace , the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . ''
Mark Regev , Olmert 's spokesman , tonight reacted to the Guardian 's story saying : " The need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is raised at every meeting between the prime minister and foreign leaders .
Israel prefers a diplomatic solution to this issue but all options must remain on the table .
Your unnamed European source attributed words to the prime minister that were not spoken in any working meeting with foreign guests " .
Three weeks after Bush 's red light , on June 2 , Israel mounted a massive air exercise covering several hundred miles in the eastern Mediterranean .
It involved dozens of warplanes , including F - 15s , F - 16s and aerial refueling tankers .
The size and scope of the exercise ensured that the US and other nations in the region saw it , said a US official , who estimated the distance was about the same as from Israel to Natanz .
A few days later , Israel 's deputy prime minister , Shaul Mofaz , told the paper Yediot Ahronot : " If Iran continues its programme to develop nuclear weapons , we will attack it .
The window of opportunity has closed .
The sanctions are not effective .
There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear programme . "
The exercise and Mofaz 's comments may have been designed to boost the Israeli government and military 's own morale as well , perhaps , to persuade Bush to reconsider his veto .
Last week Mofaz narrowly lost a primary within the ruling Kadima party to become Israel 's next prime minister .
Tzipi Livni , who won the contest , takes a less hawkish position .
The US announced two weeks ago that it would sell Israel 1,000 bunker - busting bombs .
The move was interpreted by some analysts as a consolation prize for Israel after Bush told Olmert of his opposition to an attack on Iran .
But it could also enhance Israel 's attack options in case the next US president revives the military option .
The guided bomb unit -39 ( GBU - 39 ) has a penetration capacity equivalent to a one - tonne bomb .
Israel already has some bunker - busters .
When was the first time you ran into functional programming ?
For me it was a fairly confusing introduction sometime in my junior or senior year of college .
When you pick up a new approach to solving problems -- or when you pick up a new programming language -- you usually isolate new concepts and play with them one at a time .
Getting started with functional programming can be difficult because you almost always end up learning a new language ( Haskell , Scheme , Erlang ) and new techniques simultaniously .
In the past two weeks I 've written work - related code in Java , Python , JavaScript , PHP , Objective - C and Perl .
The take home message here is n't that I know a lot of languages ( because it is n't really the case , half of those languages I can't use without half a dozen references open ) , but that I can still be productive in them despite only having a passing knowledge of the syntax and standard libraries .
If you understand the fundamental problems you 're dealing with , then superimposing a new syntax on top is n't going to be prohibitively hard .
On the other hand , when you do n't understand the underlying problem ( because you forfeited initiative to that friendly library that abstracted the details away , or because your language of choice shields you from the concept like an ORM letting you bypass learning SQL or Erlang letting you place semaphore strictly in the " I do n't give a damn " corner of your mind ) , then you 're going to lock yourself into languages or platforms .
Now you might be waiting for me to follow up this brilliant observation with a reassuring soundbyte like learn lots of languages to be a great programmer !
But that is n't the answer either .
The problem with focusing on learning languages is that it encourages relearning the same material over and over in slightly different guises .
Sure , it 's important to be able to translate
x = { " a " : 1 , " b " : 2 } x [ " c " ] = 10 del x [ " b " ] for key in x : val = x [ key ] print " %s => %s " % ( key , value )
into
my %x = ( ' a ' => 1 , ' b ' => 2 ) ; %x -> { ' c ' } = 10 ; delete $ x { ' b ' } ; for my $ key ( keys ( %x ) ) { my $ value = %x -> { $ key } ; print " $key => $ value
" ; }
but being able to write both versions does n't mean you can tell the difference between a linked list and a hashmap .
And you sure as hell did n't learn anything fundamentally new when you learned to write del x [ " b " ] as delete $ x { 'b'} ; .
It 's easy to get caught up in the language learning cycle for the same reason that people rush to recreate web servers in each new programming language that is thrown together : these are fun , interesting and moderately challenging problems that give us the high of doing something new without the potential downer of running into a genuinely difficult problem .
We 're intoxicated with that brand new feeling , even when we 're actually crawling backwards .
Instead of the language learning cycle or the library translation circuit , we need to follow a third path straight down the middle : use whatever language you want to , but dig into internals and really grok the libraries and language features that you rely upon .
It 's by understanding underlying concepts that we improve as programmers , instead of as Java programmers , .NET programmers or Pythonistas .
I think a great example of this has been the backporting of the functional programming style from Scheme and Haskell to multi-paradigmn languages like Python and Ruby and -- in some fairly awkward attempts -- even imperative languages like Java and C.
Instead of being caught up with Haskell or Erlang as the solution to programming problems , the programmers took the great ideas embodied in them and started applying them in other programming languages as well .
How to react to this idea of stepping back to the basics is a bit ambiguous .
I 'm saying people should n't keep reimplementing the same pieces of code , but I 'm also saying we should get back to the basics and work our way up to the top by starting at the very bottom .
How do we reconcile these two ideas ?
I think we should maintain two different genres of projects , with a different approach for each kind :
Small personal projects that help us learn by recreating and reimplementing the core ideas of programming and computer science .
This is where you should be creating your own servers , writing your own compilers , implementing A * and writing a graphics package .
Approach these projects like they are sketches , because that is exactly what they are .
Do n't worry so much about making things perfect , just enjoy experimenting and playing around with the ideas .
Contribute to exciting and non-redundant projects that are focused on creating new things or are taking a new approach to an existing field .
It 's hard to pin a definition on non-redundant , but I think an appropriate way to think about it is something that addresses an unaddressed need .
I definitely agree that we 're better off having Nginx , Apache and Mongrel , but it 's less clear that having both Nginx and Lighttpd are fulfilling different needs .
Now that we have all these options , do we need even more C based servers with an emphasis on simplicity ?
Maybe -- I do n't want to champion stagnation -- but I think there needs to be a clear argument for what unaddressed need a new lightweight C server would meet before spending years of developer time making Lightginx 0.1 .
I have a fairly romantic image of programmers as professionals , and that we have an obligation to keep getting better at what we 're doing , and that we also have an oblgiation to build things worth building .
I think that maintaining a healthy stable of small conceptual projects and larger complex projects that provide solutions to unsolved problems is the way to fulfill both obligations .
For me personally , that means doing a better job of contributing to existing projects , and less writing things from scratch .
It 's a somewhat bitter pill , but I think swallowing it is for the best for all of us .
Image by Simon Davison via FlickrBeing a geek is both time - consuming and expensive , and being a gamer - geek even more so .
Sadly , with our economy in perpetual shambles , the latter seems to have become an even more difficult issue than the former .
So how ’s a gamer supposed to afford new titles as well as incidentals like , y’know , food ?
Subscription - based rental services like GameFly can alleviate both the sting of current generation game prices and the hassle of driving to your local retailer to stand in line with the rest of the yahoos , but this comes at a cost .
That cost , of course , is the lack of personal ownership .
The disc is n’t yours ; it ’s merely in your possession .
While renting is a fiscally responsible move , it goes against that innate nerdy urge to procure , to collect .
But for those of us who are unable to resist that damnable desire to acquire there is a solution .
To paraphrase Ash Williams , one merely needs to shop smart .
Stay Informed :
The first step to properly budgeting your meager gamer dollar is simple ; do a little research .
Familiarize yourself with release dates and prioritize .
This is especially important during the inevitable rush of top - shelf titles that flood the market in the fall and early winter months .
Sure , we all want Little Big Planet , Fable II , Gears of War 2 , Castlevania : Order of Ecclesia , Dead Space , and Animal Crossing : City Folk , but the fact that their release dates are so closely clustered means that we probably can’t snag them all on launch day .
So pick your pony .
Remember that with the rare exception of titles that are somehow perpetually out of stock ( and thus subject to eBay price gauging ) and a few first party exclusives that manage to retain their value far into their lifespan , game prices generally drop after several months on - shelf .
So pick up your must - have titles now , and do n’t be afraid to wait a while on your second - tier choices .
Read Reviews :
Another way to ensure that you ’re getting the most bang for your buck is to keep a keen eye on game reviews .
Remember , it ’s the uninformed consumer who propagates the steady flow of shovelware to systems like our beloved Nintendo Wii by making indiscriminant purchases .
Of course it is important to note that reviews are , by their very nature , fairly subjective , so sites like Metacritic that compile multiple reviews for easy digestion are quite helpful .
Also keep in mind that the score is not always the sum total of a videogame review .
As time permits , read ( or at least skim ) through the reviews themselves , and look for common themes and complaints .
If multiple reviewers call a title to task for poor enemy AI or sloppy level design , chances are there ’s a notable problem .
Embrace the Demo :
The best barometer by which to gauge a game ’s true appeal is actually trying it yourself .
Whether at a game kiosk at a local retailer or via downloadable demo , taking a title for a test drive on your own terms is a great place to start .
Xbox LIVE Marketplace and the Playstation Network Store offer scores of free demos for practically every game imaginable , and , while Nintendo does n’t generally make Wii demos available , their new Nintendo Channel does afford you the opportunity to download demos of some DS titles using your console .
Take a game for a spin .
Kick the tires .
Smell the tiny pine tree dangling from the rearview .
Then make the call .
A demo should feature a game ’s strengths , and , should you find yourself yawning through this virtual highlight reel , chances are the title ’s not for you .
Do n’t Be Afraid to Trade - In or Buy Used :
The game industry abhors the buying and selling of used games , and with good reason .
While Activision did n’t see a dime in additional revenue from that used copy of Guitar Hero III you scored , GameStop made a killing by essentially selling the same game twice .
( It ’s been estimated that EB / Gamestop makes about 31 cents on the dollar on new software sales , as opposed to nearly 50 cents on the dollar on the sale of used games . )
Sure , chances are you ’re getting hosed on the trade - in price , but a couple of extra bucks in - hand is a bit more functional than an entertainment center full of games you ’re never going to play again .
The same can be said for buying used games ; that five or six dollar premium you pay for a new game over a used copy might not seem like much , but every little bit helps .
Harness the Power of Gaming Communities :
In addition to chain stores and local independent retailers , you can also trade games via online communities like Goozex .
This example uses a point system to quantify the value of titles that you trade , and said points can be used to " buy " games from other users .
They typically charge a nominal fee for the privilege of using their trade matching system , but , assuming you ’re using a reputable service , it ’s a small price to pay for a fair trade .
Community sites can be used not only for trading , but also to find great deals at online and brick - and - mortar retailers .
The most obvious example of this is Cheap Ass Gamer , a robust and interminably active BBS - based community that ’s users are quick to point out gamer - centric Gold Box deals at Amazon , special trade - in promotions at EB / Gamestop , universal price drops , previews of Sunday ad circulars , and discount deals at big box stores .
In the continuing struggle to stretch your gaming dollar , a site like CAG is your WMD : not necessarily elegant , but deadly effective .
“ I had all these stacks of papers at the closing , ” she told me , “ and they were just passing papers back and forth to me , back and forth , telling me to sign .
And I kept saying , ‘ Wait a minute .
Wait a minute . ’ ”
She was assured that nothing untoward was going on .
Ms. Richardson did not have a fixed - rate mortgage .
Her monthly payment rose , and rose again , eventually passing $ 800 , which she could not pay .
There was also a balloon payment provision hidden in the welter of documents , along with other obligations that would not emerge until Ms. Richardson was waist - high in economic quicksand .
Ms. McNulty , the lawyer , is trying to forestall the foreclosure , while at the same time trying to locate those who , in her view , defrauded her client .
Her attempt to hold anyone accountable has been maddeningly difficult .
As she explained , the original deal “ was securitized into one of these now infamous trusts . ”
The distress calls from despondent men and women who believed until very recently that they were living the American dream are coming from all over the country .
Tova Navarra of Atlantic Highlands , N.J. , was waylaid by illness .
“ I will end up bankrupt , disabled and bereft of a career , ” she told me .
“ I ’m wondering if this will become a bankrupt society . ”
After a series of medical setbacks forced her to stop working , Ms. Navarra , 60 , watched her standard of living deteriorate step by agonizing step to the point where she was forced to leave her condominium and move into a senior citizens ’ residence that she currently cannot afford .
The condo is in foreclosure , and she is staring at a future with no upside .
“ The first time you realize that you ca n’t pay the mortgage  that ’s the beginning of a very keen panic , ” said Ms. Navarra .
“ The medical bills pile up and that ’s when people start deliberately skipping doses to try to make the medicine stretch out a little more .
“ You find yourself gradually climbing down the economic ladder , and you start thinking , ‘ How am I going to survive , and where am I going to go ? ’
I said to myself , ‘ Oh , my God .
I ’m going to end up sleeping in my car . ’ ”
Real people .
Real suffering .
We may be fascinated by Wall Street , and bogus yarns like Joe the Plumber ’s .
But the real story in this country right now is the increasingly dire plight of those heading toward the bottom of that ladder that Ms. Navarra was talking about .
Is it out of your system yet ?
While all of this in - fighting , blaming , exempting , and naive attacks of reverse - discrimination ( a chortle - inducing term if there ever was one ) has been fun , let 's get down to brass tacks , folks .
SFist is putting out a call for and sites and / or organizations doing any of the following constructive things to help overturn gender and queer discrimination in the state of California .

Providing legal support -- to block prop 8 , or to protect gay couples , or to promote other equality - themed legislation
Organizing lists of volunteers / voters who are passionate about the cause
Providing volunteers / voters with training / instruction for doing outreach of their own
Conducting research / focus groups to find out exactly what our opportunities / obstacles are , and where our efforts are having the greatest impact

Please .

The pound has continued to fall against the dollar , hitting its lowest rate in six and a half years against the US currency on fears of a deep recession .
It follows comments from the Bank of England on Wednesday that the UK economy had worsened and that it would cut interest rates again if necessary .
Sterling fell to $ 1.467 - its weakest level since 2002 .
The pound has lost more than a quarter of its value against the dollar since July , when it was worth more than $ 2 .
POUND STERLING v UNITED STATES DOLLAR : 13 November 2008
* All Times GMT
The pound also hit a new low of 85 pence per euro .
Measured against a basket of currencies of the UK's main trading partners , sterling is at its weakest levels since 1996 .
Last week , the Bank of England delivered a shock one - and - a - half percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 3 % , the lowest level since 1955 .
Lower interest rates typically make the pound less attractive to overseas investors .

Of course , excessive loyalty to the local , and the resulting lack of mobility , has a significant and negative impact on access to education , services , and job opportunities .
In the words of one interviewee from Glasgow :
If your horizons are limited to three streets , what is the point of you working really hard at school ?
What is the point of passing subjects that will allow you to go to college or university if you cannot travel beyond these streets ?
What ’s the point of dreaming about being an artist , a doctor , etc. , if you can not get on a bus to get out of the area in which you live ?
The report points out an interesting irony here : current policies in urban regeneration are dominated by strategies to increase “ place attachment ” as a means “ to reinforce social networks and maintain the quality of an area through pride . ”
However , the areas that actually generate such loyalties are , in the authors ’ words “ often ones that have little that conventionally invokes pride . ”
It was difficult to say which was more depressing – the relentless defense of a featureless piece of open space on the fringes of a Glasgow housing scheme where there is nothing whatsoever by way of amenities , or the confinement to a socially isolated but densely populated and built - up quarter - square - mile of London of young men for whom the culture and wealth of one of the world ’s great cities might as well be on another continent .
The report goes on to identify 244 anti-territorial projects ( ATPs ) currently in progress across the UK .
Most use sports or other “ hook ” activities to encourage association and to teach networking skills .
Disappointingly , none tackle the issue in terms of the design of physical space .
So what does the anti-territorial city look like ?
Some things to consider : unsurprisingly , the report found that most conflicts “ occurred on boundaries between residential areas , which were typically defined by roads , railways , vacant land or other physical features . ”
The city center also becomes a venue for bigger showdowns : a youth worker in Peterborough explains that “ the flashpoints are in the city center , the ‘ big stage , ’ the one place they all , you know , congregate on a Saturday . ”
Finally , the researchers found that micro-territorialization took place across the spectrum of low - income housing stock , from “ high - density , flatted , inner-city estates ; traditional , pre-1914 areas of terraced housing ; and suburban , often council - built environments . ”
As the authors rightly point out , lack of jobs and economic hardship are key structural forces contributing to “ problematic territoriality . ”
But what role does urban planning , landscape design and the built environment have to play ?
Can the design of the city itself generate – or mitigate against – territoriality ?
( Note : Read the Guardian 's take on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report here and here ) .
Another question for the topic of whether or not a “ dense assortment of buildings ” can ever be a real city :
What is London for an eighteen - year old whose entire urban experience is confined to 200 - square meters and who has never seen the Thames ?
Researchers at the University of Glasgow , sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation , have spent the past two years asking young residents of Bradford , Peterborough , London , Glasgow , Sunderland , and Bristol to draw maps of their own individual urban experience in order to exploreas both a cause and a symptom of social exclusion .

Their research uncovered Bristol ’s “ postcode wars , ” where gangs spray - paint their postcode in rival areas as a form of aggression , as well as descriptions of the maneuvers involved in going to school in one part of Bradford that match the Schlieffen Plan in strategic complexity .
“ In some places , ” they note with reference to Glasgow and Sunderland , “ territoriality was a leisure activity , a form of ‘ recreational violence . ’”
In other words , bored and economically deprived teenagers are transforming 1960s council estates and Victorian terraces into a real - world , multiplayer World of Warcraft
Of course , excessive loyalty to the local , and the resulting lack of mobility , has a significant and negative impact on access to education , services , and job opportunities .

There are two kinds of Linux people in the world , those that will help people fix their Windows spyware problems , and those that will not .
I land squarely in the former camp , and I think that it 's important for us all to consider doing the same .
First , I have to clarify what I mean by , " Linux Person " -- because there is a difference between a Linux user , and what I coin as a Linux Person .
Most people I consider " Linux People " are very well versed in technology .
They can usually fix any computer problem they 're presented , regardless of operating system , and have an inherent ability to logically solve computer problems in general .
We 're geeks .
We 're also knowledgeable enough to realize that Linux is a good thing on many levels .
We want Linux to be the operating system of choice , because it makes the most sense .
We understand the idea of Free software , and we also understand the advantages of free software ( beer vs speech thing ) .
As a group , however , we tend to stink the place up when it comes to evangelism .
How We Make People Hate Linux
By telling people how much their Windows computer sucks .
Instead of helping a Windows user fix their computer , brag about how Linux does n't have those problems .
By being smug .
Admit it .
You 've been smug .
By bragging about how awesome Linux is , and then when someone tries it , and has problems , accuse them of being dumb .
By pretending Linux has no shortcomings , and claiming other OSs are worthless .
Here 's the deal : Everyone knows Windows has problems .
Rubbing it in to Windows users wo n't make the like you ( or your OS ) any better .
The end result should be that people want to use Linux , not that they 're forced to use it because Windows breaks and no one will help them .
How to Make People Want Linux
Fix their spyware problem .
Share with them that spyware is one of the reasons you do n't use Windows .
Admit that using Linux has a learning curve , but it 's one that you think is worthwhile .
Show them Compiz .
Microsoft marketed an entire operating system on worthless visual thrills .
Compiz is free , and cooler .
Give them a LiveCD .
Offer to help them .
Follow through on the offer .
Remember Wubi , it 's an easy way to try Linux .
That 's it !
As with anything new , people will be resistant to change .
Make them curious , not offended .
Make them excited , not defensive .
In the end , Linux is all about choice .
I'm a computer user that can use Windows , OSX , Linux , Unix , etc , etc -- and I choose to use Linux as often as possible .
If we really want people to love Linux , we must give them the choice to use something else as well .

The limit of the Willing Suspension of Disbelief for a given element is directly proportional to its awesomeness .
Stated another way , all but the most pedantic of viewers will forgive liberties with reality as long as the result is wicked sweet or awesome .
This applies to the audience in general ; there will naturally be a different threshold for each individual .
Also known in some circles as a " rad herring " , in which something does n't make sense within the guidelines of the story 's reality , but it 's too cool not to include it .
The Rule of Cool is another principle that seeks to dispel arguments among fans over implausibility in fiction .
It has been cited by animation director Steve Loter ( of Kim Possible , Clerks : The Animated Series , Tarzan , and American Dragon : Jake Long ) in response to questions from fans attempting to justify temporary breaches in logical consistency .
It is a complement to Bellisario's Maxim and the MST3K Mantra .

Of scientific laws that this trope circumvents , the third law of motion is probably the most frequently revoked , with the Square - Cube Law probably a close second .
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is third and a mention has to go to the laws of relativity , which prevent us from attaining Faster - Than - Light Travel and going to a distant planet in just a few hours .
Note that you only get to invoke the Rule of Cool if the end product is , in fact , cool .
Note also that different opinions on what is " cool " create the most arguments over this .
The Rule of Cool is very subjective .
Failure to properly use this trope can cause collision damage with walls .
Since it 's subjective , it does n't have to be cool in the sense of " Grim reaper on a mountain playing an electric guitar " .
The protagonist might not use guns because it 's cooler to have them fight vampires with knives and stakes .
You might have Missing Parent Syndrome because it would be weird to have parents with you on a road trip across the country .
Basically , Rule of Cool works differently for whichever genre you 're writing for .

There are no instances of this trope being justified , nor can there be — after all , the entire point is that it 's about things that do n't make sense but we still gladly accept just because they 're cool .

Shauna Sand Stages ' Barbie Goes to the Pumpkin Patch ' ( Photos )
visited Mr. Bones Pumpkin Patch in West Hollywood yesterday .
Wait , she already took her three daughters and some heavily tattooed guy to the Halloween hyped patch two weeks ago .
Apparently that photo op did n't suit the Playboy model so she made a few changes .
This time around she arrived on the scene looking very much like a Barbie doll .
She and one of her daughters were dressed for a Kodak moment and she had a new and different boyfriend on her arm .
This time we 're told the fella is David Hansen .
Check out the photos from her first visit here .
Then compare them to the new pics in our photo gallery below .
We 're inclined to believe that the first outing was the real deal and from our vantage point , this new sighting looks like a carefully orchestrated media event .
It could have gone down something like this : " Hello .... this is Shauna Sand .
Just wanted to let you know we 'll be hitting the pumpkin patch in 30 minutes .
Will that work for you guys ?
Ok , good .
Bye . "

WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination with the enthusiastic support of the left wing of his party , fueled by his vehement opposition to the decision to invade Iraq and by one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate .
Now , his reported selections for two of the major positions in his cabinet  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and Timothy F. Geithner as secretary of the Treasury  suggest that Mr. Obama is planning to govern from the center - right of his party , surrounding himself with pragmatists rather than ideologues .
The choices are as revealing of the new president as they are of his appointees  and suggest that , from its first days , an Obama White House will brim with big personalities and far more spirited debate than occurred among the largely like - minded advisers who populated President Bush ’s first term .
But the names racing through the ether in Washington about the choices to follow also suggest that Mr. Obama continues to place a premium on deep experience .
He is widely reported to be considering asking Mr. Bush ’s defense secretary , Robert M. Gates , to stay on for a year ; and he is thinking about Gen. James L. Jones , the former NATO commander and Marine Corps commandant , for national security adviser , and placing Lawrence H. Summers , the former Treasury secretary whom Mr. Obama considered putting back in his old post , inside the White House as a senior economic adviser .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 3 ( UPI ) -- Likely Republican U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin told her church congregation that the Iraq war was part of God 's plan , a videotape revealed .
A 14 - minute video of a speech the Alaska governor delivered in June to the Wasilla , Alaska , Assembly of God Church and posted Tuesday on the Huffington Post Web site showed her saying the United States ' involvement in Iraq is " a task that is from God . "

She is seen saying : " Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right .
Also for this country , that our leaders , our national leaders , are sending ( troops ) out on a task that is from God .
That 's what we have to make sure that we 're praying for , that there is a plan and that that plan is God 's plan . "
In the speech , she tells the congregation that building a long - sought , 1,715 - mile natural gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay , Alaska to Alberta , Canada , is also part of God 's plan .
" I think God 's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built , so pray for that , " she said .

I have not yet decided who I will vote for .
For me , the most important areas of concern for the next President will be the financial crisis , the war in Iraq and the wider war on terrorism , and the state of illegal immigration into America .
I 'd say I am a " small - c " conservative , a libertarian perhaps , believing in a small role for national government and a larger role for state and local governments , but I do n't cast my vote on party affiliation .
I just think about which of the candidates would do the best job in the next four years .
Obama 's charisma and great oratory skills would be great assets in representing America throughout the world .
But having been in the Senate for only three years , his lack of experience is of concern to me .
In addition , he has the most liberal voting record of all senators .
McCain , on the other hand , sounds willing to challenge entrenched interests in Washington , including within his own party , when he believes it is necessary to do so .

Governor Palin was clearly selected for the impact that she would have on the McCain campaign , not because she was the most qualified candidate .
Without a doubt , she speaks in a way that many Americans find appealing – a kind of folksy , kitchen - table style that makes her appear both honest and " one of us " .
But as someone recently wrote in the New York Times , Americans like to be governed by someone who understands the " common man " , but who is n't a " common man " himself .
Also , just as I have reservations about Obama and his lack of experience , I have similar concerns about Palin 's lack of experience and McCain 's age and health .
I would be less concerned about Biden becoming President than I would about Palin assuming that office .

I left the US right after finishing college , almost 20 years ago .
I was born in Virginia , but I last lived in Texas , so that 's where my vote will count – and I 'll be voting Democrat .
I 'm glad I left America , but I still take a close interest .
I 'm sort of sorry to have missed the Clinton years , but very glad I missed the Bushies !
I can't stand what has happened to the US – the dumbing - down and crassness , and how narrow - minded and incurious about the rest of the world even well - educated Americans seem to be .
I 've followed the campaigns avidly – I even ended up dreaming about them !
Aside from British papers , The New York Times online and BBC Radio 4 keep me up to speed .
Barack Obama is wonderful .
I finally realise what my mother felt about JFK .
I have read his book , Dreams from My Father , and think it will be so great to have someone with experience of the world beyond the borders of their state ( yes , that means you , Sarah Palin ) .
He 's a pretty good writer , too .
He has intelligence and compassion , and the ability to make the words " élite " and " liberal " mean good things again .
I 'm also with Michelle Obama : I finally feel proud of my country again .
It 's been a rough eight years .
I used an absentee ballot after registering online .
If Obama wins , I will be thrilled , but I do n't see myself going back now .
It 's not really my country anymore , although I do defend it to non-Americans who just want to bash it .
The first thing Obama should do is appoint a good , possibly bipartisan , cabinet based on knowledge , education and experience , not cronyism , wealth or ability to suck up to the Big Guy .
Then he can get to work sorting out the domestic things that really matter – like health care and education , and the economy , stupid .

I am happy living in England .
I wanted to live here originally because it was then – still sort of is – rather less materialistic than the States .
Life is harder here , but maybe that is better .
Things are a bit smaller and saner in England .
Depending upon the outcome of this election , I may go back to live in the States .
My American friends and I all tease about moving to Australia if the wrong man gets into Washington .
The outcome is hugely important to me .
I was in Cape Cod last summer , where I 'm from , and worked on the Obama campaign while I was visiting .
I take in most of my election news from the British media , and my children and friends in the States keep me posted through email about the view their end .
I first voted in the Kennedy era , and see Obama as a young , inspiring , morally ethical , diplomatically gracious and intelligent man who carries on the Kennedy tradition .
I am excited about the freshness of the Democrats , and feel that Biden was a measured , sound choice for Obama to have made .

McCain's Vietnam experience does not qualify him , in my opinion , to become the leader of our country , and his constant use of the word " fight " intimidates and scares me .
The nomination of Sarah Palin is , in my view , the most impulsive , dangerous and degrading choice of running mate .
Neither in this election nor in the last has it been straightforward to get an absentee ballot paper – a major source of distress .
I finally got the forms from the US Embassy a couple of weeks ago .
Then there was a delay at my town hall in Massachusetts , where I 'm registered to vote , in sending me my ballot .
This does n't just happen abroad .
My son is based in New York , but is registered to vote in Colorado .
At the last election , he did n't receive his postal vote , so this time he 's flying to Colorado to vote in person .

I watch lots of British current - affairs TV shows , but it 's a relief that so many people over here have fallen for the American satirical programme The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , which is now on MoreFour .
My partner and I are fans .
I 'm far too European , after 40 years here , to consider moving back to the US , though I do go back at least once a year to see family and friends , and still consider myself American .
After the last eight years of wildly unrealistic US foreign policy , I look on both candidates with relief , but as a Democrat ( and secret socialist ) , I 'm obviously supporting Obama , though I voted for Hillary in the Oregon primary .
McCain , though an excellent senator , is too old , and has done himself , and his campaign , irreparable damage by selecting the inexperienced , objectionable Palin as his running mate .
The US 's stature and credibility on the political world stage is at its lowest level for decades , and there are huge issues of mistrust .
I would want the new president to seek to reverse the naive and dangerous policies of the past eight years , and to engage in new discussions and negotiations worldwide to address such issues as stability in Iraq , stability and peace in Israel and Palestine , global warming , global poverty , etc .
Having said that , the first priority for the new president will be trying to turn around the recession inherited from the uncontrolled market excesses of the Bush years .
I believe Barack Obama can do that .

Like other British - based Americans , I 've had to fill out a Federal Post Card Application and send it off at least 45 days before the election in order to get a ballot sent out to me .
The state you vote in is the one you last lived in – and if you 've never lived in the US , there are 16 states that allow you to register , provided your parents were eligible to vote there .
There are about six million Americans living outside the US , yet only a fraction of them vote in US elections .
This is a travesty .
In the online era , getting media coverage from the States is no problem .
I 've followed the campaigns extremely closely , and I 've voted Democrat .
I believe in the importance of everyone exercising their right to vote , whether from overseas or back home .
Our democracy is best served when the maximum number of people participate .
Voting from overseas can be confusing because each state makes its own rules .
Although I have my preferred candidate , I think both men are decent human beings .
I have not been particularly impressed with the direction the McCain campaign has taken , but they are struggling for a message that will resonate with voters .
I hope his tactics wo n't work , for the sake of our country .
For too long , American politics have been ruled by deceit and distraction .
Our electorate has been carved up into tiny blocks , with narrowly targeted messages , pushing fear , so that people are n't voting for someone or something they believe in , but against someone or something they fear .
This is not healthy for a modern democracy .
I might be biased , but I see Barack Obama trying to change this , and that is one reason he has my support .
I feel we need a fundamental course correction in the US , and I do n't feel McCain will be able to turn the wheel hard enough .
Christian Sahner , student , 23 , Oxford University
America is a centre - right country , and our political coalitions are more polarised around " liberal " and " conservative " than in Britain .
It 's easy to find American - style liberals in Britain .
Finding American - style conservatives is a bit harder .
I 'll be voting for McCain .
I trust his views on foreign policy , and value his decades of experience in the Senate , the House of Representatives , and the Navy .
I also side with his instincts on social issues , and trust him to offer sound nominees for the US Supreme Court .
I respect Obama 's intelligence and skills of communication , but am deeply troubled by his lack of experience .
The public has carried him atop a wave of political messianism without critically reflecting on his thin credentials .
I particularly disagree with his stance vis -à - vis foreign policy and would not trust him to make sound selections for the US Supreme Court .
The new president 's first hundred days should be committed to two goals : first , to execute the Paulson plan and stabilise global markets ; and , second , create a strategy for victory in Iraq and Afghanistan , whether that means continuing the surge or adding new troops in trouble spots , such as along the Pakistani border .
Michelle Patient , public relations Director , 38 , Saffron Walden , Essex
I have lived in the UK as a permanent resident for 10 years , and I love it here .
It 's a more tolerant , social country with a cosmopolitan outlook .
I have followed the election campaign closely because I need to be informed to vote responsibly .
Despite being raised in a multigenerational family of military officers , the Republican Party 's policies and beliefs are too conservative for me .
I am a registered Democrat , and I voted for Barack Obama .
I am behind Obama 's policy on international diplomacy and engagement .
I also agree with the Iraq withdrawal plan .
Domestically , affordable health care for everyone is something I 'd love to see .
Obama inspires me with hope and has the potential to instil change .
John McCain as president would not be advantageous for foreign relations – he is too hardline .
As for Sarah Palin , I am baffled by McCain 's decision to make her his running mate .
Kelcey Wilson - Lee , art history student , 27 , Cambridge University
I found the vice - presidential debate – and the press that followed it – largely annoying .
Sarah Palin relied on stock responses and folsky - isms that I , as a woman , found especially offensive .
The whole press response to her has been sexist – about that , at least , the McCain campaign has been correct – as there 's no way a man would have been allowed to be so ill - informed and to spout such nonsense while running for the second - highest office in the land .
A man would have been laughed off the stage – she was congratulated .
I read US newspapers online every day , as well as the British press , and I often browse political blogs .
The overwhelming message I get is that Barack Obama has sound policies , and the wisdom to choose advisers who are out to create a better world , not just to line their own wallets .
Obama 's charisma is important .
He is an individual who can not only accomplish great things himself , but who has the ability to inspire others towards greatness .
For someone of my generation , who has only ever been able to vote for the better option , as opposed to a good option , Obama represents not just hope for the future , but the fulfilment of a promise that , at some point in my life , I 'd get to vote for someone in whom I actually believed .
I do n't think John McCain is a bad person .
But his policies are misguided and his outlook is outdated .
Harpriye A Juneja , investment banker , 30 , London
I have been following the campaign closely for nearly two years , via newspapers from the US , UK and India .
I can't say I 'm terribly enthused by either Obama or McCain .
The primaries were decided more on the basis of foreign policy and national - security issues , which seemed more pressing at the time , than of economic issues , which have rapidly proven to be the major issue facing the US and the world .
It 's clear that neither has a comforting grasp of economic issues .
In retrospect , I 'd have felt more comfortable deciding between , say , Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney .
The irony is that , for all their perceived differences , I do n't see a fundamental difference between Obama or McCain on foreign policy or national - security issues .
The next president 's path on Iraq is relatively set , given that a successful withdrawal is within sight .
Neither candidate will let Iran develop nuclear weapons .
Similarly , both recognise that Guantanamo Bay needs to be closed , that the US must clarify its opposition to torture , and needs to work with the international community to tackle global warming .
So , to me , the choice between McCain and Obama boils down to who I would trust more on economic issues .
Given the stakes , I feel more comfortable with McCain , who has a demonstrated willingness to pursue reasonable pro-growth policies and resist unnecessary intrusions of the state into markets .
Peter Francis , financial analyst , 37 , London
To be honest , I think the election has been going on too long already .
I do n't think much of the two candidates .
I 'm more of a libertarian , which means I 'm interested in limited government .
Neither candidate would be my ideal .
I see this election as being about who will do less harm .
McCain , while a Republican , is not a big conservative on most issues .
He says he 's interested in cutting taxes , and I 'd be in favour of that – giving workers more of their hard - earned money .
I 'm not in favour of most of Obama 's policies , as he generally favours a larger role for government in our lives – higher taxes and more protectionist policies – policies that were very popular both in the UK and in the US in the 1970s .
I have n't voted in many elections , but I 'm following this one by watching the BBC and Fox , and reading websites such as Drudgereport.com , Realclearpolitics.com and Instapundit.com .
I usually vote Republican but in local US elections , the party matters less , so I have voted for other parties .
In this election , I 'm for McCain .
Van Howell , artist , 60 , London
About three years ago , my niece showed me a newspaper photo she 'd taken of Barack Obama – seen from below , his noble features bathed in celestial light .
This was the first I 'd heard of the guy .
She said he was likely to be President soon .
I do n't have much faith in politicians , especially not in Democrats offering hope and change , but I kept an open mind , and found his debates with Hillary Clinton quite impressive .
For me , the fundamantal issue is ecology .
Will Obama save the planet , or its people ?
He is clearly serious about addressing real life problems , including those other politicians ( and the media ) pretend not to notice .
He studies and thinks , and he allows his proposals to evolve as he learns more .
His uplifting rhetoric may be fuzzy and hollow , but his intellect is not .
His explanations of his policies are substantive and convincing .
He might make a start in the right direction , which is more than I expected to say of any American president in my lifetime .
My " faith " in Obama was confirmed for me in the final debate between him and McCain .
It not have been show - stopping but he 's done enough for me .
Jonathan
White , sales manager , 27 , Pewsey , Wiltshire
This is the first election I have voted in .
It was the gravity of the global situation that motivated me to ensure I got my absentee ballot and posted it .
I have decided on whom to vote for but unfortunately , it was a case of choosing the lesser of two evils .
I would consider myself to be fiscally conservative but socially liberal and there is n't an electable person running on this platform .
The deciding factor , in the end , was Sarah Palin .
We Americans are voting for a President , but given McCain 's age and health , I could n't even take a miniscule risk that Sarah Palin could one day be running the country .
Just as I would n't want your average " Hockey Dad " running the United States , I do n't want someone who describes herself as your average " Hockey Mom " to be making decisions that affect the United States and arguably the rest of the world .
Carol Saumarez , book festival co-ordinator , 66 , Bideford , Devon
I have always voted Democrat , but feel more strongly this time than I have for 40 years .
I 've followed the campaign avidly – including watching the debates and speeches when possible .
When friends return from the US , they bring me The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal .
I 'm so inspired by Barack Obama , and I 'm reassured by Joe Biden 's long history in the Senate .
I 've tracked John McCain for several years , and am appalled by his choice of vice - presidential candidate .
I can only hope that Obama and Biden will surround themselves with equally intelligent and experienced people , and will live in an international world .
The alternative of an elderly president who is living on his history as a prisoner of war , and his quite unqualified vice - president is difficult to contemplate .
Of all the possibilities , why did McCain choose her ?
No corner of the Earth is immune from the effects of global warming , according to a new study that confirms manmade temperature rises in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions .
Temperature records over the last century show that warming in the planet 's coldest and most remote wildernesses is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases .
The study , published today in Nature Geoscience , is the first to find the fingerprints of manmade global warming on the Antarctic , where a shortage of data makes it hard to be sure .
Last year 's report , from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , said human influence could be detected on every continent , except Antarctica .
Climate sceptics have exploited this omission to question the science of global warming .
In the new study , Nathan Gillett , then working at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , though now at Environment Canada , compiled , with colleagues , climate data across the Arctic and Antarctic regions since 1900 , and compared the patterns with those produced by computer simulations with and without human activity .
They say only the models that included human influences – such as emissions of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) – were able to reproduce the observed temperature trends .
Gillett said : " The main message is that for the first time we are able to directly attribute warming in both the Arctic and Antarctica to human influence .
Melting of ice shelves has implications for sea- level rises . "
Peter Stott , head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office , who worked on the study , said : " In both polar regions , the observed warming can only be reproduced in our models by including human influences , natural forces alone are not enough .
For a long time climate scientists have known that Arctic areas would be expected to warm most strongly because of feedback mechanisms .
But the results from this work demonstrate the part man has already played in the significant warming that we 've observed in both polar regions . "
The polar regions have seen some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change on the planet in recent years .
The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average , which has contributed to record melting of sea ice in the Arctic summer and thinning in the winter .
The picture in Antarctica is more complex , but the rocky Antarctic peninsula has experienced temperature rises of 3C over the past 50 years – among the largest recorded .
Other parts , including the vast east - Antarctic ice sheet , have seen less change .

( Or if you do , at least take the money out first . )
I remember when episodes of the original Star Trek series were coming out two - by - two – that is , two episodes in a single $ 20 DVD .
As I lamented how much it would cost to eventually own the entire run of the series , I broke down and only bought a copy of the DVD that contained Amok Time .
Luckily , you wo n’t have this same problem !
You can get all three seasons in a single bundle .
And do n’t worry , “ remastered ” is not the George Lucas definition of the word .
Still , if the geek you ’re shopping for would turn up his nose at additional special effects , then you can still snap up the original box sets .
According to the product description , a tetrad is a “ geometric shape composed of four squares , connected on at least one side . ”
But everyone knows that what we really have here are super - cool Tetris shelves .
You even get the pick the colors !

The cute little chick sits on your hand and responds to your touch .
All the cute factor of a baby animal without the mess .
The movie comes out on March 3 and everyone is already twitching with excitement .
Now is a great time to reread Watchmen if you ’re an old fan .
And if you are , you might just appreciate this deluxe , hardcover version of the comic .
Not only is the book itself just nice ( which I can attest to , since I have a copy of Absolute Sandman ) , but it contains 43 pages of extra stuff–scripts , conceptual art , etc .
A great gift for Watchman enthusiast and / or comic buff .
For the wee geek in your life .
Because who has n’t looked at a baby and thought , “ Man , I really wish I knew that thing ’s stats . ”
A Level 1 Human may be saddled with dismal strength and HP and a tragic zero experience points , but that high charisma gives it the ability to lead henchmen ( or possibly just entice you to coo at it ) .
Maybe you ’re a geek whose girl complains that you never buy her frilly things .
Or maybe you ’re a guy whose geek girl might appreciate something racy more if it makes her think “ up up down down left right left right B A start . ”
Either way , this pretty Nintendo - garnished garter from a crafter on Etsy might be just the thing .
Though one piece of advice , guys : make sure that she knows that when you ’re looking at her legs that you ’re thinking about her and not your latest saved game .

A new report says that global warming could cost the Californian economy billions of dollars each year , through a combination of rising sea levels , and the increased frequency of wild fires and extreme weather events .
The comprehensive study ( PDF ) , published by researcher ’s at UC Berkeley , also claims that $ 2.5 trillion of Californian real estate assets are at risk .
The clear message , says co-author Prof.
David Roland - Holst , is the strong economic case for timely action to slash carbon emissions and adapt to the already unavoidable effects of climate change .
“ Our report makes clear the most expensive thing we can do about climate change is nothing , ” he said .
“ As we learned in New Orleans , turning your back on the threat of natural disaster does n’t make it go away . ”
In detail , the report found that the insurance and real estate sectors could face damages totalling between $ 300 m and $ 3.9 bn per year .
Assets across a number of other sectors are also particularly at risk , including :
$ 21bn of energy sector assets ;
$ 500bn of transport sector assets
$ 113bn of agricultural assets
$ 5bn of water industry assets ; and ,
$ 98bn of tourism assets .
In US , and particularly global terms , California is already fairly forward - looking in terms of its response to the challenges posed by global warming .
We can only hope that the publication of this report , from one of the world ’s most respected academic institutions , is likely to further galvanize opinion and spur the state into even more radical action .

The notion that tonight should have been about ripping the bark off the president seems to me misplaced .
No one needs to be persuaded that the country is on the wrong track .
We have endured one of the worst presidencies in American history , a stalling economy , and a war that was as deceptively packaged as it was poorly executed .
The wrong track number is at 80 percent .
What was necessary tonight was rebutting the only real weapon the Republicans have : dragging Obama into the mud , throwing every extremist attack they can at him , painting him as a commie , alien , anti-American freak .
For good measure , they had tried to paint Michelle as an angry black radical .
They failed .
There was nothing more American than the way the Obamas spoke of their story .
It made them more appealing to the white working class and the black working class .
It defused the smears .
And , taken as whole , it also gave the Democrats some good feeling with the Kennedys .
There was plenty I did n't like about this night , as you can tell if you scroll down .
But it succeeded in the most important task .
Michelle did it .
She more than did it .
She struck fear in the GOP tonight .
Their lies about the Obamas will fail .
As they should .

Overreaching corporate claims are nothing new , certainly when it comes to copyright .
Toyota vastly over - reached recently , requesting all images containing their products be removed from a wallpaper site , citing copyright issues .
Finally , Toyota responds .
Civil litigation and especially copyright disputes , are often a David and Goliath battle .
With lobbyists pressing hard to increase punitive damages well beyond any potential damage imaginable , or even a sane multiplier of that damage , being taken to court can be an expensive prospect .
That ’s where many lawyers , such as Davenport Lyons can make a tidy profit .
As has happened in some of the cases they are involved with , many will admit wrongdoing , and even pay ‘ damages ’ where no actions ( wrong or otherwise ) have occurred .
It has led to a general feeling that a claim of copyright infringement by a large powerful company will get the actions they desire , irrespective of facts , through fear of litigation .
This was the situation last week , when Toyota ordered wallpaper site Desktop Nexus to remove all images featuring Toyota vehicles , even those with copyright belonging to others .
However , sometimes a company can be pressured into accepting mistakes , and this is the case here .
With a large amount of negative publicity ( a selection of which can be found on DesktopNexus ’ blog ) Toyota today contacted TorrentFreak and DesktopNexus , expressing their apologies for the incident .

Dear Torrentfreak.com ,
The recent request Toyota made to have certain photos of Toyota vehicles removed from the public wallpaper site , DesktopNexus , was the result of an internal miscommunication .
To protect the legal rights and agreements we have with the photographers we hire , we ask that the photographs not be used for direct consumer advertising , sales brochures and the like .
If people wish to post their own photos of one of their own vehicles , that ’s their right .
In fact , we ’re pleased that people would want to show their Toyota vehicles to the world .
So have at it .
Consider the wallpapers on DesktopNexus to be fair game for personal use .
Please let your readers know that we offer a sincere apology to the DesktopNexus site and its users for any inconvenience or disruption this miscommunication may have caused .
Thanks for your understanding , Scott DeYager

Carbon emissions from coal power stations could be transformed into a green biofuel , German power firm RWE AG reckons .
The company said today that it 's started using flue gas from a coal power plant to ' fee d' algae and produce algae waste that could , one day , be used as biofuel .
Algae at the " Coal Innovation Centre " in Nideraussem , Germany , basically uses photosynthesis to process CO2 into algae waste .
That waste could then potentially be used as future fuel .
In other words , it 's an embyronic form of carbon capture and storage .
The project 's taking place in partnership with Jacobs University and the Juelich Research Centre .
I 've asked the RWE AG press office for more details .07/11 update : no word back from RWE yet , but Jacobs Uni has just posted further info here .

Comedian and same - sex marriage activist Wanda Sykes has announced today that she is gay and has married her partner .
Wanda Sykes at a rally in Las Vegas today said :
" You know , I do n't really talk about my sexual orientation .
I did n't feel like I had to .
I was just living my life , not necessarily in the closet , but I was living my life , " Sykes told a crowd at a gay rights rally in Las Vegas on Saturday .
" Everybody that knows me personally they know I 'm gay .
But that 's the way people should be able to live their lives , " she said .
" Now , I gotta get in their face , " she said .
" I 'm proud to be a woman .
I 'm proud to be a black woman , and I 'm proud to be gay . "

BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
A grenade apparently fired into a gathering of anti-government protesters camped out in the Thai prime minister 's office compound killed one person and wounded 23 others Thursday , officials said .
It was the first fatal assault inside the compound since supporters of the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) seized Government House in August .
The grenade , fired early Thursday morning , landed in one of the many tents that protesters have set up inside the premises as they continue their movement to unseat the democratically elected Thai government , authorities said .
A military official , who is also a PAD member , inspected the explosive and said it appeared to have been fired from an M - 79 grenade launcher .
While the death was the first inside the compound , others have been killed in mass street demonstrations organized by PAD .
Two people died in October when Thai police clashed with thousands of PAD protesters who barricaded Parliament and prevented lawmakers from leaving .
More than 420 were wounded in those clashes .
A month earlier , another person was killed in police - protester clashes .
Do n't Miss Blog : Descent into chaos
The anti-government alliance accuses the current administration -- led by the People Power Party ( PPP ) -- of being a proxy government for former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
Thaksin was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2006 , but he returned to Thailand after the PPP swept into power in December 2007 .
But Thaksin fled again in August just as he was to appear in a corruption case against him .
The anti-government protesters want him extradited and tried on those charges .
The opposition also accuses the PPP government of wanting to amend the constitution so Thaksin does not have to face prosecution .
The protesters have held almost - daily demonstrations since May and have fortified Government House with sandbags , tires and shells of burned - out buses .
Read Dan Rivers ' blog on Thailand 's descent into chaos
In September , the protesters accomplished one of their goals when Thailand 's Constitutional Court stripped then Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej of his post , ruling that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show .
The PPP responded by picking Thaksin 's brother - in - law to replace Samak -- a move that further inflamed the protesters , who have continued their campaign .

November 21 , 2020 is the 48th annual World Hello Day .
Anyone can participate in World Hello
Day simply by greeting ten people .
This demonstrates the importance of personal communication for preserving peace .
World Hello Day was begun in response to the conflict between Egypt and Israel in the Fall of 1973 .
Since then , World Hello Day has been observed by people in 180 countries .
People around the world use the occasion of World Hello Day as an opportunity to express their concern for world peace .
Beginning with a simple greeting on World Hello Day , their activities send a message to leaders , encouraging them to use communication rather than force to settle conflicts .
As a global event World Hello Day joins local participation in a global expression of peace .
The World Hello Day web site address is http://www.worldhelloday.org.
31 winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are among the people who have realized World Hello Day 's value as an instrument for preserving peace and as an occasion that makes it possible for anyone in the world to contribute to the process of creating peace .
Brian McCormack , a Ph.D. graduate of Arizona State University , and Michael McCormack , a graduate of Harvard University , work together to promote this annual global event .
It is one of London 's most exclusive addresses .
Michelin - starred restaurants are just a block away , the US embassy is around the corner and Hyde Park is at the end of the road .
To share the same postcode ought to cost millions .
But the new residents of 18 Upper Grosvenor Street , a raggle - taggle of teenagers and artists called the Da ! collective , have n't paid a penny for their £ 6.25 m , six - storey townhouse in Mayfair .
The black anarchist flag flapping from the first - floor balcony gives a clue what they are up to : since finding a window open on the first floor on October 10 , the group has been squatting in the house , and only plan to leave when evicted .
This might take some time : after almost a month , the deed owner — a company called Deltaland Resources Ltd , according to the Land Registry — does n't appear to have noticed that the once - opulent building has been taken over .
The 30 - plus rooms of the grade II - listed residence are now scattered with sleeping bags , mattresses , rucksacks spilling over with clothes and endless half - finished art installations .
One room is full of tree branches while another hosts a pink baby bath above which dangle test tubes filled with capers .
They had been watching the building for " at least six months " before they decided to try moving in , said one member , Stephanie Smith , 21 .
" We had put tape on the keyhole and kept looking through the letter box to see if anyone had been there . "
Then , one October night , five of them decided to go in .
Some wore high - visibility jackets to look like builders ; Smith had a clipboard and fur coat .
They propped their rented ladder up against the front of the building , and one man climbed on to the balcony .
" I went across to the window and I could n't believe it when it was unlocked , " said the squatter , who declined to give his name . "
It was a really exciting moment . "
Almost a month since the occupation began , no one from Deltaland Resources Ltd , which is registered in the British Virgin Islands , has been in touch .
Meanwhile the locks have been changed .
The Da ! group has reconnected the utilities and says the bills will be paid .
Smith insists they have done nothing wrong .
" Squatting is not a criminal offence , it 's a civil matter , " she said .
" If the owners want to kick us out they will have to apply for an eviction notice .
If anything , we are improving the building by mending leaks and things like that . "
The group has had a mixed reception from the other residents of Upper Grosvenor Street .
" Our next - door neighbours have been really nice ; they 've even let us use their wireless internet , " said Smith .
Another neighbour , a man called Alexander , has offered the services of a cook .
But not everyone is happy .
Jacques Dejardin , manager of a restaurant run by Michelin - starred chef Richard Corrigan , which was due to open last night , was horrified to discover this week it was directly opposite a squat .
" It 's rather bewildering .
When you move into an address like this you do n't expect to have squatters as neighbours , " Dejardin said .
He need n't worry about the squatters popping in for dinner , though : they are firm devotees of freecycling and collect all their food from supermarket skips .

Tax website shut down as memory stick with secret personal data of 12 million is found in a pub car park
Ministers have been forced to order an emergency shutdown of a key Government computer system to protect millions of people 's private details .
The action was taken after a memory stick was found in a pub car park containing confidential passcodes to the online Government Gateway system , which covers everything from tax returns to parking tickets .
An urgent investigation is now under way into how the stick , belonging to the company which runs the flagship system , came to be lost .
Security breach :
The lost USB memory stick holding sensitive details
The Department for Work and Pensions insisted that the system 's security has not been breached , but a computer expert told The Mail on Sunday that in the wrong hands the data on the memory stick could enable hackers to access personal details of the 12 million people who have registered on the system , including their passwords .
Users trying to log on to the site yesterday were met by the message : ' The Government Gateway is temporarily offline .
We apologise for any inconvenience .
Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible . '
The Government also closed down access to self - assessment tax applications via the Revenue and Customs website .
For the past six years , the £ 18 million Gateway system has enabled members of the public and businesses to gain access to hundreds of services from 50 Whitehall departments , including self - assessment tax returns , VAT returns , pension entitlements and child benefit .
This year alone , 1.8 million people have submitted their tax returns on the system .
Members of the public registering for the service have to provide their personal details , which can include names , addresses , wages , National Insurance numbers and credit card details .
The lost memory stick was found two weeks ago outside a Brewers Fayre chain pub in Cannock , Staffordshire , but the Department of Work and Pensions , which owns the Government Gateway , was made aware of its loss only last week when the 2in device was passed to this newspaper .
An expert who examined it for The Mail on Sunday said it contained confidential passwords , security software and the technical blueprint to the system known as the ' source code ' .
The memory stick is now in the hands of the police .
Concerns have been raised before about the concentration of personal information on the system , but Ministers have repeatedly assured taxpayers that the system was secure .
When The Mail on Sunday told the Department of Work and Pensions that the memory stick had been left outside The Orbital pub in Cannock , a spokesman said they were taking the matter ' very seriously ' .
He added : ' We have launched an immediate and urgent investigation into this .
We are going to assess what needs to be done and senior people are involved .
The implications are obvious . '
Yesterday , after the service had been shut down , the department added : ' We have moved immediately to make sure there is no conceivable risk to users of the Government Gateway .
' We are convinced the integrity of the Government Gateway has not been compromised and there is no risk to users . '
The department said no credit card details were contained on the USB memory stick , also known as a flash drive .
Shut down : The Government Gateway website
The breach is just the latest in a long line of scandals involving lost Government data .
This week the Information Commissioner revealed that the number of data breaches - including lost laptops and memory sticks containing sensitive personal records - had risen to 277 since the loss of 25 million child benefit records was disclosed nearly a year ago .
The memory stick was lost by Daniel Harrington , 29 , an IT analyst at computer management firm Atos Origin .
The multinational company , which boasts an annual turnover of £ 4billion , won the five - year £ 46.7 million contract to manage the Government Gateway in 2006 .
Worryingly , the same company has been selected to supply IT systems for the London 2012 Olympic Games .
Yesterday , Mr Harrington was in emergency meetings all day at Atos Origin 's offices in Cannock .
His mother Sylvia said : ' It was lost .
He is such a lovely lad .
He went into work today , I do n't know whether he was dragged in , but he went in .
It is just so upsetting .
I keep telling him , mistakes happen . '
Computer security expert Jacques Erasmus , from internet protection firm Prevx , said that the passwords and security software saved on the memory stick would provide access into a series of databases or payment systems .
But he added that the greatest concern was the source code .
Mr Erasmus , who has previously worked with Government agencies , said that the blueprint to the Government Gateway was ' invaluable ' for those who would want to harvest personal details or defraud the Government .
He said : ' We have to hope that there are not more of these out there .
This is potentially the most serious data loss this country has seen in recent times .
' Not only would a fraudster be able to take personal details using the tools provided on the lost memory stick , but the extent of the information contained in the source code would allow a hacker to access the Government Gateway 's payment systems and even divert tax money into private bank accounts .
' It is unbelievable , incredible .
In previous data loss cases it was all clear - cut .
The Government could see exactly what was lost and could combat it .
They could cancel cards , make the people involved aware of the threat . '
As well as the system blueprint , other files on the stick included samples of personal information .
One document held the names , addresses , wages , individual tax liabilities and National Insurance numbers of a group of taxpayers .
A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions insisted that the security software and passwords on the memory stick had been protected so that a stranger would not be able to access the Government Gateway easily .
She said : ' Passwords are hidden using an industry standard technique which is difficult to break .
We believe the risk of someone accessing personal data in this way is extremely low . '
She added that the source code was old , that the step - by - step guide to the system provided in a text file was a ' low risk ' , and that other items on the memory stick provided only a ' rudimentary guide ' to the system .
She also said that it would be ' impossible to intercept details of transactions ' and divert money to another account .
However , Mr Erasmus said the source code was only a few months old and that the password encryption would be ' relatively easy ' to crack , given the information on the device .
He said : ' I could decrypt those passwords to log in to the system and roam around the network .
As we can see from the data on the USB stick , the systems contain highly sensitive personal information .
' If you can crack those encrypted passwords , and it would just be a matter of time , you could potentially access those 12 million accounts and those details .
' There is even a map on the memory stick of how the whole thing works , to help an attacker . '
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said the civil rights group had conducted an audit which showed that the Government had lost 30 million pieces of data in the past year .
' That 's one data bungle for every two people in the country , ' she said .
' Still they plough on with their Big Brother ambitions ; ID cards and the scary central communications database : disasters waiting to happen at our expense . '
Lib Dem MP Norman Baker said the Government were asking for data from taxpayers that they could not protect .
' The Government can not be trusted with all this information but they collect more and more , ' he said .
' I would have thought the basic security step would be to ensure that memory sticks with all this information on simply do n't exist . '
Yesterday morning , the finder of the memory stick was asked to deposit the device at his local police station .
And seven pages of printouts were handed over to a civil servant seconded to collect the documents .
An Atos Origin spokesman said : ' Atos Origin can confirm that a single memory stick has been misplaced by one of its employees .
' The company takes the loss of this device very seriously and we are currently carrying out a full investigation of both the circumstances surrounding its loss and the data content of the stick .
' It is clear that the employee removed the device from company premises in direct breach of our own operating procedure .
' Atos Origin is working very closely with the Government and the police .
The company takes full responsibility for this loss and will discipline the individual involved .
' It is inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage . '
Once again , there were duelling rallies here in Anchorage .
The McCain - Palin rally was held in the just - completed Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage .
The Obama rally was held outside , just a couple blocks away , at the Delaney Park Strip .
One would think that the Republican rally celebrating the hometown girl , in her very very red state would have drawn a huge crowd , and that the Obama rally would be a few brave intrepid souls with a couple signs shivering by the side of the road .
One would be wrong .
The Obama rally was all set up and running when I arrived – tents , face painting , t- shirt sales , voter registration , postcard writing to swing states , a huge stage and sound system .
By 1:00 , there were more than a thousand people milling around with signs , kids , dogs and huge smiles .
This was definitely a feel - good place .
Hundreds lined the roadside waving signs to appreciative honking motorists , and hundreds more milled around the tent area .
Anchorage mayoral candidate and former legislator Eric Croft got up and spoke , so did Kat Pustay who ’s heading up the Obama campaign in the state .
Then came Ethan Berkowitz , Democratic candidate for the U.S. House seat currently held by Don Young .
Ethan welcomed his “ fellow revolutionaries ” .
The crowd went wild .
I looked at my watch .
It was after 1:30 and I knew if I did n’t get to the McCain Palin rally soon , I ’d never go .
So I ripped myself away from all the positive energy and the fresh air , and hurried over to the Dana’ina Center .
3 people stood outside waving signs .
I figured I had to smile , so I did .
“ Come on in , we ’re having a rally ! ” one of them effused .
I took a big cleansing breath , and in I went .
I just had a feeling this rally was n’t going to have as big a crowd as the Obama rally , because the rally that was held for Palin herself , when she was in Anchorage a few weeks ago only had about 500 people show up .
But I walked into the room and I really was stunned .
I felt like I had entered an empty chair convention .
It was really bad .
I actually felt sorry for the organizers for a minute , before I snapped myself out of it .
A head count yielded about 250-300 people .
Clearly they had been hoping for more .
Jack Frost , local voice - over guy and conservative Republican who got trounced by Mark Begich in the last Anchorage mayoral race , was the emcee .
Literally right as I sat down he was announcing the “ special guest ” …. a phone call from Sarah Palin !
Her voice was piped in over the loudspeakers , and there was a slide up on a screen showing her photo - op with Henry Kissinger .
I have to say , it was a bit jarring sitting there hearing the ‘ giant voice ’ of Sarah Palin filling the room .
She did n’t say much .
It was a bunch of “ Gee , I miss you guys …
I heard there were a few flakes today .
I miss that weather .
It ’s been so amazeen travelin ’ across this great country and meetin ’ people , and even Alaskans down here also as we travel across the country also meetin ’ people …
I miss you guys SOOO much . ”
A lady scooted up to me and said , “ We ’d really like everyone to be up at the front and towards the center , not all spread out . ”
Ah…ca n’t have the news cameras getting all those chairs .
I scooted up and way over to the side so I would n’t get on film .
Then the emcee reminded us about how much Alaska would “ get ” if Palin was the VP , and also reminded us that our enemies hate us because of our way of life , and our freedoms , and “ all they want to do is kill American soldiers ” .
Then he said the only thing the rally was missing was “ an effigy of Katie Couric . ”
( Felt pocket for Tums …. left them home . )
And look , there ’s Meg Stapleton sitting among the empty chairs .
Next up was a local Republican legislative candidate , Bob Lewis , who told the crowd he had driven past “ that other rally ” on his way in , and how the people were just full of hate , and anger and fear , and that “ we ” ( the Palin rally ) were the ones having a good time .
“ So , ” he told us , “ you need to decide which side you want to be on ! ”
That was it for me .
Had to leave .
On the way out I noticed clip boards with the “ support Palin ” petition .
Someone behind the table said that this was “ against those people ” ( described as ‘ Obama operatives ’ ) who were smearing Palin and that “ we just want to support her . ” I did n’t sign …. being an “ operative ” and all .
Back out into the fresh air , and down the street where signs were still waving .
As I crossed the street there were police cars , and I noticed several very large piles of something in the middle of the road .
The road had actually been closed off from traffic ….
at first I thought it was cement , but then I looked closer and it was ….mud !
It looked for all the world like muflats mud !
Done on purpose to keep visibility of the rally low ?
Strange coincidence ?
A message to Mudflatters ?
I have no explanation for that one …
Crossed the street , and there I was again , back at the rally of “ hate , anger and fear ” listening to a great local band , and watching kids with painted faces dancing in the grass , smiling people registering voters , busy postcard - writers , cheering sign - wavers , and a community brought together by a shared desire to move the country in a new direction .
Clearly I was at the right rally .

Many studies have shown that media images of female models have had a negative impact on how woman view their own bodies , but does this same effect hold true when men view male models ?
A leading researcher of media effects on body image at the University of Missouri looked at the effect of male magazines on college - age men .
Completing three different studies , Jennifer Aubrey , assistant professor of communication in the College of Arts and Science , found that unlike their female classmates , it was not the same - sex models that affected the males negatively , but quite the opposite .
In her research , which will be published in Human Communication Research , Aubrey found that the cultural expectation for men is not that they have to be as attractive as their peers , but that they need to be attractive enough to be sexually appealing to women .
In her first study , Aubrey measured male exposure to ' lad ' magazines , such as Maxim , FHM and Stuff , which she observes contains two main messages : the visual , which mostly contain sexually suggestive images of women ; and textual , which contain articles that speak in a bawdy , male voice about topics including fashion , sex , technology and pop culture .
Aubrey also measured male body self - consciousness ( a participant 's awareness and tendency to monitor one 's appearance ) and appearance anxiety ( the anticipation of threatening stimuli ) .
Participants were asked questions such as " During the day , I think about how I look , " and then asked the same questions a year later .
" We found that reading lad magazines was related to having body self - consciousness a year later , " said Aubrey .
" This was surprising because if you look at the cover of these magazines , they are mainly images of women .
We wondered why magazines that were dominated by sexual images of women were having an effect of men's feelings about their own bodies . "
To help answer this question , Aubrey collaborated with University of California - Davis Assistant Professor Laramie Taylor .
The researchers divided male study participants into three groups .
Group one examined layouts from lad magazines that featured objectified women along with a brief description of their appearances .
The second group viewed layouts about male fashion , featuring fit and well - dressed male models .
The final group inspected appearance - neutral layouts that featured topics including technology and film trivia .
" Men who viewed the layouts of objectified females reported more body self - consciousness than the other two groups , " Aubrey said .
" Even more surprising was that the male fashion group reported the least amount of body self - consciousness among the three groups . "
Aubrey speculated that the exposure to objectified females increased self - consciousness because men are reminded that in order to be sexually or romantically involved with a woman of similar attractiveness , they need to conform to strict appearance standards .
To test her theory , Aubrey and Taylor completed a third study that involved breaking men into two groups .
Group one received lad magazine layouts of sexually idealized females and group two received the same layouts with average - looking ' boyfriends ' added to the photos , with captions about how the female models are attracted to the average - looking men .
" We found that the men who view the ads with the average - looking boyfriend in the picture reported less body self - consciousness than the men who saw the ads with just the model , " Aubrey said .
" When the men felt that the model in the ad liked average - looking guys , it took the pressure off of them and made them less self - conscious about their own bodies . "

How one of the most frequently - used curses in the English language — not to mention a certain profane gesture entailing the extension of one 's middle finger — supposedly originated as a medieval battlefield taunt .
Description : Joke / Folk etymology
Circulating since : 1996
Status : False ( details below )
Example :
As posted in Usenet discussions , December 1996 :
Subject : FW : Puzzler
The ' Car Talk ' show ( on NPR ) with Click and Clack , the Tappet Brothers , have a feature called the ' Puzzler ' .
Their most recent " Puzzler " was about the Battle of Agincourt .
The French , who were overwhelmingly favored to win the battle , threatened to cut a certain body part off of all captured English soldiers so that they could never fight again .
The English won in a major upset and waved the body part in question at the French in defiance .
The puzzler was :
What was this body part ?
This is the answer submitted by a listener :
Dear Click and Clack ,
Thank you for the Agincourt ' Puzzler ' , which clears up some profound questions of etymology , folklore and emotional symbolism .
The body part which the French proposed to cut off of the English after defeating them was , of course , the middle finger , without which it is impossible to draw the renowned English longbow .
This famous weapon was made of the native English yew tree , and so the act of drawing the longbow was known as " plucking yew " .
Thus , when the victorious English waved their middle fingers at the defeated French , they said , " See , we can still pluck yew !
PLUCK YEW ! "
Over the years some ' folk etymologies ' have grown up around this symbolic gesture .
Since " pluck yew " is rather difficult to say ( like " pleasant mother pheasant plucker " , which is who you had to go to for the feathers used on the arrows ) , the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative 'f ' , and thus the words often used in conjunction with the one - finger - salute are mistakenly thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter .
It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is known as " giving the bird " .
Analysis :
Pay no attention to the pseudo - academic bluster above concerning pheasant pluckers , labiodental fricatives , and the English longbow .
The text is a clever and amusing spoof , not meant to be taken seriously .
Lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower , author of " The F - Word " ( Random House : 1999 ) , says the " totally ludicrous " tale erroneously conflates the etymology of the word f*ck with an older bit of folklore , itself questionable , purporting to trace the origin of the European " two - finger salute " ( roughly analogous to " flipping the bird " in America ) back to the taunts of British archers against the French during the Hundred Years ' War .
Etymologists say found its way into the English language from Dutch or Low German during the 14th century and made its first written appearance around 1500 .
The word pluck , on the other hand , is of Latin derivation and there is no known linguistic connection between the two English words .
It 's doubtful the expression " Pluck yew " was ever uttered before 1996 when this apocryphal story first went into circulation online .
The middle - finger gesture , which has apparently had phallic connotations in every culture in which it has been used , is much older .
We know it dates back to ancient Greece , at least , where it was referenced in " The Clouds , " a play written by Aristophanes in 423 B.C.
It was also well known to the Romans , who referred to it variously as digitus infamis ( " infamous finger " ) and digitus impudicus ( " indecent finger " ) .
In all likelihood its origins were prehistoric .

As I mentioned a couple of hours ago I ’m at RailsConf Europe 2008 .
So far , I ’ve had a good time and the Conf seems to be better organized than last year ( for starters , all the microphones worked from the start ;-) and the registration took only ~ 5 minutes ) .
Unfortunately , O’Reilly seems to have cut back on the goodies :
No RailsConf T - shirts this year and as far as I ’ve seen there ’s only one magazine that we got ( last year it was , like , 10 ?! ) .
But hey , as long as the talks are good , who cares about a TYPO3 magazine anyways ?
So here it goes for today ’s talks :
Accessible AJAX on Rails
presented by Jarkko Laine & Geoffrey Grosenbach
On of the three morning tutorials was about how you can make AJAX and JavaScript in general less obtrusive and therefore also more accessible .
Jarkko showed some basic techniques of progressive enhancement ( really necessary , since most of the people did n’t seem even know the term let alone what it ’s about ) and introduced Dan Webb ’s lowpro pretty early in the game .
In my opinion , it was very important that he really elaborated on using the right markup in order to be able to access elements using their respective class name , id or even other CSS3 - style selectors .
Jarkko also did not only talk but did live coding and a couple of short “ try it yourself ” - sessions where the participants got little tasks that they should implement .
Finally , he showed delegating event handling with Event . delegate which is hidden very well beneath the covers of lowpro and thus probably not used quite as often as it should be used ( because it ’s good ! ) .
All in all , since I ’ve written two articles about unobtrusive javascript myself , the talk was a bit too basic for me .
Jarkko presented well , though , and Geoffrey ( who replaced Dan Webb , who unfortunately seems to be missing from this years ’
Conf ) chimed in every now and then and shared his experiences with several things related to the topic .

Deploying and Monitoring Ruby on Rails
presented by Mathias Meyer & Jonathan Weiss
Jonathan started the talk and explained about different ways of serving Rails apps : FastCGI , Mongrel and Phusion Passenger ( aka mod_rails ) .
He explained the differences , advantages and disadvantages really well and elaborated on the issue of load balancing .
Jonathan said he thinks that Phusion Passenger will become the default way of hosting Rails application over the next few months .
He also discussed JRuby / Glassfish / WAR files for deploying Rails applications into existing Java environments .
Jonathan then went on to explain load balancing across multiple physical servers using Apache 2.2 ’s mod_proxy_balancer , nginx , lighttpd and HAProxy ( and other pure web proxies ) , and their respective pros and cons .
Here are his recommendations for some use cases :
Small sites ( with only one physical / virtual server ) : Apache 2.2 with Phusion Passenger
Medium sites ( with multiple servers ) : Apache 2.2 as frontend proxy and static host , Mongrel ( or Phusion Passenger ) as the backend .
Large sites : redundant load balancers , redundant proxies and static file hosts , plus Mongrel or Phusion Passenger
Heavy focus on static files : Static requests handled by nginx or Lighttpd , dynamic requests routed through Apache to Mongrel / Phusion Passenger .
Java : WAR files with Glassfish / Tomcat/etc .
He closed the first part of the presentation talking about Ruby Enterprise Edition , Thin / Ebb / Evented Mongrel ( although he does n’t seem to have favorable opinions on Thin & Co. ) and up and coming technologies like Fuzed ( Erlang - based load balancer ) , JRuby and , of course , Phusion Passenger .
The talk was handed over to Mathias who talked about deploying Rails applications with Capistrano .
He especially focused on recipes and more advanced techniques like using callbacks , namespaces , Capistrano variables and the deprec gem .
Jonathan took over again and introduced Webistrano , the web GUI he created to facilitate deployment with Capistrano and Macistrano , a little tool written by Mathias , to have deployment tools handy on our Aqua desktops .
Afterwards , it was time to get our hands dirty .
Jonathan and Mathias had brought a mighty quad - core machine with 40 virtual servers so people could try out deploying the Railscasts website by Ryan Bates .
Jonathan also showed how to configure Apache with mod_proxy_balancer to proxy dynamic requests to a cluster of Mongrels .
Finally , they demonstrated how to deploy the same application with Phusion Passenger ( great for people like me who are thinking about switching to PP for production ) .
After some initial difficulties ( turns out an AirPort Express is n’t really suited for servicing a couple dozen synchronous connections )
I think all folks took away a lot from the practical part .
In the last part , Jonathan gave a brief overview about tools for monitoring Rails .
It was especially cool to see how easily you can configure Monit with its ultra-easy DSL for basic monitoring on Rails ( and other services ) .
Lastly , it was Q&A .
Jonathan said that in his opinion memcached is the best caching solution available for Rails if you need really fast caching .
He also likes God as an alternative to Monit ( which has readable syntax because it ’s Ruby ) but prefers Monit since it is “ older ” and therefore has a proven track record .
All in all , this was a really valuable talk and Jonathan and Mathias have a great way of presenting and also engaging with the audience during the practical part .
Thumbs up .

Panel discussion
David Heinemeier Hansson , Jeremy Kemper , Michael Koziarski
David started the panel discussion with talking about three upcoming releases that are due to be released during RailsConf ( 2.0.4 and 2.1.1 , which will , among other things , contain REXML fixes , and also a 2.2 beta ) .
We also found out that most of the folks at RailsConf use Rails 2 now and it ’s only a few people who are still , dare I say , stuck with Rails 1.2 – which is good because the core team wants to cut back the efforts on 1.2 so they do n’t really know how long it ’s going to be supported .
What ’s good and what ’s bad about the way that the whole Rails system is moving ?
David especially likes that the ecosystem is growing and that people are blogging about Rails and sharing their stuff .
At the same time , he thinks there ’s lots of companies and individuals with lots of great code just sitting in their lib and vendor directories and rotting away .
Future of Test :: Unit in Rails , because there ’s rspec and others ?
David would like to get rid of long underscored test names and he ’d like to see the word “ should ” more often .
In fact , some of the new stuff in Rails edge even started using the “ new style ” where you supply the test name as a string .
Jeremy , Koz and David agree that the learning curve of Test :: Unit is more user - friendly than rspec because you do n’t need to wrap your head around the whole idea of behavior driven development .
David thinks that , after all , everybody should use what suits them best .
Future of web apps – Sproutcore / MVC in the browser ?
David is not a big fan of the idea of pushing more logic onto the browser .
“ The more stuff you take out of the application , the more stuff you have to write in a language other than Ruby – not good ! ” ( Could n’t agree more ;- ) ) .
Jeremy thinks that Sproutcore is the framework that has evolved best and has actually done some real integration and bridging the gaps between the server and the browser .
Are Gems the best way to publish and manage plugins ?
Jeremy thinks that lots of plugins are actually very small and independent of each other so they do n’t really need to be Gems and probably should n’t be .
So he thinks that plugins will stick around in the future but the bigger plugins should be distributed as Gems .
Influence of Merb on Rails ?
( thread safety , performance , etc. )
Jeremy thinks that there ’s definitely light competition going on and Rails does definitely learn a thing or two from Merb ( and vice versa ) .
Koz says that Rails still tries to build the best web application framework there is .
As far as performance goes , he hates “ Hello World ” benchmarks because they do n’t show the real world performance .
Which Ruby implementation should be used ?
Koz ’ customers mostly use the current MRI ( 1.8.6 ) but thinks that JRuby is coming along really well and that it ’s important .
Jeremy agrees and also mentions MagLev as a future possibility .
RubySpec is the future because it shows how far and how well Ruby has been implemented by the respective implementation .
Other frameworks that are interesting to the core members and what are they playing with ?
Koz evades the question ( “ I ’m a Rails consultant ” ) but states that he ’s definitely interested in alternative data stores and persistence technologies such as object - oriented DBs and CouchDB .
David is interested in clouding and distributed system technologies ( “ Having your own machine is like carrying your own electricity ” ) .
Jeremy thinks that Sysadmins should pick up convention over configuration to achieve this ( chch ) .
Differences between European and US conferences and other ones ?
Koz likes smaller conferences because it ’s less frantic and you can have conversations with people .
He also likes that it gives new people opportunities to speak .
David loves that RailsConf US is a special experience because it ’s about being part of the crowd which has a different kind of energy and atmosphere ( “ It has the big , block - buster kind of mentality . ” ) .
He likes that big conferences have lots of applications for talks which , all in all , increases the quality .
Sweet spots for Rails applications ( apart from the whole scaling debate ) ?
Koz thinks that Rails usually fits the problem from a technical perspective but it does n’t always fit the business – if the team or the company does n’t accept Rails , it ’s not right for them ( “ It ’s not about technology , it ’s about culture . ” ) .
David agrees and adds that he sometimes thinks that he ’d sometimes like if people would n’t force Rails on people .

Jeff Rubin , Chief Economist at CIBC World Markets , in a recent report , is now saying that the current recession is caused by high oil prices .
Defaulting mortgages are only a symptom of the high oil prices .
We should be blaming the underlying cause -- higher oil prices -- rather than the symptom .
These higher oil prices caused Japan and the Eurozone to enter into a recession even before the most recent financial problems hit .
Higher oil prices started four of the last five world recessions ; we should n't be too surprised if they started this one also .
According to Rubin :
Oil shocks create global recessions by transferring billions of dollars of income from economies where consumers spend every cent they have , and then some , to economies that sport the highest savings rates in the world .
While those petro- dollars may get recycled back to Wall Street by sovereign wealth fund investments , they do n’t all get recycled back into world demand .
The leakage , as income is transferred to countries with savings rates as high as 50 % , is what makes this income transfer far from demand neutral .
One of the reason that Rubin does n't feel that real estate problems are the cause of the current recession is because the geography is n't right .
How could real estate prices in Cleveland cause a recession in Japan and the Eurozone ?
Also , the dollars involved in the oil price shock are much greater than the real estate would have on the economy .
According to Rubin :
By any benchmark the economic cost of the recent rise in oil prices is nothing short of staggering .
A lot more staggering than the impact of plunging housing prices on housing starts and construction jobs , which has been the most obvious brake on economic growth from the housing market crash .
And those energy costs , unlike the massive asset writedowns associated with the housing market crash , were borne largely by Main Street , not Wall Street , in both America and throughout the world .
According to Jeff Rubin ( and his co-author Peter Buchanan in part of the material ) , the recent price spike , measuring from 2002 to the $ 147 high in 2008 was 500 % + , far greater than any of the past price spikes .
Figure 2 - Recent price spike is far larger than prior price spikes
This big increase in oil prices has caused the annual fuel bill of OECD countries to increase by more than $ 700 billion a year , with $ 400 billion of this going to OPEC countries .
He asks :
Transfers a fraction of today ’s size caused world recessions in the past .
Why should n’t they today ?
Another issue is timing .
As mentioned previously , Eurozone and Japan entered a recession in the second quarter of 2008 , which was before the spike in LIBOR rates that is associated with the current financial crisis .
Figure 3 - Recession timing is n't right
Rubin observes that it is n't surprising that Eurozone and Japan entered into recession before the United States did .
The United States is less sensitive to oil price spikes because it is itself an oil producer ( 5 million barrels out of 19 million barrels the US consumes are produced in the US ) , so it receives some of the benefit of the higher prices .
An IEA analysis also indicated that it should be less affected by oil price shocks .
Figure 4 - IEA analysis indicates US should be less sensitive to price spikes
Rubin observes that a delay in timing is expected between an oil price hike and a recession :
Some of the best research indicates that it takes about a year for an oil price shock to have its maximum impact on US GDP .
Leading macro and energy economist James Hamilton notes these lags fit the experience of past shocks , including the OPEC - induced recessions of the 1970s .
Among other factors , the unwinding of an involuntary buildup of autos and other durables is a key determinant of the lag structure involved .
It has also been found that a similar lag structure holds for the impact of large declines in oil prices .
The virtual collapse in oil prices to $ 12 / bbl in 1986 was a key driver behind a rebound in US economic growth to a 4 % - plus pace , even in the face of mounting financial costs from the Savings and Loan crisis .
Given that oil prices really took off in the third quarter of last year , after several years of more gradual increases , we should expect to see its maximum hit on the economy right about now .
By the same token , however , the impact from the even larger decline in oil prices over the last two quarters should give its maximum boost to the economy moving into 2009 .
Jeff Rubin then concludes :
If triple - digit oil prices are what started the recession , then $ 60 oil prices are what will end it .
Elsewhere he says :
Of course the bad news is , where do you think oil prices will be once the economy recovers ?
Comments
Based on the last two observations quoted , I would conclude that Jeff Rubin expects the economy to zig-zag in the future , first hitting a low point , and then a new high , and then a low point again .
If peak oil is part of the equation , I would expect the height of the highs to gradually decline , and the depth of the lows to get progressively lower .
The question I have is with respect to his statement , " If triple - digit oil prices are what started the recession , then $ 60 oil prices are what will end it . "
I would agree that lower oil prices are necessary to end the recession , but it is not clear to me that they are sufficient .
It seems to me that we have a different problem at this time - - a barely functioning financial system that governments around the world are trying to bail out .
We also have a vastly oversized financial services industry that needs to collapse to a more reasonable size .
In addition , there is a problem with non-availability of credit .
It seems to me that the problem with non-availability of credit , particularly long - term debt , is ultimately tied in with peak oil .
It is difficult to have more than a tiny amount of long term debt once an economy is no longer growing .
Repaying long - term debt is relatively easy in an economy which is growing , since funds available to pay back debt are greater in the future than they are at the time the debt is incurred .
In a declining economy , it is likely that either there will be many defaults , or that the debt will be paid back with dollars that are worth much less than when the loan was taken out .
Because of these issues , lenders will raise interest rates to such a high level that few projects will generate a high enough rate of return to justify taking out these loans .
I believe that ultimately long term debt will essentially disappear -- but perhaps not for several years .
Unless we can get world 's financial problems worked out , it seems to me that it will be difficult for the economy to get back to business as usual .
Instead , we will find more workarounds like Thailand 's recent rice for oil deal or China 's $ 25 billion loan to Russia in return for oil .
Without a solution , we are likely to have a continued recession .
If the financial problems suddenly take a turn for the worse -- say , the US dollar is no longer the reserve currency , the US economic situation could take a sudden large step downward .

Voters backing same - sex marriage ban

After a heated , divisive campaign , fueled by a record $ 73 million of spending , California voters Tuesday were backing Proposition 8 , which would change the state Constitution to ban same - sex marriage .
With more than half the vote counted , the measure was piling up huge margins in the Central Valley , but losing in every Bay Area county but Solano .
Six months after the California Supreme Court cleared the way for gay and lesbian couples to wed , the estimated 18,000 same - sex couples who took advantage of the landmark decision now wonder if they will be the last .
Opponents of the measure , gathered at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco , tried to put the best face on the disappointing results .
" There are a lot of votes still to count , and we expect the race to go on late tonight and possibly beyond , " said Geoff Kors , executive director of Equality California , the guiding force behind the " No on Prop. 8 " campaign .
Election officials estimated there could be as many as 2 million ballots left to count after election day , mainly from mail ballots that arrived Tuesday .
Supporters of the ban stayed cautiously optimistic .
" We 're confident voters did go to the polls to vote ' yes ' to protect traditional marriage , " said Chip White , a spokesman for the Prop. 8 campaign .
Same - sex marriage bans won easily Tuesday night in Florida and Arizona .
It was a rematch in Arizona , which in 2006 became the only state to ever reject a ban on same - sex marriage .
The campaign in California pitted those who argued that a same - sex marriage ban was nothing more than outdated discrimination against gays and lesbians , and conservatives and Christian groups who countered that the state and the courts have no right to unilaterally change a definition of marriage that has existed for centuries .
The flood of dollars that poured into the state from every part of the country made Prop.
8 the most expensive social issue race the nation has ever seen .
And behind every one of those checks was someone desperately worried about what the election result could mean to them and their state .
To San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and other opponents of Prop. 8 , as well as to religious groups who backed the measure , the proposed ban on same - sex marriage was the second - most - important election in the country Tuesday .
The Prop. 8 battle , born in San Francisco , came eight years after more than 61 percent of California voters came out in favor of Prop. 22 , which banned same - sex marriage in the state .
But supporters had little time to savor the victory .
In 2004 , Newsom set off a political and social explosion when he ordered marriage licenses issued to same - sex couples in the city .
Gay and lesbian couples flocked to the city , showing up in wedding dresses and tuxes for the chance to be legally married .
Despite outraged reaction from across the state and nation , Newsom did n't back down until a court ordered the city to stop issuing the same - sex licenses .
In 2005 and 2007 , the Legislature passed bills that would have allowed same - sex marriage , but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed them .
In 2006 , the state Supreme Court voted unanimously to hear several challenges to same - sex marriage and rule on them .
Opponents of same - sex marriage were ready with a challenge that became Prop .
8 .
Worried that a governor after Schwarzenegger would sign a same - sex marriage bill or that the court would rule against them , Prop. 22 supporters began putting together another initiative drive to make the same - sex marriage ban part of the California Constitution , beyond the reach of either the Legislature or the courts .
They raised the money and gathered more than 1.1 million signatures by this spring .
On May 15 , the state Supreme Court cleared the way for same - sex marriage .
The court voted 4 - 3 to overturn Prop. 22 and the same - sex marriage ban , ruling that the state Constitution provided a right to marry that extends to same - sex couples .
The three dissenting justices argued that it was up to the voters or the Legislature , not the court , to permit same - sex marriage , a view quickly taken up by opponents of the ruling .
" Four judges ignored 4 million voters and imposed same - sex marriage on California , " Prop. 8 supporters said in a TV ad .
" It 's no longer about tolerance .
Acceptance of gay marriage is now mandatory . "
It was an argument that continued all the way to election day .
But with same - sex marriage legal in California , opponents of Prop. 8 could run a totally different campaign from the type that had lost virtually every election over the issue across the nation .
Rather than arguing for same - sex marriage , opponents took the moral high ground atop the Supreme Court decision and argued that a vote for Prop. 8 was a vote for discrimination .
They got another bit of help when state Attorney General Jerry Brown ordered the Prop.
8 ballot language changed to say that it " eliminates the rights of same - sex couples to marry . "
Prop. 8 backers charged that politics , not legal rectitude , was behind Brown 's decision .
They went to court , but lost .
That allowed Prop. 8 opponents , worried that many voters were not enamored with the idea of same - sex marriage , to run a TV campaign that almost never mentioned gays or lesbians or showed them in an ad .
Instead , the ads charged that Prop. 8 supporters wanted to take away rights from a single , unnamed group of people , which just was n't fair .
" Proposition 8 would be a terrible mistake for California , " Sen .
Dianne Feinstein said in a " No on Prop. 8 " ad in the final week of the campaign .
" It 's about discrimination , and we must always say no to that . "
That pitch also was a big help for the Democratic presidential ticket .
Both Barack Obama and Joe Biden could give 100 percent support to the campaign 's efforts to preserve rights , even though neither of them supports same - sex marriage .
Middle - of - the - road voters were the prize in the campaign , and both sides geared their efforts toward grabbing them .
" There are about 40 percent of the voters on each side , and nothing will move them , " said Steve Smith , political consultant for the " No on Prop. 8 " effort .
" Then there 's the other 20 percent that seems to change their mind every day .
That 's who we concentrate on . "
The fight for undecided voters left each side battling around the edges of an issue that seemed straightforward enough : Should gay and lesbian couples be allowed to marry in California ?
DIGG THIS
Dear Messrs . Obama and McCain ,
I hope you do not take offense at my having the impudence to write you a letter on the eve of the most important day in each of your lives , but I was hoping that you might be able to take a few moments out of your regal schedules to speak with me .
I ordinarily would not even dream of addressing your royal highnesses , but I was heartened to see each of you speaking with another blue - collared working man like myself a few days ago , and I thought I might be able to present my petition to both of you before the election takes place , and the winner gets swept up in the galas , princely feasts , and other perks of having secured the most prestigious and powerful post in the history of the world .
Though neither of you have ever met me , ( nor ever will meet me , I ’m sure ) , I am fully aware that in just a matter of hours one of you is scheduled to become the new Father of the Fatherland , and thus my newly appointed Master .
I know you prefer other , less ostentatious titles , given how committed each of you is to the virtue of humility , but allow me to be frank with you for a moment and acknowledge how much power one of you will shortly hold over me and every other child of the Fatherland .
I know that the power of the position will endow one of you with the political muscle to ruin my entire life , allow me to continue to eek out my current miserable existence , such as it now is , or even elevate me in the public realm to any heights that might suit your fancy .
And so , if your highnesses will oblige me , I come now to my humble plea .
I do not prostrate myself before you today requesting a subsidy or other corporate bailout , as I ’m sure you were expecting , given the current , fascist economic environment .
Nor do I come to in the hope of securing some of that very lucrative pork that oozes out of the halls of the U.S. Congress .
Nor still do I come to you in the hope that you might be willing to shed innocent American blood to attack some remote and irrelevant foreign people .
As I ’m sure that both of you already have more than enough sycophants clinging to your heels in the hope of securing these favors , I humbly approach you today in the hope of securing a very different boon .
The simple request that I place before you today is for you to put a price tag on my own freedom so that I might be able to purchase my liberty from you and the rest of the behemoth Federal government .
I fully realize that it would initially be costly for you to release me from my current indentured position , ( since I currently and involuntarily pay approximately 50 % of my income to the Federal government in the form of income taxes , excise taxes , inflation taxes , gasoline taxes , etc. ) , but , if you will indulge me still further , I think I can show you why this would be a mutually beneficial exchange .
That is , I think I might be able to convince you that it would be better for both you and me if you allow me to purchase my liberty .
The primary reason why you will benefit from selling me my own liberty is that I will no longer be a threat to your position .
I know you might not view a man like me , a lowly roofer , as a threat to the most powerful man in human history — but I am .
I am a threat because I value my individual liberty more highly than any other article in this world , and I am willing to fight , if necessary , to secure it .
I am also incorrigible in my desire to infect the rest of the American populace with the idea that individual liberty is the highest good to be secured in this world .
As such , I , ( along with other men such as myself ) , represent the most pernicious threat to your authority and future existence as the most powerful man in human history .
And , should those of us who value individual liberty above all goods unite into a common force , your position as the most powerful man in history would quickly dissolve into empty dreams of despotism .
For , you see , governments even as powerful as the one you hope to become master of this week ultimately rest upon nothing more than the common assent or common apathy of the mass of men who suffer under their yokes .
The overwhelming mass of ordinary men , from Mark the Roofer to Joe the Plumber , can , and sometimes do , rise up and cast off the chains of servitude that men like you all too often take for granted .
Given these inexorable facts , I come before you today in the hope that you might name a price for my freedom .
There is , in fact , precedent for this type of exchange in colonial American history .
In colonial America , it was common practice for English and Irish peasants to indenture themselves to wealthy farmers and plantation owners in the American colonies in exchange for transport to the colonies .
Over time , these indentured servants were usually able to purchase their freedom in full from their masters .
You can think of your sale of my liberty to me in this light , if it makes you feel any better about the exchange .
I will overlook the fact that my liberty derives from God and not from you , if you will only promise me that your iron grip will no longer be felt upon my neck or my checkbook once the exchange is final .
In conclusion , I thank your royal highnesses for having the patience to entertain a plea from a man as lowly as myself .
I hope to hear back from the victor about the price of my liberty at his earliest possible convenience — after he has had a chance to satisfy his various appetites at the sumptuous feasts that await him this week , of course .
I will be on the roof during that time , working under the sun with my hands to pay the taxes that fund your majestic existence , and contemplating the consequences of your failure to sell me what is rightfully mine .
Sincerely , Mark the Roofer
The Best of Mark R. Crovelli

HATE , FEAR , AND IGNORANCE ….
On CNN last night , David Gergen , a Republican advisor to Presidents Nixon , Ford , Reagan , and Clinton , commented on the “ anger ” evident at McCain / Palin rallies of late .
“ There is this free floating sort of whipping around anger that could really lead to some violence , ” Gergen said .
“ I think we ’re not far from that . ”
When Anderson Cooper expressed skepticism about whether violence was likely , Gergen said he “ really worries ” given “ the kind of rhetoric ” coming from the Republican ticket .
When a mainstream , Republican presidential advisor goes on national television and expresses concern that Republican voters might literally become violent in response to the Republican presidential ticket ’s rhetoric , it ’s safe to say we ’ve reached a rather dramatic point .
This week has been unusually incendiary .
The McCain campaign has deliberately been whipping the angry , far - right Republican base into a frenzy .
That includes increasing frequency of “ Hussein ” references , but it also includes looking the other way while campaign supporters exclaim “ treason ! , ” “ terrorist ! , ” and “ kill him ! ” during official rallies .
On Wednesday , during a McCain harangue against Obama , one man could be heard yelling , “ Off with his head ! ”
On Thursday , Republicans erupted when an unhinged McCain supporter ranted about “ socialists taking over our country . ”
Instead of calming them down , McCain said the lunatic was “ right . ”
The Republicans want an angry mob , they need hysterical supporters , and so they ’ve stoked the fires of hate , fear , and ignorance .
It ’s become a surprisingly toxic cocktail .
Both the Washington Post and the Politico have good items today on the explosive , enraged emotions at this week ’s Republican rallies .
Slate ’s John Dickerson described the participants ’ “ bloodthirsty ” tone .
There are , obviously , more than a few questions to consider .
Will McCain / Palin push their enraged mob into committing acts of violence ?
( We can hope not . )
Will the hysterical Republican base consider Obama / Biden legitimate if they win in November ?
( I doubt it . )
And then there ’s the practical question : will the combination of hate , fear , and ignorance actually pay off on Election Day ?
Polls show Obama leading now , but the truth is , most of these polls were taken before McCain turned the Rage - o’- Meter to 11 .
How will mainstream voters react ?
Time will obviously answer that question soon enough , but I found John Weaver ’s perspective especially interesting .
John Weaver , McCain ’s former top strategist , said top Republicans have a responsibility to temper this behavior .
“ People need to understand , for moral reasons and the protection of our civil society , the differences with Senator Obama are ideological , based on clear differences on policy and a lack of experience compared to Senator McCain , ” Weaver said .
“ And from a purely practical political vantage point , please find me a swing voter , an undecided independent , or a torn female voter that finds an angry mob mentality attractive . ”
Weaver added that the Republican Party should be “ ashamed ” if it allows this to continue .
Given what we ’ve seen of late , they should be ashamed anyway .
This is Obama 's chance to take away the news cycle from McCain and expose what a fraud he is about his economic approach .
McCain suddenly wants to be a reformer .
Well , what was he doing all these years in Congress to reform Wall St? Nothing .

Make no mistake : my opponent is running for four more years of policies that will throw the economy further out of balance .
His outrage at Wall Street would be more convincing if he was n't offering them more tax cuts .
His call for fiscal responsibility would be believable if he was n't for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , and more of a trillion dollar war in Iraq paid for with deficit spending and borrowing from foreign creditors like China .
His newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement .
John McCain cannot be trusted to reestablish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason : he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it .
They call this the ownership society but what it really means is you 're on your own .
And we know the results ...
And McCain 's admitting that conservatism does not work .
He has to run away from his own party and his own words to try save himself from the incredible collapse on The Street .
America is watching now .
McCain , May 29 , 2007 :
" You are interviewing the greatest free trader you will ever interview , and the greatest deregulator you will ever interview , " he said .
We all have to follow rules in our lives , register our cars , get a license to drive , but to McCain --- corporations need NO regulations .
Well , if AIG goes next --- good night now .... ( Youtube and transcript under the fold )

No - on - 8 folks , this is n't necessary .
Lord knows the other side , if you will , is just waiting for the stop Prop.
8 movement to use its salad fork during the entree course , so let 's keep venom such as the above -- found in Noe Valley , shot on Sanchez Street from the Castro -- to a minimum .
Really , this is almost as hateful as the people who voted for Prop .

If you �re a US Citizen ( and even if you �re not ) , ask yourself one important question with reference to Iraq :
Have you ever heard of Bremer�s 100 orders ?
If the answer is " no " then you don�t understand the true destruction of Iraq .
This is not altogether something to be ashamed of ; the media , led by Murdoch�s " FOX News " has deliberately refrained from covering the laws in any detail , mostly because if they did reveal the extent of the destruction , good American citizens would be outraged .
But Bremer�s 100 orders destroyed Iraq�s economy not just for years but for decades to come .
It undid some historical things dating back ten thousand years .
I wish that was an exaggeration , but it�s not .
Iraq is home to the oldest agricultural traditions in the world .
Historical , genetic and archaeological evidence , including radiocarbon dating of carbon - containing materials at the site , show that the Fertile Crescent , including modern Iraq , was the center of domestication for a remarkable array of today�s primary agricultural crops and livestock animals .
Wheat , barley , rye , lentils , sheep , goats , and pigs were all originally brought under human control around 8000 BCE .
Iraq is where wild wheat was once originated and many of its cereal varieties have been exported and adapted worldwide .
The beginning of agriculture led inexorably to the development of human civilization .
Since then , the inhabitants of Mesopotamia have used informal seed supply systems to plant crops , suited to their particular environment .
The saving and sharing of seeds in Iraq has always been a largely informal matter .
Local varieties of grain and legumes have been adapted to local conditions over the millennia .
While much has changed in the ensuing millennia , agriculture remains an essential part of Iraq�s heritage .
Despite extreme aridity , characterized by low rainfalls and soil salinity , Iraq had a world standard agricultural sector producing good quality food for generations .
According to the Rome - based UN Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) , 97 percent of Iraqi farmers in 2002 still used saved seed from their own stocks from last year�s harvest , or purchased from local markets .
Source - Global Research
So the scene is set .
In 2002 things have been unchanged for centuries .
Why break a system that worked ?
Then Bremer came along with the answer : We�ll break a system that works for Iraq , because doing so will generate profit for America .
Bremer wasn�t the first choice for the job .
In the aftermath of invasion , the Coalition Provisional Authority was originally led by Lt General Jay Garner , who had plans to actually help Iraq by trying to direct the CPA to give control back to Iraqis as soon as possible and hold elections as soon as was practically possible .
Alas for Lt General Garner , the Bush administration didn�t want this .
Lt General Garner was summarily sacked from the role within a month , and Paul Bremer appointed to the job .
Bremer , under orders from the administration and it�s corporate masters , began systematically destroying any chance the Iraqis had of putting their country back together , in what has since become known as Bremer�s 100 orders .
In one hundred orders , Bremer set about the destruction of ten thousand years of working economy in Iraq .
Even now it�s extremely difficult for an interested party reading an article like this to get a straightforward list of all 100 orders and what they do , so for the sake of clarity we will focus on a few of the most destructive orders .
Order No. 39 allows for : ( 1 ) privatization of Iraq�s 200 state - owned enterprises ; ( 2 ) 100 % foreign ownership of Iraqi businesses ; ( 3 ) 'national treatment � - which means no preferences for local over foreign businesses ; ( 4 ) unrestricted , tax - free remittance of all profits and other funds ; and ( 5 ) 40 - year ownership licenses " , wrote Antonia Juhasz , a project director at the International Forum on Globalization in San Francisco ( LATimes , August 05 , 2004 ) .
Now one might argue that quite a number of Western states already do things this way , and that wouldn�t be inaccurate .
However , Iraq has never done things that way , and neither have any of it�s neighbors .
The state ran everything prior to 2002 .
In combination with the crippling sanctions that had been imposed on the Iraqi people by the United Nations when it was accepting as fact the lies the Bush administration was telling about WMD , this meant that suddenly anyone could buy anything in Iraq , but the Iraqi people who SHOULD have been first on the list were broke , and couldn�t afford to buy anything .
So it was all sold to other countries , on 40 year ownership licenses that prevent this damage from being undone until 2042 at the very soonest .
With NO requirement to re-invest in Iraq , no tax to pay and very few limits , this opened up the Iraqi economy to completely unfettered competition from foreign investment .
The only block to this Republican Utopia was that the Coalition Provisional Authority granted the licenses , which of course they made sure that they punished the countries unwilling to back them in war , and rewarded those that did back them .
Since the " Coalition of the Willing " to all intents and purposes only consisted at that time of the US and the UK this meant that the bulk of these 40 year licenses were granted to US companies .
In other words , not only could the Iraqi people see a military occupation , but they could also see their commerce being taken over for the next 40 years by a corporate occupation .
From the same article quoted above : " Order No. 17 grants foreign contractors , including private security firms , full immunity from Iraq�s laws .
Even if they , say , kill someone or cause an environmental disaster , the injured party cannot turn to the Iraqi legal system .
Rather , the charges must be brought to U.S. courts " .
So we not only have foreign companies able to buy all the commerce and 50 % of the banks in Iraq , and not being obliged to employ Iraqis to run it , but anyone they DO employ to run it becomes immune from Iraq�s laws , owing to being a foreign contractor .
And even worse , they can employ their own armed " private security " - which Blackwater USA were immediately offering as a �service� - which is also immune from any kind of prosecution .
This led to the situation we�ve seen on YouTube where armored vehicles escorting foreign contractors are driving along Iraq�s streets smashing any Iraqi car that gets in their way to one side .
They don�t have to obey the law .
It �s a two tier society , and they �re the upper tier .
( and yes , I know that video clip starts with an excerpt from the film " Aliens " but that excerpt just shows the mindset of the drivers ) .
In ANY OTHER COUNTRY , America included , NOBODY would be allowed to just ram vehicles out of the way - yet Bremer has allowed that in Iraq , for the next 40 years , and there�s no shortage of Blackwater USA macho Rambo�s prepared to do it .
" Orders No. 57 and No. 77 ensure the implementation of the orders by placing U.S. - appointed auditors and inspector generals in every government ministry , with five - year terms and with sweeping authority over contracts , programs , employees and regulations " .
There is to be NO change , and these orders reinforce that .
There is to be NO going back to having things run by the Iraqis , for the Iraqis .
That �s not the way corporations want things done .
Iraq is to be a safe haven for corporations to do whatever the hell they like , when they like , to who they like .
And anyone who gets in their way is a terrorist .
Now we come to the worst order of all .
Order 81 .
Again from Global Research : Order 81 deals specifically with Plant Variety Protection ( PVP ) because it is designed to protect the commercial interests of corporate seed companies .
Its aim is to force Iraqi farmers to plant so - called " protected " crop varieties ' defined as new , distinct uniform and stable� , and most likely genetically modified .
This means Iraqi farmers will have one choice ; to buy PVP registered seeds .
Order 81 opens the way for patenting ( ownership ) of plant forms , and facilitates the introduction of genetically modified crops or organisms ( GMOs ) to Iraq .
U.S. agricultural biotechnology corporations , such as Monsanto and Syngenta will be the beneficiaries .
Iraqi farmers will be forced to buy their seeds from these corporations .
GMOs will replace the old tradition of breeding closely related plants , and replace them with organisms composed of DNA from an altogether different species , e.g. , bacterium genes into corn .
In the long run , there won�t be a big enough gene pool for genetic viability .
It should be noted here that Monsanto have deep connections to the Bush administration .
They also create a special genetically modified grain seed that works well with their own brand of pesticide , because part of its genetic modification is an immunity to the toxins in that particular pesticide .
Unfortunately , nothing else is immune , and the pesticide ruthlessly poisons ANY other plant life except the genetically modified grain .
Also when the pesticide is absorbed into the soil , the fields it was deployed in won�t grow any other crop but the Monsanto GM grain until the pesticide�s effects diminish - by which time anyone trying to reverse the usage of Monsanto products would long since have gone bankrupt .
if a large international corporation developed a seed variety resistant to a particular Iraqi pest , and an Iraqi farmer was growing another variety that did the same , it was illegal for the farmer to save his own seed .
Instead , he is obliged to pay a royalty fee for using Monsanto�s GMO seed .
Upon purchasing the patented seeds , farmers must sign the company�s technology agreement ( Technology User Agreements ) .
This agreement allows the company to control farmers � practices and conduct property investigation .
The farmer becomes the slave of the company .
Order 81 ignores Iraqi farmers � old traditions of saving seeds , and using their knowledge to breed and plant their crops .
It also brutally disregards the contributions which Iraqi farmers have made over hundreds of generations to the development of important crops like wheat , barley , dates and pulses .
If anybody owns those varieties and their unique virtues , it is the families who bred them , even though nobody has described or characterized them in terms of their genetic makeup .
If anything , the new law � in allowing old varieties to be genetically manipulated or otherwise modified and then " registered " � involves the theft of inherited intellectual property , the loss of farmers � freedoms , and the destruction of food sovereignty in Iraq .
Like U.S. farmers , Iraqi farmers will be " harassed for doing what they have always done . "
For example , Iraqi farmers can be sued by Monsanto , if their non-GMO crops are polluted by GMO crops planted in their vicinity .
The health and environmental consequences of GMO crops are still unknown .
GMO - based agriculture definitely encourages monoculture and genetic pollution .
Moreover , this will further increase the already polluted Iraqi environment as a result of tens of thousands of tons of ' depleted � uranium dust , napalm , chemical weapons , and phosphorous bombs .
Farmers will also be required to buy fertilizers , herbicides and insecticides , against plants disease .
Iraqi farmers will be required to pay royalties for the new seeds and they will be forbidden from saving seeds .
In other words , Iraqi farmers will become agricultural producers for export , a recipe for the introduction of hunger in Iraq , not unknown in many developing countries .
Evidence shows that Western " bio-prospectors " have been using indigenous genetic material taken from their traditional owners .
It is this kind of looting or " biopiracy " that is contributing to the destruction of farmers in the developing world , because they have lost control of what they sow , grow , reap and eat .

When you consider the destruction done to Iraq by Bremer�s 100 orders you start to see why the unemployed , angry , penniless Iraqi people are so upset at the occupation .
You start to see why when someone like Sadr comes along and promises a return to old values , that �s so tempting .
You can see why Maliki absolutely HAS to stop other parties that might run on a " get the occupier out " ticket from competing against him in elections .
In researching this article I alternated between tears and anger at what I was finding .
Before I close - this shameful state of affairs , although instituted by the Bush administration , was tacitly condoned by the ENTIRE REST OF THE WORLD who have just stood by and let this happen without objection .
They share the blame .
They share the responsibillity .
What has happened to Iraq is not the fault of one nation , but the fault of a failing of nations and nobody should point fingers at other people without accepting some of the blame themselves .
How this blatant illegal occupation has been allowed to rape and destroy a nation is a thing that everyone , everywhere should be disgusted about .

Just a short note about some half - formed thoughts on the subject of monads and reasoning .
Haskell types and total functions , at least for a suitable subset of Haskell , form a category , with types and functions as the objects and arrows .
Haskell code is usually full of expressions whose types do n't correspond to arrows ( e.g.. ) .
But in category theory we can only really talk of objects and arrows , not elements of objects .
Many categories are made up of objects that have no reasonable notion of an element .
By writing code in pointfree style we can eliminate reference to individual elements and talk only about arrows .
For example , supposeand .
Then we can definein a couple of different ways .
Pointfree : or pointful : For examples as simple as this it's not hard to write code that will translate between one style and the other .
But the former definition has an advantage , it works in any category .
We 'll consider a very simple example .
Let R be the category of real numbers , where there is an arrow from x to y if x≤y .
We can think of f and g as arrows in this category .
If we know A≤B and B≤C then the first definition above tells us how to construct an arrow from A to C and hence it proves that A≤C .
The second definition makes no sense because it relies on the notion of x as an element of A and uses the functions f and g to construct elements of B and C .
These words hold no meaning in the category R where the arrows are n't functions and the objects are n't containers of elements .
Except that 's not quite true .
Because there is a scheme for translating the second pointful definition to pointfree form , the second definition does in fact provide a proof that A≤C .
We just have to bear in mind that the proof needs to be translated into pointfree form first .
In fact , we can happily spend our day using pointful style to generate proofs about R , as long as at the end of the day we translate our proofs to pointfree notation .
In fact , Haskell programmers know that it's often much easier to write programs in pointful style so it seems reasonable to guess that there are many proofs that are easier to write in pointful style even though they can't be interpreted literally .
Philosophically this is a bit weird .
As long as we restrict ourselves to chains of reasoning that can be translated , we can use intuitions about elements of objects to make valid deductions about domains where these notions make no sense .
Part I of Lambek and Scott is about the correct pointful language to use when talking about cartesian closed categories ( CCCs ) .
They use a form of typed lambda calculus .
Every arrow in a cartesian category can be written as a pointful lambda expression .
Even though there is n't a meaningful way to assign meaning to the ' points ' individually , every lambda abstraction gives an arrow in a cartesian closed category that can be built using the standard parts that come with a CCC , and vice versa .
The pointful definition ofabove is an example .
Here 's a ( very ) slightly less trivial example .
Givenandwe can defineasAgain , that code can be translated into pointfree form using only the standard parts available in a cartesian closed category .
Actually , we only need a category with products and coproducts for this example .
So consider a lattice .
The above code can be translated into a proof that A∩C≤B∪D .
( I 'm using cap and cup for join and meet . )
Again , it makes no sense to talk of elements of a general lattice as containers of elements , and yet after translation to pointfree notation we have a valid proof .
If you can restrict yourself to a suitable subset of set theory then your proofs involving elements of objects can carry over to many other categories .
Part II of Lambek and Scott is about taking this idea to extremes .
It 's about categories known as toposes .
A topos is a category that is even more like the category of sets than a CCC .
It 's still general enough that there are many kinds of toposes , but you can use a sizable portion of first order logic and ZF to make deductions about them .
Again , the literal notion of membership of the objects of a topos might make no sense , but the proofs have a translation to pointfree notation .
In fact , it 's possible to write entire papers in what looks like conventional set theory language , and have them be valid for other toposes .
Anders Kock , for example , writes such papers .
Chris Isham has been arguing that topos theory is the correct framework for physics .
If you interpret your propositions as being in the category Set then you get classical physics .
But those same propositions can be interpreted in other categories , such as one for quantum mechanics , giving a way to use and extend classical language to reason about quantum systems .
This set theory - like language is known as the " internal language " of a topos .
Anyway , I 'm interested in the notion that Haskell do - notation provides another kind of pointful language that can be used to reason about situations where points do n't seem at first to make sense .
Consider the lattice of subsets of a topological space , ordered by inclusion .
Let Cl ( U ) be the closure of U . Cl satisfies these properties : Look familiar ?
If we make this lattice into a category , with arrows being inclusions , then the first property states that Cl is a functor and the next two say that Cl is a monad .
In fact , monads are a kind of generalised closure .
So now suppose we 're given A⊂Cl ( B ) and B⊂Cl ( C ) and wish to prove that A⊂Cl ( C ) .
We can rephrase this by saying that ifandwe need an arrow .
We can write one like this :
Now it 's tempting to interpret the inclusions as functions withsaying thatis the image ofunder the inclusion .
( I do n’t know about you , but when I writeI think to myself “ is the return value from calling ” . )
But that does n't really work because the type ofisbutis of type .
On the other hand , we can radically reinterpret the above as something like this : when arguing about chains of inclusions of subsets of a topological space , as long as at the end of the chain of inclusions you always end up in the closure of some subset , you 're allowed to cheat and nudge a generic point in the closure of a subset back into the original subset .
This is exactly parallel to the way do - notation seems to allow us to extract elements out of monadic objects as long as at the end of the do - block we always return an element of monadic type .
I 'm sure that with a bit of work we could produce a rigorous metatheorem from this .
I also expect we can also produce something similar for comonads .
Anyway , the moral is that when working with categories with monads there are may be some interesting and unusual ways to reason .
The example of the lattice of subsets is fairly trivial but I 'm sure there are other interesting examples .
I also expect there 's a nice connection with modal logic .
I now think of Haskell do - notation as the " internal language " of a category with monads .
Update : I left out the crucial sentences I meant to write .
It 's easy to see do - notation as a kind of Haskell specific trick for making things like IO heavy code look like traditional procedural code .
But comparison with the theory in Lambek and Scott , and Topos Theory in general , makes it clear that do - notation is a member of a family of related languages .

THE LATEST LIST OF CONSERVATIVE + REPUBLICAN CITIZENS AND LEADERS WHO SUPPORT BARACK OBAMA FOR PRESIDENT
Much of this list was excerpted from the blog of John Martin , founder of RepublicansforObama.org .
I thank him for his work in assembling this impressive list and encourage you to visit his site , via the link above .
Other entries were taken from a Wikipedia article on conservative support for Obama .
Note : I have n't had time to keep up with all the Switchers -- I 've been too busy telephoning for Obama the last couple of days .
But please see this post from a blog called the Jed Report for another list of Switchers and almost Switchers ( e.g. , conservative critics of McCain ) .
There are several who are not listed below .

Public Servants :
Colin Powell , Secretary of State , President George W. Bush
" He has met the standard of being a successful president , being an exceptional president .
I think he is a transformational figure .
He is a new generation coming into the world -- onto the world state , onto the American stage , and for that reason I 'll be voting for Senator Barack Obama . "
Scott McClellan , Former Press Secretary to President George W. Bush
" From the beginning I have said I am going to support the candidate that has the best chance for changing the way Washington works and getting things done and I will be voting for Barack Obama and clapping . "
Douglas Kmiec , Head of the Office of Legal Counsel , President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush
" I was first attracted to government by Ronald Reagan , who lives in our national memory as a great leader and an inspiring communicator .
Senator Obama has these gifts as well , but of course , more rhetorical flourish without substance would be worth little .
Is there more to Senator Obama ?
I believe there is . "
Charles Fried , Solicitor General of the United States , President Reagan
" I admire Senator McCain and was glad to help in his campaign , and to be listed as doing so ; but when I concluded that I must vote for Obama for the reason states in my letter , I felt it wrong to appear to be recommending to others a vote that I was not prepared to cast myself . "
Jackson M. Andrews , Republican Counsel to the U.S. Senate
" Barack Obama is a thoughtful visionary leader who as President will end the decline of American law , liberty , and fiscal responsibility that are the hallmarks of the extremist policies of the current Administration , now adopted by John McCain . "
Francis Fukuyama , Adviser to President Reagan
" I ’m voting for Barack Obama this November for a very simple reason .
It is hard to imagine a more disastrous presidency than that of George W. Bush .
...
As a general rule , democracies do n’t work well if voters do not hold political parties accountable for failure .
While John McCain is trying desperately to pretend that he never had anything to do with the Republican Party , I think it would a travesty to reward the Republicans for failure on such a grand scale . "
Rita Hauser , Former White House Intelligence Adviser to President George W. Bush
" McCain will continue the wrong - headed foreign policy decisions of Bush , while Obama will take us in a new direction . "
Larry Hunter , Policy Adviser to President Reagan
" I suspect Obama is more free - market friendly than he lets on .
He taught at the University of Chicago , a hotbed of right - of - center thought .
His economic advisers , notably Austan Goolsbee , recognize that ordinary citizens stand to gain more from open markets than from government meddling . "
Bill Ruckelshaus , Served in the Administrations of Presidents Nixon and Reagan
" I 'm not against McCain , I 'm for Obama . "
Ken Adelman , Served in the Administration of President Ford
" The most important decision John McCain made in his long campaign was deciding on a running mate .
That decision showed appalling lack of judgment ... that selection contradicted McCain 's main two , and best two , themes for his campaign -- Country First , and experience counts .
Neither can he credibly claim , post - Palin pick . "
Lilibet Hagel , Wife of Republican Senator Chuck Hagel
" This election is not about fighting phantom issues churned out by a top - notch slander machine .
Most important , it is not about distracting the public -- you and me -- with whatever slurs someone thinks will stick . "
David Ruder , Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , President Reagan
William Donaldson , Former Chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission , President George W. Bush
Rear Admiral John Hutson , USN ( ret. ) , Former Judge Advocate General of the Navy and Current Dean and President of Franklin Pierce Law Center
Paul O'Neill , United States Secretary of the Treasury , President George W. Bush
Tricia Mosley , Former Staffer to Senator Strom Thurmond
Dr. Samuel Lin , Assistant Surgeon General and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health , Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush
As a longtime Asian American Republican , .... It was not easy to separate from my party 's nominee for president .
... I have become very dissatisfied and distrustful of our reigning national Republican leadership these past eight years because of its continued missteps .
...[ which has ] allowed us to fall into an economic morass , partly due to the home mortgage debacle and partly due to the incredulous expenditures for a mistaken war in Iraq .
... I want a president who is truly committed to the good of this country .
...
And that is one who shows this commitment through the selection of his best qualified successor in the event of his demise or incapacitation . "

Jim Leach , Former Congressman from Iowa
" For me , the national interest comes before party concerns , particularly internationally .
We do need a new direction in American policy , and Obama has a sense of that . "
Lincoln Chafee , Former United States Senator from Rhode Island
" As I look at the candidates in order who to vote for , certainly my kind of conservatism was reflected with Senator Obama , and those points are that we 're fiscally conservative , we care about revenues matching expenditures , we also care about the environment , I think it 's a traditional conservative value to care about clean air and clean water . "
William Weld , Former Governor of Massachusetts
" It 's not often you get a guy with his combination of qualities , chief among which I would say is the deep sense of calm he displays , and I think that 's a product of his equally deep intelligence . "
Arne Carlson , Former Governor of Minnesota
" I think we have in Barack Obama the clear possibility of a truly great president .
I would contend that it 's the most important election of my lifetime . "
Wayne Gilchrest , Congressman from Maryland
" We can't use four more years of the same kind of policy that 's somewhat haphazard , which leads to recklessness . "
Richard Riordan , Former Mayor of Los Angeles
" I 'm still a Republican , but I still will always vote for the person who I think will do the best job . "
Lowell Weicker , Former Governor and Senator from Connecticut
" At issue is not the partisan politics of two parties , rather the image we have of ourselves as Americans .
Senator Obama brings wisdom , kindness , and common sense to what is both his and our quest for a better America . "
Jim Whitaker , Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor
" If we are as a nation concerned with energy , then our consideration should be a national energy policy that is not predicated on crude oil 50 years into the future .
We need to get to it , and I think Barack Obama is very clear in that regard . "
Linwood Holton , Former Governor of Virginia and Father - in - law of Current Governor Tim Kaine ( D - VA )
" Obama has a brain , and he is n't afraid to use it . "
Charles Mathias , Jr. , Former Maryland Senator
" In 1860 , my great - grandfather ran for the Maryland Senate from Frederick on the anti-slavery Republican ticket .
At the top of that ticket was Abraham Lincoln .

BALTIMORE 
The nation 's Catholic bishops are expected to issue a statement Wednesday pledging cooperation with president - elect Barack Obama on numerous social issues but vowing all - out opposition to any law or executive order he may sign advocating abortion rights .
Bishops lined up by the dozens Tuesday to add increasingly harsh language to a preliminary draft of the statement , to be crafted and signed by Cardinal Francis George , Archbishop of Chicago and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
They expressed dismay that the 2008 election , decided in their view on the economy , could be read as well as signifying a tacit approval of Obama 's support for abortion rights .
CHART IT : See how Catholic beliefs compare to other faiths
Their top concern was that Obama had said during the campaign he would sign a Freedom of Choice Act if it passed Congress .
To Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago Thomas Paprocki , that would precipitate a cascade of disasters :
It would " nullify all conscience laws " allowing doctors , nurses and others to object to abortion , and would require abortions to be performed by all hospitals — which could lead to ending obstetrics services in all Catholic hospitals , even to closing the hospitals entirely .
To sell a Catholic hospital to someone who provided abortions would also be " morally unacceptable , " he said .
" I do n't think I am being alarmist , " Paprocki concluded .
The initial draft of the bishops ' statement expressed a " desire to work with the administration " on social issues such as immigration , economic justice and health care for the poor , highlighting that , " the Church is intent on doing good . "
However , " the Church is also intent on opposing evil , " says the next line .
The draft hammered against abortion , saying in part :
" The common good of our country is assured only when the life of every unborn child is legally protected .
Aggressively pro-abortion policies and legislation will permanently alienate tens of millions of Americans and would be interpreted by many Catholics as an attack on the Church . "
Bishop Samuel Aquila of Fargo , N.D. , suggested adding the First Amendment of the Constitution because " the free exercise of religion is what will be under attack . "
Bishop R. Daniel Conlon of Steubenville , Ohio , drew applause when he said , " We are dealing here with an absolute .
There is nothing here that will allow a compromise . "
" Any one of us here would consider it a privilege to die tomorrow — die tomorrow ! — to bring about the end of abortion , " said Auxiliary Bishop Robert Hermann of St. Louis .
Even the phrase " common good " did n't find common acceptance .
Bishop Joseph Martino of Scranton , Pa. , complained that abortion rights advocates , including a group he mocked as " Catholics for Alliance for the so - called Common Good " have drained away all proper understanding of the phrase , making it one about material wealth , not spiritual rightness .
" Do n't let people think common good is a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage , " said Martino .
But Martino was chiefly determined to blast politicians who are " stridently anti-life .
Although the session was billed as a discussion on " Catholic Teaching and Political Life , " it focused entirely on the bishops ' effort to reclaim influence in the wider public square among all Catholics .
Martino , from vice president elect Joe Biden 's home town , insisted , " I cannot have the vice president coming to Scranton and saying he learned his values there when those values are utterly against those of the Catholic Church . "
Cardinal Edward Egan , Archbishop of New York , asked George to " speak clearly and with a punch " so the statement 's message wo n't be lost in the noise of the public square .
George , who will write the final draft , told the bishops , " we have n't succeeded " in past efforts , so new language , stressing mutual responsibility , accountability and community , is needed to connect with the Catholic audience .
They 're speaking to everyone , he said , but it is " Catholics who are under our authority — the word that sends everyone up the wall . "
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) -- --
A group of nearly two dozen world leaders on Saturday reached agreement on a wide - ranging set of proposals to better regulate financial markets .
Their goal is over the next several months to put rules and early - detection systems in place to head off another financial crisis like the one currently damaging economies worldwide .
Declaration : Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy
1 . We , the Leaders of the Group of Twenty , held an initial meeting in Washington on November 15 , 2008 , amid serious challenges to the world economy and financial markets .
We are determined to enhance our cooperation and work together to restore global growth and achieve needed reforms in the world 's financial systems .
2 . Over the past months our countries have taken urgent and exceptional measures to support the global economy and stabilize financial markets .
These efforts must continue .
At the same time , we must lay the foundation for reform to help to ensure that a global crisis , such as this one , does not happen again .
Our work will be guided by a shared belief that market principles , open trade and investment regimes , and effectively regulated financial markets foster the dynamism , innovation , and entrepreneurship that are essential for economic growth , employment , and poverty reduction .
Root Causes of the Current Crisis
3 . During a period of strong global growth , growing capital flows , and prolonged stability earlier this decade , market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence .
At the same time , weak underwriting standards , unsound risk management practices , increasingly complex and opaque financial products , and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system .
Policymakers , regulators and supervisors , in some advanced countries , did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets , keep pace with financial innovation , or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions .
4 . Major underlying factors to the current situation were , among others , inconsistent and insufficiently coordinated macroeconomic policies , inadequate structural reforms , which led to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes .
These developments , together , contributed to excesses and ultimately resulted in severe market disruption .
Actions Taken and to be Taken
5 . We have taken strong and significant actions to date to stimulate our economies , provide liquidity , strengthen the capital of financial institutions , protect savings and deposits , address regulatory deficiencies , unfreeze credit markets , and are working to ensure that international financial institutions ( IFIs ) can provide critical support for the global economy .
6 . But more needs to be done to stabilize financial markets and support economic growth .
Economic momentum is slowing substantially in major economies and the global outlook has weakened .
Many emerging market economies , which helped sustain the world economy this decade , are still experiencing good growth but increasingly are being adversely impacted by the worldwide slowdown .
7 . Against this background of deteriorating economic conditions worldwide , we agreed that a broader policy response is needed , based on closer macroeconomic cooperation , to restore growth , avoid negative spillovers and support emerging market economies and developing countries .
As immediate steps to achieve these objectives , as well as to address longer - term challenges , we will :
Continue our vigorous efforts and take whatever further actions are necessary to stabilize the financial system .
Recognize the importance of monetary policy support , as deemed appropriate to domestic conditions .
Use fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand to rapid effect , as appropriate , while maintaining a policy framework conducive to fiscal sustainability .
Help emerging and developing economies gain access to finance in current difficult financial conditions , including through liquidity facilities and program support .
We stress the International Monetary Fund 's ( IMF ) important role in crisis response , welcome its new short - term liquidity facility , and urge the ongoing review of its instruments and facilities to ensure flexibility .
Encourage the World Bank and other multilateral development banks ( MDBs ) to use their full capacity in support of their development agenda , and we welcome the recent introduction of new facilities by the World Bank in the areas of infrastructure and trade finance .
Ensure that the IMF , World Bank and other MDBs have sufficient resources to continue playing their role in overcoming the crisis .
Common Principles for Reform of Financial Markets
8 . In addition to the actions taken above , we will implement reforms that will strengthen financial markets and regulatory regimes so as to avoid future crises .
Regulation is first and foremost the responsibility of national regulators who constitute the first line of defense against market instability .
However , our financial markets are global in scope , therefore , intensified international cooperation among regulators and strengthening of international standards , where necessary , and their consistent implementation is necessary to protect against adverse cross-border , regional and global developments affecting international financial stability .
Regulators must ensure that their actions support market discipline , avoid potentially adverse impacts on other countries , including regulatory arbitrage , and support competition , dynamism and innovation in the marketplace .
Financial institutions must also bear their responsibility for the turmoil and should do their part to overcome it including by recognizing losses , improving disclosure and strengthening their governance and risk management practices .
9 . We commit to implementing policies consistent with the following common principles for reform .
Strengthening Transparency and Accountability :
We will strengthen financial market transparency , including by enhancing required disclosure on complex financial products and ensuring complete and accurate disclosure by firms of their financial conditions .
Incentives should be aligned to avoid excessive risk - taking .
Enhancing Sound Regulation :
We pledge to strengthen our regulatory regimes , prudential oversight , and risk management , and ensure that all financial markets , products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight , as appropriate to their circumstances .
We will exercise strong oversight over credit rating agencies , consistent with the agreed and strengthened international code of conduct .
We will also make regulatory regimes more effective over the economic cycle , while ensuring that regulation is efficient , does not stifle innovation , and encourages expanded trade in financial products and services .
We commit to transparent assessments of our national regulatory systems .
Promoting Integrity in Financial Markets :
We commit to protect the integrity of the world 's financial markets by bolstering investor and consumer protection , avoiding conflicts of interest , preventing illegal market manipulation , fraudulent activities and abuse , and protecting against illicit finance risks arising from non-cooperative jurisdictions .
We will also promote information sharing , including with respect to jurisdictions that have yet to commit to international standards with respect to bank secrecy and transparency .
Reinforcing International Cooperation :
We call upon our national and regional regulators to formulate their regulations and other measures in a consistent manner .
Regulators should enhance their coordination and cooperation across all segments of financial markets , including with respect to cross - border capital flows .
Regulators and other relevant authorities as a matter of priority should strengthen cooperation on crisis prevention , management , and resolution .
Reforming International Financial Institutions :
We are committed to advancing the reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions so that they can more adequately reflect changing economic weights in the world economy in order to increase their legitimacy and effectiveness .
In this respect , emerging and developing economies , including the poorest countries , should have greater voice and representation .
The Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) must expand urgently to a broader membership of emerging economies , and other major standard setting bodies should promptly review their membership .
The IMF , in collaboration with the expanded FSF and other bodies , should work to better identify vulnerabilities , anticipate potential stresses , and act swiftly to play a key role in crisis response .
Tasking of Ministers and Experts
10 .
We are committed to taking rapid action to implement these principles .
We instruct our Finance Ministers , as coordinated by their 2009 G - 20 leadership ( Brazil , UK , Republic of Korea ) , to initiate processes and a timeline to do so .
An initial list of specific measures is set forth in the attached Action Plan , including high priority actions to be completed prior to March 31 , 2009 .
In consultation with other economies and existing bodies , drawing upon the recommendations of such eminent independent experts as they may appoint , we request our Finance Ministers to formulate additional recommendations , including in the following specific areas :
Mitigating against pro-cyclicality in regulatory policy ;
Reviewing and aligning global accounting standards , particularly for complex securities in times of stress ;
Strengthening the resilience and transparency of credit derivatives markets and reducing their systemic risks , including by improving the infrastructure of over - the - counter markets ;
Reviewing compensation practices as they relate to incentives for risk taking and innovation ;
Reviewing the mandates , governance , and resource requirements of the IFIs ; and
Defining the scope of systemically important institutions and determining their appropriate regulation or oversight .
11 . In view of the role of the G - 20 in financial systems reform , we will meet again by April 30 , 2009 , to review the implementation of the principles and decisions agreed today .
Commitment to an Open Global Economy
12 . We recognize that these reforms will only be successful if grounded in a commitment to free market principles , including the rule of law , respect for private property , open trade and investment , competitive markets , and efficient , effectively regulated financial systems .
These principles are essential to economic growth and prosperity and have lifted millions out of poverty , and have significantly raised the global standard of living .
Recognizing the necessity to improve financial sector regulation , we must avoid over - regulation that would hamper economic growth and exacerbate the contraction of capital flows , including to developing countries .
13 .
We underscore the critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward in times of financial uncertainty .
In this regard , within the next 12 months , we will refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services , imposing new export restrictions , or implementing World Trade Organization ( WTO ) inconsistent measures to stimulate exports .
Further , we shall strive to reach agreement this year on modalities that leads to a successful conclusion to the WTO's Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious and balanced outcome .
We instruct our Trade Ministers to achieve this objective and stand ready to assist directly , as necessary .
We also agree that our countries have the largest stake in the global trading system and therefore each must make the positive contributions necessary to achieve such an outcome .
14 .
We are mindful of the impact of the current crisis on developing countries , particularly the most vulnerable .
We reaffirm the importance of the Millennium Development Goals , the development assistance commitments we have made , and urge both developed and emerging economies to undertake commitments consistent with their capacities and roles in the global economy .
In this regard , we reaffirm the development principles agreed at the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey , Mexico , which emphasized country ownership and mobilizing all sources of financing for development .
15 .
We remain committed to addressing other critical challenges such as energy security and climate change , food security , the rule of law , and the fight against terrorism , poverty and disease .
16 .
As we move forward , we are confident that through continued partnership , cooperation , and multilateralism , we will overcome the challenges before us and restore stability and prosperity to the world economy .
Action Plan to Implement Principles for Reform
This Action Plan sets forth a comprehensive work plan to implement the five agreed principles for reform .
Our finance ministers will work to ensure that the taskings set forth in this Action Plan are fully and vigorously implemented .

Authorities should ensure that temporary measures to restore stability and confidence have minimal distortions and are unwound in a timely , well - sequenced and coordinated manner .
Reforming International Financial Institutions
Immediate Actions by March 31 , 2009
The FSF should expand to a broader membership of emerging economies .
The IMF , with its focus on surveillance , and the expanded FSF , with its focus on standard setting , should strengthen their collaboration , enhancing efforts to better integrate regulatory and supervisory responses into the macro- prudential policy framework and conduct early warning exercises .
The IMF , given its universal membership and core macro- financial expertise , should , in close coordination with the FSF and others , take a leading role in drawing lessons from the current crisis , consistent with its mandate .
We should review the adequacy of the resources of the IMF , the World Bank Group and other multilateral development banks and stand ready to increase them where necessary .
The IFIs should also continue to review and adapt their lending instruments to adequately meet their members ' needs and revise their lending role in the light of the ongoing financial crisis .
We should explore ways to restore emerging and developing countries ' access to credit and resume private capital flows which are critical for sustainable growth and development , including ongoing infrastructure investment .
In cases where severe market disruptions have limited access to the necessary financing for counter - cyclical fiscal policies , multilateral development banks must ensure arrangements are in place to support , as needed , those countries with a good track record and sound policies .
Medium - term actions
 We underscored that the Bretton Woods Institutions must be comprehensively reformed so that they can more adequately reflect changing economic weights in the world economy and be more responsive to future challenges .
Emerging and developing economies should have greater voice and representation in these institutions .
 The IMF should conduct vigorous and even - handed surveillance reviews of all countries , as well as giving greater attention to their financial sectors and better integrating the reviews with the joint IMF / World Bank financial sector assessment programs .
On this basis , the role of the IMF in providing macro- financial policy advice would be strengthened .
 Advanced economies , the IMF , and other international organizations should provide capacity - building programs for emerging market economies and developing countries on the formulation and the implementation of new major regulations , consistent with international standards .
For Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and the people of Bhutan the wait is over .
Two years after his father abdicated , the 28 - year - old prince was yesterday crowned King of the Himalayan nation , becoming both the world 's youngest reigning monarch and head of state of its newest democracy .
The delay between abdication and coronation had been imposed by astrologers who wanted an appropriately auspicious date for the occasion .
It was worth the wait : special guests at the ceremony in Bhutan 's capital , Thimphu , and ordinary citizens who witnessed a public event , were treated to a spectacular piece of regal theatre .
The day - long coronation at the Tashichho Dzong Palace began at dawn when three painted tapestries , each four storeys high and depicting images of the Buddha , were unveiled inside the white - painted building .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
As the sun slowly rose , the prince arrived , led by a procession of red-robed monks , banner - carriers , officials and soldiers in round helmets and armed with swords and black shields .
Priests chanted blessings to the young man seated cross-legged on an ornate golden throne , and then his father , King Jigme Singye Wangchuck , placed the red and black silk " raven crown " on the head of his son and announced that he was now the Druk Gyalpo , or Dragon King .
Throughout , the Oxford - educated young man looked solemn , allowing himself just one brief and fleeting smile .
All the while , monks stood on the surrounding roofs blowing on long horns , clashing cymbals and beating drums .
For sheer colour and theatre , the ceremony would have been hard to beat .
The coronation marks another step in the slow journey towards modernisation for a country that only permitted television and the internet in 1999 .
This year , Bhutan , which has long been an absolute monarchy , held its first parliamentary election .
" His Majesty the King will always play a very important role as a moral force in our country , " the Prime Minister , Jigmi Thinley , voted in by those first elections , said : " The king will be the force that will ensure the long - term sustainability and resilience of democracy . "
The first part of the ceremony was held inside the palace in the centre of Thimphu .
In the afternoon , thousands of people lined up outside were given the chance to present the new king with ceremonial white scarves .
Parts of the ceremony , which also involved dignitaries placing offerings of wine , fruit , food and symbolic objects including an umbrella and fish at the feet of the prince , were re-enacted in a large outdoor amphitheatre .
Tens of thousands turned out for the celebrations that will continue for three days .
" We have walked for more than a week to come , " said Dema , a yak - herder from the Himalayas .
" The king is like our father ; we had to come for his coronation . "
The former king , who announced his abdication in December 2006 , is credited with putting a country that until recently was decidedly medieval and reclusive on the path to modernity .
He also developed the so - called national philosophy of Gross National Happiness , which insists that the spiritual and mental well - being of the country 's 700,000 citizens must be a priority .
Yet for all the glowing affection that people may hold for the former king , Bhutan 's recent history has dark and troubled moments .
In the early 1990s , the country stripped thousands of ethnic Nepalese of their citizenship and forced them into exile , apparently in an attempt to ensure a homogenous culture .
Up to 100,000 refugees have been living in camps in Nepal ever since .
Nor was there much room for political dissidents who clamoured for democracy , such as Rongthong Kunley Dorji , who heads the Druk National Congress , which operates in exile from India .
Mr Dorji , who says that he was forced to flee Bhutan after being jailed and tortured when he was falsely accused of helping refugees , said he welcomed the king 's coronation but hoped the country would work to strengthen human rights .
" We sent the king a letter of congratulations , " he said .
" We are not against the king , but we want democracy and human rights to flourish . "
Yet that journey towards democracy has been slow and not without difficulties .
The election was initially met with much anxiety and scepticism from people who had never known anything other than the rule of the monarch , and who said they did not want to change .
There were also claims that the two parties who contested the election were too close to the royal family .
Critics point out that the People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) is headed by an uncle of the king , and the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa ( DPT ) or Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party , is headed by the now - Prime Minister , Mr Thinley , who is also related to the King through marriage .
A third party which sought to contest the election , the Bhutan People 's United Party ( BPUP ) was disqualified by the Election Commission , which decided it did not have sufficient competence or experience .
Amid this uncertainty , many see the monarchy as a uniting force that has helped preserve Bhutanese culture in a country squeezed between India and China .
After the seizure of Tibet by China , and the absorption of Sikkim by India , Bhutan remains the last of the once - independent Buddhist Himalayan nations .
" This ceremony , it 's not just about crowning a prince , " said Tinle Tenzin , who has a shoe shop in Thimphu .
" It is about a new king who we hope will bring much good for the country and the people in the future . "

' Light ' drinkers tended to be from higher income households Women who drink a small amount of alcohol while pregnant do not increase their child 's risk of behavioural problems , a study has suggested .
The University College London team classed " light " drinking as up to two drinks a week throughout pregnancy .
The study of 12,500 three - year - olds even found a lower risk of some problems in children of such drinkers .
But experts were divided over whether the study was reassuring or could lull women into a false sense of security .
Government advice says pregnant women , or those trying to conceive , should avoid drinking alcohol .
But if they do choose to drink , they should drink no more than one or two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk .
Social advantage
The relationship between sustained heavy drinking in pregnancy and health problems for the child is well - established .
Our study 's findings do raise questions as to whether the current push for policy to recommend complete abstinence during pregnancy is merited
Dr Yvonne Kelly
University College London
' I drank while pregnant ' Q&A : Alcohol and pregnancy
In the most severe cases , it can cause miscarriage or stillbirth , or permanent damage to the growing foetus .
A small number of babies in the most severe cases can be born with " foetal alcohol syndrome " , with symptoms including physical and mental developmental problems .
The University College London team asked mothers about how much alcohol they had drunk during pregnancy when their babies were nine months old .
Light drinking was classed as ranging from one drink every so often to two drinks per week , while moderate drinking was between three and six units per week or three to five per one occasion .
Heavy drinking was regarded as seven or more units per week or at least six per occasion .
While 63 % of the mothers had abstained from alcohol completely during pregnancy , 29 % had been light drinkers , 6 % moderate and 2 % heavy .
Vocabulary tests
The researchers then went back when the children were three to ask about their behaviour and understanding .
The study , published in the International Journal of Epidemiology , found boys born to light drinkers were 40 % less likely to have conduct problems and 30 % less likely to be hyperactive than those whose mothers had abstained .
They also scored more highly on vocabulary tests and on identifying colours , shapes , letters and numbers .
We are concerned that the findings from the UCL study may lull women into a false sense of security
Dr Vivienne Nathanson
British Medical Association Girls born to light drinkers were 30 % less likely to have emotional problems than those born to abstainers , although the researchers say this could be due to family and social backgrounds .
Light drinkers were more likely to be better educated and from higher income households and were less likely to have smoked during pregnancy than abstainers .
Dr Yvonne Kelly , the epidemiologist who led the study , said : " Our research has found that light drinking by pregnant mothers does not increase the risk of behavioural problems and cognitive defects .
" The reasons behind these findings might in part be because light drinkers tend to be more socially advantaged than abstainers , rather than being due to the physical benefits of low level alcohol consumption seen , for example , in heart disease .
" However , it may also be that light - drinking mothers tend to be more relaxed themselves and this contributes to better behavioural and cognitive outcomes in their children . "
Dr Kelly added : " Our study 's findings do raise questions as to whether the current push for policy to recommend complete abstinence during pregnancy is merited and suggest that further research needs to be done . "
' Simplest is safest '
But Dr Vivienne Nathanson , head of science and ethics at the British Medical Association , said : " We are concerned that the findings from the UCL study may lull women into a false sense of security and give them the green light that there is no problem with drinking during pregnancy .
This is not the case .
" So - called ' heavy ' and ' moderate ' drinking harm the unborn baby .
Very light drinking may or may not .
" The BMA believes the simplest and safest advice is for women not to drink alcohol during pregnancy . "
Patrick O'Brien , a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said women should not set out to drink during pregnancy , but that they could be relaxed about the occasional drink .
" This is further evidence that pregnant women should not be worried about having a small amount of alcohol . "

Mayan ruins in Guatemala .
This is an email I recently received from statistician Dr. Richard Mackey who writes :
The following appeared on Gore ’s blog of Nov 19 , 2008 :
Looking Back to Look Forward
Looking Back to Look Forward November 19 , 2008 : 3:04 PM
A new study suggests the Mayan civilization might have collapsed due to environmental disasters :
These models suggest that as ecosystems were destroyed by mismanagement or were transformed by global climatic shifts , the depletion of agricultural and wild foods eventually contributed to the failure of the Maya sociopolitical system , ’ writes environmental archaeologist Kitty Emery of the Florida Museum of Natural History in the current Human Ecology journal .
As we move towards solving the climate crisis , we need to remember the consequences to civilizations that refused to take environmental concerns seriously .
If you have n’t read already read it , take a look at Jared Diamond ’s book , Collapse . ”
This is a most curious reference .
It means that Gore is advocating the abandonment of the IPCC doctrine and barracking for the study and understanding of climate dynamics that ignores totally the IPCC / AWG doctrine and focuses on all the other variables , especially how climate dynamics are driven by atmospheric / oceanic oscillations , the natural internal dynamics of the climate system and the role of the Sun in climate dynamics .
Brian Fagan in Floods , Famines and Emperors El Nino and the fate of civilisations Basic Books 1999 , shows that the Maya collapse , whilst having complex political , sociological , technological and ecological factors , was largely driven by the natural atmospheric / oceanic oscillations of ENSO and NAO .
The book is one of three by Brian Fagan , Prof of Anthropology UC Santa Barbara , that documents how natural climate variations , ultimately driven by solar activity , have given rise to the catastrophic collapse of civilisations .
The book has a chapter on the Mayan civilisation which collapsed around 800 to 900 AD .
Here are some quotes from his book :
“ The “ Classic Maya collapse ” is one of the great controversies of archaeology , but there is little doubt that droughts , fuelled in part by El Nino , played an important role . ”
“ The droughts that afflicted the Maya in the eighth and ninth centuries resulted from complex , still little understood atmosphere - ocean interactions , including El Nino events and major decadal shifts in the North Atlantic Oscillation , as well as two or three decade - long variations in rainfall over many centuries . ”
“ Why did the Maya civilisation suddenly come apart ?
Everyone who studies the Classic Maya collapse agrees that it was brought on by a combination of ecological , political , and sociological factors . ”
“ When the great droughts of the eighth and ninth centuries came , Maya civilisation everywhere was under increasing stress . ”
“ The drought was the final straw . ”
“ The collapse did not come without turmoil and war . ”
Brian Fagan describes how the ruling class ( the kings had divine powers , they were also shamans and there was a vast aristocracy and their fellow - travellers that the tightly regulated workers toiled to maintain ) encouraged population growth beyond what the land could carry ; how the rulers enforced rigid farming practices which were supposed to increase food production and the ruler ’s incomes but had the effect of undermining farm productivity and diminishing the quality of the poor soils of the area .
When there were heavy rains the soil was washed away .
In times of drought the soil blew away .
More quotes from Brian Fagan :
“ The Maya collapse is a cautionary tale in the dangers of using technology and people power to expand the carrying capacity of tropical environments . ”
“ Atmospheric circulation changes far from the Maya homeland delivered the coup de grace to rulers no longer able to control their own destinies because they had exhausted their environmental options in an endless quest for power and prestige . ”
Gore says that we should use our understanding of the Maya collapse help us solve the climate crisis , noting that “ we need to remember the consequences to civilizations that refused to take environmental
concerns seriously ” .
Given what we know of the Maya collapse , what is Gore really saying ?
He is saying that we should take all the IPCC / AWG publications and related papers to the tip and bury them there and put all our efforts into the study and understanding of the reasons for climate dynamics that address every theory except that of IPCC / AWG doctrine .
Specifically , we should understand as well as we can how climate dynamics are driven by atmospheric / oceanic oscillations , the natural internal dynamics of the climate system and the role of the Sun in climate dynamics .
In an overview of his work Brian Fagan concluded : “ The whole course of civilisation … may be seen as a process of trading up on the scale of vulnerability ” .
( Fagan ( 2004 , page xv ) ) .
We are now , as a global community , very high up on that scale .
Allow me to quote a little from my Rhodes Fairbridge paper because of its relevance to Brian Fagan ’s work and what Gore is really trying to say , but ca n’t quite find the right words .
( My paper is here : http://www.griffith.edu.au/conference/ics2007/pdf/ICS176.pdf ) .
“ In his many publications ( for example , NORTH ( 2005 ) ) , Douglass North stresses that if the issues with which we are concerned , such as global warming and the global commons , belong in a world of continuous change ( that is , a non-ergodic world ) , then we face a set of problems that become exceedingly complex .
North stresses that our capacity to deal effectively with uncertainty is essential to our succeeding in a
non-ergodic world .
History shows that regional effects of climate change are highly variable and that the pattern of change is highly variable .
An extremely cold ( or hot ) year can be followed by extremely hot ( or cold ) year .
Warming and cooling will be beneficial for some regions and catastrophic for others .
Brian Fagan has documented in detail relationships between the large - scale and
generally periodic changes in climate and the rise and fall of civilisations , cultures and societies since the dawn of history .
The thesis to which Rhodes Fairbridge devoted much of his life is that the
sun , through its relationships with the solar system , is largely responsible for these changes and that we are now on the cusp of one of the major changes that feature in the planet ’s history .
As
Douglass North showed , the main responsibility of governments in managing the impact of the potentially catastrophic events that arise in a non-ergodic world is to mange society ’s response to them so as to
enable the society to adapt as efficiently as possible to them .
Amongst other things , this would mean being better able to anticipate and manage our response to climate change , to minimise suffering and maximise benefits and the efficiency of our adaptation to a climate that is ever - changing – sometimes catastrophically – but generally predictable within bounds of uncertainty that statisticians can estimate .
At the very least , this requires that the scientific community acts on the wise counsel of Rhodes W Fairbridge and presents governments with advice that has regard to the entire field of planetary - lunar - solar dynamics , including gravitational dynamics .
This field has to be understood so that the dynamics of terrestrial climate can be understood .

Webapp FreeRinger makes free PC - to - phone calls from your browser to over 30 different countries across the globe — or at least that 's the idea .
FreeRinger is powered by another free international calling service , Talkster .
The calls are ad - supported , so you never have to pay anything , and since the app runs from your browser as a Flash application , you do n't have to install anything to use it .
Unfortunately FreeRinger , I was n't able to successfully log in when testing FreeRinger ( even after forwarding port 1935 , as the troubleshooting page recommended ) , so I was n't able to verify the quality .
If you give it a try and have better luck , let 's hear how it worked in the comments .

Earlier today we featured the first release candidate of Songbird , an open - source , cross - platform media player cut from the same cloth as Firefox .
Songbird has been in development forever , but now the exciting media player is finally approaching its 1.0 release , and we were eager to sink our teeth into it .
Keep reading for a closer look at Songbird — including where it soars and where it sucks .
Advertisement
What 's Exciting About Songbird
Songbird is a forward - thinking media jukebox .
It 's all about using information and media freely available on the internet to transform a typical media player into a music - lover 's utopia .
It does this in a number of ways .
Advertisement
First , and foremost , Songbird is based on the Mozilla code that runs apps like Firefox and Thunderbird , which , among other things , means that it 's extensible in the same way those applications are .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
It 's also a tabbed browser , capable of playing any embedded MP3 or searching popular music sites — like previously mentioned Skreemr — and seamlessly downloading that music to your library .
Advertisement
Songbird also promises dream - like integration with iTunes for those of you who are just too hung up on iTunes to give it up .
When you first open run Songbird , just tell it to Import your iTunes library .
You can even have Songbird update its library with any changes made to your iTunes library each time it runs .
When the import finishes , all of your iTunes playlists ( regular and smart ) should be sitting comfortably in your sidebar .
Advertisement
Songbird suggests several extensions when you first install it , including one that adds iPod support and another called mashTape , which integrates with web services Last. fm , MusicBrainz , Google News , YouTube , and even Flickr to give you artist info , videos , and photos while you 're listening to music .
At first glance , I love everything about Songbird .
In fact , I 've been excited about Songbird ever since I first learned of the project almost three years ago .
Unfortunately , then and now , Songbird has its problems .
Advertisement
The Downside
Advertisement
When I tried importing my iTunes library out of the blocks , Songbird took forever to import my 6500 + tracks .
It took rougly 17 minutes to hit 99 % , then sat there for an additional 20 minutes before I gave up on it and hitting cancel .
When I did , I got the error message below .
Advertisement
I do n't know for sure whether or not the unsupported files were the cause of the delay or not , but either way it was a drag .
Advertisement
Unfortunately the bugs do n't stop there .
At one point , I double - clicked on the album art for a larger view , but it displays as a pop-up , so when I could n't close it , I could n't do anything .
I hit Cmd - Q to quit the app , but that just closed the album art window .
That made me happy until I realized that everytime I tried double - clicking a track to play it , Songbird thought I wanted to edit the track instead .
That was interesting because I was n't aware of the inline editing and I love that kind of inline editing , but it 's not what I wanted to do at all .
Advertisement
I also received alerts every time a track changed from my Flash player telling me that " Adobe Flash Player has stopped a potentially unsafe operation . "
The alert prompts me to change my Flash settings , so when I click Settings as it asks me to , I see the disturbing alert message at right .
( I suspect the mashTape extension is at fault , but as a suggested extension , it reflects poorly on the core application whether the extension is at fault or not . )
The Upshot
Everyone ( myself included ) wants Songbird to be an iTunes killer , and frankly , if it accomplished everything it sought to , it would have a great chance at being just that .
I understand that the application I 'm using is n't the final 1.0 release , but we should n't be seeing all these bugs in a release candidate .
In the meantime , apps like the very popular MediaMonkey , foobar2000 , and even Winamp offer strong alternatives to the status quo .
( Check our Hive Five Best Desktop Media Players for more . )
I just wish Songbird could fly a bit higher without making users feel burned .

BATAVIA , N.Y . ( AP )  A New York state man has been arrested for getting too close to his bride on their wedding day .
Police say Timothy Cole quarreled with a wedding guest at a party Friday after his wedding to his ex-wife in Batavia .
Officers knew the 45 - year - old Cole from previous arrests and realized his bride had an order of protection against him .
Cole was charged with first - degree criminal contempt , a felony , and ordered jailed without bail .
The Daily News in Batavia says Cole was convicted of criminal contempt on July 1 .
The Genesee County public defender 's office says Cole has n't been assigned an attorney .

The following news release from the Labour government minister of health inspired me to make the following points :
1 . It is good to see the government take some notice of men ’s health needs .
Without MENZ and the political action of many of those who contribute here , that almost certainly would not have happened .
Well done one and all .
2 . I believe that the presence of the Republic of NZ Party on the political scene has contributed significantly to forcing this feminist dominated government to realize that it is fast becoming politically unsafe to continue to take men for granted .
3 . The current minister ’s gesture of recognition of men ’s needs now occurs about a month before the election .
His government has shown appalling contempt for men until now .
The gesture seems little more than another election bribe as are the cynical tax cuts that give some of us a bit more money just over a month before the election .
In the unlikely event that Labour is re-elected , you can bet they will return to their normal policies of disempowering and disenfranchising men whilst enslaving them to feed the nation ’s economic needs and in particular to fund the further ascendency of women .
4 . Some pamphlets to help men decide if they will pay the full cost of tests for prostate cancer seems a rather humble gesture .
A $ 3 million package for men’s health initiatives will amount to perhaps a few percent of the cost of the various health packages provided specifically for women ’s health needs , many of which will require no expenditure at all by the female recipients .
We should be grateful for the few crumbs , but remember , this will be as good as it gets under either of the two major deadbeat parties likely to make us their servants for the next few years .
29 September 2008 Media Statement
Prostate cancer resources will help men make choices
New resources going out to GPs and medical practices will provide better information to help men decide if they want to be tested for prostate cancer , said Associate Minister of Health Damien O’Connor .
Mr O’Connor said the resources — an information pamphlet for men and their families and resource cards for doctors to show their patients , will allow men to make informed decisions about their health .
“ Prostate cancer is an important , complex health issue for men .
Men and their families deserve to get the best possible advice to make choices about whether to be tested for prostate cancer .
These resources will help men do just that .
“ Men need to be able to have access to clear , concise and relevant information to be able to make decisions on testing , ” said Mr O’Connor .
The resource card for health professionals highlights those potentially at risk , provides information on the benefits and harms of prostate testing and facts on the Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) test .
The pamphlet for men and their families includes similar information as well as providing contact numbers and links to useful websites if men want to find out more or speak to someone about prostate testing .
Mr O’Connor said the Labour - led government is committed to men’s health and the new prostate cancer guidelines were part of a $ 3 million package over the next year for men ’s health initiatives .
“ We have also announced that we are fast - tracking a bowel cancer screening programme , in an effort to better diagnose and treat New Zealand ’s second - biggest cancer killer .
This is important for men as they have a substantially higher mortality rate for colorectal cancer than women , ” said Mr O’Connor .

A “ Letter of Intent for the Purchase of the Assets of Gen Con LLC Chapter 11 ” was filed on 11-20 - 2008 with the bankruptcy court .
The “ Letter of Intent ” is a summary of the terms and conditions of a potential Gen Con purchase by the “ Gen Con Acquisition Group . ”
I summarized the highlights below and have a download link for the original document at the bottom of this post .
The purchase price is the amount sufficient to pay off all of Gen Con ’s outstanding claims ( debts . )
Buyer will pay $ 500,000.00 on closing day and $ 400,000.00 30 days later .
Then $ 400,000.00 every six months until all claims are paid in full .
They buyer is paying 6 % interest on all claims , payable from the date of closing .
Buyer will pay the Make - A - Wish charity claim , plus 6 % interest from the initial date of claim
Buyer will purchase all contracts , rights , licenses , intellectual property , leases and franchise agreements .
( This is a partial list , check the original for the full list , but it is basically everything Gen Con owns . )
Closing date is December 31st , 2008
Gen Con accomplishes two things by this sale .
Primarily they escape bankruptcy , since the purchase price is the cost of Gen Con ’s outstanding debt .
Secondly , Gen Con LLC and by extension , Peter Atkison will no longer own Gen Con .
An earlier Chapter 11 reorganization filing , made mention of attempts to sell Gen Con before the bankruptcy filing that failed and how Mr. Atkison was not as involved in the day to day operations as he once was .
This sounds like a winning solution for all parties .
I am especially happy that the “ Make - A - Wish ” charity receives their promised monies .
I always felt that this debt to a worthy charity cast a pall over Gen Con .
It is also likely that this pending sale was a factor in the dismissal of Lucasfilm v. Gen Con .
Since the buyer promises to pay off all debts , which includes Lucasfilm , the court case is pointless .
Assuming Lucasfilm ’s attorneys knew of the pending sale and approved , it also implies that the offer is sincere and backed up with sufficient funds .
I am not a lawyer , but I would not dismiss my case unless I checked that the buyer had enough money to complete the purchase contract and pay the debt owed to my client .
The buyer , “ Gen Con Acquisition Group ” is identified by name , but the document does not list the members or backers of the group .
The document lists the group as “ to be formed , ” so there is probably no paper trail on it yet , but I tried to find something nonetheless .
The letter of intent has this line , ” This LOI shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky . ”
The lawyer that filed the LOI resides in Kentucky .
Starting from those clues , I did some checking on the Kentucky Secretary of State ’s website and checked for trademark , business licenses or LLC filings for the “ Gen Con Acquisition Group . ”
There was nothing .
I hope future filings reveal more information about this group .
Remember , this is all still in the realm of a potential sale .
There are many hurdles to clear before Gen Con changes hands .
I just hope the new owners are worthy stewards of this gaming institution .
“ Letter of Intent for the Purchase of the Assets of Gen Con LLC Chapter 11 ”

BBC News , Nasik , western India
It 's argued that Hinduism and terrorism are incompatible A new and highly controversial phrase has entered the sometimes cliche - riddled Indian press : " Hindu terrorism " .
As with the term " Islamic terrorism " and " Christian fundamentalism " , this latest addition to the media lexicon is highly emotive .
It was in the aftermath of the 29 September bomb blast in the predominantly Muslim town of Malegaon in the western state of Maharashtra that the term " Hindu terrorism " or " saffron terrorism " came to be used widely .
That was because the state police 's Anti-Terrorism Squad ( ATS ) arrested 10 Hindus following the blasts and has said that it wants to arrest several more .
Little - known
One of those detained was a female priest , Sadhwi Pragya Singh Thakur , aged 38 , who has been accused by the ATS of being involved in the Malegaon blast .
Her detention shocked members of the faith .
So too did the arrest of a serving Indian army officer , Lt - Col Prasad Srikant Purohit , who the ATS says is the prime accused in the case .
Police said the Malegaon attacks were the work of ' terrorists '
Police are investigating whether some of those arrested are members of a little - known Hindu outfit called Abhinav Bharat ( Young India ) .
At least three of those held have some links with a prestigious college in the city of Nasik , the Bhonsala Military Academy .
ATS investigators have questioned two of the academy 's former office bearers several times .
One of them was Col Raikar , who retired from the Indian army some months ago .
Both he and Col Purohit served in the same unit of the army and became friends .
The ATS claims the meeting in which the plan for the bomb blast was hatched was held in the Bhonsala school .
Another retired army officer , Maj Prabhakar Kulkarni , is also under arrest .
He too was an office bearer at the school .
In addition , the ATS says that at least one of the 10 suspects received military training here .
Sadhwi Pragya Singh Thakur , Col Purohit , Maj Kulkarni and Col Raikar have denied any connection with terrorism , as has the Bhonsala Military Academy and its parent organisation , the Central Hindu Military Education Society ( CHMES ) .
Founded in 1937 , the sprawling Bhonsala campus is run by the CHMES , an organisation established in the 1930s by Dr BS Moonje , a former president of the militant Hindu Mahasabha ( Hindu Assembly ) organisation .
His vision was to militarise India to fight the British Raj .
Military - style training
As the name suggests , this is not an ordinary college .
Its aim , as its website claims , is to " encourage students to take up careers in the armed forces of the country " .
Many Hindus are bemused at claims their faith is linked to terrorism Military training involves teaching students how to fire guns .
The students are prepared for the National Defence Academy , the central government 's premier military college .
The branch of the academy in the city of Nasik has many impressive buildings .
One of them is used to impart military - style training to students , aged 10 - 16 years .
Its secretary , Divakar Kulkarni , laments the fact that his school is getting a bad press these days .
He says that besides military training , students are taught Hindu philosophy and scriptures .
Mr Kulkarni accepts it 's primarily a school for Hindus , but he adds that there are two or three Muslim and Christian children in every class of 45 students .
' Tea and biscuits ' " Even Muslim students study the Bhagwat Gita and the Ramayana [ Hindu scriptures ] , " he says proudly .
So how does he respond to the ATS allegation that the bomb plot was hatched at a meeting in the academy ?
Mr Kulkarni concedes his school has recently had ' bad press ' " Col Raikar let out a hall to Abhinav Bharat for a meeting for two hours , but we do n't know what transpired in the meeting , " Mr Kulkarni said .
The ATS believes Col Raikar was also present in the meeting .
But according to Mr Kulkarni he went there just for a few minutes " to ask if they wanted tea and biscuits " .
The ATS says that it has also found the aims and objectives of Abhinav Bharat downloaded on the computers of the two men .
Mr Kulkarni insisted that there was a perfectly innocent explanation for this : " They downloaded the outfit 's aims and objectives without knowing much about its work , " he said .
Meanwhile , most Hindu organisations believe India 's Congress party - led government is playing politics by defaming Hindus .
They argue that the very term " Hindu terrorist " is not only a creation of the media but also a contradiction in terms - because the faith explicitly renounces violence .
" The government , with an eye on the general election next year , is trying to woo Muslims by maligning Hindus , " says Datta Gaikward , chief of the right - wing Hindu Shiv Sena party in Nasik .
Hindu political parties are also staunchly defending Sadhwi Pragya Singh Thakur , the arrested female priest .
They have hired lawyers to represent her and at every legal hearing in Nasik supporters of right - wing parties gather outside the court and shout anti-government slogans .
All eyes will be now be on the court proceedings - whenever they start in earnest - to find out whether " Hindu terrorism " really has taken root or not .

( NOTE FROM HELEN – I use a lot of dirty words in this story .
A lot even for me .
And dirty even for me .
If you suffer through the nasty language , I think you might enjoy the intended message .
If not , I ’m sorry .
Get over it . )
Margaret , I know you did n’t watch the shit show this week , so I did .
We pride ourselves on being informed so I suffered through it for the both of us .
Here is what you missed :
Night One : Land of Heroes – Evidently most heroes are white and scream a lot .

Night Two : Land of Promise – The GOP promises that if you vote for Donald , you will never , ever have a black person as a next door neighbor .
Plus !
Melania promises that the guy who left his first two wives and then cheated on her will never , ever lie to you .

Night Three : Land of Opportunity – Given the opportunity , Mike and Karen Pence would probably tell me to my face that they are more Christian than I .
Pence gives an amazing speech while simultaneously crawling up Trump ’s ass .
Also , Donald Trump really did n’t hug his kids enough … if at all .

Night Four : Land of Great Asshats – Ben Carson put a cup of coffee to sleep .
In the land of greatness if you stay out past curfew , some white guy also out past curfew gets to shoot you .
It ’s in the constitution .
Oh and , Trump lied .
Basically , the theme of the week is that only Donald Trump can save us from the mess that Donald Trump made .
However , it had an interesting subplot where some bitch YELLED LIKE A MOTHER FUCKER at us right before her high - as - a - kite boyfriend and his brother begged the business man who raised them to please love them .
Sorry for the bad words .
It ’s just that I am overly anxious after a week of speakers screaming at me about HOW HORRIBLE AMERICA IS .
It was almost as if they forgot that Donald Trump was President .
Years ago , I got caught calling Sarah Palin a bitch and suddenly a whole lot of people started paying attention to our little blog .
In retrospect , I should not have called her a bitch .
That word is derogatory towards women .
It ’s also a female dog and honestly dogs are just the best which would mean a female dog is perfection and I certainly did n’t mean to suggest that Sarah Palin is perfect .
I meant to suggest that she is a stupid twat .
No wait .
Twat is another one of those words that offends me because it is another derogatory word that is almost exclusively used to denigrate women .
I say “ almost ” exclusively because I have watched a few English comedy shows during quarantine and it appears that they apply that word to pretty much everybody .
But still , it ’s not a word I like .
My apologies to all of you for having to read it .
I know I could go back and just delete it , but then I would also have to delete all the words I have written afterwards and that is really just too much time and energy wasted on Sarah Palin .
And honestly , who cares about that b… that t…. that … let ’s just go with asshat .
Who cares about that asshat anymore ?
Asshat is genderless , right ?
I mean everyone has an ass and a head and pretty much every Republican I have met – male , female , intersex , Lindsey Graham – has been able to easily and successfully stick their head up their own ass or , in the case of Lindsey Graham , up Trump ’s ass .
There does n’t seem to be male / female preference for being an asshat .
I ’M TALKING ABOUT YOU KIMBERLY GUFFEROLLAFUL .. GUFF .. GUER …. never mind her last name .
You know who I am talking about .
That bitch who is dating Don Jr. Oh crap .
I said bitch .
I meant asshat .
KIMBERLY GOOGLELY IS AN ASSHAT .
KEEP READING BECAUSE THE BEST IS YET TO COME !
I really am sorry .
It ’s one of those old dogs , new tricks situations .
I need to stop using the term bitch to describe Republican women who always seem to have their head up their asses .
Maybe if I try to apply that term to a man …
Mike Pence , however , is the real bitch .
Well shit .
That does n’t work either .
Using bitch to belittle a man does n’t really solve my problem .
Mike Pence is actually a homophobic , boot licking , mother fucker …
Now wait .
Just hold on right there .
Hard stop .
Mother fucker is a horrible expression and I have now used it twice .
It is just horrible and not a term I tolerate .
Except …
Mike literally sleeps with a woman he calls Mother .
So , there is that .
But between you and me , I ’m not real sure about the fucker part .
He seems more like the Jerry Falwell Jr. in the corner while mother has sex with the pool boy type .
My goodness but I sound like a dime store novel .
Unrelated but related , I need to remind you that Evangelicals got behind Trump in large numbers when Jerry Falwell Jr. told them that Trump was their guy .
Is anyone now asking Evangelicals why Jerry Falwell Jr. was the guy they were listening to in the first place ?
But I digress …
I need to stop here and explain something .
I have always had a “ sailor ’s mouth ” as my mother used to say .
I have n’t shied away from words like shit , damn and asshole .
I rarely used the term bitch until I met Sarah Palin , but the term just seemed to fit her so well .
The problem is , once you let that cat out of the bag , a whole lot of other cats start hanging around .
Cats like twit , mother fucker and even ( dare I say it ) the c-word .
Cocaine .
How in the world did I get this low ?
How in the world did Jr. get that high ?
I ’m supposed to go high when they go low .
And speaking of high , did anyone else catch Don Jr. ’s speech ?
I mean this is n’t my world .
I am really out of my lane here , but was that cocaine ?
It was cocaine , right ?
Or did that Kimberly girl just bitch slap the hell out of him ?
Oh shit , I used the word bitch again .
Damn it .
I blame the Trumps .
They did this to me .
They ruin everything .
Of course , that does n’t explain why I called Sarah Palin a bitch so many years ago .
That was long before Trump .
It must be the GOP then .
The GOP ruins everything .
In truth , I might be on to something here .
The GOP gave us Sarah and Donald .
Son of a bitch !
That ’s it !
No wait .
That ’s an even worse expression .
I ’m just arbitrarily calling some mother a bitch .
Unless of course that mother is Karen Pence !
Oh , dear Lord .
I ’m really digging myself into a hole .
I really do n’t enjoy becoming this person .
I ’m normally a very happy , go lucky , you - be - you kind of gal .
But in the last four years …
The last four years .
Is n’t that how it usually works , though ?
It does n’t happen overnight .
It ’s usually a slow slide .
You use bitch once and then you use it again and eventually it slides off the tongue like melted butter .
Take Trump for example .
He lies .
He lies a lot actually .
And in the beginning , we were all taken aback by it .
It was almost comical until it was n’t .
I ’ll release my taxes but then I wo n’t .
I admitted to sexually assaulting women and then I was really just joking .
I told my wife I do until I did n’t .
He lies .
And then he lies about his lies .
And then he lies so much we begin to normalize it because …
That is just Trump being Trump .
At least you always know what is on his mind .
He ’s not afraid to say what he is thinking .
And before you know it , you ’re drinking bleach , sticking a lightbulb up your ass , eating aquarium cleaners , not wearing a mask and just like that – 180,000 Americans are dead .
Or here is another one .
You start by preventing people of color from living in buildings you own .
You falsely accuse five young black boys of murder and call for their execution .
You suggest that America ’s first black President is n’t a legal citizen .
You accuse Mexicans of being rapists and drug dealers .
You call black neighborhoods hell on earth .
You suggest Nazis are very fine people even when they drive a car over someone .
You give a national platform to two accused felons who pointed guns at peaceful protestors and let them tell white people to arm themselves because the blacks are coming for them .
And just like that you have a white kid shooting people in the face because they are protesting police who are shooting black people in the back .
Hate slips off Donald ’s tongue like so much … so much melted butter .
In Trump ’s America , a black man who might have a knife gets shot in the back seven times by police officers while a white teenager shooting people with a gun gets water and a thank you from police officers .
So much butter in Trump ’s big , fat America .
Trump , my friends , is a bitch of a twat mother fucker .
And I have no intentions of apologizing for using those words to describe him .
It was a slippery slope to get there , but no other words fit quite so well .
I thought about calling him the c-word .
The c – word is a word that once referred to something beautiful .
The Hindu Goddess Kunti , or great “ Yoni of the Universe , ” represented the beauty and power of the female body .
It then was wrongfully changed to suggest something ugly because celebrating female sexuality was considered evil .
It was beautiful and then someone decided to make it ugly .
Trump takes everything that is beautiful and makes it ugly .
He also seems to hate females .
So , to me that word fits him .
But as I type all these nasty words , I wonder if maybe I am digging myself into a hole .
And is it a hole I want to dig for myself because in Trump ’s America , I feel like I reached bottom a long time ago .
I like words .
And I like President ’s who knows more than four or five words .
I do n’t like Trump .
But speaking of digging a hole .
Did you catch Nikki Haley ’s speech ?
Now there is a woman who needs to stop digging .
Nikki Haley has officially reached bottom too .
Did she really go on national TV to make the case that America is n’t racist and then go on to make her case by describing how when she was Governor of South Carolina she had to remove a certain divisive symbol from the state ’s Capitol after a white supremacist murdered several black people while they were praying in their church ?
I mean did I really hear her right ?
Damn it .
This not calling people a bitch thing is really , really getting hard .
Ok .
Let me start over here .
Kimberly Gerfoul .. Gerulfile … Kimberly Goofball … you know .. that bitch dating Don Jr…
Well shit .
At this time , I would like to apologize to Margaret ’s and my readers for my inability to discuss the Republican Party without using the terms bitch , fuckers , asshat , and the c-word .
You all deserve better .
And as a woman I should strive to be better .
And I will try to be better .
In fact , I will try to be best .
And speaking of Melania .
That bitch ruined Jackie ’s rose garden .
She took away all the color and most of the trees so she could get some better camera angles for her speech … oh shit .
See what I did there ?
I got going on a rant and almost did n’t catch myself calling yet another female member of the GOP a bitch .
Ok deep breath .
10…9…8…7…6…5…4…3…2…1
Now exhale .
Ok .
I can do this .
I can .
I will .
From this point forward , I commit to treating all women with more respect .
Throwing out the term bitch every time I get mad at someone is lazy .
It ’s ignorant .
It ’s anti-woman .
And I need to stop it because it is also misleading .
They are n’t bitches .
They are n’t assholes or asshats .
They are n’t mother fuckers .
They are n’t even the c-word .
The are liars .
Plain and simple .
And you do n’t respond to liars by calling them names .
You respond to liars by telling the truth .
I respect just how artfully Melania planned that rose garden massacre .
About the same time that Trump realized his convention would have to be virtual , Melanie ( oops – Melania ) decided that the Rose Garden needed a remodel .
In the middle of a pandemic and an economic disaster , the rose garden just had to have a makeover .
Afterall , to get enough cameras and lighting for her Rose Garden Convention Speech , she would need to remove some trees and add some cement .
She is clever that one .
I ’ll give her that .
She might be the most clever of all the Trumps .
I bet for awhile there , she was taking butter to bed with her almost every night .
I also bet that of all the words that begin with C , you did n’t think I would use clever to describe Melania .
Kimberly Gerfo… Guhig…
Guffoffly is n’t as clever .
And she is not a bitch .
I mean she is , but you wo n’t hear that from me … anymore .
She is loud .
I will give her that .
VERY LOUD .
And she dates a man who seems to snort lots of cocaine and quite literally lures endangered animals out of hiding so he can murder them .
She left Fox News due to accusations of sexual misconduct and abusive behavior .
Granted she denies that , but anyone who saw her screaming at America the other night probably would concur that she ’s not an ideal co-worker .
But enough about Kimberly .
She is so not interested in the truth that she does n’t even realize her mother is n’t an immigrant .
Kimberly , they had an acutal immigrant on later in the show .
You did n’t have to lie .
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN , LEADERS AND FIGHTERS FOR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY , KIM’S PUERTO RICAN MOTHER IS ACTUALLY A US CITIZEN !
It was inevitable that Kim would find the Trumps – another family that seems to get confused about Puerto Ricans .
I ’m just shocked she had a brief layover with Gavin Newsome on her way to hell .
But I guess that might say more about Gavin than it does about Kimberly .
Nikki
Haley really is n’t a bitch either .
She is a liar , sure .
And a hypocrite , absolutely .
She admitted that Donald Trump was “ everything we hear and teach our children not to do in Kindergarten ” .
She then went to work for him and now supports his reelection .
The woman who could n’t even last two full years working for Trump wants us to sign up for eight years .
What exactly is she teaching her children now ?
By the way , Nikki , the word you forgot to use in your speech was Confederate .
It was a Confederate flag you were talking about .
And all those black lives that you said mattered ?
You forgot a few .
You forgot Emmett , Eric , Dante , Treyvon , Breonna , George …
You forgot to mention those black lives and so many others .
Did they matter , Nikki ?
Did they ?
Because they were all somebody ’s baby .
Racism in America is real Nikki .
They ’ll be asking for your birth certificate in four years .
Mark my words .
And speaking of birth certificates …
In retrospect , Melania Trump is not a bitch either .
She really does n’t care anyway .
She does not care about a lot of things .
She says she does , but she does n’t .
She told us she was taking on internet bullies and well that did n’t go very well .
She is still married to the king of internet trash .
She went to visit children in cages quite literally wearing a jacket that said , “ I really do n’t care .
Do you ? ” .
She says it had nothing to do with the visit , but that really is n’t the point .
The point is that the First Lady does n’t care .
The woman has never apologized for suggesting that Obama ’s birth certificate was n’t real .
Mr. and Mrs. Birther .
God , they are awful .
And now at the convention Melania claimed that Donald Trump is honest .
Seriously ?
The man is on record lying to the American people thousands of times .
He cheated on all three of his wives including Melania , whom he cheated on with a porn star shortly after Melania gave birth to Barron .
Bless her heart , but the third wife ( third ! ) actually told Americans that Donald would never give up on you .
I mean if irony was going to die , how better fitting than to die in a rose garden that Melania renovated to look like a cemetery ?
( Side note : I do n’t have an issue with porn stars .
I hear Stormy is a pretty good one .
In truth , Melania got her start as one – sort of .
I really do n’t know the difference between a soft porn star and a hard porn star .
Well , unless they are male .
But I am getting off track .
I just thought I should point out that in the Trump family you can go from porn to the White House in less than one lifetime … that ’s impressive regardless of your political affiliation .
OK .
This was really just an opportunity for me to point out that Tim Scott ’s family going from Cotton to Congress in one lifetime is indeed remarkable .
But it ’s even more remarkable that he does n’t see the irony in that statement .
The irony that he is n’t just the first , but he is THE ONLY African American to be elected to both the United States House and Senate .
Tim , why are n’t there more ? )
If Donald Trump had been President in 1996 , Melania would not even be an American citizen .
And neither would her parents .
Barron would probably be called a dreamer or an anchor baby .
And while I appreciate that Melania ’s heart [ sic ] goes out to the families who have lost loved ones to COVID - 19 , just what exactly has she done about it ?
What empathy has she or her husband ever shown to anyone ?
Let me remind you AGAIN that the woman wore an I DON ’T CARE jacket to visit kids in cages and her husband said he had no responsibility when it came to the pandemic .
I honestly must question the existence of a heart in either one of them .
And speaking of heartless …
Mike Pence is not a bitch either .
He is a mother fucker by definition .
Hey , come on now .
I ’m not willing to budge on that .
I do n’t call Karen , Mother .
He does .
You do n’t like the expression Mother Fucker ?
Ok .
Fair enough .
Let me just go back to calling him a homophobic , hypocritical , liar .
That ’s not name calling .
That is just fact .
If you are reading this and you are voting for Trump , then I am not going to waste my time explaining why each of those words is accurate .
You have access to the internet .
Use your head for something other than a hat rack and Google it .
Mike is asking us to make America great again … again .
His words .
Not mine .
He wants us to make America great again , again .
I am wondering if the second time around we can do it without praising Nazis , without botching the response to a pandemic , and with Biden as President rather than Trump .
I would watch that sequel .
All week long we have been hearing that the only one who can save us from this mess is the guy who made the mess .
I am actually writing this on Thursday afternoon , before Donald gives his speech .
I do n’t intend to watch .
I do n’t need to watch .
He will lie a few times , call it the China virus , suggest that Biden wants to defund police , tell us that suburbs are about to become shithole countries , and then finish it off with a few more lies all while tightly squeezing his butt cheeks so Lindsey Graham , Marco Rubio , Susan Collins , Martha McSally and Mitch McConnell do n’t fall out .
If you really believe that the protesting and the resulting violence in the streets right now can be blamed on Biden , then nothing anyone says or writes is going to save you from yourself .
Trump is the President .
He has been the President since 2017 .
He is the one dividing us .
He is the one who called Mexicans rapists and drug dealers .
He is the one who said Nazis were fine people .
He is the one speaking ill of our allies while professing his love for Kim Jong - un .
He is the one who ignored Russian bounties on American soldiers .
He is the one suggesting that suburbs will be overrun by people of color if we do n’t vote for him .
He created this entire mess .
He has been the President for four years .
The buck stops with him .
He wants us to believe that he created the greatest economy in history .
Funny .
Two weeks into quarantine tens of thousands of families were lining up at food banks .
How come so many people were one paycheck away from poverty ?
This election is a choice between decency and debauchery .
It started five years ago when the GOP candidates debated the size of each other ’s penis and then ultimately nominated the man who mocked a disabled person and bragged about sexually assaulting women .
They melted the butter .
I do n’t claim to be decent .
I have a mouth like a sailor .
But I am not running for President .
I do n’t represent the American people .
I have not taken an oath of office to preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .
The world does n’t turn to me for guidance and does n’t hold me up as an example .
When it comes to telling stories , I choose naughty words because they make me laugh .
But when it comes to choosing a President , I choose honesty .
I choose decency .
I choose Biden .
To quote Kimberly Guilfoyle , THE BEST IS YET TO COME !
They are coming in January and their names are Joe Biden and Kamala Harris .
I mean it .
Really .
NOTE FROM MARGARET : Helen , did you know they went and remade One Day at a Time ?
Not sure it was necessary but that Rita Moreno sure is a hoot .
Text VOTE to 30330 and then make your plan to vote .
But the goal should n’t be to return to “ a normal campaign . ”
For these are n’t normal times .
We face a real financial crisis .
Usually the candidate of the incumbent ’s party minimizes the severity of the nation ’s problems .
McCain should break the mold and acknowledge , even emphasize the crisis .
He can explain that dealing with it requires candor and leadership of the sort he ’s shown in his career .
McCain can tell voters we ’re almost certainly in a recession , and things will likely get worse before they get better .
And McCain can note that the financial crisis is n’t going to be solved by any one piece of legislation .
There are serious economists , for example , who think we could be on the verge of a huge bank run .
Congress may have to act to authorize the F.D.I.C. to provide far greater deposit insurance , and the secretary of the Treasury to protect money market funds .
McCain can call for Congress to stand ready to pass such legislation .
He can say more generally that in the tough times ahead , we ’ll need a tough president willing to make tough decisions .
With respect to his campaign , McCain needs to liberate his running mate from the former Bush aides brought in to handle her  aides who seem to have succeeded in importing to the Palin campaign the trademark defensive crouch of the Bush White House .
McCain picked Sarah Palin in part because she ’s a talented politician and communicator .
He needs to free her to use her political talents and to communicate in her own voice .
Image William Kristol
I ’m told McCain recently expressed unhappiness with his staff ’s handling of Palin .
On Sunday he dispatched his top aides Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis to join Palin in Philadelphia .
They ’re supposed to liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative in the vice - presidential debate on Thursday .

Antoinette DiPietro - Marketing & Events Coordinator
D'Souza begins his final reply to Dennett by saying that he has tried hard to listen because he does n't want this to be " a mudslinging , cartoon , debate " but one that really engages the issues .
Remember that .
It 's going to be important later .
He then concedes one of Dennet 's points : morality is not the special province of religion — it 's a universal phenomenon .
But after a brief complaint ( about Dennett using the idea of evolution outside of a biological context ) , he proceeds to argue the opposite .
He tells us that the reason we ( westerners ) are so good , and the rest of the world is so bad , is that we have the advantage of a Christian civilization , and they do n't .
This takes a bit of untangling :
It directly contradicts the concession he began with .
Morality , it appears , is not only the special province of religion , it 's the special province of Christianity .
It 's pure political rhetoric .
We ( the west =Christians ) are the good guys , they ( the east =Hindus , Muslims , Buddhists , Confucians , etc. ) are the bad guys .
So you would obviously want to make sure you 're on our team .
Except that it ignores the fact that many members of the other teams do believe in a god or gods , and even the ones that do n't are mostly religious .
So exactly what place this point has in a debate about religion vs. atheism is , well , debatable .
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of whether God is a human invention , and no bearing on the question of whether God actually exists , or on whether we should believe in God .
The examples he uses are questionable .
He argues that democracy , the abolition of slavery , and feminism were all products of Christianity .
But , although there certainly were Christians involved in each of these changes , they were not in the mainstream of the faith in their times .
One could just as well ( perhaps more easily ) argue that these changes were a product of the enlightenment , achieved in spite of the church — certainly in spite of the current orthodoxy .
This leads to a very strange ability , on D'Souza 's part , to argue that when secular Western countries give more aid than religious Eastern countries , the difference is due to the good influence of religious belief .
So , even at this early point in his reply , D'Souza has begun to do the exact opposite of the intention he announced at the outset .
He claimed to want to avoid mudslinging and , instead to engage the issues .
But his first developed argument is an attempt to avoid the issues while motivating his audience to join his side .
And his method is to sling mud .
Admitedly , he does n't sling it at Dennett yet — instead , he slings it at all religions but his own .
By doing so , he provides us with a clear example of a mentality which he shares with many authoritarians .
This division of the world into " them " and " us " , and the the constant vilification of " them " is more than a rhetorical technique .
It is a way of viewing the world .
There 's a constant need for an enemy , or for multiple enemies — a need to define oneself as " not them " , and a moral need to make them stop being them .
The " them " , however , shifts from moment to moment , depending on the current need .
In D'Souza 's case , in this one debate , " them " has been at various times atheists , accademics , easterners , intellectuals , Hindus , secularists , and Muslims .
He has accused " them " of having affairs , killing people , faking concern about others , not sending aid to others , lacking concern for others , being elitist , and sneering at " us " .
" We " , on the other hand , has been all religious people ( including Muslims and Hindus and worshipers of Baal and Thor and all the gods who required human sacrifice , when he needed to include them to get a majority ) , Western culture ( including the secular west , when he wanted to make a case based on humanitarian aid ) , intellectuals , anti-intellectuals you 'd like to have a beer with , academics , and non-academics .
He follows this bizarre line of reasoning by taking Dennett to task for talking about toxic religions .
Dennett argued at the beginning of the debate that all religions had toxic forms , and that these forms ( the toxic ones ) depended upon their ability to keep their young ignorant of the general history and variety of human religions .
It 's not clear whether he intended , among " toxic forms " of religion , to include such obviously political struggles as those between the Palestinians and Israel .
But it is clear that this was not his primary focus — that he was speaking of a broad variety of beliefs and behaviors from female circumcision to suicide bombing that are inspired by religious belief , and depend upon ignorance of a broader world view .
However , D'Souza responds to Dennett 's suggestion by first narrowing the examples to wars .
By doing this , he accomplishes something he has ( falsely ) accused Dennett of doing several times : he has cleverly shifted Dennett 's point in order to trivialize it .
Specifically , he tells us that the Israelis and Palestinians are fighting over land , not religion , that the Irish are fighting over who will rule Ireland , and that the Hindus and Muslims are fighting over Kashmir — not religion .
Aside from the clever shift from Dennett 's real point to a straw man , his point does n't hold up even in all of the cases he gives .
The reason , for example , that the Israelis and the Palestinians are fighting over land is largely because the Israelis believe that God has given them that land , and because they insist that an Israeli state must be defined by religion — in this case , Judaism .
It 's not clear at all that Dennett would include Israel as an example of " toxic religion " —
D'Sousa is the one who provides it as an example .
But it is clear that it does n't hold up as the kind of counter - example he would like it to be .
He concludes with a series of points , also designed to shift the topic of the debate in the minds of the listeners :
The new atheists are talking outside their fields .
They have wandered from their area of expertise .
The only possible purpose of such an argument is to discredit his opponent — not to address the actual question .
Unfortunately , Dennett 's field is philosophy — the field appropriate to such questions , while D'Souza 's field is English Literature .
Probably because of this , D'Souza makes the target of his attack " the new atheists " so that he can bring to mind others who are venturing outside of their fields , and then spread the guilt to Dennet by association .
The new atheists are bigots , not willing to take religion seriously .
Again , the idea is to discredit by calling names .
Notice , by the way , that D'Souza is winding up his final statement by doing exactly what he promised not to do in the first sentence — he is reducing the argument to a cartoon debate , based on mud-slinging .
We should take seriously what most people , for most of human history have taken seriously , and even now .
[ religion ]
Pure political rhetoric again : most people , for most of human history have believed that the sun circled the earth .
This is not evidence about the existence or nature of God ; it 's an emotional argument for siding with D'Souza .
Also note how , suddenly , Hindus and Muslims and worshipers of Thor are all on D'Souza 's side .
Atheists are closed minded and dismissive because they do n't take the idea of Thor , or Bacchus , or Krishna literally and seriously .
" So , ultimately , this provincial , you may say North - Eastern atheism of the academy that snickers at the whole world as being a bunch of idiots ... "
This hardly needs a gloss .
Political rhetoric , mud-slinging , anti-intelectualism , anti-North - Easternism ( horrors ! ) , name - calling ...
If you produce 2/3 of the people on the planet who see a UFO on a daily basis I 'll take them seriously ...
For one brief moment at the end , he returns to a scientific rhetoric .
The actual experience of God , by 2/3's of the people on the planet , would be evidence , and it would address the question .
D'Souza does n't care to develop the point , however , but only makes it in passing .
( As an ex-believer , and one who has had those God-experiences , I have a lot to say about them , but this is not the place . )
Unfortunately for D'Souza , the claim he makes here , in the form he makes it , falls to pieces on a moment 's examination ,
It depends on his lumping together a great many people of different religions who have contradictory beliefs and experiences concerning God .
( And incidentally points out the wisdom in the way Dennett began the debate . )
Also , his use of UFOs as an analogy is too apt .
Yes , if that many people saw a UFO , any intelligent person would take them seriously — but that would not extend to taking their speculations about the object being from Andromeda , or about the moral desires of the pilot , seriously .
For that , we would require more evidence .
After that brief flirtation with the actual question , D'Souza returns to name calling .
He implies that Dennett thinks he 's superior to non-academics , and that Dennetts proposal is frivolous .
He then says he agrees with it , in spirit , but that he objects to Dennett being the one to carry it out .
So his attack ends with a final bit of unsubstantiated mud-slinging .
D'Souza manages to close on a note which implies that the debate topic was whether we preferred common sense , ordinary Christian folk , or North - Eastern atheist intellectuals who snicker at common ordinary Christian folk .
This is all to his benefit , since he has conceded practically every important point .
And the debate ends .
I wo n't be commenting on the question and answer period , but I will be putting together a chart giving the fundamental positions of the two debaters , the nature of each argument , and quality of its support .
Center for Media and Democracy
November 14 , 2008
WASHINGTON
The Center for Media Democracy and Free Press today exposed an epidemic of fake news infiltrating local television broadcasts across country .
At a press conference in Washington with FCC Commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein , the groups called for a crackdown on stations that present corporate - sponsored videos as genuine news to an unsuspecting audience .
CMD , which unveiled the results of a 10 - month investigation , found scores of local stations slipping commercial “ video news releases , ” or VNRs , into their regular news programming .
The new multimedia report released today includes footage of 36 separate VNRs and their broadcast as “ news ” by TV stations and networks nationwide , including those in the nation ’s biggest markets .
The full report — “ Fake TV News : Widespread and Undisclosed ” — is now available complete with VNR and TV station video footage at www.prwatch.org/fakenews/execsummary.
“ It ’s shocking to see how product placement moves secretly unfiltered from the boardroom to the newsroom and then straight into our living rooms , ” said Diane Farsetta , a senior researcher at CMD and co-author of the report .
“ Local TV broadcasts — the most popular news source in the United States — frequently air VNRs without fact - checking , conducting their own reporting , or disclosing that the footage has been provided and sponsored by big corporations . ”
Investigators captured 77 television stations actively disguising sponsored content from companies including General Motors , Intel , Pfizer and Capital One to make it look like their own reporting .
More than one - third of the time , stations aired fake news stories in their entirety as their own reporting .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Despite repeated claims from broadcasters that they do not air VNRs as news , the new report reveals just the tip of the iceberg .
Instances of fake TV news documented by CMD likely represent less than 1 percent of VNRs distributed to local newsrooms since June 2005 .
Fraudulent news reports have likely been aired on hundreds of more local newscasts in the past year .
“ The president of the Radio - Television News Directors Association , Barbara Cochran , called fake news ‘ kind of like the Loch Ness Monster .
Everyone talks about it , but not many people have actually seen it , ’ ” said John Stauber , executive director of CMD .
“ This report drops a big nest of squirming Nessies in the laps of TV journalists .
Fake TV news is the worst plagiarism scandal in American journalism , and it must be stopped by labeling all VNRs on screen so viewers can tell if its news or fake news . ”
Approximately 80 percent of the stations snared in the investigation are owned by large conglomerates .
The list of the worst offenders includes Clear Channel , News Corp . / Fox Television , Viacom / CBS , Tribune Co. and Sinclair Broadcast Group – whose Oklahoma City affiliate was caught airing VNRs on six separate occasions .
“ The evidence suggests a strong connection between media consolidation and the broadcast of deceptive , pre-packaged propaganda , ” said Timothy Karr , campaign director of Free Press .
“ When all station owners care about is profit margins , fake news can prove irresistible .
After all , VNRs are free .
Reporting news that ’s meaningful to local communities is n’t .
And without decisive government action , the fake news problem will only get worse . ”
In conjunction with the report , Free Press launched www.freepress.net/fakenews — urging the public to contact the FCC and demand “ No Fake News . ”
Free Press and CMD also filed a formal complaint with the FCC , seeking a thorough investigation “ to help restore the public trust in the integrity of local news . ”
The public interest groups want all VNRs be accompanied by a continuous , frame - by - frame visual notifications and verbal announcements disclosing their sources .
They also recommended broadcasters be required to file monthly public reports detailing their use of government or corporate - sponsored material .
The FCC complaint is available at www.freepress.net/docs/fcc_complaint_4-06-06.pdf

A spontaneous re-enactment of Orson Welles ' 1938 " War of the Worlds " radio broadcast unfolded Friday on microblogging site Twitter .
Hundreds of tweets detailed a mock Martian invasion , with reports both panic - stricken and humorous .
" Smoking , smoldering hunks of buildings , cars and people lay strewn about , " wrote one user , joshlewis .
" The tripods have left the Warehouse District in ruins . "
Another , iancanfield , wrote : " The freeways are packed !
I 've heard from a few stuck on 252 and 94 , they are sitting ducks . "
Since the site made headlines at South by Southwest in 2007 , Twitter has been used to comment on national events and disseminate crucial information quickly during natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and earthquakes .
A team of NASA scientists even adopted the service to blast space - loving geeks with updates on the Mars Phoenix roverLander 's progress .
However , it appears this is the first time the service has been used for mass fiction .
The mock Twittering appears to be spontaneous : Twitterers are chipping in as the idea spreads across the network .
Thursday marked the 70th anniversary of Orson Welles ' legendary radio broadcast of " The War of the Worlds , " an adaptation of the H.G. Wells science fiction novel .
Welles ' hour - long faux newscast sparked a nationwide panic when it aired Oct. 30 , 1938 , causing many Americans to believe an actual Martian invasion was under way .
To distinguish the apocalyptic messages from the rest of the updates flowing through the site – and to prevent igniting the kind of confusion and panic caused by Welles ' historic broadcast – participants are adding the tag
" #wotw2 " to the ends of their fictional accounts .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said fictional , multi-user gags like Friday 's " War of the Worlds " blitz are a natural evolution , given the microblogging site 's instantaneous , real - time format .
" I 'm impressed by the level of creativity that continues to emerge from such a simple service , " said Stone in an e-mail .
" Even when they are only allowed 140 characters , people find interesting , helpful and playful ways to communicate .
This spontaneous game behavior is not dissimilar from the way folks tend to check in and self - organize during shared events like disasters , festivals and the recent presidential debates . "
Other Twitterers contributed more colorful tidbits .
Dielaughing posted : " Getting my herpes ready to infect the aliens . "
__Update : __
Turns out the experiment was n't totally spontaneous , it was actually a staged reenactment , using Twitter to experiment with the War of the Worlds broadcast on the internet .
The event was organized by Twitterers Josh Lewis , Ryan Paul and Kris Kowal .

Straw Bale Construction
By : Chris Nickson - Updated : 6 May 2019 | * Discuss Tweet
People have built homes using straw , grass , or reed throughout history .
During the late 1800s on the American plains however , straw bales houses were a matter of necessity ; there was no lumber for construction .
Now , with the rise in interest in sustainable housing , there 's been a revival in straw bale construction .
It 's mostly been in the U.S. , but in 1995 , Bob Matthews , of the Institute for Social Inventions and author of The Complete Manual of Practical Home Building , built a straw cabin in the U.K. ( possibly the first such building in Britain ) and has been living in it ever since .
With straw often being a farm surplus product and very cheap ( around 40 p a bale , or £ 1.50 delivered ) , it 's inexpensive , and an easily renewable medium .
Properly built , straw bale houses are fire - resistant , waterproof and actually pest free , with super - insulated walls .
Construction Basics
You 'll need about 300 standard three - wire bales of straw to make a 2,000 square - foot house ( 186 sq. metres ) .
You skewer them on rebar pins ( or wood or bamboo stakes ) to keep them firm .
When you 've finished , after adding plumbing and wiring , you seal and finish the walls .
You need to use bales that have a uniform size ( about a metre long , half a metre wide ) , are well secured with two strings , and with very few seed heads .
Make sure they 're compacted properly and dense - each bale should weight between 16 - 30 kilos - and dry ( and be sure you keep them dry when you 're building , for obvious reasons ) .
Even after you 've finished the house , you need to be certain the centre of the bales does n't become wet through either the top or bottom - however , if the outside gets wet , that 's fine ; it 'll dry out naturally .
Types of Construction
Use a " non-structural " or " in- fill " system for bigger structures .
That means you make a frame first to support the roof , then pierce the bales with rebar as you rise , attaching the bales to the frame to keep your walls secure .
" Structural bale construction " is a little like Lego , where you stack the bales together in a " running bond " manner .
After construction , you simply stucco the exterior and plaster the interior walls .
However , since the bales compress as they settle , you need to leave settlement gaps above both windows and doors ( how much depends on the number of bales ) .
Straw and clay construction is a little like cob .
You mix clay and water , and then add straw , before packing it into a wooden frame .
Mortar bale construction is similar to working with giant bricks .
You put mortar between the bales , and the mortar actually takes the wall 's weight ( it needs to be quite thick - at least an inch on all surfaces of the bale ) .
It 's a good method when you 're making a two storey house or a basement .
About the only drawback is that the mortar creates cold bridges and thermal leaks .
Again , use stucco and plaster to add to the structural integrity .
Finally , there are also pressed straw panels .
Here you use straw that 's been compacted under pressure .
You can also use the panels for floors and roofs if you wish .
Maintenance
In theory , at least , a properly constructed straw house , built where there 's good drainage , could last for centuries .
You should probably use a different material for the roof , however ( something more permanent ) , and build that roof at a steep angle for drainage .
Foundation
If you 're building a straw bale house in Britain , the climate means you 'll have to be on a self - draining foundation ( one of the best is a rubble trench ) .
You 'll also need plastic or metal strapping to attach the wallplate ( use anchor bolts ) to the foundation .
Make sure your foundation goes well below the frost line , and then fill it with small stones before you put concrete in the rest of the space .
You also have to be sure that water can't gather at the point where the bales meet the foundation , which means you need to elevate the foundation by at least 23 mm ( much higher is better ) , and leave a good overhang ( around 450 mm ) on the roof .
Finishes
Obviously , after you 've completed the construction , you still need to render , or finish , the place .
Limewash is good , but very expensive .
Earth plaster is an American favourite and durable to use both inside and outside .
It 's non-toxic , and comes in many colours .
Additionally , you have plenty of time to work it and it dries to a hard surface .
Rot and Pests
You should n't have a problem with rot as long as you use dry bales .
Remember , though , that all the paint must be permeable so moisture is n't trapped in the wall .
Believe it or not , you find fewer insects or vermin in straw bales than you do in wood , and once you 've plastered the building , they can't get in .
Fire
You might also be surprised to learn that straw bale construction is very fire - resistant ; in tests it actually out - performed conventional building materials .
However , in spite of all its advantages , getting a mortgage for a straw bale house can be difficult as can insuring it .

Hi All ,
Here 's hoping I 'm in the right place !
I am looking to build a 3 - 4 bedroom Straw Bale House approximately 120 square metres overall ( bungalow , dormer or two - storey depending on accepted plans ) .
We are hoping to go with a timber frame instead of load bearing as this would then mean that the build site is covered when the roof is on and the weather would have less of an effect on the bales .
I have read that ' one ' would normally cost for £ 1000 - £ 3000 per square metre for a standard build but unsure if this is the same for a Bale Build .
I am hoping to do some of the work myself but depending on work commitments it may not be possible so the big ask is are there any builders who work with Bales in the Nottingham area that would be able to give a quote ?
I have Googled several different phrases but am coming up short when looking for a specific kind of builder and thought I 'd just ask !
Thanks in advance !

Gordon - Your Question :
We are planning new music studios in SE London , and considering creating two large straw bale buildings – 1 x 16mt x 11mt internal space , and the other 1 x 10 mt x 7mt , both as a two storey build .
We are practical , with wood working and building skills , so we could help as part of the construction team , although we will need one or two people with straw bale building experience to lead the project .
The planned site is a yard and has a good solid concrete base 30 /40 cm thick pretty much throughout .
Not sure its self - draining however .
Load in for materials is good and direct to site , with easy access for trucks & fork lift .
This could be a very interesting project , so if anyone has suggestions on how to progress this plan further , please get in touch .
Many thanks Our Response :
If anyone wants to respond via the Sustainable Build team , they can send in their details to jmarshall@pts.com and we 'll forward them on .

As the article states , you do need the right ground , and insurance will generally be problematic .
You also need to be extremely careful not to construct the house in an area that ’s prone to flooding and it would generally be destroyed , or at least rendered uninhabitable .
If consider a straw bale house , take this into account .

World 's weakest currencies
Bruce Einhorn , BusinessWeek | November 14 , 2008
F rom the Arctic coasts of Iceland to the Southern Ocean shores of New Zealand , the financial crisis has humbled many of the world 's currencies .
As risk - averse investors have rediscovered the US dollar , they have swiftly pounded down currencies that until recently had been highfliers .
Especially hard - hit have been countries such as Australia and South Africa with large mining industries , as slower economic growth has popped what had been a steadily inflating resources bubble .
by
Apparently a lot has happened since my last post .
The stock , credit and housing markets have been in shambles ; the price of oil has now fallen over 50 % from its record highs set this past July ; and the price of gasoline has dropped well below the psychologically important $ 3 mark .
As of this afternoon , the national average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline stood at $ 2.88 , which is about 30 % below this summer ’s peak prices .
Â
Over the past month alone , the price of gas has fallen nearly 23 % .
Â
Additionally , the price of gasoline is now only 7 % higher than what it was at this point last year .
Currently every state is reporting an average price below $ 4 per gallon , and there are only 13 states with average prices above $ 3 per gallon .
Â
Hawaii has the highest state - wide average price at $ 3.77 per gallon , while Oklahoma has the lowest state - wide average price at $ 2.40 per gallon .
Unfortunately , this record price decline might be nearing an end .
Â The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) will be holding a meeting this coming Friday to discuss massive production cuts in order to protect oil prices .
Â
It is widely speculated that OPEC will announce daily production cuts of between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels .
Given the world ’s current economic state , it is very doubtful that this production cut will cause oil prices – and subsequently gasoline prices – to shoot back up towards their record highs .
Â
However , it ’s not unreasonable to expect prices to , at the very least , stay at their current levels or rise slightly .
I woke up this morning to Kirin Dave 's cantankerous rant about how Ruby 's going down the tubes .
The whole post was a giant whine - fest , with the exception of the beginning , where he heaps faux past praise on Ruby to justify his complaints .
The entire post read kind of like Joe Lieberman supporting McCain : " I used to be a Democrat , but now I think Obama 's in love with terrorists . "
Dave did n't even really attempt to be even - handed in his critique ( if I can even call it a critique ) ; he just goes after the Ruby language , interpreter , and community with the full force of his giant ... rhetoric .
Let 's take a look at Dave 's claims :
Claim 1 .
Ruby 's interpreter is so outdated , it 's impossible to write code without it leaking memory .
As evidence , he points to a case encountered by Tom Preston - Warner in his God monitor library .
What Dave fails to point out is that despite his claims that Ruby 1.9 is basically useless , the last post in the thread he references informs the readers that the bug is fixed in Ruby 1.9 .
He also does n't inform the reader that many large web applications , including YellowPages.com , scribd.com , and hulu.com , not exactly tiny web sites , are running on infrastructures that depend on this " outdated " interpreter .
While I 'm not going to claim that the Ruby interpreter is all rainbows , it 's hardly the problem that Dave claims it is .
Dave also dismisses JRuby with a wave of his hand , using the argument that it 's not useful for web applications because it can't be used for scripting ( which Ruby is frequently used for ) .
This is a classic example of a red herring fallacy .
The existing " terrible " Ruby interpreter works just fine for scripting , where the supposed memory leaks are n't an issue .
As a result , dismissing JRuby , which solves all of his other deployment concerns , is just pure malarky .
Claim 2 . Ruby is the slowest thing imaginable .
I 've tackled this argument with some vigor before , but suffice it to say that real - life Ruby applications must be compared against real - life PHP or Django applications , and they perform quite well .
Even Rails , not exactly the fastest Ruby web framework , beats out CodeIgniter in Hello World benchmarks , and is dead even with CodeIgniter on more robust benchmarks .
Comparing it with CakePHP , which is a closer feature - for - feature comparison , Rails completely destroys Cake in all benchmarks .
Merb , which takes more effort to avoid being slow , does significantly better than Rails , and beats CodeIgniter on hello world benches by around 5 x .
The reason for this is that despite Dave 's claims that the Ruby community is stagnant , some of the worst speed offenders have been handled by native extensions that provide speedups for the community without the community having to drop into C all the time .
The most recent example : ThirdBase , a library to make Ruby 's date facilities an order of magnitude faster than the built - in Date class .
Because the Ruby interpreter has a fairly good C API , developers without commit access have been able to improve the speed of everything from web servers ( who uses the stdlib 's webrick ! ? ) to XML parsing ( why use REXML when you can use Nokogiri and gain orders of magnitude in speed ) .
Real - life applications are simply not as slow as the benchmarks ( which even Dave admits are not dispositive ) would seem to imply .
Real apps simply spend more time IO - waiting on things like databases or grabbing strings out of cache than in calculating the fibonacci sequence .
Claim 3 . Rubinius did n't happen and JRuby ... these are not the droids you 're looking for ...
Rubinius did n't happen .
Somehow , in all his bloviating , Dave did n't really address JRuby at all .
Let 's take a look at his hand - wave real quick :
jRuby is great , but I kind of liked the illusion of a small memory footprint–a lot of Ruby use is in scripting and starting up a “ java - server ” instance is not really desirable for that .
So let 's take a look : .
Actually , not so much .
When you take into consideration that you only need a single JVM instead of multiple processes , JRuby starts looking very competitive .
In fact , when you start factoring in the impact of real threads on IO - wait , JRuby startsMRI .
I already addressed the other claim : Ruby is used in scripting and JRuby is thus unsuitable for it .
For those cases , MRI works just fine .
Even if we were to grant
Dave his claim of unbeatable memory problems , scripts can handle a slow 200 k leak every 10,000 seconds ( the big gotcha memory leak ) .
As a result of all the effort around alternative implementations ( and spearheaded by Rubinius ) , JRuby and MRI are remarkably compatible .
Developing on MRI ( for fast startup times ) and deploying on JRuby ( for a rock - solid memory footprint and great concurrency handling ) is viable by design .
In essence " There are no good choices for a Ruby interpreter " is straight - up not true .
Claim 4 . Ruby 's future is ... yawn .
Dave takes a look at the new features in Ruby , and based on the future of the Ruby language , decides that Ruby itself is booooring .
He makes one tiny mistake when he claims that better FFI was only in alternative implementations : the aforementioned C API made it possible for wmeissner of the JRuby team to roll out a 100 % compatible version of Rubinius ' FFI ( which they have now adopted ) for Ruby 1.8 .
Probably the most misleading part of this claim is ignoring all the work being done on Ruby libraries .
I can be competitive with Rails from time to time , but even I 'm not going to claim that Rails is no longer producing good work .
And Merb is fairly well acknowledged for innovation around these parts .
Dave says :
And what do I have to look forward to in the Ruby world ?
Essentially the same promise that I heard in late 2005 , “ Christmas will bring a faster ruby . ”
This assumes that the only interesting things happening around a library are related to its core interpreter or the core language .
While Ruby 1.9 does see some improvements to the complaints that he raised , and JRuby flat - our resolves them , Dave 's fundamental mistake is here .
By assuming that the only way the community around a language can get better is by improving its core , he is ignoring reality : there are tons of exciting developments around Ruby that are being pushed by its users .
Dave closes by saying :
People will leave trying to stake out The Next Big Thing™ , bleeding the Ruby talent pool dry and making it even less capable of recovering from these bad fortunes .
I predict the opposite .
The Ruby talent pool will continue to grow , and we will continue to produce new , innovative , and exciting projects .
JRuby will continue to improve and Rubinius will be released , sparking a new Ruby speed war that will lead to the faster Ruby that so dominates Dave 's dissatisfaction .
And the Ruby community will continue to learn from other languages , like Python and Erlang .
It 's only going to get better from here .

Barack Obama scored a key appointment for his administration today , as it is being reported that Rep. Rahm Emanuel has agreed to be Obama ’s Chief of Staff .
Politico is reporting that Emanuel has taken the job , and Tom Daschle was the runner up .
Emanuel bring a blend of both White House and congressional experience .
In the House of Representatives , he is the fourth highest ranking Democrat .
As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , he was the man behind the strategy that led to the Democratic takeover of the House .
What made him especially appealing to Obama was likely the fact that he has executive experience having served as a senior advisor to President Clinton .
The fact that Obama considered Emanuel and Daschle signals that he plans on working closely with Congress .
The early signs are that Obama is focused on getting things done and passing legislation .
This would be a dramatic shift from the gridlock that has existed in Washington since the Republican Revolution in 1994 .
Advertisements
Emanuel did think for a day about whether or not to take the job .
Wednesday night , he told Chicago TV station WLS , “ I do know something about the White House and I have children now .
I have a family .
This is not a professional choice .
This is a personal choice . ”
He probably needed to think this over , because he has a great position in the House , and taking the job means uprooting his family , and moving them to Washington for at least a year or two .
In the end , this was probably too big of an opportunity for him to pass up .
As Obama ’s chief of staff , he will be one of the most powerful people in the capitol .
He will also have a big role in keeping things running , and shaping legislation on the hill .
If Obama wants to hit the ground running , Emanuel was his best choice .
He knows both sides of the fence , so having him in such a crucial position gives the new president the luxury of an experienced person who can help implement his agenda quickly .
How to use freelancers
Freelancers are an absolute necessity in the communications industry .
When times are really good you need them to handle all the extra work you have on .
And when times are bad you need them to temporarily fill the gaps made by redundancies .
Without them the ad industry would be in big trouble .
I ’ve spent much of my career as a freelancer .
And in recent years I ’ve been the dude who decides to get freelancers in .
And having lots of experience on both sides of the fence , I thought I should share my experiences to tell agencies how best to use this vital resource – because it ’s clear that very few of them know how .
Show me the money !
The first ( and biggest ) issue is paying freelancers .
In recent years the finance men have had far too much power in the industry .
And they very often see freelancers as simply suppliers and therefore hold off as long as they can on paying them .
I ca n’t tell you how wrong this is !
The freelancers are doing the job of your staff and should be treated as such .
They are performing the skills you have in - house ; doing the stuff you told your clients that you can do ; and helping to create the product that builds your reputation .
If you ’re not happy to tell your employees to wait 90 days before you pay them , do n’t do it to freelancers .
They are just individuals with bills to pay , not corporations .
If you ’re an agency that has a bit of pride in its product , you want the very best freelancers .
They ’re the ones in demand .
And if you disrespect them financially , they ’ll not be as willing to do the work for you next time .
If , instead , you pay them right away , they ’ll drop what they ’re doing to help you out and go the extra mile .
Which do you think is the better use of cash ?
Use them for their skills
A strange one this !
I was talking to a planner the other night who has years of good experience in the industry .
She was taken on by an agency who ended up using her to create financial plans , do invoicing , answer phones , make coffee and buy biscuits .
That ’s an expensive office junior !
I also had an experience a few years ago when I was hired as a copywriter .
The agency found out that I could draw and decided to use me as a visualiser instead .
I was probably the highest paid and least talented marker jockey in London that day .
Timing is everything
It ’s never a good idea to leave your hiring to the last minute – but that seems to be the way that most agencies do it .
Plan in advance and make a firm booking with your freelancer , if you can .
One of the worst practices is ‘ pencilling - in’ a tentative booking .
That puts a freelancer in a terrible situation .
They feel as if they ca n’t chase for more work the way they normally would .
And if someone calls them to offer them work , they ca n’t say yes right away because they feel they need to call you first to see if the job ’s still on .
It ’s disrespectful and it sucks .
Either book a freelancer or do n’t .
Finding the right freelancer
See every freelancer that contacts you and make notes on who was good and who was awful .
If you do n’t have your own contacts , ask for recommendations from people in the office .
Get the portfolios in ( or look at them online ) to see which ones you like .
Then talk to the people – you want to enjoy working with them .
But it ’s not a train wreck if they turn out to be a bit crap – you ’ve not made a commitment and do n’t need to hire them again .
Be prepared
It always surprised me how most agencies just were n’t ready for me when I arrived .
They were paying me to sit around reading a magazine in reception while they found me a desk , sorted out a computer and got ready to brief me .
Very often this would take all morning and would have wasted a lot of money .
Crazy !
Are you in or out ?
If you do n’t need a freelancer to work from your office , do n’t ask them to .
They ’ve probably got their own setup that they ’re familiar with and can get on with stuff faster without the distractions of getting to know new people .
Well , I think that ’s about it for agencies .
Feel free to pass this post around and share your own wisdom in the comments area below .
Next I ’ll be sharing my advice with freelancers .
It was a sunny afternoon , school was out and children were gathering in the playground .
Jane Currie and her partner , Anji Dimitriou , both small , soft - spoken women , were waiting with other parents at Gordon B. Attersley public school in Oshawa , when , fists flying , a man attacked them , his blows as harmful as his words .
" Which one of you two ' men ' spoke to my kid ?
F------ dyke .
Lesbians , " he said , spitting in Dimitriou 's face .
As she wiped her face , eyes closed , he punched her on the cheek and wound up again , slamming her backward into her truck .
As Currie ran toward him , she remembers him shouting , " F------ dyke bitches , " and punched her on the cheekbone so hard the skin burst apart , blood splattering .
What Currie remembers most , from the afternoon of Nov. 3 , is the stillness of the schoolchildren , and the sound of her six - year - old son screaming .
" It was a face of complete and utter horror , " Currie said in an interview yesterday .
" His mouth was wide open , and he just stood there , screaming . "
In seconds , it was over .
Another man intervened , so did a woman , pushing the attacker aside .
Police were called .
The principal led him inside to her office , Currie said .
A man was arrested and charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm .
It was n't the first time the man had called them those names , Currie said .
There have been several other occasions where he had verbally attacked them , usually over a parking spot in the school lot .
Last night , when Currie spoke of the assault , her voice grew low with anger .
Why , she asked , did another person feel he had the right to attack them because of their lifestyle ?
Currie said she and Dimitriou are pushing Durham police to upgrade the charges to hate crimes .
" That is what it is , " she said .
" He went after us because of who we are . "
Insp. Brian Osborne , of Durham Regional Police , said last night that the department will investigate the possibility that the assaults could be classified as hate crimes .
The decision to pursue those charges is usually made with the Crown attorney 's office , Osborne said .
In 2006 , Statistics Canada reported that one - quarter of hate crimes were motivated by religion and one in 10 by sexual orientation .
Hate crimes accounted for less than 1 per cent of all criminal incidents reported by police .
Currie said a rally is being planned for Friday night at 7 at , at King St. and Centre St. in downtown Oshawa .
The couple has gathered support on a Facebook site called , " Lesbian moms attacked outside elementary school , " which so far has almost 3,000 members .
Currie said her son , and her partner 's seven - year - old daughter and six - year - old son , all students at the school , are terrified of encountering the man again .
" I'm angry , " Currie said .
" Why does he even care ?
Is his existence so pathetic that he needs to single me out for how I live my life ? "
Charged is Mark Scott , 43 , of Oshawa .
Valencia , Spain will soon be home to a $ 145 million school of rock ( and pop and jazz ) from the Boston - based Berklee College of Music , which hopes to extend its successful contemporary music training program to European shores .
" ARTeria Valencia " will be a state - of - the - art , 25 - story building ( see artist 's renderings ) featuring faculty and student housing , a high - speed data network , a 1,000 - seat outdoor amphitheater and several smaller performance spaces .
Construction will be largely bankrolled by the SGAE Spanish performing rights organization , which is apparently eager to bring Berklee 's approach to contemporary music education to Valencia – already a popular " semester abroad " destination .
You might think the music industry 's heavily - publicized woes would scare kids into more financially stable lines of work – say , brokering stocks or managing hedge funds .
Those are n't the greatest examples these days , but still , given shrinking labels and dwindling sales , the music industry seems like a hard place to get a foothold .
Nonetheless , budding musicians continue to be drawn like moths to the flame of the Berklee College of Music in Boston , where applications for Fall '09 matriculation are up 40 percent according , to Larry Monroe , the school 's vice president of international programs , and popular subjects include music theory , composition , performance , music management , music education and even music therapy .
The Boston location turns out 800 graduates each year , while the Valencia location will produce smaller classes of 250 .
Famous grads include Aimee Mann , Branford Marsalis , John Mayer , Bill Frisell , Juliana Hatfield and Quincy Jones .
The guy who scored The Simpsons an Ferris Beuller 's Day Off went there too – Alf Clausen , class of ' 66 .
The school 's more famous graduates , 58 of whom have won Grammys , have not been the only ones to turn a Berklee degree into gainful employment .
According to the school 's most recent survey , 80 percent of its graduates work in the music business , while 65 percent of graduates earn their livings solely from music – fairly impressive statistics , all things considered .
Monroe was about to catch a flight for Spain for various meetings aboutthe plan when we caught up with him by telephone .
" It 's almostinexplicable , " he said .
" There does n't seem to be any slowing down ,
even in these tough economic times and certainly shifting musicbusiness reality , [ these ] youngsters [ are ] intent on pursuing careersin contemporary music , so we 're just grateful .
I 'm not quite surewhat 's driving it .
People do n't give up their dreams , I think , justbecause the times are tough . "
He said Berklee , considered by many to be the top school in the US for players of pop , rock and jazz ,
has had several opportunities to expand into Japan and other countries .
The Spanish government played apart in the choice of the Valencia location , as did Spanish 's statusas one of three major languages for music in the 21st century .
One quarter of the students at the Boston location come from outside the US .
At the new location , students will be recruited from around the world , with a focus on Spain , Europe , Spanish - speaking countries , Africa , and the Middle East .
" We 're very conscious that in this century we 're going to see anincreasing drift of centralization around the languages of English ,
Spanish , Chinese and perhaps others , but these are going to be the hugemarketplace languages , " said Monroe .
Aside from speaking English , Spanish or Chinese , working musicians of tomorrow also need to develop production and business skills .
" There are no more talent scouts roaming around bistros at night looking for hot players and good songwriters anymore , " explained Monroe .
" You 've got to really generate your own music , you have to produce something , a CD or something that you can [ use to ] show your ability with , and in many cases , you have to show that you have an earning power already .
That 's a whole different level .
Most of our students are adding ... a better understanding of the music business , protecting their product and so on to the usual music education . "
Construction has begun on Berklee 's Valencia location , which willfeature built - in wiring for sharing large audio and video files , floating sound stages and performance areas without the pillars and L - shaped rooms that obstruct some of the rooms in the Boston location .
This will be a private university – somewhat of a rarity in Europe , where many secondary education costs are covered by tax dollars .
And it 's focused on areas that the traditional European music establishment has ignored .
" There is n't a country in Europe that does n't have great conservatories , " he explained , " but what we found from doing market research is that there are an awful lot of graduating students from , say , a classical composition school , who 've learned to write for symphony , chamber orchestra , ballet and so on , who want to enter the world of film music , or want to get into writing for videogames – all of the places in contemporary music where the electronic entertainment industry is lurking .
And what you learn in a conservatory just is n't going to help if your first movie is a contemporary detective story and they want a funk background in the opening scene . "

Pictured : Giant panda cubs that are hand - reared by researchers
They are one of the most endangered animals in the world , but these giant panda cubs are in safe hands .
The babies are being specially cared for by a team of workers at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding , in Sichuan Province , China .
Scientists at the research base aim to increase the captive population of giant pandas and ultimately reintroduce the distinctive black and white animals to the wild , with the help of artificial breeding .

Some of the panda cubs ' mothers had to transferred to the research base after the devastating earthquake which hit the Sichuan Province on May 12 , killing 70,000 people .
Researchers carried out psychological comfort on the pregnant mothers who were traumatised by the quake , which also destroyed vast swathes of their habitat .

There are only around 1,590 pandas living in China , mostly in the Sichuan area and the northwestern provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu .
Last year , the number of captive bred giant pandas was 239 .
Giant pandas are known for being sexually inactive .
Their numbers have been dwindling because of of their shrinking habitat .

The capture of a Saudi oil tanker by Somali pirates has focused attention on the lawless waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
This year 's spike in pirate attacks is not just a reflection of Somalia 's chronic instability , it 's also symptomatic of an unstable region .
An illegal economy is flourishing in the Gulf of Aden , with smugglers trading weapons , fuel and people between the Horn of Africa and Arabia .
Piracy attacks are clustered in the northern waters of the Gulf of Aden , close to Yemen 's coastline .
Yemen 's government is officially engaged in diplomatic efforts to stamp out piracy and broker peace talks with the various Somali factions .
But Yemen 's tiny coastguard is poorly resourced and the country 's foreign minister , Abu Bakr al - Qirbi , recently complained that plans for a multilateral naval deployment would pose a threat to Arab security .
( He blamed Israel for wanting to increase its influence in the area . )
There 's another reason why Yemen 's elite may be reluctant to see greater foreign interference in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden .
Yemen is the source of a significant number of weapons in circulation in Somalia , according to the United Nations ' monitoring group on the 1992 arms embargo to Somalia .
While million - dollar piracy ransoms are raising cash for arms , private interests in Yemen have no interest in ending piracy or bringing a halt to the war in Somalia .
And a new report by Chatham House concludes that Yemen 's own internal problems may soon contribute to increasing instability in the region .
The poorest nation in the Arab world confronts western policymakers with the prospect of another failed state .
This veneer democracy on the south - western tip of the Arabian peninsula faces rapid population growth , plummeting water tables and dwindling oil supplies .
Without substantial new discoveries of oil , the economy will surely hit a wall in the next few years and President Saleh 's patronage networks will dry up , exposing divisions among the tribes , political groups and religious interests .
In addition , jihadi networks in Yemen appear to be growing as operating conditions in Iraq and Saudi Arabia become more difficult .
The CIA director , Michael Hayden , said last week that Yemen is a " place where al - Qaida is strengthening .
We 've seen an unprecedented number of attacks this year .
Plots are increasing not only in number , but in sophistication , and the range of targets is broadening . "
Twin car bombs exploded at the gates of the US embassy in the capital , Sana'a , in September , confirming fears that Yemen is facing a resurgent terrorist movement .
Smuggling crews have already ferried 40,000 refugees from Somalia to Yemen so far this year , turning over $ 4 m .
If Yemen slides towards failure in the coming decade , the links between organised criminals , people traffickers and terrorist networks on both sides of the Gulf of Aden will grow .
State failure in Yemen would reduce any chance of progress towards peace in Somalia and create a lawless zone stretching from northern Kenya to Saudi Arabia – with 3.3 m barrels of oil a day transported right through the middle of it , on one of the world 's busiest shipping routes .

Palin gone , anything but forgotten
U.S. Republican vice - presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin waves to the crowd after U.S. Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) delivered his concession speech in Phoenix , November 4 , 2008 .

GOP vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin returned home in defeat to Wasilla , Alaska , on Wednesday night - leaving behind eyebrow - raising tales about towel - clad appearances and internal campaign feuds .
Palin had barely touched down when conservative Web sites began hawking defiant bumper stickers : " I 'll keep my guns , freedom and money .
You can keep ' The Change ' : Palin 2012 . "
It 's 1,460 days until the next election , and loyal Palinmaniacs have already kicked off the palin4 pres2012.com
Web site and mailing list .
Emerging from her plane , Palin was met with chants of " 2012 ! 2012 ! "
She left herself a very big open door when asked about her plans in four years .
" We 'll see what happens then , " she told reporters .
But even as she hedged , stories emerged this week that threatened to collapse Palin 's carefully cultivated pit bull - with - lipstick , moose - hunter , hockey - mom , maverick image .
Among the stories reported by Fox News and Newsweek magazine :
--
She showed up in front of John McCain campaign aides " wearing nothing but a towel . "
--
She sent campaign staff on a shopping spree for her family that insiders described as the " Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast . "
--
She was so shockingly ignorant of basic geography that aides prepping her for her single debate realized she did n't know that Africa is a continent and not a country , nor could she identify the countries that comprise North America .
Palin released a statement calling the accusations " so unfortunate and , quite honestly , sickening .
...
The accusations we are reading are not true . "
Conservative icon and author Richard Viguerie , who heads conservativehq.com - and who has called Palin " the new Ronald Reagan " - dismissed the reports Thursday and defended Palin as a figure who will continue to have enormous clout with conservatives .
" Almost the entire leadership of the McCain campaign was Washington insiders , lobbyists ... and they come from a very different background than Sarah Palin , " he said .
" She became a hero ... and a rising star in this campaign , " a status he said is likely to continue as conservatives aim to reshape and remarket their brand in the wake of the 2008 election landslide for Barack Obama .
GOP debates her future
Days after the election , Palin 's future is the subject of enormous speculation among Republicans - conservatives are pushing her to be among the party 's next generation of leaders even as the old guard appears to be distancing itself .
The enmity toward Palin within some factions of the GOP remains abundantly clear .
Even before the election was called on Tuesday night , damaging leaks began to spring from the embattled McCain campaign , some of whose top advisers were quoted in major newspapers suggesting Palin was a " whack job " and a " diva . "
Those advisers said she repeatedly went " rogue , " refusing to tell the campaign when she was talking up issues - such as Weather Underground member William Ayers ' supposed ties to Obama - or chatting on the telephone with a Canadian radio - show prankster who claimed to be French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
On election night , the New York Times reported , Palin showed up at McCain 's election - night gathering in Phoenix ready to read a concession speech .
It goes against campaign protocol for a vice presidential candidate to speak on election night , and the move was vetoed by McCain strategist Steve Schmidt .
Even Carl Cameron of conservative Fox News reported this week that Palin showed " real problems with basic civics " during her debate prep .
" She did n't know the nations involved in the North American Free Trade Agreement , " NAFTA , a key agreement between the United States , Mexico and Canada , he said GOP insiders told him .
She also " did n't understand that Africa was a continent and not a country , " and asked for explanation about the difference between South Africa and Africa , he reported .
Wearing just towels
Revelations by Newsweek also were shocking :
At the GOP convention , Palin was so " completely unfazed by the boys ' club fraternity she had just joined " that she greeted McCain advisers Schmidt and Mark Salter in her hotel room " wearing nothing but a towel , with another on her wet hair . "
And the lingering matter of her wardrobe spending continues - a Republican Party attorney has been assigned to look into Palin 's designer clothing purchases and , reportedly , to retrieve the expensive items .
Newsweek said that Palin " used low - level staffers to buy some of the clothes on their credit cards , " something that the McCain campaign did n't find out until aides asked for reimbursement .
" One aide estimated that she spent ' tens of thousands ' more than the reported $ 150,000 , and that $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 went to buy clothes for her husband .
Some articles of clothing have apparently been lost , " the magazine said .
" An angry aide ... said the truth will eventually come out when the Republican Party audits its books , " according to the magazine .
Still , conservative leaders downplayed those reports , insisting that base voters were deeply impressed by Palin and her contributions to the ticket .
" The candidacy of Sarah Palin was immensely helpful , absolutely essential to making this a reasonably close race , " said Morton Blackwell , Republican National Committee member from Virginia .
" If she had not been on the ticket , our Republican ticket would have fared as Dole 's did back in 1996 , " Blackwell said .
He called her one of " a new generation of conservatives in the Republican Party that we are looking at . "
GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway said that before anyone begins talking about Palin 's possibilities in 2012 , " watch how she is viewed in 2010 . "
" I would be very interested in how many candidates ask her to campaign , ask her to come out of Alaska and join her on the campaign trail as a standard - bearer , " she said .
On the potentially damaging stories , Conway added , " I 'm not surprised .
I 'm just very disappointed ... because it seemed like some of the stories were being dispatched before the campaign was over " - and at a time when the campaign had its hands full with other things , " like Florida . "
Short thoughts on KirinDave 's post The Opposite of Momentum , which the anti-Ruby crowd has latched on to as more evidence that Ruby is " falling flat on its face " .
Dave 's post appears to largely lament the lack of progress in the C implementations , be it their lack of performance , presence of memory leaks , or relatively primitive GC implementations .
He briefly mentions alternative implementations , calling Rubinius " the light and hope of the Rubyverse " and summarizing JRuby as " great " before dismissing both .
In Rubinius 's case , he may have a point .
There have been many setbacks , and after a year of funding six developers it 's still not really usable for real apps .
The sad news that their team has been cut to two paid developers certainly does n't help .
Most will agree that the Rubinius ideal , that of Ruby implemented in Ruby , is a great goal ... perhaps the highest ideal for a Ruby implementation .
But in practice , it 's turned out to be a lot harder to execute ... and impossible to execute in a year with six smart hackers .
Update :
My intent here seems to have been missed .
I am not in any way claiming " Rubinius sucks " , because Rubinius is n't even finished yet .
I would not make such a claim about any incomplete project .
I mention Rubinius only because Dave dismissed both in the same breath ; to address one case I felt I needed to address the other .
Rubinius will succeed ... of that I have no doubt .
And already it has proven many things possible nobody ever expected to see .
It 's unknown how long it will take to " get there " but it will " get there " eventually , and be a major contender for replacing the standard impls .
Dave 's use of Rubinius to help prove a lack of momentum is almost as questionable as his out - of - hand dismissal of JRuby .
We 've started to attempt an integration of Rubinius 's kernel into JRuby , and we 've added Rubinius 's FFI and MVM APIs because they were very well - designed .
We continue to contribute to the RubySpecs , and I eagerly offer any technical help I can whenever the Rubinius team has questions about how JRuby solves certain problems .
What more good things do you want me to say about Rubinius ?
However when we look at JRuby , Dave is entirely wrong to dismiss it in a single sentence .
JRuby * is * what he wants , in almost every way .
JRuby runs on the best available dynamic language VM , Hotspot .
Hotspot has its roots in the Smalltalk world Rubyists hold in such high esteem , and real steps are being taken to make it even better than before for dynamic languages .
The end result will be trivially inlinable dynamic calls nearly as fast as static Java code , which no other VM in the world can claim .
JRuby does not have GC headaches and memory leaks like the C impls because we use the existing GC options on Hotspot ... which are , again , some of the best GC implementations in the world .
It 's folly to say that an implementation from scratch is going to be able to compete with JRuby on JVM , because the simple truth is that making a world - class VM and / or GC is super dooper hard .
Even where JRuby still stumbles a bit , like the classic JVM problem areas of memory use and startup time , we 've made huge strides .
JRuby starts up no slower than Rubinius at its fastest ... in many cases under a second .
And memory - wise , we pay little cost beyond the JVM's own 20 - 30 MB memory tax , while still working to reduce our overall consumption with every release .
JRuby is also moving faster than any implementation available .
A year ago , we were generally a bit slower than Ruby 1.8.6 ; this year , we 're faster in most cases than Ruby 1.9 .
A year ago , there were a handful of early - adopting production users ; this year , dozens of them , ranging from small orgs and agile projects to governments , banks , and telecom .
There 's no lack of momentum when it comes to JRuby .
To top all this off , there 's still dozens of folks working to make Hotspot even faster , it 's GCs even smarter , and we just come along for the ride .
Yes , we 've done a lot because we have n't implemented our own VM specifically for Ruby .
But that 's exactly the point ... we 've been able to focus on areas that matter most , like actually running apps and running them as fast as possible .
The bottom line , as far as I can see it , is that if the C impls of are n't moving fast enough , and the " light of the Rubyverse " is hitting a few roadblocks , you damn well better give JRuby more consideration than one sentence .
I certainly hope this was n't a reflection of any continuing anti-Java bigotry in the Ruby world , since as I 've mentioned previously that attitude will only make things worse .
If it reflects simple ignorance as to why JRuby really will be a better Ruby , then we 're not doing a good enough job educating ... help us do better .
JRuby is continuing to do things no other Ruby has been able to do .
We 've cracked the Enterprise glass ceiling , with numerous deployments inside some of the most rigidly Java - centric and intransigent organizations around .
We 've shown it 's possible for Ruby to perform extremely well , and we 've only scratched the surface of Hotspot 's potential .
We 've implemented most of Ruby 1.9's features in just a few months , where other implementations have barely gotten 1.8 working .
And we 're just getting started ... we have plans upon plans to continue improving compatibility , performance , scaling , and ease - of - use , and the various folks working on the JVM will continue making it a better and better host for dynamic languages .
If you have n't used JRuby yet , you 're really missing out .
It 's time to give it a try .
( Footnote : Do n't take this as a shot at any of the other impls ; it 's obvious JRuby had a big head start , and we 've been funded longer ( albeit less ) than most of them .
This post is squarely focused on anyone like Dave that thinks if the C impls do n't solve all Ruby 's implementation woes , Ruby is doomed .
The truth is that Ruby will survive despite any lingering issues in the C impls , and JRuby is a crucial part of that survival . )

If you are either wanting to get married or are married and possibly facing the prospect of a divorce soon , you need to prepare yourself for this eventuality .
One of the early tactics , in a divorce proceedings , and is pretty much standard operating procedure , is the filing of a petition for an Injunction Against Domestic Violence which sets the stage for further injustices to be heaped on the target spouse .
From the statistics available as to the number of them filed , it is the weapon of choice with a majority of women , usually on the advice of their lawyer .
To show how simple it is , here is an answer by a Florida lawyer to a question asked about the procedure :
Q. How Do I Get a Domestic Violence Injunction ?
A
: You must go to the local courthouse and see the clerk of court .
The clerk will give you a document to fill out , called a Petition for and Injunction Against Domestic Violence .
A Judge will look at your petition within the next few hours and sign it if you are actually in danger .
After the Judge 's signature , the Domestic Violence Injunction is active .
The court will schedule a hearing two weeks in the future .
You must attend that hearing if you wish the Injunction to remain in effect .
The person whom the Injunction is against gets a chance to appear and fight the injunction .
You can
read more about the
process .
The procedures are probably pretty similar from state to state .
In this process , the spouse [ usually the man ] against whom the injunction is filed is kind of a helpless spectator in a process over which they have no control .
It is all done on an ex parte [ by one side ] basis without a chance to defend themselves until the hearing in several weeks .
Not only is the injunction filed against you without any chance for your defending yourself , but once it is granted by the judge there is another serious negative aspect that will really frost your cojones if you are one of the many proponents and participants in the 2nd amendment right to own and bear arms .
For you to possess a weapon when under an injunction .... it is a federal crime !
Here is an excerpt from the Florida Bar Journal article :
Civil Orders of Protection and the Prohibition of Firearms Possession
" In 1994 , the Violence Against Women Act ’s amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 made it a federal crime for a person who is subject to a qualifying order of protection to possess , ship , or receive a firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce . 8 A “ qualifying ” order means that the court order must be issued after a hearing where the restrained person received actual notice , and where the person had an opportunity to participate .9
Basically , a qualifying order conforms to basic concepts of due process .
­Further , the court order must restrain the person from harassing , stalking , or threatening an intimate partner or child of such person , or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child .10 Additionally , the court order must include a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child ; or by its terms explicitly prohibit the use , attempted use , or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury . " [
]
What to do if falsely accused
Fighting false allegations of abuse :
Give no statement to any authority or any person , even a friend , until you have talked to legal counsel .
your only statement should be "
I DEMAND TO SEE COUNSEL
" Nothing you say will be used to help you , only hinder you .
Do not hold
ANY
conversation in a jail .
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT
.
Do not agree to any polygraph other than a private one set up by your attorney .
Later , upon your attorney 's ok , when asked by any authority to take a polygraph say " only if you first give the accuser one to determine whether the allegations are false and after that only if you guarantee in writing that if I pass the test you will drop any investigation of me and prosecute the accuser for filing a false police report . "
( They never agree to let a polygraph help you , only to hurt you ! )
How can you protect yourself in this situation ?
One of the things you can do is to simply plan on it happening and preparing a get - out - of - town safety - net fund and / or a credit card that no one knows about [ from which you can cover your expenses when you are removed from the house ] and that are hidden away for this occurrence .
Do n't be caught unaware !
--------------------------------
Do you think your spouse has hidden any assets away ?
Or , have you hidden some away and wonder if they are safe from detection ?
Now you can find out what you need to know with

An IT administrator scorned is not to be trusted , according to a study recently conducted by Cyber - Ark .
The security firm claims a survey conducted on 300 security professionals found a whopping 88 per cent of IT admins would steal valuable and sensitive company information if they were fired tomorrow .
Only 12 per cent said they 'd leave empty handed — or at least were smart enough not to openly admit they 'd plunder sensitive data on a questionnaire .
" Our advice is to secure these privileged passwords and identities , and routinely change and manage them so that if an employee 's contract is terminated , whether voluntary or not , they can't maliciously wreak havoc inside the network or vindictively steal data for competitive or financial gain , " said Cyber - Ark CEO Udi Mokady .
We should note Cyber - Ark sells products that manage , log , and update privileged passwords , so swallow that incredibly high percentage with a grain of salt - or twenty .
A vested - interest does n't necessarily mean the findings are bunk , however .
Based on the average amount of barely - bottled rage we field from data center denizens , we dare say they caught the troops in a moment of vulnerable honesty .
Bless them .
In other tid-bits , a quarter of the companies polled admitted to suffering from internal sabotage and security fraud in their workplace .
One third said they believe industrial espionage and data leakage is occurring within their company .
But even paying the big bucks for security systems does n't mean a thing when admins get sloppy .
One third of IT admins surveyed admit to having written down privileged passwords on a post - it note . ®
Is the Solar Industry Hurting the Environment ?
November 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Solar energy is necessary for our transition to a sustainable economy , but a recent study in Geophysical Research Letters suggests that the industry may be harming the environment .
Nitrogen Triflouride ( NF3 ) , a greenhouse gas used by the semiconductor industry to clean the chambers where silicon chips are produced , has 17,000 times the globe - warming capacity of CO2 .
Now researchers believe that emissions of the gas are up to 4 times higher than previously thought — perhaps as high as 16 percent .
With LCD televisions and thin film solar cells becoming more common , NF3 is following suit .
Each year , NF3 production almost doubles .
And lest you think electronics companies are actually paying attention to NF3 production , well , they are n’t .
There are no regulations for NF3 , and companies are n’t required to keep records of its use .
But there is hope — companies such as Toshiba , Samsung , and LG have begun using an NF3 alternative ( fluorine ) that does n ”t pose a risk of global warming .
Though the fluorine production system is not yet cheap enough for smaller manufacturers , increased awareness of NF3 ’s impact should put pressure on the semiconductor industry to eliminate it .

END THE FED
On November 22nd , rallies in 39 cities will commence at Federal Bank locations throughout America .
We have one message : END THE FED .
We invite all of you to join the rally at your locations .
The official website is www.endthefed.us
For a list of rally locations , click here .
Update : A reader sez ,
I can tell you firsthand that no Republican officials that I know of have been involved in this situation .
There are certainly partisan undertones around this story however , considering the Obama campaign has much to gain from a large registration effort at Va .
Tech .
But any facts supporting the idea that Republicans were behind the misinformation distributed by the county where Virginia Tech is located have not emerged .
You can read the original story here
You might also be interested in this subsequent story , which points out that the campus and surrounding area is divided into no fewer than five precincts , and the main polling place for the area where most dorms are located is four miles from the campus and inaccessible by public transportation .
Shamelessly breaking boundaries here at SFist , we 're letting budding SFist star Tiffany Maleshefski use the first - person voice with this opinion piece .
Not because youu Editor necessarily disagrees with the sentiment ; it just works better this way .
By Tiffany Maleshefski
To add one more outraged voice to the mix , I too will echo the sentiments expressed by millions of others today , on how the passing of Proposition 8 is not only heartbreaking and disappointing , it ’s unjust , unfair , and a complete breach of privacy .
And while this measure dukes it out in the courts , I say we move forward and begin preparing for the next election , where we do not need to plan on resurrecting Proposition 8 ( or anything like it for that matter ) .
Rather , I ’d like to propose something that digs into the personal lives of people even deeper .
For me , Proposition 8 kind of does n’t go far enough .
Here ’s my proposal .
Let ’s just ban marriage altogether .
I ’d like to get everyone on board with a new measure I ’m calling the “ Divorce Prevention Initiative . ”
I think marriage is so sacred , that really , the only way to preserve its sanctity is probably to make sure it never happens in the first place .
Let ’s all think for a moment think of all those terrible anti-marriage people who file for divorce .
They ’ll all tell you : I should ’ve never gotten married in the first place !
Am I right ?
Just think of how many celebrities would n’t have to get divorced , if they just did n’t brazenly get married altogether .
Just think of how we many high - powered CEOs could continue having affairs with their interns without risking harm to the purity of this institution .
And of course , let ’s think of the children .
Imagine how better we ’ll all feel when we have to stop blaming our kids for mommy and daddy ’s marital woes .
Over the anguished cries and resigned sighs of its victims , the financial storm that broke out in August 2007 also echoes with a different kind of noise , ringing with shouts of triumph and head - shaking :  I told you so . 
 Here we have the utter failure of Anglo - American laissez faire ! 
 This is the shameful result of immoral greed on the part of capitalists lacking any sense of social responsibility !
 Neo -liberalism ( but why neo ? ) has shown its noxious impotence the strong hand of the state is needed to save the system !
 After thirty years of mindless deregulation , we must now urgently erect a new , comprehensive , and tight framework of regulation !
Nearly everyone seems persuaded that the financial system that has been behaving so perversely in the recent past and has not yet finished doing so is one of purebred deregulated free market capitalism .
This is not the case ( just as the late lamented Soviet Union was not a purebred socialist system ) .
It is true that since World War II , the economies of Western Europe and North America have been gradually freed of a certain amount of regulatory ballast .
Trade was liberalized , controls on capital movements relaxed or abolished , and the institution of contract has regained some of its 19th century liberty .
Nevertheless , the system remained a hybrid , with a great deal of active or latent state intervention , an oppressive fiscal regime , an anti-capitalist and anti-profit public ethos in Continental Europe , and important financial regulations that were capable of producing self - defeating results and did produce some in the present turbulence .
In fact , they were among the chief causes that set off the turbulence .
How and Why The Storm Broke Out
One of the initial impulses was the smooth , steady and seemingly inexorable rise in American home prices over the last 15 years or so .
Economic growth was brisk and fairly regular .
Brisk growth should lead to higher interest rates , but the interest rate environment stayed comfortably low ( and consequently , mortgages were relatively cheap ) because the progress of globalization put a downward pressure on traded goods prices and inflation remained moderate .
Buying a home with mortgage loans , or more often than not selling the old home and buying a more expensive one , seemed a sure - fire method of making a handsome capital gain .
Strengthening this tendency was the American income tax law that made mortgage interest on loans up to $ 1 million tax - deductible .
This favor to homebuyers was estimated to amount to an annual subsidy ( tax savings ) of $ 80 billion .
Thus , after - tax borrowing costs were cheap .
Lending to homebuyers as much as 100 percent of the homes price seemed practically riskless .
Moreover , regulations encouraged mortgage lending to less creditworthy borrowers .
For instance , the Community Reinvestment Acts of 1977 and 1995 required banks to discriminate in favor of poorer borrowers .
The Comptroller of the Currency treated more leniently the banks that lent socially .
The result of these practices was that as long as home prices did not start falling , perhaps only a few hundred billion out of the 13 trillion dollars of mortgages in existence was dubious .
But declining home prices in the first half of 2007 caused the volume of subprime mortgages to multiply quickly .
Much blame has since been heaped on two recent financial techniques , securitization and the extensive use of various derivatives ( especially credit default swaps , a method of insurance whose volume now exceeds $ 60 trillion , more than four times the United States GNP ) .
These techniques have been of enormous benefit to the world economy because they distributed risk to those most willing to bear it .
A very rough estimate , though little more than a guess , put their total contribution to world wealth at 30 trillion .
However , the fact that securitization transformed mortgages into marketable securities had dire consequences .
The Perverse Effect of Regulations
As home prices declined , the market value of securities backed by subprime mortgages started to fall .
Partly because the quality of the collateral was unclear , there were few willing buyers and mortgage - backed security prices fell steeply ( one such portfolio was sold by Merrill Lynch at 22 per cent of face value ) .
 Fair value accounting under FASB and IASB rules requires that marketable securities be carried in bank balance sheets at  market value . 
Marking down their mortgage portfolios to the price of an almost nonexistent market made huge holes in the banks  own capital .
This , in turn , made them violate the regulations ( the  Basel II rules ) prescribing the capital backing they must have against risky assets .
Being in violation forced them to sell the assets at almost any price , and the resulting pressure on mortgage - backed security prices caused them , and other banks , to be in ever greater violation of the regulations .
Thus , the combined effect of two seemingly reasonable regulations has produced an avalanche .
Some old and prestigious names simply collapsed under it , and almost every bank and insurance company fell under ( usually quite groundless ) suspicion of insufficient liquidity and solvency .
Interbank lending , an absolutely basic element of any modern financial system , dried up because lenders suspected that any borrower might be hiding some secret weakness or regulatory vice .
The two accounting standard boards that prescribe what auditors will or will not accept or certify remain inflexible about marketable assets having to be marked to market ,  even if the holder is under no pressure at all to sell and even if market conditions are temporarily chaotic and prices absurd .
There is something to be said for such severity , but giving some discretion to banks for valuing their securities portfolios by reason rather than rigid regulation might have avoided much unnecessary havoc .
Much the same could be said of Basel II .
The interaction of the two rules generated a vicious circle that reinforced itself with every turn .
The whole scenario illustrates the potential of hybrid systems , such as the actual set of liberal elements mixed with dirigiste ones , for making a moderately bad initial disequilibrium into something very much worse .
Doing Their Best To Create Panic
As we all know , the function of a banking system is to solicit resources from depositors by offering them a high degree of liquidity and to offer these resources to other economic agents on a longer - term basis .
The obvious condition for the transformation of short liabilities into longer assets is confidence .
The corollary tells us that if confidence is shaken and panic starts , no amount of even the most severe regulation can save the system from at least partial breakdown .
There are then only two possible outcomes .
One is to let the breakdown happen and work itself out .
This involves sharp losses for some and equivalent gains for others in a zero- sum game . 
The other is to force the taxpayer to lend the resources that are needed for the immediate repair of the breakdown .
This game is also zero-sum , though more complex .
The taxpayer may end up among the gainers , as happened with the United States  Resolution Trust Corporation that was called upon to repair the savings and loan bankruptcy after 1989 and as is quite likely to happen with the quasi-nationalization of the AIG insurance giant or the Fortis group in 2008 .
One of the saddest and most depressing aspects of the 2007 - 2008 financial breakdowns is that panic was generated without sufficient objective grounds for it and without the intention to do so .
The American mortgage default problem caused a loss to the lenders , mostly banks , estimated at just under 1 trillion dollars .
This was in major part also zero-sum , for there was no destruction of real wealth and no loss of current production of goods and services ; the mortgaged homes were still standing and were lived in by the original borrowers or could be rented out if foreclosed .
The trillion - dollar loss was really a redistribution of existing wealth , painful but not catastrophic , nor really large in relation to a 14 trillion dollar American economy .
The news media have nevertheless opened up a round - the - clock barrage of panicky comment , sufficiently shrill and intense to put fear into all but the coolest heads .
We might say that the media must be forgiven , for their business is to interest and excite an audience , not to serve the common good .
What can not be forgiven is the panic - mongering declarations of some of the most august authorities whose business is not to excite the public and get their names in the headlines , but to use their authority to preserve calm and a sense of proportion .
They , unlike the media , are paid to serve the common good , not their own personal notoriety from the prestigious pulpit where they have been placed .
Least of all are they paid to play Cassandra .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the probable Socialist candidate in the 2012 French presidential elections , was nominated last year to head the International Monetary Fund by the center - right French government , reputedly in order to remove him from the leadership of his party .
This objective , if true , has failed .
Mr. Strauss - Kahn is using his Washington post both to manage the fund in a high profile , strident manner quite unlike the discreet style of his predecessors and to gain authority in France as an economic expert of world renown .
Since the outbreak of the financial turmoil in August 2007 soon after his appointment to the IMF , he has on several occasions declared that the situation was due to get worse and catastrophe was threatening the system .
Saying so has certainly helped to make it so .
In fairness to Mr. Strauss - Kahn , he was not alone in earning publicity by frightening bankers , depositors , and businessmen alike and rendering the situation more and more difficult to manage .
Alistair Darling , Britains Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) , a mediocre man with a precarious hold on a position too big for him , has also done his best , as have several less highly placed public figures .
Given that financial stability depends essentially on confidence , their alarmist prophecies had a good chance of becoming self - fulfilling .
Transforming the Hybrid System
The current financial upset looks particularly frightening because both the North American and the European economies are expected to move into recession or are already there .
Many observers even believe that the recession has actually been caused by the financial systems near - collapse .
It is amusing to reflect how this state of mind lacks a sense of proportion .
French GDP in the second quarter of 2008 has declined by 0.3 percent and is expected to fall by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
There is general alarm and despondency that the worst has in fact happened the recession is in place .
Suppose , however , that the official statistics , instead of stating the percentage decline , simply stated that GDP in the second quarter was 99.7 and for the following two quarters was forecast at 99.9 , compared to 100 a year earlier .
It would surely be grotesque to call this a catastrophe .
There is now near - unanimity that the actual hybrid system of banking regulation was far too liberal , permissive , and tolerant of irresponsibility and greed perhaps even the cause of irresponsibility and greed .
Prominent voices are calling for moralizing  it and for purging it of the speculation that is understood to be a synonym for financial immorality .
This populist wave will probably peter out when the storm calms down and will merely leave a belief in the popular mind that liberalism does not work ; it was tried and see the result . 
One lasting effect is likely to be a series of regulatory obstacles to make speculation more difficult to carry out .
Such measures , reflecting economic illiteracy and a childish incapacity to understand the place of speculation in a market economy , will do damage too dear to the Everymans heart to be avoided .
The marking to market accounting rule will probably be relaxed doing so would in fact be a liberal and benign move .
For the rest , however , the present liberal - and - dirigiste mixed system is likely to be remodeled in a very much more dirigiste mold .
Such a change would make banking and finance neither safer nor more moral .
In fact , it would favor the least scrupulous and most agile type of bankers and financiers who are best able to get round or slip through the regulatory net .
In a pure liberal system , durable success and profit maximization depend on gaining and retaining the confidence of depositors and other creditors .
In a pure  dirigiste system , it is not the customers that must be satisfied , but the regulators .
In any hybrid system between the two , it may not be possible to satisfy either the customers or the regulators .

A Vision For A Better Future For The American People And People Throughout The Planet .
Fellow blogger , Thomas Watts , recently had this response to my " Write In Presidency " - and the " New Agenda for America " - which contained my explicit set of initial policy planks .
===================
I 'm still voting for you .
When can you start ?
This is a valiant effort but you do realize that Dobbs is a member of the CFR .
Do n't you ?
There are giant bucks in the drug war .
Therefore , it 'll never happen .
I hate to be a wet blanket but like they say , ' Facts is Facts ' .
===================
I 've already started .
My " mission " was never seriously about winning the Presidency .
My " New Agenda for America " is my attempt to change the minds of the American People by -- unlike any of the other Presidential Candidates -- presenting an explicit agenda of things that need to be done in order to serve the will of the American People .
You may or may not like every plank on my agenda , however , there is little question as to what I intend by each plank .
And the " People " are now primed for change as the new victim will not be some stranger losing his / her job etc .
Nope , this time it will reach so wide that the American People will have no alternative other than " putting up " or " shutting up . "
This coming DEPRESSION is going to be far worse than the " Great Depression " and virtually everyone is going to be effected in some significant way .
My prediction is that , once the " People " begin to understand the real Obama agenda , his approval rating will fall below 50 % as soon as June 2009 .
And that may very well explain why we have a division of US troops , on US soil , to be deployed to staunch the " civil unrest " that is almost assured if Obama does not find a way to make the American People " whole " once again .
As for the Drug War let us consider that Marijuana has only been illegal for less than a third of our " republics " history : a mere 70 years .
My state , of Michigan , became the 13th state to Legalize Medical Marijuana and now 25 % of the American people have potential access to Medical Marijuana .
On top of that the demographics are increasingly swinging toward complete Marijuana Re-Legalization for all Adult Americans -- something I have unabashedly been working on for over 20 years now .
Then look at the international movement against the Drug War .
Mexico , Venezuela and Bolivia are seriously considering " bailing out " on the Drug War : beginning with the legalization of Marijuana .
The Re-Legalization of Marijuana is inevitable and will have tectonic effects on so many things :
* Attorneys will lose out on profiting from the near 500,000 Marijuana arrests each year .
* Drug testing labs will lose huge amounts of revenue .
* The Prison Industrial Complex will be gutted and the US will no longer have the largest per capita number of its citizens behind bars or in some other form of judicial control
* The Multi-National Banks that launder billions in drug money , each year , will loose significant revenue
* Drug gangs , and drug cartels alike , will collapse as Re-Legalized Marijuana has a " Gatekeeper " - effect ( e.g. , since users will be able to " brew " - their own Marijuana they will have less contact with those that sell harder drugs such as Heroin , Cocaine and Methamphetamine .
* The government will no longer be able to do anything with all that surveillance data they insist on accumulating on each American Citizen .
* Clemency for all non-violent drug use will reduce the absurd amounts of money spent on the Prison Industrial Complex and the number of felons will be reduced drastically .
In light of these facts I still hold out much hope .
Getting beyond Drug Policy :
I think the most important thing that needs to be conveyed to the American People is that they have been the victims of the largest Ponzi Scam in US history , and this scam was supported by both parties , both houses of Congress , the Multi-National Corporate Elite and the President himself .
And , as in all bodies of law , those that commit crimes need to be punished and those that have been victimized need to be made " whole " once again .
As the American People begin to understand the true ramifications of the " bailout " their anger will be felt in ways that have never occurred in US history .
There is no doubt in my mind that civil unrest will result unless the elite gives back to the People , what belongs to the People .
And I can only pray that at the end of the day , it will be the American People that prevail .
I also think it important that the American People recognize that the economic transition that we are about to undergo -- like it or not -- is not merely a " cyclic " change that occurs every 50 - 100 years , largely due to intentional manipulation of the markets by a Global Elite .
Nope , this is more like the transition between a " hunting and gathering society " and an " agricultural society " which resulted in the vertical transformation of society which laid the foundation for today 's Global Elite .
In the present case we are moving from a " exponential growth " model to a " static " sustainable model .
This will be the most challenging transition in the history of human civilization .
It will require that we consider every " indirect cost " ( e.g. , pollution , Negative GDP realities etc. ) and that the resulting model results in true sustainability .
I know this seems rather daunting as we proceed forward .
But we have accumulated such a body of knowledge over the past millennia that I can't help but remain hopeful .
Despair , only leaves only in a state of inaction and is a sure recipe for disaster .
It leaves us with no more hope than a flock of sheep , being led to the slaughter house .
Again I see much reason for hope .
Each day enough sunlight falls upon the Earth to replace all of our current energy resources : oil , nuclear , coal etc. for an entire year .
Should we liberate the " holy grail " of photovoltaics our energy needs as it will be met and the CO2 vector -- as much as it really contributes to Global Warming -- will be erased .

End -of - Oktoberfest Statistics 6.6 Million Liters of Beer , 104 Oxen and No False Teeth
It 's that sad time of year again -- the Munich Oktoberfest is over .
But the annual post - Oktoberfest statistics on beer and oxen consumption make for entertaining reading , as does the list of lost items which for the first time since records began does not include a set of false teeth .
A 24 - year - old woman who spent her life as a slave has taken the Niger government to court , claiming it failed her by ignoring its own laws .
Peter Beaumont and Alexander Carnwath report
In one of the most extraordinary episodes in African legal history , a panel of judges from Senegal , Mali and Togo will tomorrow issue a verdict expected to give fresh hope to more than 40,000 people being held as slaves in rural Niger and across the region .
The landmark case of Hadijatou Mani , a courageous young woman of 24 , will be heard in a packed court in Niger 's capital , Niamey , which will decide whether Niger 's government has failed to protect Ms Mani and tens of thousands like her who have been enslaved , despite the practice being outlawed five years ago .
If she wins her case , which is being heard by the justice arm of the Economic Community of West African States ( Ecowas ) , she is likely to be awarded compensation of up to £ 40,000 , in a humiliating reversal for the authorities she blames for her lost youth .
Ms Mani was sold into slavery at the age of 12 and repeatedly raped by her master .
Her appalling story is familiar in a country where the ownership of slaves , many from a hereditary slave caste , has been commonplace , particularly in remote rural areas .
Speaking before the judgment , Ms Mani said : ' It was very difficult to challenge my former master and to speak out when people see you as nothing more than a slave .
But I knew that this was the only way to protect my child from suffering the same fate .
Nobody deserves to be enslaved .
' We are all equal and deserve to be treated the same as anyone else .
I hope that all those who are in slavery today can find their freedom .
No woman should suffer the way I did .'
Helen Duffy , a lawyer who has represented Ms Mani , said : ' I 'm really optimistic .
It is such a clear case .
She has suffered so much .
It is just the clearest violation . '
The life of a sadaka - sexual slave - has been described in detail by Ms Mani in the court , in front of some of the country 's most senior political figures .
Speaking nervously at first , she told the court how she had been born a slave , been sold and transferred as a child against her mother 's wishes to a man named El Hadj Souleymane Naroua .
She testified that she had been raped at 13 and constantly forced to have sex with her 63 - year - old master , who owned seven other slaves .
Beatings were frequent and she and other slaves were forced to work unpaid and gruelling hours for Naroua and his four legitimate wives .
When she tried to escape , she was punished .
In 2005 , two years after Niger enacted a law forbidding slavery , she was presented with a ' liberation certificate ' .
This proved to be worthless , as she was immediately forced into a ' wahiya marriage ' , with the status of a concubine .
When she fled and married another man , her master had her arrested and charged with bigamy .
She was subsequently imprisoned for two months on remand .
It is believed that if tomorrow 's verdict goes in her favour , the bigamy charges will be dropped .
' You could see her grow in stature through her testimony , ' said Duffy .
' When she was done we left the courtroom and , for the first time , I saw her smile ; an enormous , satisfied smile .
She was justifiably very proud of herself . '
The issue has become a deeply embarrassing one for the government of Niger .
Despite introducing the anti-slavery legislation , it has failed to act on evidence of its continuing and widespread existence in rural areas .
One Nigerien official told the UN committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 2007 that he could prove that ' slavery does not exist in Niger ' .
As well as being banned under Nigerien law , slavery is outlawed under many of the international agreements Niger has signed up to , including the UN Slavery Convention of 1926 and the African Charter on Human and People 's Rights .
But international conventions and national laws count for little compared to the centuries old ' customary law ' that holds sway in rural villages and towns .
According to Anti-Slavery International , Niger 's courts have frequently proved reluctant to enforce law over custom .
In one case in 2006 , both the sentence and fine against one slave owner , Seidimou Hiya , were massively reduced .
The case of a 15 - year - old girl who sought help from Timidria , a Nigerien anti-slavery group , after fleeing her slave master , was thrown out after the local prosecutor ruled that she was a ' disobedient girl ' .
Ms Mani's case against the government rests on witness testimony , including that relating to her sale to Naroua .
The government 's witnesses , tribal chiefs , have claimed not to understand the terms of enslavement , then changed their evidence twice .
' We are hoping for a strong message on this , ' said Romana Cacchioli , Africa programme officer of Anti-Slavery International , which worked with Timidria to bring the case .
' It would send out a clear message that the longstanding prohibition of slavery must be enforced .
' Although it 's all well and good that states ratify human rights conventions , we need them to ensure effective implementation .
We hope the court will recommend the state trains its judicial staff and raises the issue of slavery through a national publicity campaign .
It is not the state of Niger which is perpetrating slavery , it is individuals , but the state has a responsibility .
' Hadijatou is really impressive .
She comes across as very unassuming .
She knows she has been wronged .
She was in court with her baby strapped on her back .
She says she does not want the same thing that happened to her to happen to her daughter .
Her vision is in terms of others . '
Campaigners hope a favourable ruling may herald a major cultural shift on the issue of descent - based slavery throughout the Sahel region .
The court 's judgment will be binding in Niger and will be applicable in other countries in the Ecowas community where descent - based slavery exists , including Mali .

Africa news round up : Global Fund holds back money for HIV and malaria treatment , Ugandan health system criticised and ' no cuts ' in aid to Africa
Uganda has lost 25 bn Ugandan shillings ( $ 12 m ) of Global Fund money due to concerns over poor accountability , according to reports this week .
The Global Fund has refused to release a second $ 10 m instalment from the $ 36 m pot it allocated for HIV / Aids activities in Uganda in 2003 because it was not satisfied with how initial payments have been spent , reported New Vision .
A further $ 2 m is yet to be disbursed from the $ 24 m allocated for malaria work under the Global Fund in 2004 .
In 2005 Uganda was suspended from the Global Fund over irregularities in the administration of funds .
This year , the Ugandan government began proceedings to prosecute those accused of embezzling Global Fund money , including two former health ministers .
Aidspan , the independent watchdog that monitors Global Fund activities worldwide , said Uganda failed to satisfy the fund that the arrangements put in place after its suspension were robust enough to protect its money from misuse .
In an interview with New Vision , an Aidspan representative said the $ 12 m grants were now so far behind schedule that they " become irredeemable " .
The news comes in the same week that the Uganda Aids Commission said Uganda requires an estimated 1.3tr Ugandan shillings ( $ 700 m ) over the next 18 months to finance vital HIV / Aids activities .
The commission said that 25 % of this sum should go towards prevention and 50 % towards treatment , care and delivery of drugs and services .
This week has also seen groups representing people living with HIV and Aids reject Uganda 's new draft HIV / Aids prevention and control bill 2008 .
The draft bill criminalises the intentional transmission of HIV .
The National Forum of People Living with HIV / Aids Networks in Uganda said that the country should avoid creating scenarios where people living with HIV / Aids are looked on as criminals .
Health system criticised
Uganda 's decentralised health system is to blame for the poor delivery of health services across the country , according to health minister Stephen Mallinga .
Speaking at the 14th health sector joint review meeting in Kampala on Monday , Mallinga said the decentralised recruitment of health workers had led to a culture of " tribalism " , with many health workers recruited and remaining within their own home regions , reported the Daily Monitor .
This has led to an uneven distribution of qualified health workers across the country , particularly in regions with few of its own qualified medical staff .
Mallinga added that decentralisation was also thwarting health workers ' chances of being promoted and transferred to other regions .
" Once you are recruited to Kisoro you are likely to be tied up there forever without getting an opportunity to upgrade and be promoted , " he said .
At the same meeting the Belgium ambassador to Uganda , Jan de Bruyne , warned that Uganda is off - track to meet the Millennium Development Goals on reducing child and maternal mortality as a consequence of its " poor healthcare system " .
Economic troubles continue
Uganda 's economic woes continued this week with an estimated 114bn Ugandan shillings ( $ 54 m ) wiped off the local stock market in one day .
The losses recorded on October 27 were the result of panic selling by stockbrokers in the Uganda Securities Exchange , reported the Daily Monitor .
Of the losses , Shs 23.6 bn evaporated from six locally listed companies , including Uganda Clays , New Vision and the Bank of Baroda .
Despite assurances from the Bank of Uganda and the government that the economy would weather the global financial downturn with minimal effect , confidence among local investors is falling .
Last week the shilling collapsed against the dollar , falling to a low of Shs 2,200 .
As a result fuel prices have spiked , with a litre of petrol rising by nearly Shs 300 .
With Uganda 's heavy dependency on foreign imports , prices of other goods are expected to start rising soon .
The governor of the Bank of Uganda , Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile , attributed the scarcity of dollars to a fall in remittances from Ugandans working abroad who have lost their jobs or had their work hours cut .
No cut in aid to Africa
The global financial downturn will not see donors slash aid to Africa , according to the World Bank .
Despite the widespread belief that western countries hit by a faltering global economy will renege on aid commitments , Shanta Devarajan , the World Bank 's chief economist for the Africa region , says that reduction in foreign aid among donor countries is still a long way off .
Writing on his World Bank blog last week , africacan.worldbank.org , he said : " Two things need to happen for the crisis to lead to a significant reduction in foreign aid .
First , the financial crisis has to lead to a major recession in donor countries .
Second , the recession leads to such fiscal constraints that foreign aid is cut . "
He argued that the world is not yet at this stage of economic decline and that aid is motivated largely by non-economic factors .
His comments followed an appeal from the chairman of the African Union , the Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete , to the west not to cut aid to Africa .
Concerns have been also raised by Uganda 's Central Bank that Uganda will face deep cuts in development funding as donor countries pour millions into shoring up faltering financial institutions .
This week some of the world 's largest NGOs confirmed they were revising budgets , cutting staff and reviewing their 2009 programmes of funding and activity .
Robert Zachritz , World Vision 's director of advocacy and government relations , told IRIN news he believed micro-credit programmes could be particularly hit .
" Much of this [ micro - finance credit ] relies on getting loans from banks , which is going to be a real challenge in the near future .
Losing this credit is a huge problem for the world 's poor , small - scale farmers . "
Carbon finance for African farmers
Environmental experts are examining ways in which the billions of dollars available under the Kyoto Protocol could be used to help improve the lives of farmers across Africa .
Earlier this week , more than 100 experts from five continents met in the US to discuss ways in which carbon finance could be used to help fund agricultural development in some of the world 's poorest countries .
Carbon finance has been developed under the Kyoto Protocol 's Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) , whereby industrialised nations can fulfil their commitments to reducing their carbon footprint by investing in emission - saving projects overseas .
To qualify for funding , agricultural projects in Africa would have to be able to scientifically prove how much they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with traditional farming methods .
Issues debated at the meeting included the potential for new sustainable production intensification ( SPI ) technology that would reduce tilling of land , which releases CO2 trapped in the soil into the atmosphere .
According to news agency IRIN , systems under discussion include Conservation Agriculture , a method where seeds are drilled directly into the ground .
" This is a win - win - win opportunity , " said Theodor Friedrich , an expert in SPI .
" We have a chance to slow climate change , help poor farmers make a better living and improve soil health and productivity all at the same time . "
He pointed out that developing non-tillage methods of farming would directly benefit small - hold farmers in Africa as soil that is rich in carbon is also more adaptable to the higher temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that are the expected outcomes of global climactic change .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. workers drawing jobless benefits hit a 25 - year high this month and imports suffered a record fall in September , according to reports on Thursday that underscored a rapid drop - off in the U.S. economy .
The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose by an unexpectedly steep 32,000 last week to 516,000 , the highest since the weeks following the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , the Labor Department said .
The number of workers still on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid hit 3.9 million in the week to November 1 , the highest since January 1983 .
“ This is obviously very , very serious deterioration in the labor market , more than a lot of people had expected even a couple of months ago , ” said Scott Brown , chief economist with Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg , Fla .
“ We are looking at the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression and the biggest economic crisis we have had in the United States since the early 1980s . ”
The U.S. economy has been suffering from a housing market crash , a lack of credit and an auto industry that is struggling to survive .
One source of growth through the first half of the year has been exports , but that appeared to be stalling .
U.S. exports fell at the fastest pace in seven years as the credit crunch slowed economies around the world .
Worried U.S. consumers also cut back on retail purchases for the second consecutive month in October , according to Spending Pulse data , which excludes auto sales .
Consumer spending fell 1.5 percent last month , after a 2.4 percent drop in September that was the largest since SpendingPulse started the data series in 2003 .
At a time when retailers are normally beginning to gear up for the holiday season , the trade data also showed imports of consumer goods fell nearly 7.9 percent in September .
However , a drop in interest rates spurred increased interest in home loans last week as mortgage applications recovered from almost an 8 - year low .
“ EVERYBODY IS HURTING ”
U.S. stocks finished higher in volatile trade on Thursday after three straight days of losses .
Investors snapped up beaten - down shares in energy , financial and others sectors , giving stock prices a boost despite the worries about a deepening economic downturn .

The dollar weakened against the euro , but rose against the yen .
U.S. government debt prices fell .
A report from the Commerce Department showed a record drop in the price of imported oil and the lowest auto imports since February 2004 , factors that helped trim the monthly trade gap to $ 56.5 billion , slightly below the $ 57 billion expected on Wall Street .
U.S. imports from China hit a record $ 33.1 billion in September , but imports from the European Union fell 3.8 percent and imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slumped 27.1 percent as the cost of imported oil fell by a record $ 12.41 per barrel in September .
“ The drop in oil price is a factor , no doubt about it .
People are just not driving that much ( any ) more , ” said Joel Naroff , president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland , Pennsylvania .
“ We are seeing a decline in everything -- imports and exports ...
It tells me everybody is hurting . ”
U.S. goods exports fell by a record $ 10.4 billion , with all major categories showing a decline .
A sharp drop in exports of capital goods was led by civilian aircraft , after posting big numbers in the two prior months .
“ We should still have another strong year for exports , but the short - term trend is not as strong as we ’d like , ” U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said .
“ If anything , what that says is we should help our exporters to offset that . ”
Congress could do its part by approving three pending free trade agreements with Colombia , Panama and South Korea , while the White House keeps pushing for an agreement in the long - running Doha round of world trade talks , he said .

One of the most public manifestations of race is the choice of one 's partner or spouse .
This very individual and personal aspect can sometimes produce a lot of public discussion .
Studies consistently show that Asian Americans have some of the highest " intermarriage " ( also known as " outmarriage " ) rates among racial / ethnic minorities -- marrying someone else outside of their own ethnic group .
But as always , there 's more to the story than just the headline .
The Public and Private Sides of Ethnicity Whether it 's dating or marrying someone of a different race , interracial relationships are not a new phenomenon among Asian Americans .
When the first Filipino and Chinese workers came to the U.S. in the 1700 and 1800s , they were almost exclusively men .
A few of them eventually married women in the U.S. who were not Asian .
However , many people soon saw Asian intermarriage with Whites as a threat to American society .
Therefore , anti-miscegenation laws were passed that prohibited Asians from marrying Whites .

FR = Foreign - Raised ( 1st generation )
" USR + USR or FR " = Spouse 1 is U.S. - Raised while Spouse 2 can be U.S. - Raised or Foreign - Raised
" USR + USR Only " = Both spouses are U.S. - Raised
Methodology used to tabulate these statistics " USR + USR or FR " = Spouse 1 is U.S. - Raised while Spouse 2 can be U.S. - Raised or Foreign - Raised " USR + USR Only " = Both spouses are U.S. - Raised History shows that these anti-miscegenation laws were very common in the U.S.
They were first passed in the 1600s to prevent freed Black slaves from marrying Whites and the biracial children of White slave owners and African slaves from inheriting property .
It was not until 1967 , during the height of the Civil Rights Movement , that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Loving v. Virginia case that such laws were unconstitutional .
At that time , 38 states in the U.S. had formal laws on their books that prohibited non-Whites from marrying Whites .
As suc , one could argue that it 's only been in recent years that interracial marriages have become common in American society .
Of course , anti-miscegenation laws were part of a larger anti-Asian movement that eventually led to the Page Law of 1875 that effectively almost eliminated Chinese women from immigrating ot the U.S. , the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 , and other restrictive regulations .
These laws actually made the situation worse because Asian men were no longer able to bring their wives over to the U.S.
So in a way , those who wanted to become married had no other choice but to socialize with non-Asians .
After World War II however , the gender dynamics of this interracial process flip - flopped .
U.S. servicemen who fought and were stationed overseas in Asian countries began coming home with Asian " war brides . "
Data show that from 1945 into the 1970s , thousands of young women from China , Japan , South Korea , the Philippines , and later Viet Nam came to the U.S. as war brides each year .
Further , after the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act , many of these Asian war brides eventually helped to expand the Asian American community by sponsoring their family and other relatives to immigrate to the U.S.
These days , Asian Americans in interracial relationships are very common .
One of the best research articles on this topic is a study conducted by Shinagawa and Pang entitled " Asian American Panethnicity and Intermarriage , " reprinted in the highly recommended Asian Americans : Experiences and Perspectives .
Similar in structure to their study , my colleague J.J. Huang and I have analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau to construct the following table on marriage patterns among Asian Americans .
How to Read and Understand the Table Using data from the 2010 Census ( updated Nov. 2011 ) , the table shows the percentage of the six largest Asian ethnic groups who are married either endogamously ( within their ethnic group ) , to another Asian ( outside their ethnic group ) , or to someone who is White , Black , Hispanic / Latino , or someone who is Mixed - Race / Multiracial , by husbands and wives .
The other major component of the table is that it presents different numbers depending on which statistical model is used .
That is , the specific numbers for each ethnic group vary depending on how you measure " intermarriage . "
The different models are : All Spouses :
This model include all marriages that involve at least one Asian American .
The benefit of this approach is that you get a complete picture of all marriages involving Asian Americans .
The drawback is that since most married Asian Americans are immigrants , many of them got married in their home countries before immigrating to the U.S. -- i.e. , they came to the U.S. already married .

USR + USR or FR : USR stands for " U.S. - Raised , " or those who are either born in the U.S. ( the 2nd generation or higher ) or came to the U.S. at age 13 or younger ( the ' 1.5 generation ' ) , while FR stands for " Foreign - Raised , " the 1st generation ( those who came to the U.S. at age 14 or older ) .
In this model , the ' subject ' spouse ( either the man or the woman ) is USR , but his / her spouse can be either USR or FR .
This model narrows down the sample somewhat by trying to exclude those who were already married when they arrived in the U.S .
: USR stands for " U.S. - Raised , " or those who are either born in the U.S. ( the 2nd generation or higher ) or came to the U.S. at age 13 or younger ( the ' 1.5 generation ' ) , while FR stands for " Foreign - Raised , " the 1st generation ( those who came to the U.S. at age 14 or older ) .

This model narrows down the sample somewhat by trying to exclude those who were already married when they arrived in the U.S. USR + USR
Only :
This model includes only marriages in which both spouses are U.S. - raised .
This has the advantage of including only those who were raised and socialized within American society and its racial dynamics .
It is this U.S. - raised population that best represents young Asian Americans , since they are the ones who have the most exposure to prevailing American cultural images and media .
The drawback of this model is that by focusing exclusively on the U.S. - raised ( who only represent about one quarter of all marriages involving Asian Americans ) , it may overemphasize and " over - highlight " instances of outmarriage among Asian Americans .
I present these three models to give you , the reader , the opportunity to decide for yourself which model best represents the " true " picture of marriage among Asian Americans .
You should understand that each model has its strengths and weaknesses and as you can see , each produces some very different numbers .
If you would like to read about the exact procedure J.J. Huang and I used to calculate these numbers , visit the Statistical Methodology page .
These are certainly a lot of numbers to consider and as I mentioned above , each model presents a different proportion .
Nonetheless , what these stats tell us is that generally speaking , across all three models ( calculated by using the admittedly unscientific method of averaging the proportions across all three models to emphasize the last two models ) , these are the Asian ethnic groups are most or least likely to have each kind of spouse : Men / Husbands -- Most / Least Likely to Have a ( n ) __ Wife :
Endogamous -- Most : Asian Indian / Least : Japanese
Asian Indian / Japanese Other Asian ( Pan - Asian ) -- Most : Japanese / Least : Asian Indian
Japanese / Asian Indian White -- Most : Japanese / Least : Vietnamese
Japanese / Vietnamese Black -- Most : Filipinos / Least : Chinese
Filipinos / Chinese Hispanic / Latino -- Most : Filipinos / Least : Chinese
Filipinos / Chinese Multiracial or Other -- Most : Japanese / Least : Koreans Women / Wives -- Most / Least Likely to Have a ( n ) __ Husband :
Endogamous -- Most : Asian Indian / Least : Filipinos / Koreans ( tied )
Asian Indian / Filipinos / Koreans ( tied ) Other Asian ( Pan- Asian ) -- Most : Japanese / Least : Asian Indians
Japanese / Asian Indians White -- Most : Korean / Least : Asian Indian
Korean / Asian Indian Black -- Most : Filipinos / Least : Vietnamese
Filipinos / Vietnamese Hispanic / Latino -- Most : Filipinos / Least : Asian Indian
Filipinos / Asian Indian Multiracial or Other -- Most : Filipinos / Least : Vietnamese
Recent Trends and Developments
The numbers presented above only represent a ' cross sectional ' look at racial / ethnic marriage patterns involving Asian Americans .
In other words , they only represent a ' snapshot ' look using the latest data from 2010 .
Nonetheless , it is important to recognize that such marriage patterns have evolved and changed over time .
In order to get a closer look at recent trends , we can compare these numbers to data from the 2006 Census .
In comparing the 2010 data to the 2006 numbers , there are a few notable trends we can observe : Consistently , rates of marriages involving Asian Americans and Whites have declined .
Specifically , among those marriages in which both spouses are U.S. - raised , for five of the six Asian American ethnic groups , the rates of interracial marriage to a White spouse for both men and women have declined from 2006 to 2010 .
Among men / husbands , the largest decline involved Asian Indians and Koreans .
For women / wives , the largest decline was for Filipinos and Koreans .

For women / wives , the largest decline was for Filipinos and Koreans .
The only exceptions to this trend of declining rates of White - Asian marriages were for Asian Indian women / wives ( whose rate slightly increased from 2006 to 2010 ) and for both Vietnamese men/ husbands and women / wives .
For Vietnamese men , their rates of marriage to a White wife increased from 15.0 % to 21.9 % while for Vietnamese women , their rate for having a White husband jumped from 28.3 % to 41.3 % .
Strangely , the sample population sizes for U.S. - raised married Vietnamese American men and women have declined from 2006 to 2010 .
For example , in 2006 , there were about 40,500 and 45,200 U.S. - raised Vietnamese men and women respectively who were married .
In 2010 , those numbers declined to 26,795 and 34,998 .
Some possible explanations are that many who were married in 2006 got divorced , U.S. - raised Vietnamese men and women are delaying getting married , and / or many U.S. - raised Vietnamese have changed their ethnic identity to some other ethnic group , such as Chinese or Hmong .
In contrast to the declining rates of Asian - White marriages , the rates for Pan - Asian / Other Asian marriages have increased notably from 2006 to 2010 ( having a spouse of a different Asian ethnicity ) .
This increase was almost universal across all six ethnic groups and for both genders ( the only exception was for Filipino women ) .
Among U.S. - raised men/ husbands , Vietnamese Americans experienced the biggest increases in having a pan-Asian spouse -- from 5.8 % in 2006 to 13.7 % in 2010 for men and from 7.8 % to12.2 % for women / wives .
Now that we have a general picture of what the marriage rates are for all members of each of these six Asian American ethnic groups , on the next page we will take a more specific look at only those Asian Americans who grew up in the U.S. and are therefore most likely to have been socialized within the context of U.S. racial landscape and intergroup relations -- the U.S. - born and those who immigrated to the U.S. as children .

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. overpromised and underdelivered on its last big product launch .
It is determined to reverse that pattern this week , with a new chip dubbed Shanghai .
The new member of AMD 's Opteron product line , which serve as calculating engines in server systems , is a successor to a chip called Barcelona that was late to market when announced in September 2007 and had early technical problems .
AMD 's missteps with the Opteron family -- which commands higher prices and profit margins than chips for personal computers -- contributed to big losses for the company this year and helped rival Intel Corp .
So AMD executives said little about Shanghai until customers had tested it .
The verdict , so far , seems to be thumbs up .
" We knew the performance results would be good , but they exceeded our expectations , " said Paul Gottsegen , a vice president of marketing in Hewlett - Packard Co. 's server business .
Sally Stevens , director of platform marketing at Dell Inc. , estimated that Shanghai delivered about 37 % better computing performance per watt of energy consumed -- an important issue for customers worried about power bills .
Dell , H-P , Sun Microsystems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. say they plan to offer systems using Shanghai .
It seems even Amazon 's not holding out hope that Christmas will make up for dwindling consumer spending .
In its third quarter earnings yesterday , the online retailer predicted fourth quarter revenue would only be $ 6 - 7 billion , lower than Wall Street 's $ 7 billion forecast and operating income would only reach $ 145-305 million .
FT : Tom Szkutak , chief financial officer , said the forecast reflected “ appropriately conservative assumptions ” and followed slower sales at the end of the quarter in September as consumers reacted to the turmoil on world financial markets .
The slowdown included a fall - off in the number of online purchases worth more than $ 1,000 .
This is down from Amazon 's previous Q4 estimate of $ 7.2 billion .
Predictably , the market responded calmly , sending Amazon 's shares down 14 percent in after - hours trading .
Meanwhile , even the National Retail Federation is forecasting a smaller increase in holiday sales .
The National Retail Federation is predicting Christmas sales growth of 2.2 per cent , the lowest level since 2002 .
So much for those hopes that Christmas will save the economy .
Indeed , the BBC notes that across the board , retail 's indicating it wo n't be immune to the economic downturn .
BBC : The firm 's warning of weaker trading conditions in the key festive period follows after similar announcements by Apple and eBay .
Taken together it is a growing sign that the crisis in the financial sector is spreading to a wider economic downturn .
" Amazon is definitely signalling much worse returns in the fourth quarter , " said analyst Jeffrey Lindsay of Sanford Bernstein .
" This is further confirmation that the economic downturn is much more pervasive than was earlier thought .
" Online retailers were thought to be immune to it , but this is an indication that that is far from true . "
We guess it 's up to Halloween and Hollywood to save the economy now .
So stock up on candy , in and out of the theater .
Mobile phone users warned of new skin disorder caused by nickel on casing
At risk : Women who wear nickel jewellery , such as watches , are most likely to develop the skin condition
As if there were n't enough health scares over mobile phones already , heavy users were yesterday given another reason to cut down on their habit .
It can bring you out in a rash .
Doctors claim ' mobile phone dermatitis ' is a risk for those who develop an allergic reaction to the phone 's nickel surface .
The British Association of Dermatologists is warning other doctors about the newly - identified allergy as it suspects many cases are going unreported or untreated .
Cases reported in journals so far include an 18 - year - old U.S. man , a 19 - year - old woman in Austria and a 14 - year - old girl in Scotland .
The alert comes after scientists last month urged caution over mobile phone use saying it could take years for the health risks to emerge , although there is a consensus that children are likely to be more vulnerable .
Nickel allergy is the most common contact allergy in the UK and is thought to affect 30 per cent of the population , and rising .
Women have a higher risk of developing mobile phone dermatitis , as they are more likely to have been previously sensitised to the metal following an allergic reaction to nickel - coated jewellery .
Some patients have developed patches of eczematous dermatitis where their handsets has come in contact with their faces
Dr Graham Lowe , from the British Association of Dermatologists , said : ' If you have had a reaction to a nickel - coated belt - buckle or jewellery , for example , you are at greater risk of reacting to metal phones .
' In mobile phone dermatitis , the rash would typically occur on the cheek or ear , depending on where the metal part of the phone comes into contact with the skin .
' In theory it could even occur on the fingers if you spend a lot of time texting on metal menu buttons .
' It is worth doctors bearing this condition in mind if they see a patient with a rash on the cheek or ear that cannot otherwise be explained . '
A spokesman for the GSM Association , the trade body representing mobile phone operators worldwide , said : ' The nickel content in mobile phones is regulated by an EU directive .
' Using a case or hands - free kit will minimise contact with surfaces that contain nickel . '
In a study published earlier this year , doctors in the US tested for nickel in 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers , and found it present in ten of them .
Dr Lionel Bercovitch , one of the study ’s authors from Brown University , Rhode Island , said ' Nearly half of the phones we spot tested contained some free nickel .
' The menu buttons , decorative logos on the headsets and the metallic frames around the liquid crystal display ( LCD ) screens were the most common sites .
Those with the more fashionable designs often have metallic accents and are more likely to contain free nickel in their casings .
' Given the widespread use of cell phones , the presence of metal in the exterior casing of these phones and the high prevalence of nickel sensitization in the population , it is not surprising that cell phones can cause allergic contact dermatitis . '
The British Association of Dermatologists advises anyone who develops a rash on their face which might be caused by prolonged mobile phone use to seek advice from their doctor .
( CNN ) --
Some mothers choose what their children will eat .
Others choose which children will eat and which will die .
A Haitian boy begs for food .
One child dies from hunger every six seconds , an aid agency says .
Those mothers forced to make the grim life - or - death choices are the impoverished women Patricia Wolff , executive director of Meds & Food for Kids , encounters during her frequent trips to Haiti .
Wolff says Haitians are so desperate for food that many mothers wait to name their newborns because so many infants die of malnourishment .
Other Haitian mothers keep their children alive by parceling out food to them , but some make an excruciating choice when their food rationing fails , she says .
" It 's horrible .
They have to choose among their children , " says Wolff , whose nonprofit group was formed to fight childhood malnutrition .
" They try to keep them alive by feeding them , but sometimes they make the decision that this one has to go . "
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. declared in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech that " I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies . "
Four decades later , King 's wish remains unfulfilled .
The global food market 's shelves are getting bare , hunger activists say -- and it will get worse .
Food riots erupted across the globe this year in countries such as Egypt and India .
Food pantries in the United States also warned that they were running out of food because of unprecedented demand .
The news from the World Food Programme is even grimmer : A child dies of hunger every six seconds , and hunger now kills more people every year than AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis combined .
As World Hunger Relief
Week is marked , more people are asking :
Why are so many people starving and what , if anything , can be done to eradicate hunger ?
The end of food ?
Wolff thinks hunger can be conquered .
Her group produces " Medika Mamba , " energy dense , peanut butter food that 's designed to ensure Haitian children survive childhood .
Medika Mamba is easy to make , store , preserve and distribute , she says .
" It just takes the will to do it , " she says of eliminating hunger .
" Look at what we did for Wall Street .
We did n't have enough money for infrastructure , schools , but all of a sudden , we had all of this money for Wall Street . "
Raj Patel , author of " Stuffed and Starved : The Hidden Battle for the World Food System , " says the right to food should be seen as a human right .
But , he says , powerful corporate food distributors control too much of the world 's food supply to ensure a robust global food supply .
Patel says " 2008 was a record year in terms of harvest .
There 's more food per person in 2008 than there 's ever been in history .
The problem is not food , but how we distribute it . "
Other causes for the rise in global hunger have been documented .
They include :
• Surging oil costs have made it more expensive to harvest , fertilize , store and deliver food .
• The rise in droughts and hurricanes worldwide has wiped out crops and made farming more difficult .
• The world is running out of the raw materials -- water , oil , good farmland -- needed to keep the food system intact .
" A lot of people have begun to understand at various levels that the food system , as it is , ca n't go on , " says Paul Roberts , author of " The End of Food . "
Every time an American bites down on a steak or hamburger , they 're contributing to global hunger , Roberts says .
As other countries become more affluent , they 're copying our meat - heavy diet .
The problem :
It takes so much grain and other resources to produce meat , he says .
" If the rest of the world were to eat like we do , the planet would collapse , " Roberts says .
" There 's been this unspoken assumption that the rest of the world wo n't eat meat like we do .
That does n't go over well in countries like China . "
Fixing our food system would be similar to weaning ourselves of our addiction to oil , Roberts says .
It 's going to require innovation , heavy business involvement and changes in public policy .
People are going to have to find ways to grow food with less fertilizer and water , and use less energy to store and transport food , he says .
Much of this innovation will have to be driven not just by activist and aid workers , but by savvy business people , he says .
" It 's going to have to be profitable or the market wo n't be interested in it , " Roberts says .
" And if the market is n't interested in it , it 's not going to happen . "
In the meantime , Wolff offers some of her own solutions .
She says the practice of big foreign aid agencies shipping in food to poor countries like Haiti needs to be modified .
Food has become too expensive to produce , ship and store , she says .
" You can't count on big aid agencies showing up to save everybody , " she says .
" Not everybody can do it , and when they do it , it 's not soon enough and not long enough . "
She suggests that more groups teach local farmers in poor places how to produce their own crops .
In Haiti , for example , her group employs 22 Haitians who make Medika Mamba and teaches other farmers how to grow crops for the mixture .
" Instead of throwing fish in the crowd , we should be teaching people how to fish , " she says .
Until that day takes place , Wolff , who is a pediatrician in St. Louis , Missouri , will continue to make her trips to Haiti , where mothers are forced to make their grim choices .
" It 's the most difficult thing I 've ever done , " she says .
" You realize how absolutely blessed you are by the fate of your soul coming down the chute in the United States of America , " she says .
" You wonder : Why did this happen to me and not to them ? ' ''
All About Hunger • Foreign Aid • Haiti
You might not have realized it , but the next great battle of cryptography began this month .
It 's not a political battle over export laws or key escrow or NSA eavesdropping , but an academic battle over who gets to be the creator of the next hash standard .
Hash functions are the most commonly used cryptographic primitive , and the most poorly understood .
You can think of them as fingerprint functions :
They take an arbitrary long data stream and return a fixed length , and effectively unique , string .
The security comes from the fact that while it 's easy to generate the fingerprint from a file , it 's infeasible to go the other way and generate a file given a fingerprint .
Originally created to make digital signatures more efficient , hashes are now used to secure the very fundamentals of our information infrastructure : in password logins , secure web connections , encryption key management , virus and malware scanning , and almost every cryptographic protocol in current use .
Without cryptographic hash functions , the internet would simply not work .
At the same time , there is n't a good theory of hash functions .
Unlike encryption algorithms , there are no secret keys involved ; this makes it harder to mathematically define exactly what hash functions are .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology , NIST , is holding a competition to replace the SHA family of hash functions .
" SHA " stands for " Secure Hash Algorithm . "
It was developed by the NSA in 1993 to replace the commercial MD4 and MD5 algorithms , and has been updated several times since then .
All the SHA algorithms are very similar , and have been increasingly under attack , so NIST wants to replace them .
The competition is important because , unlike other technological standards , committee design � balancing the interests of diverse constituents � is n't conducive to good security .
Security is best when it 's designed by expert teams and then subjected to public review .
And cryptography is best when it 's chosen by competition .
In 1997 , NIST held a competition for a block cipher to replace DES .
Fifteen candidates and three - and - a - half years later , Rijndael became the new Advanced Encryption Standard � AES .
NIST is doing the same thing for what it 's calling SHA - 3 ( not , for some unexplained reason , the Advanced Hash Standard or AHS ) .
The deadline was October 31 , and NIST received 64 submissions .
This is n't surprising �
I predicted 80 � as most of the 15 AES submitters were professors , whose students at the time have become professors themselves , with their own students .
( If NIST does a stream cipher competition in another ten years , they should expect about 256 submissions . )
These submissions came from academia , from industry , and from hobbyists .
CIO magazine recently interviewed one of the submitters , who is 15 .
Twenty - eight submissions have been made public by the submitters , and six of those have been broken .
NIST is going through all the submissions right now , making sure they are complete and proper .
Their goal is to publish all accepted submissions by the end of November , in advance of the First Hash Function Candidate Conference , to be held in Belgium right after the Fast Software Encryption workshop in February .
The group expects to quickly make a first cut of algorithms � hopefully to about a dozen � and give the community a year of cryptanalysis before making a second cut in 2010 .
After another year of cryptanalysis , NIST will choose a winner in 2011 .
Expect a final standard by 2012 .
My advice for software developers is to let the process run its course .
While it 's tempting to use the new cool algorithms in your designs , it 's far too soon to trust any of them .
This process is likely to result in all sorts of new research results in hash function security , and some real cryptanalytic surprises .
Give the community a few years to figure out which ones are good and which are n't .
I 've previously called this sort of thing a cryptographic demolition derby :
The last one left standing wins .
But that 's only partially true .
Certainly all the groups will spend the next few years trying to cryptanalyze each other , but in the end there will be a bunch of unbroken algorithms .
NIST will select one based on performance and features .
NIST has stated that the goal of this process is not to choose the best standard but to choose a good standard .
I think that 's smart ; in this process , the best is the enemy of the good .
While there 's no rush to choose a new standard � the SHA - 2 algorithms will remain secure for the foreseeable future � we do n't want to analyze the candidates forever .
Personally , I was part of a group of eight cryptographers that submitted Skein to the competition .
A decade ago , writing Twofish and participating in the AES process was the most fun I had ever had in cryptography .
These next few years promise to be even more fun .

Lieutenant Hastings said the police had no reason to think Ms. Pressly had been singled out before the evening her assailant entered her rented cottage - style home in the affluent Pulaski Heights neighborhood .

“ He was not stalking her , ” he said in an interview .
“ We do n’t know for sure , but we think the motive is going to be robbery .
I think he saw an opportunity and took advantage of it . ”
The police declined to say whether Ms. Pressly had been raped .
For weeks police agencies across Arkansas and beyond had supplied detectives here with names and DNA samples of possible suspects , hoping that the material would match evidence taken from Ms. Pressly ’s home .
None of the forensic specimens were a match until Wednesday .
“ This time it came back positive , ” Lieutenant Hastings said , explaining only that scientists at the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory here tied forensic material from Marianna , including DNA , to evidence collected from Ms. Pressly ’s home .
Police officials disclosed on Friday that detectives from Little Rock had interviewed Mr. Vance on Tuesday at police headquarters in Marianna , about 100 miles east of here , after learning he had been questioned by officers there in a rape near his home on April 21 .
A warrant has been issued for Mr. Vance ’s arrest in the rape case , said Detective Sgt. Carl D. McCree of the Marianna police .
PS - Why did they ( do n't know who ) put conio.h in C in the first place if it was such a problem ?
" They " did n't .
It 's for a third party library , one that was meant to work with DOS .
Not a windows console , mind you , but DOS .
Code that uses it is really meant for DOS .
It does n't really belong in Windows , and the " let 's abandon this " period was begun about 1995 .
The " problem " is people still using this after , oh , about 1999 .
Generally these folks are nudged away from using something like this that is quite out of date .
Many insist on using it anyway .
I do n't know to what aim -- it 's not going to become any more widely used , and almost certainly less so .
If having your say in who will be the 44th President of the United States is n't incentive enough to get out and vote , then how about free Starbucks coffee , Krispy Kreme doughnuts , or Ben and Jerry 's ice cream ?
These companies and many more across the nation are offering freebies just for being patriotic .
Free stuff
Not in the Joe Biden " be a patriot " way .
But , at Starbucks , just for saying you voted .
For Krispy Kreme -- all you have to do is wear an " I voted " sticker .
It 's even simpler at Ben and Jerry's .
The two step process is : 1 ) Show up .
2 ) Have a pulse .
It makes you want to break out and sing Glen Campbell 's " Rhinestone Cowboy " - does n't it ?
Felony ?
Well , not so fast .
Seems there are legal restrictions afoot .
Take the State of Georgia where the motto is " Wisdom , Justice and Moderation . "
Requiring someone to say they voted in order to receive a free coffee - that 's a felony .
Here 's the Georgia state law :
“ Any person who gives or receives , or offers to give or receive , or participates in the giving or receiving of money or gifts for the purpose of registering as a voter , voting , or voting for a particular candidate in any primary or election shall be guilty of a felony . ”
Get out of jail free card
No word if an individual would get the electric chair upon conviction .
But thankfully Starbucks and Krispy Kreme have modified the promotion so you are n't required to break the law in order to get free stuff .
" To ensure we are in compliance with election law , we are extending our offer to all customers who request a tall brewed coffee , " said Starbucks ' spokeswoman Tara Darrow .
Skittles are not kosher .
They are not kosher because they use unkosher gelatin .
But the company that created Skittles are now discussing if they want to make a kosher line of Skittles .

Many more questions about the terror attacks
November 28 , 2008 11:50 IST
Last Updated : November 28 , 2008 14:45 IST
A fter we first posted a list of unanswered questions about the terrorist attacks in Mumbai [ Images ] 10 days ago , hundreds of readers mailed us with their own questions that need to be investigated by the security agencies .
We are posting the most relevant questions here .
After he was arrested , early reports -- based on briefings by the Mumbai police -- said the captured thug was fluent in English .
The investigating agencies now say he hails from an impoverished background and only studied up to Class IV .
So where did his fluency in English comes from ?
Is he pretending to be something he is not ?
Why was the captured terrorist and his murderous mate sent out on this mission of mayhem ?
Unlike the others , who operated within the confines of buildings like the Taj , the Oberoi - Trident [ Images ] and Nariman House , these two men functioned in the open .
Did they disregard orders to stay in the CST and take hostages ?
Did they abandon those plans because CST was sparsely populated at that late hour ?
The terrorists were said to be familiar with Google Earth , navigational equipment and satellite phones .
Would school dropouts have that kind of technical savvy ?
How many terrorists were there was the first question we posted on Friday morning .
The official version after the attacks ended was : 10 terrorists , of which 9 were killed and one arrested .
The break - up being : 2 at CST ; 2 at Nariman House ; 2 at the Oberoi - Trident hotels ; 4 at the Taj .
But this arithmetic does not explain how just two terrorists took charge of both the Oberoi and Trident hotels , which is a much larger area than the Taj .
In Tuesday 's Times of India [ Images ] newspaper , a survivor says there were between 5 and 6 terrorists at the Oberoi - Trident .
The two thugs who mowed down many guests in cold blood ( this survivor and a couple of others were shot , but survived ) and three or four others who came in later to shoot photographs of the bodies .
Where did the other men vanish ?
Were they captured by the commandos so that the intelligence agencies could interrogate them without any scrutiny ?
Or , more worrying , did they walk out as guests when the siege ended ?
The day after the attacks began , Maharashtra [ Images ]
Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh [ Images ] told a press conference there may have been between 20 to 25 terrorists , a number that was subsequently revised .
The terrorists are said to have set up control rooms at the Taj and Trident hotels , a Cabinet minister told PTI on Thursday .
When were these bookings made ?
A detailed investigation into the bookings made at both hotels in the months , weeks and days before the attacks may reveal the names of suspicious guests who registered there .
Military sources tell rediff.com that there was no way the terrorists could have carried so much ammunition with them when they assaulted the two hotels with their guns blazing .
They believe the ammunition may have been stored earlier in rooms at both the hotels , perhaps on the higher floors .
If some of the terrorists had registered at the hotels earlier , could these men / women have left along with the guests who were released ?
Did the police record the identities and addresses of the guests who were released from both hotels ?
Indian Hotels Chairman Ratan Tata [ Images ] indicated on Thursday that the terrorists had intimate knowledge of the Taj , its service corridors , its layout .
Does this mean that they had a mole inside the Taj ?
Or more worrying , did a couple of them work there at some point of time ?
Did they have drawings of the layout of the two hotels ?
If the terrorists were Pakistani , how did they have such an intimate knowledge of the terrain ?
The two or three cowards who attacked the CST on Wednesday night made their way from the CST through a road on the left side of The Times of India building towards the Cama and Albess hospital / Azad Maidan police station , a route that is known only to true - blood Mumbaikars .
Were they locals ?
Or did they conduct extensive reconnisance of the likely routes of escape ?
These same two or three men , who are said to have commandeered ATS Chief Hemant Karkare 's [ Images ] police Qualis [ Images ] after shooting him , Additional Commissioner of Police Ashok Kamte and Inspector Vijay Salaskar , revealed similar familarity with the road outside the Esplanade Court , making an easy U - turn towards the Metro cinema junction rather than head on the road towards the CST .
How did they know this if they were Pakistanis ?
How did those men , whose images have appeared all over the world , get to the CST from Colaba where they are said to have landed by boat ?
Did they take a taxi ?
Or did they have local transportation ?
Did they come by a suburban train , which could explain the firing on one of the suburban train platforms ?
Who left the grenade on the Gitanjali Express , which killed a Bengali mother ?
The terrorists are said to have done extensive reconnisance of the city .
If they are Pakistanis , how did they get earlier entry to the city unnoticed ?
Did they come in by boat ?
Or did they use other routes to escape notice ?
Such an operation could not have been conducted without extensive training and preparation , possibly on models of the Taj and Trident or Chabad House / Nariman House .
Could this have been achieved at the rudimentary training camps hosted by the Lashkar - e - Tayiba [ Images ] in Pakistan occupied Kashmir [ Images ] ?
Or was it a more systematised operation conducted by a State agency in a hostile country ?
How did they know Chabad House / Nariman House , which even long - time residents of Colaba -- the area in South Mumbai where the Taj , the Leopold Cafe [ Images ] and Chabad / Nariman House are located -- are unfamiliar with ?
The choice of this target indicates precision thinking -- it is doubtful if the Lashkar strategists are capable of such deep strategy -- and again points the needle of suspicion at a government intelligence agency in a nation inimical to India or renegades within such a bureau .
Early on Thursday morning , the television channels spoke about an exchange of fire between the terrorists and the police near the Liberty cinema ( which is close to the Metro cinema / Cama hospital [ Images ] , but situated on an inner road ) .
There was even fear expressed that these terrorists would enter the Bombay hospital , but nothing was heard about them thereafter .
Where did they go ?
Were these two / three terrorists the same men who took over the police Qualis and shot at people near the Metro junction ?
Or have they escaped ?
The police say the two men , who took over the Qualis , grabbed the Skoda [ Images ] that was halted at a police road block near the Girgaum Chowpatty [ Images ] beach .
One of them was later killed by the police .
Where did the other man go ?
Is he the Ismail , the Lashkar terrorist who is appparently singing like a canary to the police ?
Or is he someone else ?
If these are the two of the three terrorists who attacked the CST , what happened to the third man seen in photographs and video captures ?
Where did he vanish ?
Another terrorist is said to be in custody .
Where was he captured ?
What has he told the police ?
The Times of India reported on Friday morning that wellknown food critic Sabina Sehgal - Saikia 's cellular phone recorded activity in the Raigad area , which is located across the sea from the Taj , where she was staying on the night of the attacks ?
Nothing has been heard from Saikia for over a day , so how did her phone reach Raigad ?
Could one of the terrorists have escaped under the guise of a guest to the Raigad area ?
To this Mohit says : Sabina 's husband has clarified that Airtel reps have told him that since the towers around Taj were shut down , it is possible that the phone might have picked up the signal from Raigad tower .
Could some of the terrorists have come by boat from the Alibag - Murud Janjira area in Maharashtra 's Raigad district , rather than from Pakistan ?
Boats ply through the day from the Alibaug area to the Gateway of India [ Images ] , and it would be easy for terrorists to use this mode of transport rather than high - speed boats which would have attracted the Coast Guard 's attention .
According to a Maharashtra Times report , the two terrorists who killed the three police officers on Wednesday night spoke Marathi !
This disclosure casts fresh doubt on the origin of the terrorists .
Or did each terrorist from an enemy nation have an Indian accomplice accompanying him ?
If the attacks were restricted to South Mumbai for logistical reasons , who was responsible for the explosion on the taxi near the Santa Cruz airport in northwest Mumbai , which is located at least 25 km from Colaba ?
Uttara wants to know :
If the terrorists are interested in something , how come they have not made any demands in spite of having taken so many hostages ?
If they kept the hostages for so long , they should have started negotiations also .
This indicates that they have some other , larger ultimate objective .
What is that , and has it been investigated ?
The Deccan Mujahideen [ Images ] may or may not be a valid front .
Has the Andhra Pradesh police and security forces started investigating that ?
What are the results of that ?
Has there been any additional discussion on the terrorists who might have escaped into Bombay city , apart from these three locations ?
If the dead terrorists had blueprints of the major areas in the city , it means that they might launch an attack on these locations after the Taj , Oberoi and Colaba encounters are over .
Have the police been investigating this , and has there been any safety precautions ?
The names of these places should be circulated , and civilians asked to refrain from going to those locations , so that casualties can be at a minimum .
When will this be done ?
Ravi wants to know :
Why did the terrorists not blow up the full building itself ?
What can be the reason for this ?
I do not believe that they do not have the ammunition for that or planning .
I believe if they wanted they could have done it .
Winnie wants to know :
What is the Navy doing around the Colaba area ?
Why is it not monitoring or keeping a check on what goes on in the seas just below its nose ?
Why does n't Mumbai have enough fire ladders or other equipment which can put out fires like the ones set at the Taj ?
Even in a terrorist attack why are most of our constabulary seen with antique rifles and without bulletproof attire ?
Why are civilians seen in and around the affected areas in spite of a curfew call ?
Why do the best hotels in Mumbai have such pathetic security ?
Govind wants to know :
Are the CCTV records of the hotels available ?
Assuming such large quantities of weapons had been pre-stored in the hotels , is there any security system to search these bags while being taken to the hotel ?
Are there any missing hotel staff after the attack ?
Rajendra wants to know :
How come the terrorists were able to fight for more then 40 hours ?
This is very clear that all these people got the arms and weapons ready on site in advance .
Is n't this a question on the qualification and intelligence of our police and all other security agencies ?
Sujoy wants to know : Manmohan Singh [ Images ] has claimed that this terror attack has been executed by external forces .
What proof has the government got in order to make such a claim ?
Every time a situation like this happens , the government of India makes such claims and then they give no proof to anyone , especially the common people who are always kept in dark .
Vinu wants to know :
When the commandos of the navy and the army are there why were ATS officers involved in the operation , who are ill equipped and lost their life ?
The man who ordered this should be held responsible for the death of bright officers and must be procecuted .
Lokesh wants to know :
Why the BCCI does not organise India - Pakistan cricket matches on neutral grounds ?
How many Pakistanis return after the match ?
How many sneak through on a tourist visa ?
Why cant we have a centralised SSN ( Social Security Number ) system in India ?
Amit wants to know :
Whether there are terrorists holed up in other parts of Mumbai and surroundings , as they were inside those targeted hotels ?
What action is necessary for those hiding terrorists in other parts , right now unknown to us ?
How did they procure AK - 56 rifles ?
What action is necessary which need to be taken for controling smuggling of these weapons inside Indian territory ?
Are we planning to carry out operations inside Pakistan where the terrorists ' headquarters are firmly believed to be located , if Pakistan cannot capture those responsible and as we have every right for pre-emptive action ?
Whether we will take help of the Pakistan government and other countries in conducting such secret operations inside Pakistan to capture terrorists , as the United States is doing presently inside Pakistan if their weak system cannot achieve this ?
Sarnath wants to know :
How did the room service guys not find the bombs if it had been preserved somewhere within the Taj ?
Some room service guys are involved ?
Someone inside the Taj is definitely involved .
King c wants to know :
One report said that a taxi laden with explosives was on its way to have a fidayeen attack on the Mumbai International Airport .
But something went wrong and the taxi exploded at Vile Parle under the flyover itself .
The question is -- who was driving the taxi ?
How did they get hold of the taxi ?
Was there support from locals ?
How can the terrorists fight for over 40 hours without any sleep ?
( In response , Pradeep says : Yes , there are certain drugs like Dexedrine who can keep one awake for 72 to 96 hours but at the end one has to compensate for the wakefulness .
They shoot up the blood pressure , hence are banned from the market .
I think 48 to 72 hours was what the terrorists were bargaining for ) .
The television visuals clearly showed Hemant Karkare wearing a helmet and a bullet - proof vest .
How did he get hit in the chest ?
How could the three top cops travel together in an operation ?
Should n't they have been given back - up and cover ?
It is said that there was a massive recruitment drives at the hotels a few months ago .
It is suspected that a few of the terrorists 's aides might have infiltrated into the organisation of the hotel .
Is this being investigated ?
Kunal wants to know : I just heard from a guy who escaped from the Taj on Aaj Tak .
He said that he saw a lot of security personnel , but none of them questioned him when he escaped from the rear of the Taj .
This means that the terrorists as well could don a normal citizen 's clothes and escape without any questions asked .
I want to know what about Mumbai or rather Indian citizens 's security if even one among them gets lost in Mumbai 's crowds ?
J D Kamble / Sachin wants to know :
Why were the helicopters not brought in at the earlier stage ?
Why are the helicopters not provided with water tanks ?
Why was tear gas not used to disable the terrorists ?
Why was morphine gas not used ?( in response , Pradeep points out ' one reader wants to know why morphine gas was not released to make the terrorists unconscious .
There is nothing like morphine gas .
It is only seen in the movies . ) '
Rohan wants to know :
All the security forces are searching for a ship .
Is it possible that a submarine dropped off the terrorists ?
Mohit wants to know :
The terrorists used satellite phones to communicate .
How come their satellite phones worked and could not be traced or jammed ?
How can the government allow the television channels to broadcast live what is happening at the three locations ?
These might have watched by some of the terrorists 's agents around the country and helped communicate with the terrorists in the hotel who had satellite phones .
Nilesh wants to know :
With a major naval headquarters in Mumbai , how come the marine commandos came into action only the subsequent morning ?
Why is there no permanent base of NSG commandos in Mumbai ?
And why did they take 10 hours to get to Mumbai ?
Anirudh wants to know :
Why did the terrorists choose that late hour to begin their assault ?
Did they plan to attack CST and the hotels after peak hours , or were their plans held up in some way ?
Or did they choose that time to avoid even the small risk of being challenged by a policeman ?
How can people carry huge rifles slung across their shoulders in the midst of a milling crowd ?
They are not like handguns which can be concealed under clothing and taken out when they need to be used .
How come there was no panic just upon sighting people with rifles marching into a railway station or hotel lobby ?
Did the Taj Mahal hotel [ Images ] officials have any sort of permission or authority from the Mumbai police before relaxing their security measures just days before the attack ?
If so , on what grounds was the permission granted ?
As a corollary , were the terrorists waiting for the measures to be relaxed before striking ?
Prashant wants to know : I was once stopped by the Taj hotel [ Images ] staff for being in slippers ( chappals ) .
If you can be so alert to look down at chappals ( for w/e reasons ) , how come the same security system blunders when the ammunitions were being stored in the room well in advance ?
What could have been the motive of the taxi blast ?
Venkatesh wants to know :
The arms and ammunition being used by the terrorists --- are they purchased inside India ?
Or sent from outside ?
If the ammunition is purchased in India , why can't the government regulate buying and selling such explosives and all chemicals used in the manufacturing of the explosives ?
What was the hotel security doing when the terrorists barged into the hotel ?
Were the security personnel unarmed or just not equipped enough to face the attack ?
If this is the case , then is the security system in our country foolproof ?
Do we have enough protocols to face different kinds of threats ?
The terrorists posses Indian rupees -- used to pay for rent , and make purchases .
How are they able to get Indian currency ?
Does the RBI keep track of all the Indian rupee notes going outside India ?
Mehul 's analysis and unanswered questions :
The primary target seems to have been to capture the Taj and Oberoi hotels and take a bunch of hostages .
The events at VT , Leopold's , Metro etc were diversions to create panic and ensure the police were spread thin and could not respond quickly to calls from the 2 hotels .
If the motive was to inflict maximum damage , the terrorists seem to have done very poorly with the resources they had in terms of time , ammunition and equipment .
They had more than 600 people locked in the 2 hotels for more than 10 hours before the NSG got there ... An AK - 47 can fire 600 rounds per minute .
From about 10:30 pm on 26th November to about 8 am on 27th November there was a complete standoff at both the hotels .
There were a few guests who managed to get out at about 3 am from the Taj but there was no full scale assault by the Indian forces till the NSG got there at 8 am .
What took place during that period of 10 hours is the key to understanding the motive of the terrorists .
If the terrorists just wanted to kill everyone , they had ample opportunity to do so .
They were obviously holding out for some kind of deal .
Did the NSG spend those 10 hours negotiating a deal ?
Did they even make contact ?
I find it hard to believe that the NSG stormed the place and rescued almost every person taken hostage .
The other worrying thing is .. what prevented the terrorists ( or some of them ) from getting rid of their guns and just walking out of the hotel , pretending to be one of the hotel guests ?
Hundreds of people got out of the Taj at 3 - 4 am .
Were all of them questioned ?
The presence of American intelligence officials at the Taj that night adds another twist .
There were also a group of EU officials present at the Taj for an Indo - EU summit .
The terrorists had also captured group of Israelis at Nariman house .
What happened to these groups ?
Who exactly were they ?
Were they the targets ?
The circumstances in which three top Mumbai policemen charged with investigating the underworld were shot is puzzling as well .
Only a trained sharpshooter with inside information could have managed to do this .
The fact that the sniper then got away in the police van adds further credence to the fact that he had help from the inside .
Sridhar wants to know :
Is it clear at this point that most of the terrorists are Punjabi ?
Watching videos on India TV , I see them referring to incidents like Babri Masjid [ Images ] and Gujarat and also sporadic Hindi words like Neta , Shanti and parivar , but the accent is undeniably Punjabi .
One terrorist also used the word ' Rab ' interchangeably with Allah , and referred to ' Waqt ' as ' WAKAT ' .
What is more all their sound bytes were basic monologues , that they seem to have memorised .
And in the Big Picture , looking at their clean cut faces , lithe physiques and smart logistical moves and mastery over weapons , what are the chances that these are not terrorists , but trained Pakistani commandos themselves ?
Deepti wants to know :
Why did the security personnel not think of using helicopters to air - drop personnel on the roof tops of the hotels at the beginning ?
It would have made operation more effective and speedy .
They could have made a recce of the roof top in the early morning and could have planned air - dropping commandos on the roof top .
Why was that option not considered ?
Vipin wants to know :
We all know that the operation took time because the commandos were searching each and every room at the hotels and had no idea in which room the terrorists were hiding .
Is it technically not feasible to tell how many people are there across the room with the help of some penetrating laser light etc ?
Ahmed wants to know :
How could they have travelled 900 km to Indian territory in deeply guarded waters undetected ?
Viraj wants to know :
What was the RDX going to be used for ?
The police found 8 kgs of RDX behind Taj .
Was this forgotten by the terrorists ?
Or was this a drop point for them to pick up later ?
The explosions inside the hotels were mainly grenades and plastic explosives .
There are differing reports on how the top decorated officers got shot .
Were they in the same car as reported by the Mumbai Mirror ?
Or were they shot somewhere else ?
When a machine gun is sprayed normally the cops would have got hit by one bullet .
How did Hemant Karkare have 3 shots in his chest ?
There is still no explanation on why he would remove his bullet - proof vest when he had worn it on live television ?
Srikant wants to know :
Was any staff in the hotels on leave for the last few days ?
Any new employee joining the staff in recent days ?
This coordinated attack would not have been possible without the help of somebody from the hotel .
Why was there so much delay in getting the NSG unit from Pune ?
Why was not anything done in terms of jamming the frequencies of the satellite phones ?
Satellite phones use a different frequency than normal mobile phones so a frequency jammer could have been installed in the hotel vicinity ?
Why are we not getting the stats on the terrorists bodies ?
Have the calls made from the hotels in the last week to places outside India been analysed ?
Gautam wants to know :
Why did the terrorists choose a Wednesday night to attacks these popular Western tourist hotels ?
A weekend might have caused greater damage .
This leads me to believe that it might have been convenient for them to do it on the particular day .
Maybe the ship they supposedly caught sailed accordingly .
It is a possibility that there were groups that arrived by various means to Colaba .
How many were there in all ?
I read an eye - witness ( a lady staying in the fishermen colony nearby ) claiming that she saw 6 people getting out of a boat and walking towards the Taj / Trident .
There were definitely more that 6 .
Since the TV cameras caught a few of them , it should be straightforward to get the exact count along with the help of survivors .
The TV crew managed to get photos of the terrorists standing in the window with guns .
They appeared to look like nice targets for snipers .
How come there were no snipers taking shots at them ?
Were there any photographs of the terrorists taken by hostages on cell phone cameras ?
Satish wants to know :
From the TV footage , the commandos do n't seem to have the following equipment .
It would be great to know what the government 's position is on equipping the personnel with the following hi-tech equipment : a. Night - vision goggles .
These would have helped the commandos gain thermal imagery of the terrorists and their location in the night .
B. Headsets with wireless communication :
We normally see soldiers deployed in the Iraq / Afghanistan operations using these .
C. Bullet - proof vests / helmets .
The vests the officers were wearing appeared to be very flimsy and not effective .
What is the quality of these vests ?
Prakash wants to know : 40 hours without sleep or rest ??
You can't do it even when you are just sitting .
I can't imagine in that intense situation .
So were they using any medical stuff ??
If so , ca n't we know through post mortem what those medicines are and how and where the possibility of them coming from ??
Sunil wants to know :
Did the government appoint any one officer at the head of the operation to combat these attacks ?
It seems different group of security forces were working independently without any coordination and clear guidance ?
Sulekha wants to know :
The army claims it had sent a warning about a suspicious boat / ship , why was n't this followed up by the government ?
Why did n't the army check with the government again to make sure it was followed upon ?
Different passports have been found from the terrorists , what do they suggest ?
Two cars were reported to have sped away with terrorists .
Have the cars been found ?
Have the terrorists been captured ?
Have they been killed ?
Considering the well planned attack that they have conducted and their eye for detail , is n't it possible that the terrorists have eyes outside of the three locations they captured ?
What measures are being taken to find out who else could be part of the mission besides the terrorists who have been involved in activity in these three places ?
Ajay wants to know :
In one video , when the late Hemant Karkare was putting on his bullet - proof jacket , I noticed that one person was hiding his face from camera .
As the camera moved , this guy moved along with the camera by covering his face .
Who was that person ?
Rajeev wants to know : I have a simple query to those who have put up CCTV .
Is this footage meant to be seen after the event or monitored real - time ?
Kanna says : Suppose A checks into TAJ on 1st Nov , ( carries minimum stock ) .
On 3rd Nov at 4 pm B checks in along with his stock .
A moves his stock to B's room and checks out at 5 pm .
On 6th Nov C checks in at 7 pm .
B's stock along with A's is moved to C. B checks out at 8 pm ..... and so on till the D Day .
A study of the check in and outs should also be studied .
Siddharth notes :
It would be a good idea to review short sale positions on hotel scrips , specially Indian Hotels .
Who had taken large short sale positions on Indian Hotels before 26 / 11 ?
It could lead to some more clues .
Satish notes :
While it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that there is adequate security for each citizen , it is surprising to see the amount of ammunition and equipment present in these hotels .
Is it the responsibility of the hotel management to ensure adequate security , checks and balances and compliance with KYC norms ?
The management of these hotels is therefore equally answerable for the disaster of this magnitude .
The management of these hotels should also provide adequate insurance cover as 5 star hotels charge premium rates from guests .
If the management is unable to take care of its customers / premium guests , they have to be equally answerable instead of blaming only the government .
Hotel managements ' inability to provide the complete details of its occupants shows the careless attitude of the staff and the failure of the hotel administration as the traffic of terrorists to hotels must be going on for months to plant operations of this size and magnitude .
No effort should be spared to put in place a fully considered and partnered solution with joint investigations / thoughts of the management of these hotels and other establishments with the government .
Moby wants to know :
The army said the terrorists keep shifting their positions from one floor to another , and from one room to another .
Why was their transit area not checked and blocked initially ?
To go from one floor to another they would use a lift , stairs or laundry passage .
To go from one room to another they have to pass through corridors .
Why were all these not blocked and secured initially ?
Sirish wants to know :
If the terrorists are killed , why are the photographs not released ?
This would help intelligence agencies across the states and other countries to check their background .
Even if we agree that the terrorists landed a few days back and then planned this , did they carry all the ammunition , guns and goods from their hideouts to the hotel ?
Or was someone waiting for them at these points to hand it over to them ?
Bappa wants to know :
At every railway station in Mumbai policemen and women record every visitor 's name , address and phone number .
Is this really working ?
Amit wants to know why the NSG was not provided blueprints of the Taj , Trident and Nariman House .
It was easily available at the Bombay Municipal Corporation which could have helped them a lot .
Sitapati wants to know why all the rescued were not taken to a specific location , their identities ascertained before they were released ?
Who knows a terrorist could have escaped and is at large ?
Emeraldin wants to know :
Why do n't the police show the terrorists ' pictures to the public and ask whether they have seen any of these guys earlier ?
The authorities might be able to collect important information .
Hafiz wants to know :
In a telephone interview with CBC News journalist Arun Asthana said there are reports that some of the militants had stayed at a guest house there ( Nariman House ) for up to 15 days before the attacks .
" They had a huge mass of ammunition , arms and food there , " Asthana said .
How did they know about the Jewish centre when even most locals were unaware about it ?
A quote from an article in the DNA newspaper : " They had purchased around two crates of chicken and liquor worth Rs 25,000 from two shops in Colaba , " another resident Joseph D'Mello said .
" They then entered the Nariman House building and took the Israeli family captive . "
If they were fundamentalist Muslims , what were they doing buying large quantities of liquor ?
According to a BBC article by Soutik Biswas : ' Locals say the orgy of killings in Mumbai began here .
Three men walked into the cafe , drank beer , settled their bills and walked out .
Then they fished out guns from their bags and began firing . '
What were they doing drinking beer if they were fundamentalist Muslims ?
Quoting the same BBC article by Soutik Biswas : " They did not look Indian , they looked foreign .
One of them , I thought , had blonde hair .
The other had a punkish hairstyle .
They were neatly dressed , " says Mr Amir . "
What nationality were these " foreign looking " blonde haired guys who were part of the terrorist group ?
Querelle wants to know :
The timing of the attack on Thanksgiving [ Images ] in the USA made sure that a large American audience watched this unfold .
Is this a first shot in an opening gambit , much as the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was a precursor to attack on those Twin Idols in New York City ?
Krishna wants to know :
How many terrorists arrived ?
How can you assume that all have been accounted for ?
How come even before their mission was over , the arrested terrorist is telling all that we WANT TO HEAR ?
How come an important clue like a GPS instrument was left behind so that we could find it ?
How come the GPS ( a very helpful and expensive instrument ) was not carried along ? ?
How come it is easy to blow the JW Marriott in Pakistan ( which was inside a guarded compound ) , but cars with RDX were not used to blow away the Taj ?
Khalfan wants to know :
Is it me alone who noticed on the wrist of one of the ' terrorists ' ( the short fat pudgy one ) the yellow saffron band that is only worn by Hindus and Buddhists ?
Raj wants to know :
As per details by the army and other officials , the terrorists who were killed and arrested are as follows : Nariman House : 2 killed ; Oberoi / Trident Hotel : 2 killed ; Girgaum road , those who were in the Skoda after they left the police Qualis : 1 killed and 1 arrested ; Taj Hotel : 4 killed .
Which comes to a total of 9 killed and 1 arrested , which is the figure given by officials .
So the two blasts which took place in a taxi -- one in Vile Parle and one in Dockyard Road , which were said to be terror attacks .
If we consider one terrorist in each taxi , why are these 2 not in the count of those killed ?
Trisha [ Images ] wants to know :
If the Taj had central AC , why did n't anybody think of blowing in anesthetic gas to tranquilise all and then take charge of the whole building ?
The number of lives lost and damage could have been much less .
Caroline notes : Just wanted to know , how the security personnel storming the two hotels could shoot and use hand grenades in a bid to flush out the terrorists , knowing there could be hostages inside .
How could they know they were targeting only the terrorists and that the hostages were not likely to get shot at or injured in the process .
Considering there could be women and children too in there .
The news reporters have , personally I feel , been overtly responsible for the terrorists to get information on what was happening every step of the way and accordingly planned their next move .
There was no immediate or pressing need that the people of India be informed of minute by minute details of what was happening .
More important was saving the lives of hostages and catching the terrorists .
Also , the commando chief should not have spoken to news people during the crisis informing them how many men had been deployed etc .
Moreover , the crowd of onlookers should have been told to leave the spot immediately .
The area should have been cordoned off .
Abroad , such places are off - limits to all .
Even reporters .
Even while the shooting was on , bystanders were around .
Just to say that its going to be a long , long while before there are any changes in the mentality of us Indians .
Nishesh wants to know :
In rediff 's article " A commando's account " there is an observation about the numbers involved in the Taj operation .
Therein it is stated " we saw there were more than 8 terrorists . "
The DG , NSG talks about only 4 .
What is the truth ?
Aravind wants to know :
While cleaning the hotel rooms daily , did nobody notice this much foodstuff and lot of bags kept in the terrorists 's room ?
Nejal wants to know :
How much arms and ammunition did they have to fight up to 61 long hours ?
Renjith wants to know :
Are the commandos well equipped for this type of operation ?
Do they have proper equipment to gather intelligence before or during the battle ?
Do they have any night vision equipment ?
Marco commando leader was quoting they were hindered by the lack of light and lack of knowledge about the Taj .
Normally commandos prefers operations at night because they get the advantage over the enemy due to better visibility and coordination .
Do they have any type of communication jammers to prevent the terrorists from communicating with each other and coordinating the operation against the commandos ?
The terrorists were not using gas masks .
Why we did n't look for that option to save the hostages without any casualties ?
Do they have any audio or visual aids like sound recorders or remote controlled movable cameras to explore the hidden areas without risking their lives ?
Rakesh wants to know :
Were the terrorists not using hostages as human shields ?
In a TV interview an injured commando from his hospital bed said that they used a charge to blow off the door and then lobbed grenades inside the room .
He also said he was not sure how many terrorists were there and the terrorist was getting cover fire from his buddy so there were at least 2 in the room .
So how did the commando who lobbed grenades ascertain there were no hostages inside the room being used as human shields ?
Also , in a TV interview , the injured policeman accompanying Karkare , Salaskar and Kamte said they were asked to look out for a red car , and they saw the car but were ambushed by the terrorists 100 metres ahead of the car .
So did the terrorists have real - time information of the police vehicle ?
How come all the 3 top cops were traveling in the same vehicle and that too seated in the front ?
Why did Salaskar decide to drive the vehicle himself ?
If Hemant Karkare was shot in the chest the photo of his body being taken for cremation had blood clot marks under his right eye and top of the right cheek ?
Sameer wants to know :
The boats had landed in fishermen 's colony at around 9 at night .
How could the alien terrorists locate the landing site at night , considering a very long shoreline ?
Does that mean local sleeper cells helped them with a beacon or signal from the shore ?
The NSG copter deployed commandos on the Nariman House terrace on the 3rd day .
Why not on the Oberoi 's terrace on the second day ?
What are the security agencies doing about the local sleeper cells ?
Nilesh wants to know :
In the Nariman house operation , it was pretty clear that there were hostages and it was located within the vicinity of residential buildings , which is the reason given for why the operation took so long ..
Finally , we saw the commandos blow up the entire 3rd floor .
Blowing up the floor would have blown up the hostages too .
If it had to be done , why not much earlier ?
In the Taj operation , from reports , it is clear that the terrorists were moving from one floor to another to confuse the commandos .
Were they hauling the ammunition around with them all the time ?
It was probably stored at convenient locations much in advance , which is why it must be the work of someone working in the Taj or a group of people separated in different rooms checked in as visitors .
From the report of one of the witnesses , a large group of people were hiding in the lobby .
Somewhere around 3 am 2 foreigners made a dash for the entrance and were shot right there .
So the terrorists were manning the entrances from some point .
Were there no commandos or anyone else in there till that late ?
Everyone was waiting for the NSG to arrive ?
Till then nothing ?
Suraj wants to know :
How come one terrorist was caught alive ?
Why was he not killed ?
Did he purposefully surrender to the police to say something which can twist the real story or to confuse the investigation ?
Sujoy wants to know :
The main issue to ponder over is that who is the " mastermind " ?
Who is paying money to the terrorists ?
Who is arranging the ammunition ?
Who is killing civilians ( including Muslims ) in the name of jihad ?
Who is the " big boss " ?
Is there anyone who would gain if there were a war or many pseudo - wars between the two neighboring countries ?
Who will make the highest profit out of all the mayhem ?
Jitendra wants to know :
Our navy is busting pirates in Somalia .
Why can't they guard our domestic waterfront ?
It is a shame that we have so many warships and frigates stationed at Mumbai and still we could n't stop this attack .
There were more than 100 armed policemen at CST station and they could n't take down 2 - 3 terrorists ?
Especially , the RPF which is equipped with automatic weapons .
Can these police officials be dismissed for their inaction ?
Rohini asks :
If all the reconnaissance was done by a group of Pakistani nationals some time in the last 3 to 6 months , they must have been given visas to come to India , in which case there should be a record of the visas issued to those individuals .
Is there going to be some attempt to match the faces of at least some of the terrorists killed with the photographs on the visa applications ?
Should n't there be a thorough probe into the killing of Hemant Karkare and his colleagues , given that certain political forces in the country had every reason to target the ATS chief and were actually issuing death threats to him ?<./ LI >
The statements extracted so far from the lone captured terrorist are riddled with inconsistencies , for example , if they were planning to blow up the Taj , why did they have only 8 kg of RDX ?
The blast at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad [ Images ] involved no less than 600 kg of RDX and TNT explosives !
How can we trust anything that this particular source tells us about the actual events of the 26th night ?
Phiroz wants to know :
As per media reports the ' terrorists ' were staying at the Taj and used Mauritian ID cards for check - in .
My question is how did the Taj accept just an ID card for check - in formalities from an international guest ?
Hotels are supposed take a photocopy of an international guest 's passport at check - in Hemanshu wants to know :
The residents of Cama hospital have informed about one lady accompanying the terrorists in a burqa when they stormed the hospital .
Where is the lady now ?
Do the government or the security agencies know the lady 's whereabouts ?
Or is it that the government wants to downplay the role of the lady ?
Can the government digest the theory that there were only 10 terrorists involved in the siege of Mumbai ?
Since the government has no clue do they want to hide the facts ?
Deepak
What the level of training and preparedness of the Mumbai Police ?
In the first hour itself the police lost there senior officers and after that it virtually accepted defeat giving command to the army and later to the NSG .
No doubt , the policemen who died were brave , but that is a small consolation .
What we look for is physically and mentally fit and intelligent officers like the army who fight with enemy but are trained for their survival .
Ranjit wants to know :
The Alibag / Roha area in Raigad is a hotbed for smuggling activities and needs to be investigated as there is a likelihood that the operations may have been launched from there as its a short boat ride away from Ground Zero ?
Had this angle been looked into ?
Karthik notes :
It has been reported that a number of credit cards , that was a part of the terrorists 's baggage , have been found .
It is a simple matter to find out where the cards were issued from and the billing addresses to which the bills are sent .
Has this been done ?
If so what are the findings ?
Robert says : I am a resident of Colaba , staying just opposite the Nariman Building , and I am staying here for the past 30 years .
I have friends from the local fishermen colony too .
These local fishermen anchor their boats near the coast , which is close to our area .
The first night when the terrorist took over Nariman House , I with a group of friends at around 12:30 am , were surprised to find only 5 policemen manning the lane , which leads to Nariman House .
When we asked them " Where is the Force ? " they said they were the only people sent .
Later in the night we received information from local fishermen that a speed boat [ one similar to the one which landed at Cuffe Parade ] had approached during the night at about 02:00 am and when the fishermen questioned them , the speed boat took a u turn and disappeared in the dark .
We immediately passed on the info to these policemen .
To our surprise they said " What can we do ? "
We did not know what to do and then we got stuck for the next two days in our houses .
My question is that in such a scenario who do we approach to give any information for verifying ?
What if there were two speed boats .
It 's still possible that they are out there or maybe they have landed at some other location .
The threat is real .
One bunch of terrorist from one boat created havoc .
Can you imagine if there is a second group waiting somewhere ?
Shekhar says : Being an ex -army officer I would like to know the following :
The manner in which the militant attacked their targets and the tactics they had taken could not have been done by just Lashkar or Hizbul or any other militant organisation .
They must have been trained by some one from the Pak army or ISI which is clear from the manner the entire attack was carried out as it was in the case of the Kargil [ Images ] war .
Lashkar or Hizbul militants do not have the capability to hold the NSG for as long as the militants did .
Who trained them ?
Who provided the extensive maps of Mumbai roads
The roads of Colaba are so confusing even for people living in Mumbai .
Who guided them through those roads and to target Leopold ?
How did the militants know that foreign guests visit Leopold ?
Who provided them the logistical support for such a precise attack and from whom did they get the briefing about the targets ?
Why were policemen in and around Colaba not alerted and moved immediately to the site of the attack as then they would have engaged the militants on the roads with little cover for the latter and eliminated them instead of allowing them to reach the hotels and take up defensive positions ?
Sainath notes :
The whole plan of the terrorists as per news available was to complete their so - called mission and return home safely .
If that is so , why did they fire indiscriminately ?
Definitely , this firing would not fulfill their goal .
Without firing they could have kept the hostages in captive with so much ammunition they were possessing and do whatever they were intended to .
Was it a pre-drill for a major operation ?
Were they testing the capability of our armed forces ?
The terrorist in captivity :
Is he disclosing the total plan or diverting our attention ?
Jess wants to know if the terrorists were circumcised .
Rahul notes : Besides very good knowledge of the terrain -- which a foreigner is unlikely to have despite very good recce work -- there are other things which indicate that at least some of these were locals .
One terrorist reportedly spoke to one guest saying , " Your name sounds South Indian , are you a Brahmin " .
A Pakistani ( or for that matter any foreigner ) is unlikely to have knowledge of Indian names and the Hindu caste system .
Does this indicate that at least some of them were locals ?
Ethewald wants to know :
All five star hotels have CCTV cameras ; why were the terrorists not cornered and or flushed out by using the CCTV ?
Why was the hotels put into darkness ?
Should not instead the whole place be lit up so that the security forces be able to see the terrorists and civilians clearly ; the terrorists want darkness to carry on , light exposes them , Why was the armed forces not provided logistics like dropping the commandos by helicopters and using helicopters to douse the flames and light up the building from outside so as to disorientate the terrorists .
The terrorists are reported to have a return route planned , so why would they set up a control room as dismantling a control room would delay their escape and also leave behind clues ?
The terrorists are reported to have RDX with them , yet the only arms and ammunition used were grenades and AK - 47 rifles ; what was the purpose of the RDX and why was it left behind ?
The terrorists were fidayeen and so were prepared to die , then why did they leave behind such a large amount of ammunition and not blow themselves up with it and cause more damage ?
Umakant wants to know :
How come that the people who had made such meticulous planning could have erred in leaving so much evidence behind ?
I mean do n't they and their bosses know that all telephone conversations are likely to be tapped and their game could be exposed even before it began .
Unfortunately for India and even more unfortunately for all the victims of this dastardly act , these telephone conversations were tapped , but no action taken .
This muddies the situation even further .
Caroline wants to know :
As regards the only survivor of the Nariman House terror attack , the maid and the 2 - year - old Jewish boy , it is surprising how the two managed to evade the terrorists .
Has the maid been questioned ?
How long has the maid been working with the deceased Jewish rabbi's family ?
Reji wants to know :
Did they select this particular day because there was a day - night cricket match between India and England [ Images ] ?
Did they think this would help them land safely on the Mumbai coast as most people were glued to television ?
Ravi wants to know :
Has any of the government agencies set up a hotline / Web site to get leads ?
Mayur wants to share some thoughts : Quite a few of the questions were regarding how the terrorists knew that the Chabad Centre was located there .
They did a recce of the entire area .
I suspect they had local support .
During that recce , I am sure they would surely notice a rabbi ( by the way he dresses and his outfit ) .
Also , Google helps .
Type ' jew +colaba ' and if you sift through all the links about the terror attacks , you come to this link which would have been one of the first links to show up if they had typed the same BEFORE the terror attacks .
This does mention that there are many Jews around Colaba .
About how , after shooting down the three distinguished cops and the constables , they turned around from Cama hospital and went towards Metro , and the flyover onto Marine Drive [ Images ] without batting an eyelid -- I really think there is some local participation .
Sleeper cells abound .
The reason why they did not use RDX to blow up any location a la the Marriott in Islamabad -- they wanted to maximise damage by sustaining the assault for as long as possible .
And they were well - trained , no doubt about that .
All the hard work had been done by them .
The ultimate plan was to indeed bomb the Taj once it had been destroyed completely and the ' operation ' was over .
How they got the ammo inside the hotels -- no hotel staff will check your suitcases ( which , incidentally , are quite high in capacity ) during the time of check - in .
Hotels simply ' assume ' that the bag has come straight from the airport / railway station .
And they had US dollars .
' Atithi Devo Bhava ' became ' Atithi Devil Bhava '
How they got the ammo into the country -- a new Srivardhan ?
Querelle 's question -- the US is already on high alert and they have already gotten threats from Al Qaeda [ Images ] .
Chinmay provides some answers : King c wants to know :
The television visuals clearly showed Hemant Karkare wearing a helmet and a bullet - proof vest .
How did he get hit in the chest ?
Response :
It is said by different experts that the bullet - proof vests used by the Mumbai police and ATS is only able to stop bullets fired from small caliber weapons like hand .22 hand guns .
These kinds of vests are vulnerable to high caliber automatic assault rifles like the Kalashnikov .
Thus even with the bullet - proof vest , the late Mr Karkare was vulnerable to shots fired from a very close range .
Vipin wants to know :
We all know that the operation took time because the commandos were searching each and every room at the hotels and had no idea in which room the terrorists were hiding .
Is it technically not feasible to tell how many people are there across the room with the help of some penetrating laser light etc ?
Response :
There is no laser and infra red imaging device than can penetrate through solid walls or doors .
X - Rays and Ultrasonic waves can penetrate solid obstructions but they need to be reflected back to the sensors in order to get an image , which was not possible there ( unless you make a giant size X - ray sensor and place it outside to cover the entire building ) .
Viraj wants to know :
When a machine gun is sprayed normally the cops would have got hit by one bullet .
How did Hemant Karkare have 3 shots in his chest ?
There is still no explanation on why he would remove his bullet - proof vest when he had worn it on live television ?
Response : A machine gun fires extensive amount of rounds / minute ( as close as 600 rounds / minute )
So it 's very unlikely that even in burst ( Let alone the fully automatic mode ) mode only one bullet will hit the target .
The fact that the late Mr Karkare was shot from a close range , makes it possible that he took 3 shots in his chest .
Also the vest he was wearing was not designed to stop bullets fired from high caliber assault rifles .
Only high tech multi layered composite bullet - proof jackets , made of different composite layers of Polyethylene , Steel and Ceramic plates , can stop assault rifle hits to some extent .
Trisha wants to know :
If the Taj had central AC , why did n't anybody think of blowing in anesthetic gas to tranquilise all and then take charge of the whole building ?
The number of lives lost and damage could have been much less .
Response :
This kind of solution is only possible in movies .
In reality to fill the entire building with anesthetic gas that can actually tranquilize they would have needed probably 50 tanker trucks filled with gas , and this alone would have taken more time than the entire operation 's time span .
Also , since the buildings were not air tight , the gas could have escaped on the streets affecting un - masked people around .
Nilesh wants to know :
In the Nariman House operation , it was pretty clear that there were hostages and it was located within the vicinity of residential buildings , which is the reason given for why the operation took so long ..
Finally , we saw the commandos blow up the entire 3rd floor .
Blowing up the floor would have blown up the hostages too .
If it had to be done , why not much earlier ?
Response : Despite some of the media outlets claims the commandoes did not blow the entire 3rd floor apart .
They can't do that anyway .
What we have seen on the television is a controlled explosion intended to rip only the window grills apart to make a clear space for commandoes and / or snipers .
They also blown a hole into the wall to make a way into the floor .
Sony wants to know :
If Chinese - made grenades were found at the hotel , who gave the terrorists Chinese made grenades ?
Who assisted them to get these grenades and where did they get it ?
Which agency is involved in it ?
Directly getting Chinese made grenades will be difficult for a normal terrorist .
Jayesh wants to know :
What quantity of RDX was brought by these terrorists ?
Has of all of it been detained ?
AKG wants to know : I have three questions based on what I have read in The Hindu : Security .
One gentleman -- a senior CBDT member -- who survived the Taj attack says : " The other thing I noticed this time -- you see , I go there every other month .
The last time I went , last month , there was very tight security .
You could not get into the [ Taj ] Palace .
There is an entrance there which is closed .
At the entrance to the tower , they had two - level security .
First , when you enter the open parking , where the cars are parked , you had a very heavy metal frame , your baggage was searched , and then you went .
At the entrance of the foyer , there was another metal detector and you were personally searched and so on .
This time I noticed it had gone .
We could go straight to the Palace . "
How could this happen if 5 - star hotels were asked to beef up security days before the attack ?
Who gave the orders to reduce the security levels , and why ?
Source : http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/29/stories/2008112955911700.htm
The same gentleman ( and many others ) say that once they came out , their identities were not checked and verified .
They and their bags were not searched .
" I asked the fireman , ' Do you think I can ? '
He said , ' Do n't worry .
Take the bag , ' and asked me to come . "
" And immediately [ after I got down ] they said : ' Do n't stay here .
Take cover behind the parked fire engines and then keep going . '
Along the side of the Gateway of India , there is a ledge with a sitting place .
Everybody was asked to go and sit there � a large number of people . "
Why were the persons not screened at all ?
How many terrorists would have walked off ( with ammunition and arms ) posing as guests ?
Source : http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/29/stories/2008112955911700.htm
The Hindu reports that " Three Lashkar fidayeen captured .
Police sources said an injured terrorist captured during the fighting at the Taj Mahal hotel was tentatively identified as Ajmal Amir Kamal .
Highly - placed police sources said two other Pakistani nationals had also been held in the course of intense fighting on Thursday .
All three , the sources said , identified themselves as members of a Lashkar fidayeen squad . "
One of them was Ajmal .
What about the other two ?
Source : http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/28/stories/2008112862080100.htm
Anuradha wants to know :
There have been reports that a member of the kitchen staff called home as he was dying and reportedly said that he had been betrayed by someone he had helped get a job in the hotel 's kitchen .
If the terrorists had been interns , how come no member of the staff recognised them ?
Were the photographs of the other slain terrorists shown to the staff of the hotels to ensure that none of them had interned there ?
If the terrorists or their accomplices had stashed away ammunition in the hotel earlier , signs could be still detected if a search were made .
Has it been done ?
Even if Google Earth gave them pictures of the city , it could not have shown them the one ways and landmarks to make them move at the speed they seem to have done .
They are supposed to have taken taxis -- how ?
At gunpoint ?
Stolen them ?
As for layouts and structural details , I wonder if they were readily available .
I am going by my limited experience of smaller industrial establishments and new residential colonies .
Nobody has a layout map of even the essentials like the electrical and drainage / sewage lines .
Sarathy wants to know :
Why could n't the NSG fox the terrorists inside the Taj using the television channels ?
They could 've strategically shown something on television and done something else .
Like sending forces of 10 men to each floor on say the west side of the building through ropes / ladders and then showing the same images on television after 30 minutes or an hour .
This could have attracted the terrorists to the west side making them easy targets when they got there .
Are we short on imagination in an operation like this ?
Fahad says I am a Pakistani and want to ask :
If indeed the terrorists came from Karachi , traveling 500 nautical miles on a boat which cannot have traveled at more than 10 miles an hour , they would have spent 50 hours inside Indian waters .
They would have to go through the range of 21 radars installed for maritime security .
An ordinary fisherman is arrested as soon as he even strays into disputed waters .
How could the trawler used by these terrorists not have been detected by an enormous surveillance infrastructure despite spending 50 hours in Indian waters ?
Further , they would have to cross the oil fields located 70 or so nautical miles north of Bombay which are heavily secured and protected .
They would somehow have to navigate through not only an intricate surveillance system but also avoid a huge presence of the Indian naval east command .
Is this easily believable ?
Gangadhar wants to know : why the hotels did n't have fire suppression systems -- like water sprinkler systems which spray water once it detects fire ?
This could have also made ineffective the arms and ammunitions which the terrorist were using ?

India to Bottle and Sell Waste Water from Hydrogen Fuel Cells
November 1st , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Indian company Bharat Petroleum has announced plans to bottle purified waste water from the manufacture of hydrogen fuel cells , and sell it at it ’s fueling stations across the nation .
In a country plagued by poor water quality and shortages across many regions , the company is keen to exploit high demand for pure bottled water .
According to some estimates , as many as 1,600 Indians die every day as a result of water - borne diseases .
Bharat estimates that it will be able to produce 1 million metric tonnes of clean water for every 1000 MW of energy from hydrogen fuel cells .
The state - run outfit has voiced tentative plans to establish a 1000 MW plant within the next three to five years .
On the surface , the venture might seem to be a remarkable example of market synergy , that also represents an intelligent and sustainable use of ‘ waste ’ water .
However , as with most things , the picture is not as clear - cut as it seems .
The bottled water industry has been criticized for the use of petroleum in the manufacture of bottles .
Paradoxically , production also uses very high levels of water , with the Pacific Institute reporting that the bottling process uses two liters of water for every liter bottled .

We do not often cheer on Fox News ’s coverage of politics .
But we did the other day when the anchor Shepard Smith reported on an especially absurd turn in the “ Joe the Plumber ” saga .
John McCain ’s reference at the last presidential debate to Samuel J. Wurzelbacher , the Ohio plumber who worriedly asked Barack Obama about taxes , was a predictable campaign stunt .
It ought to have lasted for half a news cycle , especially after it became clear that Mr. Wurzelbacher ’s taxes would go down under Mr. Obama ’s plan .
But the Republican nominee simply will not let the plumber go .
On Thursday , he shouted : “ I ’m going to Washington , and I ’m going to bring Joe the Plumber with me ! ” Earlier , in Virginia , Mr. McCain ’s running mate , Sarah Palin , announced that one of her favorite rally signs  sometimes made by voters , but more often supplied by the campaigns  was “ I am Jo Momma . ”
Mr. Wurzelbacher has held press conferences .
He was interviewed on the “ CBS Evening News , ” where he compared Mr. Obama to Sammy Davis Jr. According to Politico.com , he has an agent and is exploring “ a possible record deal with a major label , personal appearances and corporate sponsorships . ”

It was a spring day in 1957 when a dashing fellow with dark , wavy hair looked up from Yosemite Valley at the soaring cliffs and vowed to do what no human had ever done .
Scaling the colossal , 3,000 - foot - tall granite cliff known as El Capitan was something most people regarded as beyond the capability of humans , but when Warren Harding had a mind to do something , he did it .
It took Harding , Wayne Merry and George Whitmore 47 days of climbing over 16 months to turn what had seemed like a fantasy into a reality .
The first ascent of El Capitan 50 years ago was one of the greatest climbing achievements in history .
That is why Merry , Whitmore and many of the legends of Yosemite climbing have gotten together this weekend to celebrate the anniversary of that day a half - century ago .
" I am extremely honored , and I feel almost a little embarrassed because I do n't think we deserve this much , " Merry said Saturday after a gathering of some 150 people , including Harding 's celebrated onetime rival , Royal Robbins .
" It is really rewarding to get this kind of reunion under your belt after 50 years . "
Six of the nine climbers involved in the first ascent told tales , narrated slide shows of their exploits and drank red wine in honor of the hard - driving , devilish Harding , who died in 2002 .
" For years climbers were treated like outcasts or oddballs , and now climbing is getting some recognition , " said Ken Yager , president and founder of the Yosemite Climbing Association and organizer of the anniversary event .
" I want these world - class athletes to be recognized for what they did . "
Harding , Merry and Whitmore topped out on El Capitan on Nov. 12 , 1958 , establishing the Nose route .
The 2,900 - foot rock face is now world famous , and the climbers who first scaled it are rock - climbing royalty .
" It really opened up the era of climbing El Capitan , " said Steve Schneider , 48 , of Oakland , who has climbed the Nose 27 times and set a speed record on it in 1991 that has been broken many times by his then - partner , Lafayette 's Hans Florine .
Florine , who also attended the anniversary , climbed the Nose with Yuji Hirayama last month in an astonishing 2 hours , 37 minutes and 5 seconds .
" It 's just the best route up the best rock in the world , " Schneider said Friday .
" These guys broke the barrier , and everything that has happened since then is because of them . "
It all started that day in 1957 when Harding learned that his former climbing partner Royal Robbins and two other men had aced him out of being the first to climb the towering Northwest Face of Half Dome .
" What we gonna do ? " was Harding 's reaction , according to an interview with him in 1999 .
" Well , nothing but El Cap would do ! "
Harding spent hours scanning the immense slab of granite through binoculars before selecting a route that followed the prow of the giant wall .
On July 4 , 1957 , Harding , Bill Feurer and Mark Powell started out on the epic quest .
Himalayan technique
Nobody had ever climbed such a towering cliff before , according to Yager , so they used a technique more consistent with climbing in the Himalayas .
They fixed a rope in a high place and stockpiled food , water and supplies there before fixing a line up higher and repeating the process .
The " siege style " tactics required the men to make numerous trips up and down the ropes and to hammer many bolts and pitons .
" It was a great technical achievement to figure out how to live and survive on these walls , " said Dick Duane , 69 , a rock climber and lawyer who represented climbers in a lawsuit that resulted in the traditional climbing camp , known as Camp 4 , being designated a historical landmark .
The climb dragged on through two summers because the Park Service banned climbing during peak tourist season in an attempt to cut down on the traffic jams caused by looky - loos .
Most climbing occurred only on weekends because the climbers had to go to work or school .
Among the equipment used on the first climb were custom - built pitons forged by Harding 's friends and fellow climbers Frank Tarver and Rich Calderwood out of the legs of old - fashioned stoves .
This is how the feature known as Stoveleg Crack got its name .
Dolt Tower , a rocky ledge traditionally used for the first night of camping , was named after Feurer , who was given the nickname " Dolt " after a series of minor mishaps , including getting his beard caught in a knot .
Harding 's climbing partners changed frequently as the months went on .
Merry , a seasonal ranger and naturalist , joined Harding after the first winter when members of the initial assault team quit for various reasons .
Letters in soup cans
" We were scared to death half the time , " said Merry , who stuffed love letters to his fiancee in soup cans and hurled them off the wall .
" There were days I did n't know what I was doing up there . "
Merry 's primitive form of air mail worked .
He and his wife , Cindy , will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary in the spring .
The climbers had ample reason to worry .
At one point a hemp rope snapped just after Harding had climbed it , prompting the climbers to switch to nylon for the rest of the trip .
A ledge near the top is now known as the Glowering Spot because it is where Harding 's partners found him glowering after being hit in the head by a piton .
During the final push , Harding drilled 28 bolts into the 100 - foot - tall overhanging summit headwall .
The 14 - hour burst of energy allowed the three men to reach the top and make history .
" It stunned the whole world and sent a shock wave through mountaineering , " Duane said Friday .
" The Europeans came into the valley after that achievement and the emphasis on mountaineering shifted .
For that brief shining moment , Americans were the best climbers in the world . "
By the time they had completed the climb , Harding 's team had pounded 675 pitons and 125 bolts into the granite .
" It was not at all clear to me who had conquered and who was conquered , " Harding later wrote of the climb .
" I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in much better condition than I was . "
Differences with Robbins
But Harding and his cohorts were widely criticized by many in the climbing world , most notably followers of Royal Robbins .
Robbins was famous for scrutinizing the big walls for natural climbing routes in an attempt to limit the use of bolts .
He believed climbers should haul out what they brought in .
Harding , on the other hand , was a rebel .
" Warren had a more high - profile approach to climbing than most of his peers , " said Yager , who met Harding at the age of 16 .
" He 'd drive up in his Corvette with two women attached to him .
He was a drinker and partyer . "
Although Harding said he liked and respected Robbins , he scoffed at those who would impose climbing rules and limit equipment , labeling them " Valley Christians . "
" Why institutionalize rock climbing ? " he was later quoted as saying .
" If there is a blank wall , and there 's no way to place gear , you bolt . "
The rivalry between the two raged for years , but Robbins ' philosophy seems to have won out .
Most climbers today try to free climb as much as they can - meaning they use their hands and feet to climb - and ropes are attached only as protection against a fall .
" The Harding - Robbins rivalry is mythical stuff that really has substance today , " said Tom Frost , a 72 - year - old Yosemite legend who , with Robbins and two other partners , pulled off the second ascent of the Nose in 1960 , in seven days .
" They were contemporaries in climbing and in climbing excellence , and the thing that matters a lot to climbers - which is style - they approached from different directions . "
At the reunion , Robbins , Merry and Whitmore - all in their 70s - traded tales and discussed old - style climbing with the many younger climbers in attendance , the former enmity all but forgotten .
" That 's all past history , " said Merry , who started the Yosemite mountaineering school and rescue team and lives in British Columbia .
" We 're all great friends now . "
The anniversary coincided with the last weekend of a museum exhibit at Yosemite Village celebrating 100 years of climbing in the park .
The climbing museum , for which Yager is trying to find a permanent home , has a display of the first ascent of El Capitan , including several stove leg pitons and the " Big Brute Piton , " which hit Harding on the head and caused that celebrated glower .
But for the celebrants at the anniversary , El Capitan was the biggest attraction .
" When I drove into the park a week ago , I looked up at the walls and I thought , ' What was I thinking ? ' " Merry said .
" It 's still pretty impressive after all these years . "

Lately I 've gained ... 3 pounds .
How you may ask ?
To be honest , I do n't know .
My caloric intake has been less than usual & my period passed .
I popped a pill though , maybe my tubes are backed up ..? tmi , i know .
But whatever .
Back to 102 .
Ain't that wonderful ?
Nope .
I feel like a fat worthless slob .
Even though I want to cry so badly , I 'm not .
My mind says " I know you wanna " .
My body says " ... what the fucking ever .
You can lose it , you 're not weak . "
I do n't get me .
But school has been hard for me .
I 'm not sure if it 's extreme stress or sleep deprivation , but I have 3 makeup assignments that I have to do & 1 that have to get started on , but my mind is so entirely focused on meal planning & exercise that I 'm just ... slacking .
I 'm officially fried .
Not high - I hate smoking .
But my brain is totally wasted .
I think I might actually collapse & fall asleep right here , right now .

bitterescape Metabolism ?
So , finally , after being the same weight for DAYS , I finally lost 2.5 lbs again today .
Right now I 'm VERY afraid my metabolism would shut down .
I lost 12.3 lbs over 9 days but stayed the same for 4 days until today ?!
What do you guys think of a " planned " binge meal once a week ?
My school serves fresh Chinese wok food that I 'm really into .
I calculated that it would be between 330 and 470 kcal per portion , depending on what I take .
That would make my total intake max .
800 kcal for that day .
Does it help taking " real " lunch once a week to keep metabolism going ?
What do you guys do to keep it up and working ?

evelynmay New Beginning Hello everyone .
I 've been here before but it 's been years .
Here 's whats up .
I 'm very unhappy with my weight , have NEVER been successful at loosing any , and I 'm 20 now and think it 's about time I crack down and meet my goals .
I am 5'6.5
CW : 147
HW 148
GW 133
I am at 143 to 144 almost all of the time , school has just been swamping me down and I have been stressed and lazy and eating bad and not having time to work out .
Not to mention all the drinking for my birthday earlier this month , and all the drinking in general ..
I 'm in college .
So the biggest problem here is that I 'm a vegetarian .
I should probably just see a nutritionist for real help in creating a diet plan , but do any of you have any advice on what and when to eat while being a vegetarian in order to loose weight ?
Help would be greatly , greatly appreciated .
I 'm going to come up with rewards for reaching my goals later tonight after I finish some more studying .
I have my eye on a few Victoria 's Secret bras ...
I love bras !
Anyway , good to see you all again ..
I guess :/
Hope everyone is healthy and achieving their goals !

But I do .
It 's all I do .
Starting Tuesday I am starting a new plan .
But I have to wait tell then .
The good news is something is making it EXTREMLY painful to swallow anything including salvia .
So I am just been eating apple sauce ( 1/2 cup is 50 cals ) and hot tea .
God it hurts though : (( I wish I could make things right , and this is only way I know how .
Because I can some how make me .... a better me .
Chris Wallace played the sickening Bill Ayers robo calls and insists he will continue the political strategies that he said he would never use .
Wallace even brought up a Bill O'Reilly clip of him saying his campaign would not be about Ayers , but about issues that are so important to this great country .
Now you 've hired the same guy who did the robo calls against you to — reportedly , to do the robo calls against Obama and the Republican Senator Susan Collins , the co-chair of your campaign in Maine , has asked you to stop the robo calls .
Will you do that ?
WALLACE : ... and you said the following , " I promise you , I have never and will never have anything to do with that kind of political tactic . "
WALLACE : But Senator , back — if I may , back in 2000 when you were the target of robo calls , you called these hate calls and you said ...
McCain only hates things when they are targeted at him .
These robo calls are vital to his campaign and are all he has left .
We know the kind of man he is when his back is against the wall and he turns to the Lee Atwater politics of personal destruction .
John McCain employs his usual tactic of filibustering Wallace whenever he brought up a tough question for him and said that he would not even listen to Rep.
Susan Collins , who asked McCain to stop using those horrible robo calls .
LA Times :
" These kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics , " said Collins ' spokesman , Kevin Kelley .
" Sen. Collins urges the McCain campaign to stop these calls immediately .
Even the odious Norm Coleman asks them to stop .
McCain , have you no decency ?
Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) , who called for pulling all of his negative advertising Oct. 10 ( though the NRSC was running anti- Franken ads ) , has called now for all " attack ads and phones calls " to be pulled across the country , including robo-calls paid for by the Republican National Committee .
" It 's time for all of these attacks to end , " Coleman said , per a release , during his Obama - sounding " Hope Express Tour . "
Full FNS Transcript :
NARRATOR : You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayres , whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol , the Pentagon , a judge 's home and killed Americans .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
WALLACE : Senator , back in 2000 ...
MCCAIN : That is absolutely true .
WALLACE : Can I ask the question ?
MCCAIN : No , no .
But before you do , that is absolutely true .
And I do n't care about Mr. Ayres , and old — and his wife , who was on the top 10 most wanted list .
I care about everybody knowing the relationship between the two of them .
That 's legitimate .
Senator Obama and Bill Ayres served on a board of the Woods Foundation and they gave $ 230,000 to ACORN .
What 's that all about ?
He said that he was just a guy in the neighborhood .
He was n't just a guy in the neighborhood .
We know — we need to know the full extent of that relationship .
That is an accurate robo call .
WALLACE : But Senator , back — if I may , back in 2000 when you were the target of robo calls , you called these hate calls and you said ...
MCCAIN : They worked .
WALLACE : ... and you said the following , " I promise you , I have never and will never have anything to do with that kind of political tactic . "
Now you 've hired the same guy who did the robo calls against you to — reportedly , to do the robo calls against Obama and the Republican Senator Susan Collins , the co-chair of your campaign in Maine , has asked you to stop the robo calls .
Will you do that ?
MCCAIN : Of course not .
These are legitimate and truthful , and they are far different than the phone calls that were made about my family and about certain aspects that — things that this is — this is dramatically different , and either you have n't — did n't see those things in 2000 ...
WALLACE : No , I saw them .
MCCAIN : ... or you do n't know the difference between that and what is a legitimate issue , and that is Senator Obama being truthful with the American people .
But let me tell you what else I think you should be talking about and the American people should be talking about .
In the debate the other night , I asked Senator Obama to repudiate a statement made by John Lewis , a man I admire and respect and have written about , that connected me and Sarah Palin ...
WALLACE : This is the congressman and civil rights leader .
MCCAIN : Civil rights leader , American hero — that connected me and Sarah Palin to segregationists , to the campaign of George Wallace , and even alluded to the bombing of a church where four children — four children — were killed .
And I asked him to repudiate that statement .
I have repudiated every statement made by any fringe person in the Republican Party .
And it has come up from time to time , and it probably will .
The fact that Senator Obama would not repudiate that statement , I think , is something the American people will make a judgment about .
That robo call is accurate — is totally accurate .
And there is no comparison between it and the things that were done and said in South Carolina .
WALLACE : I want to ask you about William Ayres .
Last may , Bill O'Reilly asked you about Ayres and also about Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
And here 's what you had to say .
Let 's watch .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : This campaign is not going to be about — in all due respect , about Reverend Wright or Mr. Ayres .
It 's going to be about vision .
It 's going to be about a plan of action , for the American people are hurting right now .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
WALLACE : But , Senator ...
MCCAIN : And that 's exactly — and that 's exactly what the campaign is about .
WALLACE : Senator , let me ask the question .
MCCAIN : Yeah , sure .
WALLACE : But , Senator , according to a New York Times poll this week — and let 's put it up on the screen — there you can see it — 62 percent of independents now think you 're spending more time attacking Obama than explaining what you would do as president .
Have n't you gone on the attack against Ayres because you 're behind ?
MCCAIN : Facts are stubborn things .
Senator Obama has spent more money on attack ads against me than any campaign in history .

The Other War on Terror
Copyrighting the President
Schoolboy , 15 , held as terror suspect after taking photos of railway station for GCSE project
A schoolboy was held as a terrorist suspect by police support officers - for taking photographs of a railway station on a geography field trip .
Fabian Sabbara , 15 , was dressed in his school uniform when he was stopped by three police community support officers for taking photos of a station on his mobile phone .
He explained he was taking pictures , as well as pedestrian counts and a traffic survey , as part of a GCSE project .
Fabian Sabbara , 15 , was questioned by police support officers when they spotted him taking pictures of Wimbledon station , below
But PCSO Barry Reeve told Fabian , from Cheam in South London , to sign forms under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act , which allows police to stop and search at random anyone they suspect of terrorism .
The pupil from Rutlish High School , Merton , was forced to comply or face arrest after he was stopped at nearby Wimbledon railway station .
After the incident , his mother Clare and father Felix contacted police to remove any record of the incident against their son's name - but were told it had to remain in place for six years .
Scotland Yard have since wiped the record from their database , but Mr Sabbara , 48 , an audio- visual installer , said the incident could have affected Fabian 's future employment chances .
He said the matter had also sparked fear at Fabian 's school , where trips had been banned over concerns that pupils could be stopped by police for taking pictures .
Mr Sabbara said : ' Fabian was just a 15 - year - old boy trying to do his school work .
He had done nothing wrong .
' The point is , if this incident had remained on file it could affect him in years to come when he applies for jobs such as the RAF .
' Also if there was a terrorist attack at Wimbledon station he would be a suspect .
It 's just ludicrous .
' There needs to be more common sense when applying this law . '
During the incident Fabian , among 55 pupils who had split into groups , had to sign a form titled ' Stop - and - Search Terrorism Act ' .
Metropolitan Police spokesman Beverley Kassem said officers did not search him and no further action was taken .
She said : ' Police have met with the boy , his family and representatives from the school to discuss the incident and reassure them of any concerns they may have .
' As a result of this meeting , schools and police will work closely on future school trips in the area .
' The record of the stop on the stop - and - search database has been removed . '
Merton Council cabinet member for children 's services Councillor Debbie Shears said : ' We understand this incident has been resolved directly between the police , the school and the pupil 's family .
' School trips are an integral part of a student 's life and we are working with both schools and police to see what sort of guidelines need to be developed and put in to place . '
The local chapter of “ Protest Warrior ” has announced a campaign against Students against Sweatshops GVSU ’s efforts to improve the working conditions for farm workers picking tomatoes for Taco Bell .
The West Michigan Chapter of Protest Warrior is planning an effort to target what they see as Students Against Sweatshops GVSU ’s “ freedom stealing ” campaign to remove Taco Bell from campus .
SAS - GVSU has been working on the campaign for the past three years in response to a call by the Coalition of Immakolee Workers ( CIW ) for students to work to remove Taco Bell from their campuses as a result of human rights violations among farmworkers picking tomatoes sold to Taco Bell .
Protest Warrior is calling for Grand Valley State University ( GVSU ) students to start a “ student revolution ” to save Taco Bell charging that a “ communist group ” is trying to “ tample [ sic ] upon the freedom of others . ”
While the call for “ Operation : Viva Taco Bell ” , as it has been dubbed by Protest Warrior , is full of the usual sloganeering and distortions that many activists have come to expect from the local “ protest warriors ” and Free Republic members ( including getting the name of the group wrong and an inability to understand the reasons for the boycott ) , the Protest Warrior site does feature a more detailed analysis of why the Taco Bell boycott is “ wrong ” that mainly repeats the same old argument that people are better off with a bad job than no job .
It is hard to believe that the local contingent of Protest Warriors and Free Republic members might be able to launch anything resembling an organizing campaign given the fact that it seems to be made up primarily of middle - age white males ( and a few students ) who have nothing better to do than sit on the internet posting messages full of superlatives detailing their “ protests ” .
Past “ operations ” by this group have included the extremely effective coordinated shouting of “ go back to iran ” and chanting “ 9 - 1 - 1 , do n’t forget the terrorists ” at antiwar protestors –both of which have no doubt made “ the left ” tremble .
Call for Operation : Viva Taco Bell :
Any members that attend GVSU please let me know who you are .
The communist group “ Students United Against Sweat Shops ” is trying to have TACO BELL removed from the GVSU campus .
They claim that farm workers were mistreated at a farm in Florida that grows tomattoes for Taco Bell , so they are targeting Taco Bell instead of the farm .
It is one thing to personally boycott a business , but this group has gone way beyond the boundries of common sense , and tample upon the freedom of others .
I emailed this group a couple weeks ago and expressed my outrage with thier agenda .
They think that it is perfectly alright for everyone else to give up thier personal freedom , for thier liberal cause .
Do you support the idea of surrendering your freedom and personal liberty to enjoy Taco Bell , in support of a far - left cause such as this ?
These anti-capitalist , freedom stealers must be stopped !
Who is interested in helping to start a student revolution at GVSU to save Taco Bell , and perserve individual liberty ?

High food and commodity prices are increasing the pressure on the Amazon
Brazil 's government has been named as the worst illegal logger of Amazon forests by one of its own departments .
The Environment Ministry has drawn up a list of the 100 worst offenders and says all of them will be charged .
Topping the list was the Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform ( Incra ) , a government department which distributes land to the poor .
The revelation came after an official report revealed that deforestation in the Amazon region was gathering pace .
The six largest deforested areas since 2005 all belonged to Incra , Environment Minister Carlos Minc said .
In total 550,000 acres of the world 's largest rainforest was destroyed on those six properties .
Greenpeace has accused Incra officials of illegally handing over rainforest to logging companies and creating fake settlements to skirt environmental regulations .
But Incra 's president , Rolf Hackbart , said all the areas cited by Mr Minc as being deforested by his department were areas legally settled between 1995 and 2002 .
' Terrible result '
Mr Minc told a news conference he would take legal action against all of the loggers .
" We 're going to blow all 100 of them out of the water and then some , " Reuters quoted him as saying .
Meanwhile , official data released by Mr Minc showed a renewed increase in the rate of deforestation .
About 760 sq km ( 300 sq miles ) of the Amazon was destroyed last month , compared with 230 sq km in August 2007 .
" It was a terrible result , " Mr Minc said .
He blamed expanding cattle and farm activity , as well as land theft through the falsification of property titles .
The environment minister said he would create an environmental police force with 3,000 armed officers to help combat deforestation .
My alternative is to encourage new lending by lowering capital
requirements at the margin .
Tell banks that loans issued after
September 1 , 2009 , require half the capital of similar loans issued
before September 1 .
Some banks are in such bad shape that even with
those lower capital standards they will not be able to make new loans .
Fine .
You do n’t want those banks to grow .
But other banks have room to
grow , and you want them to grow more than they would under the existing
regulations .
As with changing accounting rules , lowering capital requirements
ultimately exposes the government funds that insure banks to more risk .
That is the flaw in the idea .
However , there has to be some risk
exposure to tax payers for any policy that encourages bank lending .
Here is more .
One question I have is how to calculate the existing capital for the very worst , most insolvent , and most corrupt banks .
You do n’t want them making loans to their uncles , so to speak .
Would requiring 1/ 2 capital discriminate usefully against such banks or would it in fact select for their relative expansion ?
Or do we have this problem in any case ?
Via Brad DeLong , here is a summary of the Dodd plan .
It sounds like an improvement over the Paulson plan .
PRINCETON , NJ --
The final Gallup 2008 pre-election poll -- based on Oct. 31 - Nov. 2 Gallup Poll Daily tracking -- shows Barack Obama with a 53 % to 42 % advantage over John McCain among likely voters .
When undecided voters are allocated proportionately to the two candidates to better approximate the actual vote , the estimate becomes 55 % for Obama to 44 % for McCain .
The trend data clearly show Obama ending the campaign with an upward movement in support , with eight to 11 percentage point leads among likely voters in Gallup 's last four reports of data extending back to Oct. 28 .
Obama 's final leads among both registered voters and likely voters are the largest of the campaign .
Gallup 's final estimate is based on Gallup 's traditional likely voter model , and assumes an estimated turnout of 64 % of the voting age population , an increase over 2004 .
( Gallup estimates voter turnout from the results of key voter turnout questions , using a model that compares how respondents ' answers to these questions have related , historically , to actual turnout . )
This year 's higher turnout estimate is fueled by a surge in early voting -- 28 % of registered voters in the final poll indicated they had already voted -- and higher turnout among blacks than in any of the last four presidential elections .
Gallup has been calculating and reporting an expanded likely voter model alongside its traditional model over the past month .
In the end , the candidate selection estimates of the two models converged , and both show the same unallocated 53 % to 42 % margin for Obama .
The gap in voter support for Obama versus McCain is slightly wider ( 53 % to 40 % ) when the vote preferences of all registered voters are taken into account .
The likely voter model typically shows a reduction in the Democratic candidate 's advantage , as has been the case with Obama this year .
Nevertheless , Obama has been able to maintain a significant lead over McCain in recent days , ending in the 11 - point lead in the final poll .
It would take an improbable last minute shift in voter preferences or a huge Republican advantage in Election Day turnout for McCain to improve enough upon his predicted share of the vote in Gallup 's traditional likely voter model to overcome his deficit to Obama .
Democrats have been more energized than Republicans throughout the year .
In the final poll 73 % of Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents say they are enthusiastic about voting compared to 59 % of Republicans and Republican - leaning independents .
Additionally , the Obama campaign has appeared to do a slightly better job of reaching voters than the McCain campaign : thus far 39 % of registered voters say they have been contacted by the Obama campaign compared , with 33 % contacted by McCain 's camp .
Democratic Advantage in Party Identification Difficult to Overcome
Obama was able to match McCain in maintaining party loyalty toward his candidacy : 91 % of Democrats say they will vote for Obama , the same as the 91 % of Republicans voting for McCain .
But Obama 's 90 % - plus loyalty has a far greater payoff than McCain's , given the significant Democratic advantage in party identification -- evident not only in this final poll , but throughout the year .
In the final poll , 38 % of U.S. adults identified as Democrats , 34 % as independents and 26 % as Republicans .
Among likely voters , the figures are 39 % , 31 % and 29 % , respectively .
Thus , given the Republican deficit in party identification , McCain would have needed a big boost from independent voters in order to prevail .
The two presidential nominees -- both of whom owe their primary victories earlier this year to solid support from independents -- waged a fierce battle for the independent vote , but in the final poll independents preferred Obama to McCain by 48 % to 43 % .
An Obama victory would also owe a great debt to overwhelming support from racial and ethnic minorities .
McCain led among white voters , 51 % to 44 % , but Obama more than made up for that with an 83 % to 13 % advantage among non-whites , including a 97 % to 1 % advantage among blacks and a 73 % to 24 % lead among Hispanics .
According to Gallup 's final pre-election polls , the last time a presidential candidate won without winning the white vote was Bill Clinton in 1992 .
That year George Bush narrowly beat Clinton by two points among white voters , 41 % to 39 % , with 20 % supporting third party candidate Ross Perot .
Prior to that , Gerald Ford in 1976 received 52 % of the white vote to Jimmy Carter 's 46 % , but Carter won the election with 85 % of the non-white vote .
While only 4 % of voters remain undecided in Gallup 's unallocated likely voter model , the final poll estimates that a slightly larger 10 % of likely voters still have the potential to either change their mind or make up their mind .
Even if McCain converts the vast majority of swing voters , victory for him would be highly unlikely since 51 % of likely voters say they are certain to vote for Obama compared with 39 % who say they are sure they will vote for McCain .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 3,050 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 31 - Nov. 2 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,824 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,472 likely voters ( using Gallup 's traditional likely voter model which identifies likely voters on the basis of current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
The likely voter model assumes a turnout of 64 % of national adults .
The sample is weighted to reflect this assumption , so the weighted sample size of likely voters is 1,952 .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
The deaths of two Sumo wrestlers were linked to the virus A viral skin condition linked to contact sports such as rugby and wrestling has prompted warnings after two deaths in Japan .
" Herpes gladiatorum " - dubbed " scrumpox " in the UK - is passed through broken skin .
The researchers , writing in the Journal of General Virology , studied 39 infected sumo wrestlers .
They said the unusual strain found was easily spread and more severe than other virus types .
A UK expert said serious complications were normally " highly unlikely " .
As two of the wrestlers died as a result of their infections , cases like this do need to be investigated
Dr Kazuo Yanagi
National Institute of Infectious Diseases , Tokyo
The herpes infection is normally associated with the sexually - transmitted form , genital herpes , and cold sores , but in rare cases it can affect other parts of the body .
Herpes gladiatorum is spread through broken skin , and has been often linked before with sports such as wrestling , which involve close body contact .
It is generally diagnosed after the appearance of a rash of blisters , and while it can be treated with antiviral drugs , it can lie dormant in nearby nerve endings , and may re-emerge on a regular basis to cause similar symptoms in patients who contract it .
The Tokyo University researchers looked at samples taken from 39 sumo wrestlers diagnosed with herpes between 1989 and 1994 .
Ideal conditions
Sumo wrestlers live and train communally in " stables " called " heya " , providing the perfect environment for the virus to spread .
Two of the infected wrestlers died as a result of the severity of their illness , although it is not clear whether any other aspect of their health might have contributed to this .
While one particular strain , BgOl , is historically associated with herpes gladiatorum , the researchers found another , BgKl , was more prevalent in their samples .
Dr Kazuo Yanagi , who led the research , said : " Herpes virus can hide in our nerve cells for long periods of time and symptoms can reappear later .
" Our research showed that the BgKl strain of herpes is reactivated , spreads more efficiently and causes more severe symptoms than BgOl , and other strains .
" As two of the wrestlers died as a result of their infections , cases like this do need to be investigated . "
He said he hoped that research would lead to better medicines to stop the disease from spreading .
Scrum down " Scrumpox " is a generic term for skin infections of varying types spread through close contact during rugby matches , and is the most reported form of herpes gladiatorum in the UK .
Professor Will Irving , a clinical virologist at Nottingham University , said it was rare , and that in otherwise healthy people , life - threatening complications were " very unlikely " .
He said : " The effect is like having cold sores , except that the lesions will come up on your back , or somewhere else on your skin , instead of your mouth .
" To the vast majority of people , it would be a nuisance , but nothing more serious . "

Shortly after he heard explosions outside of his home in the Colaba district in Mumbai , 27 - year - old Vinu Ranganathan grabbed his camera and ran outside to take some shots .
For hours , his graphic photosof the destruction wrought by the terrorists in the Colaba district on the photo - sharing site Flickr seemed to be the only relevant ones available online .
With the orange hues and human police chains blocking crowds from entering streets , the photos gave a sense early on of the pandemonium during the early hours of the terrorist attacks .
Ranganathan , a 2005 Berkeley mechanical engineering graduate , literally became a mini-celebrity overnight as blogs ( including Danger Room , ) television networks and newspapers around the world picked up his photos to show their audiences what was going on in Mumbai .
Ranganathan answered a few questions via e-mail late Wednesday night about why he ran out into the streets when most people probably would have locked their doors and stayed at home .
Wired.com :
Do you live near the scenes where you shot the photos ?
Where are those shots of the destruction located in Bombay ?
__Ranganathan : __Yes , two minutes walking distance from my apartment .
Here 's a Google Maps link :
Its in the southern area - the financial district of Mumbai .
Wired.com :
What inspired you to run out and get the shots and upload them to Flickr ?
Most people would have stayed safely at home .
__Ranganathan : __I have always been a shutterbug .
Would love to be a photo journalist someday !
When I heard two loud reverberating [ noises ] in the night around
10:45 pm , I picked my camera bag and headed out .
As I was stepping out my sis said there are reports of firing at CST ( train station ) - but I suspected it was bomb as it was pretty loud .
Turns out they were grenades .
__Wired.com : __What 's your occupation in Bombay ?
Ranganathan :
Business Development Manager at www.netcore.co.in.
__Wired.com : __What does the city feel like right now ?
Are all the friends all right ?
__Ranganathan : __Luckily all my friends are safe .
One of my father 's friends was shot dead at a restaurant .
The city is still scared and angry .
I feel the situation is still not under control and hostage drama is still on .
__Wired.com : __Did you feel that you were personally in any danger ?
__Ranganathan : __I think in general every person in Bombay does all the time be it terror , traffic or mob .
We have kind of got largely de-sentized .
But feelings overflow when things happen ' live ' near you for 12 hours .
The incident near my place which I took photos - grenades were thrown by the terrorist from the terrace of the building on to the adjacent gas station .
And they have taken some families hostage ... the situation is still not in control .
I have heard 5 gun shots in the last hour ( 12 hrs after start of the incident ! )
Wired.com :
Have you ever been in a situation like this before in Bombay , and if so , did you rush out and take photos ?
Ranganathan : I have witnessed shoot - out before when I was kid more 12 - 15 yrs ago when the mob fighting was at its peak .
That incident was of mob groups engaging in cross fire over the roof tops of buildings .
Even a film got realeased last year on that - " Shootout at Lokandwala . "
__Wired.com : __Did I see that someone gave you some money to update to a " pro " account ?
If so , who was that ?
Was that someone reacting to your shots ?
__Ranganathan : __I was have a problem while uploading my snaps on flickr possibly due to restrictions .
I was a pro user but had not renewed it for last 4
months .
A Flickr staff who got my twitter decided to give me a 3 month gift of Pro .

Hardly a day goes by without some extraordinary news from the military commissions , the system of " terror trials " conceived in the office of the vice president in November 2001 , and their days now seem to be as numbered as those of the Bush administration itself .
Following the outspoken resignation of former prosecutor Lt. Col.
Darrel Vandeveld and the Pentagon ’s desperate decision to drop charges against five prisoners to prevent Vandeveld from testifying for the defense , the latest news to rock the commissions is that the trial of Omar Khadr  a supposedly flagship case , along with that of the Yemeni Salim Hamdan , who received a surprisingly light sentence after a trial this summer  has been delayed until after the administration leaves office .
This is a bitter blow for the government , which has been pushing to prosecute Khadr for war crimes since 2005 .
Its first attempt failed , when the Supreme Court ruled that the whole enterprise was illegal , but after the commissions were bandaged up by Congress and resumed their ghoulish existence in 2007 , Khadr was once more put forward for trial .
This was in spite of the fact that his tenacious lawyers  both military and civilian  have questioned the very basis of the " war crimes " charges ( which essentially transform combatants in war into " terrorists " ) , and have unearthed evidence ( despite systemic obstruction ) that Khadr may not have been responsible for the main crime for which he is charged ( throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier ) .
Focusing on the fact that Khadr was just 15 years old when he was seized in July 2002 , they have also persistently pointed out the cruel folly , injustice , and illegality of prosecuting a juvenile for war crimes , when the UN Convention on the rights of children in wartime , to which the U.S. is a signatory , requires juveniles  those under the age of 18 when the alleged crime took place  to be rehabilitated rather than punished .
Last week , in pre-trial hearings , they reprised some of these arguments , and also sought access to seven interrogators , from various intelligence agencies , who , they insist , extracted coerced confessions from Khadr , who was severely wounded , while he was detained in the U.S. prison at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan , before his transfer to Guantánamo .
According to the lawyers , the information extracted from Khadr under duress was then used as the basis for interrogations at Guantánamo using more " sterile " and " benign " techniques , in much the same way that the administration has attempted to cover up its torture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other " high - value detainees " in secret CIA custody by using " clean teams " of FBI agents to extract new confessions in Guantánamo .
As was revealed in Salim Hamdan ’s trial , the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence ( which was only introduced after the commissions ’ first incarnation was struck down by the Supreme Court , and is still allowable at the judge ’s discretion ) may technically satisfy the absolute prohibition on the use of evidence obtained through torture , but it has the knock - on effect of effectively erasing the government ’s crimes from the record , while also allowing the authorities to obtain " clean " confessions from abused prisoners in a way that would shame all but the most vile totalitarian regimes .
Last week , Khadr ’s judge , Army Col.
Patrick Parrish , deferred a decision on the defense ’s motion , but as Judy Rabinovitz , an observer for the American Civil Liberties Union , noted , he " did not appear impressed " by the prosecution ’s argument that " there ‘ needs to be a showing ’ by the defense that coercive interrogation practices were used , " which otherwise were only " speculative . "
As Rabinovitz noted , touching on the burning issues of the suppression of evidence vital to the defense , which was highlighted in Mohamed Jawad ’s case by Lt. Col .
Vandeveld , " This line of argument would not likely succeed in a regular military or civilian criminal court , in which the standard for discovery generally places the burden on the government to give the defense information that may assist the defense . "
She added that Col. Parrish was also not impressed by the government ’s assertion that even providing information about the seven interrogators , three weeks before the trial ’s scheduled start date of Nov. 10 , would be an " undue burden " on the government .
However , Col. Parrish ’s decision to postpone Khadr ’s trial until Jan. 26 , five days into the new administration , was prompted in particular by defense complaints about the government ’s attempts to obstruct an independent psychiatric examination of their client .
Although this was first requested in May , it was challenged and resisted by the government in hearings throughout the summer , and as a result a psychiatric expert met Khadr for the first time on Oct. 13 .
Requesting a postponement of the trial ’s start date , the defense pointed out that the expert would need time to establish a rapport with Khadr , and also argued that the delay in providing Khadr with a psychiatric evaluation was largely the government ’s fault .
As Judy Rabinovitz explained , even when an independent expert had been approved , the prosecution " delayed in providing her the necessary security clearance , and has also failed to provide the defense with Khadr ’s psychiatric records . "
Those who have been pressing for the young Canadian ’s release will now be hoping that the Canadian government ( which is also a signatory to the UN Convention ) will finally discover its spine , and will take advantage of the change of administration to demand his return to Canada , or that the new U.S. government will refuse to proceed with the case .
Barack Obama , who voted against the Military Commissions
Act that revived the trial system in 2006 , has pledged to abolish the military commissions , which he regards ( along with the use of torture , the shredding of the Geneva Conventions , and the sidelining of the U.S. Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice ) as key examples of the Bush administration ’s quest for " unchecked presidential power , " and even John McCain , who voted for the legislation , may wish to transfer the ailing system to the mainland , and has already explained that he would repatriate Khadr if asked to do so by the Canadian government .
Apple did n’t just introduce new laptops Tuesday ; it also introduced a new term to the vocabulary of Mac users — DisplayPort .
The Mini DisplayPort found on new MacBooks , the refreshed Macbook Air and 15 - inch MacBook Pros replaces the DVI and mini-DVI interfaces found on older models .
But is this another proprietary debacle like Apple ’s failed Apple Display Connector ( ADC ) interface ?
No .
DisplayPort is , in fact , an open industry standard promoted by the Video Electronics Standards Association ( VESA ) , the same group that determines standard sizes for flat panel display mounts , for example .
And Apple is n’t the only company supporting DisplayPort .
HP , Philips , Samsung , Lenovo , AMD , Nvidia , Intel and many other companies have thrown their weight behind the standard , so we ’ll be seeing a lot more DisplayPort - compatible devices in the coming years .
Digital Visual Interface ( DVI ) has become the de facto standard for flat panel displays over the past few years , and it ’s not hard to understand why .
It ’s a direct digital interface between a computer and a display , which makes it nice and fast , keeps images sharp and colors crisp .
But DVI interfaces are big and clunky — probably its most obvious difference with DisplayPort .
Compared to a full - sized DVI interface , DisplayPort — and especially Mini DisplayPort — is much smaller .
Apple says the Mini DisplayPort — a smaller version of the official spec—on its redesigned portables is 10 percent the size of a full DVI connector .
Thus , DisplayPort frees up a lot more space on the side of a laptop as well inside the machine .
There are practical issues as well .
With DVI , you have to use thumbscrews to insert and secure a connection ; you just push a DisplayPort connector into place as you would with a USB device .
And you ca n’t easily bend a DisplayPort connector ’s pins , like you can with a DVI connector .
But just like DVI and , to a certain extent , High Definition Multimedia Interface ( HDMI ) video port found on newer home entertainment products and flat - screen TVs , Display Port can work equally well connecting a Mac or PC to a flat screen or to a home entertainment system .
A lot of what makes DisplayPort better than DVI , though , is found in the technological nitty - gritty .
DisplayPort has greater bandwidth than DVI does , for example ( no need for a Dual - Link DVI connector , as a single DisplayPort can accommodate a 30 - inch screen ) , and it embeds the clock signal in the data signal , while DVI and HDMI do that separately .
It also supports High - bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) , which should help put content providers at ease .
The downside of Apple ’s push to use DisplayPort :
It ’s still very early in this standard ’s adoption cycle , and there ’s no guarantee that DisplayPort will be used as pervasively as DVI is right now .
Even if it is , it ’s going to be an uphill climb for consumers , at least until more display vendors have more products on the market that use DisplayPort .
Unless you ’re content with the infinitesimal selection of displays that work with DisplayPort right now , you ’ll have to buy more gadgets to get your new Mac to work with a DVI or VGA display .
You ’re going to pay $ 29 for the privilege of getting such an adapter through the Apple Store .
Unless you need a Dual - Link DVI adapter to hook up a Cinema HD Display or another 30 - inch LCD panel , that is — that ’ll set you back a full c-note , and you ’ll be waiting four to five weeks for it , according to the online Apple Store .
What ’s more , regardless of whether you buy Apple ’s Display Port adapter or a third party ’s ( if you ’re lucky enough to find one , that is ) , you ’re going to mess up your desk with more boxes and wires getting that DVI or VGA display to work .
For what it ’s worth , Apple is one of the first major computer makers to actually release a system with DisplayPort on it , but it ’s not the first company out of the gate with a product equipped with a DisplayPort connector .
Dell released displays earlier this year with DisplayPort built in , and HP has since followed suit .
PC users can also buy Windows - compatible graphics cards ( from vendors that use both Nvidia and ATI chipsets ) that have DisplayPort adapters built in .
However , unlike HP and Dell with their displays , Apple is going out on a limb with its new 24 - inch LED Cinema Display .
That new monitor requires a DisplayPort connector , so for now , it ’s only compatible with the new Apple laptops — at least until Apple upgrades the rest of its product line with DisplayPort connectors .
Circular Error Probable

Following up on my post last week about using Twitter to track eating and weight , some of you voiced some interest in creating your own Twitter bot .
This post covers how you can do that .
The Gist of It
Creating my own Twitter bot was pretty straightforward ( much more than I thought it ’d be ) , mostly because Twitter provides an API and the resources to make it that way .
I wanted something really simple that I could play around with .
I just wanted to be able to send a direct message to my Twitter bot , and from there , it would store my data .
OK , so here are the basic steps I took :
Create Twitter account for bot Turn on email notification for direct messages only Check email periodically for new direct messages Parse direct messages and store in database
Create a Twitter Account ( and Email Address )
The first step is easy .
Create a Twitter account specifically for your bot .
The account name should be short and easy to remember .
Make sure you enter an IMAP email address that is only for your bot .
You could put in a general purpose email address , but it ’ll make your life a lot easier if the email address was specifically for Twitter .
Turn on Email Notifications
Once you ’ve setup your bot account , turn on email notification via the Twitter options menu .
For now , tell Twitter to only send you notifications when your bot receives direct messages and not when someone new follows .
Check Email and Do Something with Messages
Here ’s where the actual code comes in .
Here ’s the general framework .
I ’ve left out some details that will be specific to your own purposes .
from imaplib import * from email .
Parser import Parser import datetime , time , email , email .
Utils import re # Connect to email server server = IMAP4(" __EMAIL_SERVER.COM__ " ) server.login(" __EMAIL_ACCOUNT_NAME__ " , " __EMAIL_PASSWORD__ " ) r = server.select ( " INBOX " ) #
Find only new mail ( i.e. new direct messages ) r , data = server.
search ( None , " ( NEW ) " ) #
If there are new direct messages : if len( data [ 0 ] ) > 0 : p = Parser ( ) # Loop through new emails for num in data [ 0 ] .split( ) : #
Who email is from ( Should be one line , broken for display only ) r , data = server .
fetch( num , '( BODY [ HEADER .FIELDS ( DATE SUBJECT FROM X- TwitterEmailType X- TwitterSenderScreenName X- TwitterCreatedAt X - TwitterRecipientScreenName ) ] ) ' ) msg = p.parsestr ( data [ 0 ] [ 1 ] ) who = msg.__getitem__ ( ' From ' ) matchemail = re.compile ( r '[ \w\ - ] [ \w\ -\. ] [ email protected ] [ \w\ - ] [ \w\ -\. ] +[ a - zA - Z ] { 1,4} ' ) email_addy = matchemail.findall( who ) [ 0 ]
# Twitter username twitter_un = msg.__getitem__('X - TwitterSenderScreenName ' ) #
If the email is a direct message sent from Twitter if msg.__getitem__(' X - TwitterEmailType ' ) == ' direct_message ' : #
When direct message sent , convert to epoch seconds twitter_time = msg.__getitem__('X - TwitterCreatedAt').strip ( ) time_tuple = email.Utils.parsedate(twitter_time ) epoch_seconds = time.mktime( time_tuple ) #
Get body of email sent by Twitter r , data = server.
fetch( num , '( RFC822.TEXT ) ') body = data [ 0 ] [ 1 ] twitter_dm = body.split( " \r
\r
" ) [ 0 ] .strip ( ) #
Do something with the twitter direct message ... # Parse it ... #
Store it in a database ?... # Logout of email server server.logout ( )
I run this script every 30 minutes with a cron .
You could of course run it more frequently .
The important part of this code though is that Twitter attaches its own special headers ( e.g. X - TwitterEmailType ) .
If you wanted your bot to automatically follow users that followed it , you could check the EmailType and then use the Twitter API to follow a Twitter user .
For my simple purposes though , I only cared about direct messages .
That ’s all .
There is of course plenty of room for improvement .
Like I said , you could make this useful to lots of users by making your bot automatically follow those who follow it .
Users can only direct message another Twitter user , if he is following .
I would also delete emails that have already been read and stored somewhere so that the INBOX does n’t pile up .
Yup .
Did I miss anything ?
It was fall of 1995 and everyone was gearing up for the 1996 tax season .
After years of maintenance of a DOS - based tax application , TaxQuik -- as we 'll call the company -- had to get with the times .
New , spunky companies were building tax software for Windows with fancy GUIs , integrated help and even Internet - enabled features , while TaxQuik was still in the text - based stone age of DOS .
The one thing that the new companies all lacked was the name recognition and brand loyalty of TaxQuik 's customers .
The company developed an aggressive plan to continue to support the DOS version , while simultaneously building a Windows version of the software .
And by all accounts , the plan worked like a charm .
Some of TaxQuik 's larger clients were given a preview version of the new Windows version , and the feedback was almost universally positive .
An interactive 1040 form that could be printed on any sheet of paper without needing blank copies of the form ?
It was the kind of thing that tax accountants ' dreams were made of .
Trouble in Paradise
As testing continued , the initial appeal of the software started to wear off .
One day , a user called to complain his network connection kept dropping whenever he was using the Windows version .
The following day , two more reports of the same problem came in .
Eventually TaxQuik received more issue reports than it could handle , so the network infrastructure group was called in to help .
Bruce W. and the rest of the infrastructure team got to work right away , first setting up a test installation on a small network with a sniffer running on one of the machines .
They entered 1040 information for Joe Employee at 123 Fake St. and took a deep breath as they hit ENTER .
There was barely a blip in the network traffic .
Returning to the machine , they loaded the tax form , tabbed through , changed a few fields and hit ENTER again .
Again , hardly any traffic was generated .
" Wait , let me try , " Bruce said , grabbing the mouse .
" Whoa , what just happened ? " a teammate exclaimed .
" What did you do ?
A ton of traffic just came through ! "
" Uh , nothing , I think . "
Bruce had n't done anything but sit down at the table and put his hand on the mouse .
" Let me see if I can reproduce whatever just happened , " he said .
Bruce dragged the cursor to the file menu and was about to reload the form .
" You just did reproduce it !
What the heck are you doing ? "
This gave Bruce an idea .
" I have to ask the lead developer about something . "
The Source
" Oh , I think I might know what the problem is , " the lead developer said , when Bruce questioned him .
" We wanted the operations to be quick so it would feel like a Windows app instead of a DOS app ported to Windows , so we spent a lot of time on optimization and hiding reads and writes . "
" So ... "
" So , we decided to put a lot of the background logic in the application 's MouseMove event . "
Bruce summoned all of his self control to keep from slapping himself on the forehead .
" What kind of ' background logic ' ? "
" You know -- database reads and writes , re-calculations . "
Windows Next Season
After several meetings , it was decided that it was n't the best idea to put critical code in an app 's MouseMove event .
Realizing that users of the DOS version were probably accustomed to keyboard navigation sealed the deal .
TaxQuik quietly stopped describing the Windows version as a " preview " -- probably because " harbinger of doom " would 've been more apt -- and instead called it a " limited beta . "
Large sections of code were reworked to perform smaller tasks in little bursts , rather than unleash a series of dozens of commands and queries while the mouse was moved around the screen , but it was n't enough .
TaxQuik did n't have a shippable Windows version of the software for the 1996 tax season .
The following year , it managed to put out a Windows version that still had some performance issues , but by 1998 the company had hit its stride .
At this rate , TaxQuik will hopefully have a Windows Vista version by 2012 .

Initiative Would Only Apply to Future Marriages
SAN FRANCISCO --
The California Attorney General , Equality California , and the nation 's leading LGBT legal groups agree that the marriages of the estimated 18,000 same - sex couples who married between June 16 , 2008 and the possible passage of Proposition 8 are still valid in the state of California and must continue to be honored by the state .
As Attorney General Jerry Brown has stated in previous court papers and as he reaffirmed to the San Francisco Chronicle , those marriages should remain valid notwithstanding Proposition 8 's possible passage .
On August 5 , 2008 , Brown told the Chronicle , " I believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the May 15 Supreme Court opinion will be recognized by the California Supreme Court , ' He noted that Proposition is silent about retroactivity , and said , ' I would think the court , in looking at the underlying equities , would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result . ' "
There is absolutely nothing in the language of Proposition 8 to suggest that the initiative would apply to couples who have already legally married .
Unless the language of an initiative specifically says that it is to be applied retroactively , California 's courts have been very reluctant to do so , especially when the newly passed measure is in such stark conflict with existing constitutional provisions .
Although it is extremely unlikely that California courts would apply the initiative retroactively , the proponents of Proposition 8 may file a legal challenge trying to invalidate the marriages of those who married before Proposition 8 possibly passed .
The LGBT legal groups remain committed to ensuring that all the couples who married in California continue to receive the legal protections and to have their marriages respected as required under California law and will vigorously fight any attempts to take rights away from couples and families .

What do you get when you cross a hamster ball with a roller coaster , super size it so humans can go in ?
And if that 's not enough , let 's give it motors so you can drive it ...
Behold , the Buzzball :
At the heart of the Buzzball is a dual motor configuration , enabling the pilot to control the motion and direction of travel via left and right control triggers , which provides power to the driving wheels . [...]
Once the Buzzball is in motion the pod maintains an upright position until the pilot turns , causing the pod to rotate inside the ball against the direction of travel , which applies a braking force and the pod to lock with the ball .
This causes the pod to rotate with the ball until the weight of the pilot and pod overcomes the inertia forces and causes the Buzzball to change direction .
This is when the fun starts , as the speed will affect the degree of rotation of the pilot and pod from a partial barrel roll to complete and multiple rotations !
There is a reason why the McCain camp embargoed Sarah Palin for as long as they did .
She was talking to Greta on FOX and explained what the McCain administration would do in their first 100 days of taking office .
( 2:07 mark )
Palin :
Ok , we 're confident that we 're going to win on Tuesday so from there , those first 100 days , how we 're going to kick in the plan that will get this economy back on the right track and really shore up the strategies that we need over in Iraq and Iran to win these wars ...
Greta then glosses over it , as if Sarah never mentioned that we 're at war with Iran and immediately brings up a possible " gaffe " made by Gov. Richardson .
Go Greta .
Let 's hope the Iranians did n't see this .

Kosovan leaders rejected UN - mandated deployment of EU police before bombing attempt
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , November 24 , 2008
German intelligence agents have been caught staging a false flag terror attack against an EU building in Kosovo , apparently in an attempt to create a pretext for EU police to be deployed in Kosovo after government leaders rejected the UN - mandated proposal .
“ Germany declined to comment on on Saturday on reports that three Germans arrested on suspicion of throwing explosives at an EU office in Kosovo were intelligence officers , ” reports Reuters .
“ The explosive charge was thrown on Nov. 14 at the International Civilian Office ( ICO ) , the office of EU Special Representative Pieter Feith , who oversees Kosovo ’s governance . ”
A police source in Kosovo told Reuters : “ They are members of the BND ” , but gave no further details .
German news outlet Der Spiegel named the men as BND intelligence officers .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Most reports claimed that the officers had thrown dynamite at the building , while others reported that a bomb was placed near the building .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The bombing attempt happened just days after Kosovan leaders rejected a plan by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ’s for the deployment of a 2000 strong EU police and justice mission , EULEX .
A Kosovan judge has ordered that the men be detained for a further 30 days as prosecution lawyers seek terrorism charges that carry a maximum 20 - year sentence .
The three men were not in Kosovo under official auspices but were working on behalf of a contractor , named by German media as Logistic Assessments .
“ The alleged presence of covert intelligence operatives has led to a deterioration in the cordial relations between Germany and the newly independent Kosovo .
The German foreign ministry confirmed that three German citizens had been detained in Kosovo .
The BND had no comment , ” reports the European Voice .
The German secret service , the BND , is notorious for infiltrating extremist groups and using them for their own political ends .
In March 2003 amidst a highly publicized attempt to ban the activities of a German Neo -Nazi political party , the trial collapsed in court after it emerged that the far - right National Democratic Party ( NPD ) was full of German intelligence officers occupying top ranking positions , including the publisher of the party ’s newspaper , who were all secretly on the government ’s payroll for decades .
“ The case has been stalled for more than a year after it emerged that the government ’s case rested , at least partly , on a network of informants in the National Democratic Party .
This raised the question of whether any acted as provocateurs , ” reported the Scotsman .
As many as 30 leading figures in the party were exposed as paid agents and informers for the BND .

Obama camp : McCain ' desperate and dishonest '
Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008
Print This Email This MILWAUKEE , Wisconsin ( AFP ) - John McCain cranked up a searing character assault on Democrat Barack Obama Thursday , branding him " too risky " for the White House , as he raced to rescue his diving poll numbers .
McCain issued a hard - hitting negative commercial , slamming his rival 's judgement and candor and accusing him of not telling the truth about the extent of his acquaintance with 1960s radical William Ayers .
The Obama camp said the ad was " desperate and dishonest " and an attempt to distract voters from the worsening economic crisis and the McCain campaign 's darkening prospects in the November 4 election .
Obama , set to launch a two - day bus tour in Ohio , often a decisive swing - state , also hit back with an ad ridiculing McCain 's plan to buy up 300 billion dollars in bad mortgages as a waste of taxpayer money .
McCain trails Obama by widening margins in battleground state polls , in national surveys and even on some reliable Republican turf , and time is fast running out for him to turn the race around .
His latest ad noted that Ayers was part of the activist Weather Underground group and his wife was on the FBI 's Most Wanted list , and says Obama has disguised the full scope of their relationship .
" Americans say , ' where 's the truth , Barack ? ' the ad says .
" Barack Obama .
Too risky for America . "
Obama has repeatedly said he is not close to Ayers , an assertion backed up by independent fact checking organizations , but said he served on philanthropic boards with him and lives in the same Chicago neighborhood .
Senior Obama strategist Robert Gibbs Thursday blasted McCain 's new ad as a " desperate and dishonest political attack . "
" It 's meant to cover up that John McCain has virtually no answers for the economic crisis , " he said on ABC .
But McCain spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace said the ad asked a deeper question about Obama 's character .
" If we can't tell Barack Obama to tell the truth about the guys in his neighborhood , who also happen to be domestic terrorists ... how can we trust him to tell the truth about what he could do as president ? "
McCain 's relentlessly negative comes after the Republican camp said it wanted to turn the spotlight away from devastating economic news .
The character attacks may be an attempt to leverage cultural suspicion among white working class voters in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania , where the economic crisis has hammered McCain 's hopes .
Recent McCain tactics have seen anti-Obama bile pouring out of McCain crowds , vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin accusing the Democrat of " palling around " with terrorists and a personal attack by McCain 's wife Cindy .
The McCain character assault against Obama has escalated sharply in recent days , though the Arizona senator did not raise Ayers , who is now a college professor , in the second presidential debate on Tuesday .
On Wednesday , McCain 's wife Cindy took up the assault , accusing Obama of voting against legislation funding troops in Iraq while her son was serving in the war zone .
" The day Senator Obama decided to cast a vote to not fund my son , when he was serving -- -- sent a cold chill through my body , " she said .
Democrats including Obama voted against the troop funding bill on the grounds that it did not include withdrawal timelines .
At the time , there was little realistic prospect that funding for the war would be halted .
Also on Wednesday , an warm - up speaker for McCain and Palin spoke about " Barack Hussein Obama . "
Democrats accuse Republicans of mentioning their nominee 's middle name to fan inaccurate suspicions that Obama , who is a Christian , is a Muslim .
The McCain campaign said in a statement it did not condone such comments , but it was the latest in a sequence of occasions when Obama 's middle name has come up at Republican events .
McCain himself was accused of being disrespectful towards Obama in Tuesday 's debate , referring to him dismissively as " that one . "
And the Republican nominee has been stepping up criticism of the Democrat on the stump .
" Who is the real Barack Obama ? " he asked on Wednesday , after saying in a Fox News interview that his rival was not prepared to be president .
Meanwhile , there have been angry chants of " treason " and hisses and boos , when Obama 's name is mentioned at McCain rallies .
McCain was campaigning Thursday in the midwestern state of Wisconisin , which was once a battleground but where polls suggest Obama may be set for victory , just over three weeks from election day .

Matt Lauer Marriage Question by Meredith Vieira
It started like any other Monday morning on The Today Show. andstarted an innocent enough story intro about the right age to get married .
Matt asked the question and Meredith responded that she had tied the knot when she was in her 30's .
Without missing a beat she turned the question on her co-host and asked , " When did you get married ? "
Matt was left stammering and not willing or able to bluff his way through .
His first marriage to television producer Nancy Alspaugh spanned 1982 - 1989 .
That would have made Lauer 25 when he first married .
Matt went on to marry his current wife Annette Roque in 1998 .
That union has gone through a very rocky patch with divorce proceedings initiated .
The couple have since reconciled and are raising three young children , Jack , Romy and Thijs .
Back to Meredith .
After she left Lauer speechless she could n't leave it alone .
Someone off camera was heard to say , " Nice ! "
She said , " Anyway , I 'm sorry .
Oh geez ... "
Her parting comment before break was , " I do n't think I 'm going to be the one to live happily ever after , after this show ! "
As one of our readers pointed out , Matt brought up the subject so he really brought on the reflex question by his co-host .
Meredith simply prolonged his momentary discomfort by carrying on - as she has been known to do on numerous occasions .
Now Matt is involved in a cheating scandal - see who the other woman is here .
Check out photos of his wives in our gallery below as well as the Today Show video below .

" What is Thanksgiving and why is it celebrated ? "
For thousands of years , mankind has set aside a day each year to celebrate bountiful annual harvests .
Before the establishment of formal religions , many ancient farmers believed that their crops contained spirits which caused the crops to grow and die .
Many believed that these spirits would be released when the crops were harvested and they had to be destroyed or they would take revenge on the farmers who harvested them .
Some of the harvest festivals celebrated the defeat of these spirits .
Harvest festivals and Thanksgiving celebrations were held by the ancient Greeks , the Romans , the Hebrews , the Chinese , and the Egyptians .
What is the history of Thanksgiving in United States ?
The initial " Thanksgiving " feast , held in 1621 , was really a traditional English harvest celebration .
The Pilgrims shared it with the Native Americans because they had taught the colonists to plants crops and hunt wild game .
Without the Native Americans , the Pilgrims may not have survived the harsh winter and been able to celebrate their first harvest of plentiful crops in the New World .
The colonists ' first harvest feast lasted for three days .
Food was served all at once , instead of in courses , so people ate whatever they pleased in the order that they desired .
The more important members at the feast were given the best pieces of meat , while the rest of the diners ate whatever was closest to them .
Since the Pilgrims did n't use forks or plates , they ate their meal straight off the table with spoons , knives or their fingers .
They used large napkins to wipe their hands and also wrapped it around food when it was too hot to hold .
The history of Thanksgiving demonstrates that feasts like the one at Plymouth were held throughout the colonies after fall harvests .
However , all thirteen colonies did not celebrate Thanksgiving at the same time .
In 1789 , George Washington became the first president to declare Thanksgiving a holiday .
By the mid-1800s , many states observed the Thanksgiving holiday .
Meanwhile , the poet and editor , Sarah J. Hale , had begun lobbying for a national Thanksgiving holiday .
During the Civil War President Abraham Lincoln looking for ways to unite the nation , discussed the subject with Hale .
In 1863 he gave his Thanksgiving Proclamation declaring the last Thursday in November a day of Thanksgiving .
In 1939 , 1940 , and 1941 Franklin D. Roosevelt , seeking to lengthen the Christmas shopping season , proclaimed Thanksgiving the third Thursday in November .
Controversy ensued , and Congress passed a joint resolution in 1941 decreeing that Thanksgiving should fall on the fourth Thursday of November , where it remains .
What is Thanksgiving today ?
At its heart , it 's a holiday where family and friends congregate to catch up , reminisce , tell jokes , share scrumptious food and generally give thanks for all the good things in life - exactly what they did at the very first Thanksgiving .

What if every product category , every business , is a bubble — and some just last longer ?
We know the newspaper business was a bubble .
It lasted over a century , but here we are , at the end of it .
Papers will still be around , for the same reason that railroads and mainframe computers are still around .
But they ’ll never be what they were in their golden decades .
Television will follow .
That golden age is coming to an end as well .
Same with radio .
These will also persist , in somewhat different forms .
But the golden age is over .
I ’m thinking now that we ’re seeing the same thing with cars .
A few days ago I took in my old Volkswagen Passat to get the water pump replaced .
Turns out lots of other stuff was worn out or broken and needed fixing too .
The final bill came to around $ 5000 , which is what I paid for the thing three years ago .
For a minute I thought about getting a new car .
They ’re cheaper than ever , with lots of good deals , and guarantees that would relieve me of the need to pay much for upkeep .
But I decided to fix the old car instead , becuase it ’s good enough .
Spending $ 5 k is better than spending $ 20 k , especially if I do n’t have to borrow the difference .
The mechanic told me his business is booming .
Most car owners have awakened to the fact that cars are cars , and most of what we do with them is just drive from place to place .
New cars purchases are impelled mostly by advertising and fantasy .
Drive a lot of rental cars and you get hip to the obvious : the differences between cars , especially fairly new ones , is n’t large .
After a few years they all plateau at a certain level of partial suckage and stay that way for the duration .
You forget the quiet cabin and tight handling that turned you on in the first place .
You care less about its color than just being able to find it in the parking lot .
You know the noise in the heater is some rocks your kid put down the vents and wo n’t ever get fixed .
Now , what happens if an absence of new car fantasy prevails for the duration ?
What if the whole automobile business has jumped the shark , and the problem is n’t just Detroit’s ?
Even if it has n’t now , the business will falter eventually .
They all do .
Disruptions happen .
Trees do not grow to the sky .
That ’s Nature ’s nature , in business as well as the wilderness .

Oct. 30 , 2008 -- Scary Halloween news from the CDC : Type 2 diabetes is up 90 % since 1997 .
And that may be an underestimate because the numbers come from self - reported surveys conducted by the CDC in 1995 - 1997 and in 2005 - 2007 .
About a third of people with diabetes do n't yet know they have the dangerous disease .
" This dramatic increase in the number of people with diabetes highlights the increasing burden of diabetes across the country , " CDC data analyst Karen Kirtland , PhD , says in a news release .
For the first time , the CDC has state - specific data on diabetes .
Southern states have the highest diabetes rate .
Among the 10 states with the highest diabetes rates , only Arizona is not in the South .
The other nine are Alabama , Florida , Georgia , Kentucky , Louisiana , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , and West Virginia .
West Virginia takes the dubious honor of being the U.S. diabetes capital .
Of the 33 states for which the CDC has complete data , West Virginia has the highest annual diabetes rate -- 12.7 new diabetes cases for every 1,000 residents .
Minnesota has the lowest annual diabetes rate : five new cases per 1,000 residents .
But even in the " best " state , diabetes is way up -- by 67 % -- over the last decade .
California has the highest number of new diabetes cases .
In 1997 , 208,000 Californians were told they had diabetes .
What 's going on ?
" The growth in diabetes prevalence has been concomitant with growth in obesity prevalence , " Kirtland and colleagues report in the Oct. 31 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
In the South , 27.3 % of people are obese .
But Americans are n't exactly lean in other regions .
The obesity rate is 26.5 % in the Midwest , 24.4 % in the Northeast , and 23.1 % in the West .
Obesity , the CDC says , is the major risk factor for diabetes .
Yet it 's not necessary to become thin to avoid this debilitating disease .
A study of people at high risk for diabetes shows you can cut your risk of diabetes by 58 % in a three - year period by doing just two things :
If gas prices are n't enough to threaten your wallet during holiday travel , consider a photo speed - enforcement ticket .
Motorists traveling any stretch of Interstate 10 or Interstate 40 across Arizona between 3 and 11 p.m. today will encounter speed - enforcement devices every 20 miles .
The move is part of a nationwide strategy to keep highways safe on a busy travel day , said Roger Vanderpool , director of the Arizona Department of Public Safety .
AAA officials estimate about 41 million Americans will travel 50 or more miles from home this Thanksgiving weekend .
About 33.2 million are expected to drive to their destinations .
DPS is using its entire fleet of 42 speed - enforcement vans and about 20 fixed units to cover all of I - 10 and I - 40 in Arizona .
Units are triggered when a driver is going 10 mph or more past the posted speed limit .
Violators are notified by mail within 30 days and must pay a fine of roughly $ 185 .
The civil violation does not have any bearing on a driver 's license , but anyone caught traveling at 20 mph or more over the speed limit will face a criminal charge .
DPS operates more than 60 mobile - speed cameras .
Report : Chinese hackers download White House e-mails RAW STORY
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This The White House 's computer network was penetrated on several occasions earlier this year by Chinese hackers who downloaded e-mails between government officials , a new report reveals .
A senior US official tells the Financial Times that cyber - security experts believe the attacks were coordinated by the Chinese government , although there is no proof they were the result of an organized assault .
 We are getting very targeted Chinese attacks so its stretches credulity that these are not directed by government - related organisations ,  said the official .
The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force , a unit established in 2007 to tackle security , detected the attacks .
The official stressed the hackers had accessed only the unclassified computer network , and not the more secure classified network .
Intelligence officials and cyber- security experts in the US government have become increasingly concerned with online attacks originating in China .
This spring , hackers claimed to have penetrated the Pentagon 's network and warned they could access any site .
Earlier : ' Foreign entity ' staged cyber attack on both campaigns WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The computer systems of US presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were targeted by hackers this summer from an unknown " foreign entity , " Newsweek magazine reported on Thursday .
Newsweek said a federal investigation was opened after the campaigns were " victims of a sophisticated cyber attack . "
" FBI and White House officials told the Obama campaign that they believed that a foreign entity or organization sought to gather information on the evolution of both camps ' policy issues -- information that might be useful in negotiations with a future administration , " Newsweek said .
" Obama technical experts later speculated that the hackers were Russian or Chinese , " the magazine said , adding that the FBI had assured the Obama team that the attack had not been carried out by its political opponents .
Newsweek said technology experts at the Obama headquarters discovered the cyber attack in midsummer and initially thought it was a computer virus .
But the FBI and Secret Service warned them the system had been compromised and a " serious amount of files " had been stolen .
They said the McCain campaign 's computer system had been similarly compromised .
Newsweek said the Obama campaign retained a security firm following the attack and ended the intrusion .
Obama defeated McCain in Tuesday 's election and is to be sworn in as president on January 20 , 2009 .

Finish work , eat , slump , channel flick , sleep .
Most of my evenings followed this pattern until my partner took the drastic action of cutting the plug off the TV , brandishing it wildly like the scalp of a confounding enemy .
I was initially horrified - " I need the telly for work ! "
" Gok Wan is not work " " He is !
He 's part of the zeitgeist !
I'm a writer and I need to be connected " - but giving up television was a smart decision .
Instead of restricting our conversations to what needs cleaning , who is doing what at the weekend and " Where did you put the thing ? " , we have talked more about what makes us happy , where we want our lives to be and taken the time to listen to each other .
I can't remember the last time we had a row .
Living in Brighton meant we could make the most of the late summer evenings and started taking long walks along the seafront .
I can't say it has made me much fitter , but it has made me feel healthier .
Mealtimes have become more of an event , instead of a necessary break in the day to consume food .
We choose new recipes to cook for each other , try different dishes that had previously been put off for " taking too long " and enjoy it all much more than the usual stressful half hour of making something - anything - before EastEnders starts .
After a few weeks , I found not watching the news incredibly frustrating - especially if I was working on a news desk the next day - so the plug was reattached with the condition that we would only watch things we are genuinely interested in .
Like a couple from the 1950s , we now go through the TV guide and pick specific programmes , instead of mindlessly channel surfing .
Staying off the telly will be a challenge as the winter nights draw in , but I feel I have so much more time in the evenings that I 'm keen to keep it up .

Losses are great , and continuous , says the report
The global economy is losing more money from the disappearance of forests than through the current banking crisis , according to an EU - commissioned study .
It puts the annual cost of forest loss at between $ 2 trillion and $ 5 trillion .
The figure comes from adding the value of the various services that forests perform , such as providing clean water and absorbing carbon dioxide .
The study , headed by a Deutsche Bank economist , parallels the Stern Review into the economics of climate change .
It has been discussed during many sessions here at the World Conservation Congress .
Some conservationists see it as a new way of persuading policymakers to fund nature protection rather than allowing the decline in ecosystems and species , highlighted in the release on Monday of the Red List of Threatened Species , to continue .
Capital losses Speaking to BBC
News on the fringes of the congress , study leader Pavan Sukhdev emphasised that the cost of natural decline dwarfs losses on the financial markets .
" It 's not only greater but it 's also continuous , it 's been happening every year , year after year , " he told BBC News .
Teeb will ... show the risks we run by not valuing [ nature ] adequately . "
Andrew Mitchell
Global Canopy Programme
" So whereas Wall Street by various calculations has to date lost , within the financial sector , $ 1 - $ 1.5 trillion , the reality is that at today 's rate we are losing natural capital at least between $ 2 - $ 5 trillion every year . "
The review that Mr Sukhdev leads , The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( Teeb ) , was initiated by Germany under its recent EU presidency , with the European Commission providing funding .
The first phase concluded in May when the team released its finding that forest decline could be costing about 7 % of global GDP .
The second phase will expand the scope to other natural systems .
Stern message
Key to understanding his conclusions is that as forests decline , nature stops providing services which it used to provide essentially for free .
So the human economy either has to provide them instead , perhaps through building reservoirs , building facilities to sequester carbon dioxide , or farming foods that were once naturally available .
Or we have to do without them ; either way , there is a financial cost .
The Teeb calculations show that the cost falls disproportionately on the poor , because a greater part of their livelihood depends directly on the forest , especially in tropical regions .
The greatest cost to western nations would initially come through losing a natural absorber of the most important greenhouse gas .
Just as the Stern Review brought the economics of climate change into the political arena and helped politicians see the consequences of their policy choices , many in the conservation community believe the Teeb review will lay open the economic consequences of halting or not halting the slide in biodiversity .
" The numbers in the Stern Review enabled politicians to wake up to reality , " said Andrew Mitchell , director of the Global Canopy Programme , an organisation concerned with directing financial resources into forest preservation .
" Teeb will do the same for the value of nature , and show the risks we run by not valuing it adequately . "
A number of nations , businesses and global organisations are beginning to direct funds into forest conservation , and there are signs of a trade in natural ecosystems developing , analogous to the carbon trade , although it is clearly very early days .
Some have ethical concerns over the valuing of nature purely in terms of the services it provides humanity ; but the counter - argument is that decades of trying to halt biodiversity decline by arguing for the intrinsic worth of nature have not worked , so something different must be tried .
Whether Mr Sukhdev 's arguments will find political traction in an era of financial constraint is an open question , even though many of the governments that would presumably be called on to fund forest protection are the ones directly or indirectly paying for the review .
But , he said , governments and businesses are getting the point .
" Times have changed .
Almost three years ago , even two years ago , their eyes would glaze over .
" Today , when I say this , they listen .
In fact I get questions asked - so how do you calculate this , how can we monetise it , what can we do about it , why do n't you speak with so and so politician or such and such business . "
The aim is to complete the Teeb review by the middle of 2010 , the date by which governments are committed under the Convention of Biological Diversity to have begun slowing the rate of biodiversity loss .

Biden : ' Abuse of power ' is ' most serious ' abuse Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Sunday October 12 , 2008
Print This Email
This A vote for Obama / Biden is a vote for your interests , Senators Clinton and Biden told the audience at a Scranton , Pennsylvania rally alongside former President Bill Clinton .
Also , Biden called the upcoming election literally the most important in one 's lifetime .
" I'm deputizing every one of you to make the that has to be made " to undecided family and friends , Sen .
Clinton told the audience , " because Barack and Joe are not asking you to marry them ... they 're asking you to vote for them and vote for yourselves . "
" This election is too important to sit on the sidelines of history , " she added .
" There is the one most serious abuse a man or a woman , or a government , can engage in ... is to abuse power , " Biden noted in a segue to the economy .
While no particular person was named , Biden 's opponent , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , was found in a report released on Friday related to the " Troopergate " investigation to have abused her power in violation of Alaska 's state ethics law .
Gov. Palin , her husband Todd and their aides were accused of a campaign of pressure on state officials aiming to get their ex-brother - in - law , Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten , fired during his divorce battle with the Governor 's sister .
Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan was believed to have been let go because he refused to dismiss Wooten .
" Right now , all across Pennsylvania , folks are trying to figure out what all this tough economic news means for them and for their families .
" But [ for too many ]
Americans , the economy did n't start collapsing a week ago , it did n't start collapsing a month ago , it did n't start collapsing a year ago ... it started collapsing eight years ago .
For too long , families have been asking questions as simple as they are profound ... ' Will I have a job next month ? '
' Can I afford to go to the doctor's ? '
' Can I fill the gas tank ? '
' Is my house worth what I paid for it ? '
' Will I be able to send Mary back to college next semester ? '
' Will I be able to retire now that my 401 ( k ) and the value of my home has ( sic ) evaporated ?'
" Ladies and gentlemen , they 're asking simple questions ; simple and profound questions ; that this administration and John McCain and Sarah Palin have been unwilling , unable , and apparently , it seems like [ they ] sometimes do n't know how to even begin to answer . "

Britische Regierung plant Senkung der Mehrwertsteuer Florian Rötzer
Eine Senkung der Mehrwertsteuer würde auch in Deutschland allen zugute kommen .
Um die Wirtschaft in Schwung zu halten , plant die britische Regierung die Absenkung der Mehrwertsteuer – noch vor Ende des Jahres , um die Weihnachtseinkäufe zu fördern .
Im Gegensatz zu den in Deutschland diskutierten oder geforderten Steuernachlässen zur Stimulierung des Konsums , würden bei einer Reduzierung der Mehrwertsteuer tatsächlich alle etwas davon haben .
In Großbritannien liegt die Mehrwertsteuer seit 1991 bei 17,5 Prozent .
Nach den Vorgaben der EU darf sie höchsten auf 15 Prozent reduziert werden .
Ob die britische Regierung bis zu diesem Minimum gehen will , ist noch nicht heraus .
Klar ist jedoch , dass es eine auf ein Jahr begrenzte Maßnahme sein soll .
Eine Absenkung auf 15 Prozent würden dem Staat Mindereinnahmen von etwa 15 Milliarden Euro einbringen .
Neben der Mehrwertsteuersenkung sind weitere Maßnahmen geplant , die Großbritannien schon im nächsten Jahr ein Hauhaltsdefizit von fast 120 Milliarden bescheren werden .
So soll die geplante Erhöhung der Kraftfahrzeugsteuer für größere Autos und der Unternehmenssteuer für kleine Firmen verschoben und die Steuer für Geringverdiener gesenkt werden .
Zudem wird die Versteuerung auf ausländische Dividenden ausgesetzt , um multinationale Unternehmen im Land zu halten .
Man wolle sich nicht zu einem " Gefangenen der alten Dogmen " machen , sagt Regierungschef Brown .
Er kündigte an , europaweit für eine gemeinsame Politik der Steuersenkung einzutreten .
Head gardener Darren Dickey said : " We have extensive grounds which we maintain well but this particular spot was a bit tucked away .
We could see the top of a palm tree but there are a few exotic plants here so we assumed it was on its own .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Though Sarah Palin 's vice presidential run came to a losing end on Tuesday , many of her supporters are already touting her as a candidate in 2012 .
Despite her poor performance in the media and in some polls , Palin , unlike McCain or the other Republican primary candidates , managed to excite the party 's conservative base .
But history has a cruel lesson for anyone counting on her presidential aspirations : the losing vice presidential candidate has usually met the end of the line for a national office run .
Based on recent history , this may seem counterintuitive .
After all , the winning vice presidential candidate is handed a gilded path to the nomination .
Since 1952 , seven of 11 vice presidents have gained their parties ' presidential nomination in the next election .
There is an obvious reason for this -- the vice president is running effectively as incumbent , cloaked under the mantle of the previous president .
The vice president has also managed to stay in the public eye for the last four or eight years , gaining invaluable name recognition and respect from the party faithful .
But the losers have a sadder story to tell .
Throughout the entirety of American history , only three losing vice presidential candidates have managed to ever come back and win their parties ' nomination .
And all three have exceptional stories .
The most recent man to do it , the Republican 1996 presidential standard bearer Bob Dole , had previously run as Gerald Ford 's second in 1976 .
By the time Ford tapped him , Dole had already served 16 years in Congress and a term as the head of the Republican National Committee .
And yet , the two dates for his national runs say it all .
It took Dole 20 years , two failed presidential runs and a long service as the Senate Republican leader before he managed to re-climb the ladder and capture the Republican nomination .
Not that it helped .
He was easily defeated by Bill Clinton in the presidential race .
The second losing candidate to climb onto the top of the platform was Walter Mondale , but his place comes with a major asterisk .
Mondale did lose with Jimmy Carter in 1980 , but of course , Mondale had already served four years as a Vice President .
By the time 1984 came around , he was the Democratic front runner based on his four years in national office .
His Democratic Party triumph was no surprise .
The final name , like Palin did not have a lot of experience in office when tapped for the VP slot , and could provide a slight comfort .
But she would have to go all the way back to 1920 to find him , and ignore some critical facts to find hope in his example .
Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt served as James Cox 's running mate on the Democratic ticket .
Cox and Roosevelt were trounced by Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge 's return to normalcy campaign .
Roosevelt of course managed to return to the national arena .
However , it took him 12 years to get back onto the stage .
And to do it , he had to serve four years as Governor of New York , by far the largest state in the nation and a real swing state at the time .
He also had the benefit of his famous name and deep family connections .
That 's it though .
None of the other losing VP candidates have ever gotten close to the White House .
Many of them have gone on to distinguished careers .
Usually though , when they were tapped as running mate , they already held prestigious position of power .
That was why they were named to the ticket in the first place .
Many , especially the Democrats , were well - known Senators who kept their current elective office , and continued to make a mark in Washington .
But Palin , after a mere two years as Governor of one of the least populated states in the country , may be staring down at a different history .
Many of the losing running mates have discovered that the country is not kind to a loser .
Some of the failed VPs , like Joe Lieberman , Edmund Muskie and John Edwards , made disappointing bids for the presidency in the next election .
Others never succeeded in capturing elective or appointive office again , like Dan Quayle , Jack Kemp or Geraldine Ferraro .
Worse still is the path of William E. Miller , Barry Goldwater 's second in his crushing 1964 defeat .
Not only did Miller , a little known conservative upstate New York Congressman , never gain public office again , he actually starred in American Express commercials a decade after his losing run , asking " Do You Know Me ? "
Few did .
Palin may be trying to lay the ground work for 2012 , but she should realize history 's cruel lesson -- building a campaign based on a losing vice presidential run is a weak place to start .

Russian regulators will not let Google buy a local online advertising company , halting a $ 140 million deal agreed to in July .
Google planned to acquire Zao Begun , which has a search and contextual video and text advertising business .
Begun is owned by Rambler Media , a Russian company that own various Web sites and runs a search engine .
Google said it is reviewing the decision of Russia 's Federal Antimonopoly Service ( FAS ) and has n't decided how to react .
" We are very disappointed to hear that FAS has come to this decision , " Google said in a statement .
" We strongly believe that this acquisition will enable us to significantly improve opportunities for Russian users , advertisers and publishers as well as the entire industry . "
Google 's plans to grow its online advertising business , which comprises nearly all of the company 's revenue , has run into other obstacles with regulators .
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating a plan for Yahoo to show Google search ads .
That deal formed as Yahoo was under intense pressure earlier this year as Microsoft tried to acquire the company .
Yahoo and Google planned to start the program this month , but it has been delayed pending the DOJ review .
Critics say it could drive up the costs of advertising and also gives the two companies too much control over the online advertising market .
Google has said ads are purchased by auction , and neither company sets prices .
The rejection of the deal in Russia underscores the difficulty Google is having in some markets .
While it dominates search in Western countries , Google faces strong competition from local search engines in places such as South Korea , China and Russia .
Google picked a strong partner in Russia : Begun runs a network with 40,000 advertisers covering 143,000 Russian - language Web sites .
When the deal was announced , Rambler also signed an additional agreement to use Google 's AdSense technology on its main portal .
Efforts to reach Rambler Media were unsuccessful .

Voters definitively beat back anti-choice ballot initiatives on November 4 , but opponents of legal abortion say they 'll be back for another round .
What can women 's health advocates do to build up support before the next round of attacks ?
The night of Tuesday , November 4 , 2008 , was a night of solid
victories against anti-choice ballot measures around the country .
In
Colorado , voters beat back the country ’s first " egg-as- a- person " ballot
proposal .
California ’s electorate vetoed parental notification measures for the
third time , and South Dakota beat back a second abortion ban .
For women ’s health advocates celebrating
success against these restrictive measures , there is reason to be cautiously
optimistic that their message may have really sunk in : Americans are loath to
pull the lever in favor of limiting women ’s autonomy .
But even after decisive defeats , Bloomberg News
reports that anti-choicers in all three states threaten
a new round , hoping if not to achieve victory , then to distract reproductive health advocates and
keep the issue in the public eye .
As one Colorado anti-choice activist put it , " Our
goal is to increase the social tension over abortion . ”
And so reproductive justice
activists are prepared for the next cycle , should it be necessary .
They hope
that blue - ing demographics and youth engagement will help their
cause in the long term .
They are also eager to use a prevention and
reproductive justice framework to go on a peaceful offensive , challenging their
opponents to find common ground in reducing unintended pregnancies .
It ’s a
philosophy in keeping with a new administration whose modus operandi is reducing social tension over the issue
of abortion .
COLORADO : Definition of Personhood Voted Down
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .
SUBSCRIBE
Amendment 48 , in Colorado , was the
first of its kind : an attempt to codify the rights of a fertilized egg ,
" defining the term ‘ person ’ to include any human being from the moment of
fertilization as ‘ person . ’ "
Because of the extreme nature of
this measure , it racked up opponents from Planned Parenthood to Republicans for
Choice , all of whom pointed out that it could threaten many kinds of birth
control as well as banning all abortion .
Anti-choice politicians in Colorado
refused to endorse the measure .
In an editorial against the measure , which it
called " an inane flight of fancy , " The Denver Post editorial board pointed out :
If made into law ,
Amendment 48 could allow a man to sue a woman with whom he had conceived for
wrongful death of his fertilized egg .
It could subject a woman who had
miscarried to charges of negligent homicide .
As Colorado went " blue , " voters delivered a handy defeat to
Amendment 48 , 74 to 26 percent .
Sarah Fong , from the No on 48 campaign , said
she did n’t anticipate those numbers moving drastically , " unless the political
climate really swings back to red in Colorado .
It ’s a bona fide blue state now . "
But she said that although the campaign was pleased with the
perceived climate shift and is eager to spend the interim helping Colorado women ,
reproductive health activists were fully prepared to face down another measure in 2010 .
Indeed , Bloomberg quoted Bob Enyart , from Colorado Right to
Life , as saying " they ’ll be back in 2010 . "
Fong said she could imagine
Kristi Burton , the young woman who co-wrote the amendment , becoming a
" poster child " for the personhood movement , which hopes to expand its reach
beyond Colorado with Personhood
USA , a new national organization aiming to put personhood amendments on all states with a citizen - initiated constitutional amendment process .
CALIFORNIA : Rejecting " Draconian " Notification
In California , voters defeated a
parental notification law for teens
obtaining abortions , for the third time in four years , this time 52 - to - 48 .
As Emily Douglas reported
last Tuesday night , James Holman and Sonoma winemaker Don Sebastiani , two
well - to - do Californians who financed the last three measure , have shown no sign
of abating in the past and are already talking about a fourth swing .
" We almost feel an obligation to
go forward , " Proposition 4 spokesman Albin Rhomberg told
insidebayarea.com on Thursday .
The parental notification law , if
it had passed , would be " more draconian than any law in any state , " says President
and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California Kathy Kneer .
" They have
already indicated that they ’re coming back for a fourth round .
It ’s a 3,000 word
constitutional amendment , but they keep 2700 words exactly the same and try to find a way to make it look new and
improved , " she said .
She added on this issue , the challenge pro-choicers faced
was explaining to parents that defeating Proposition 4 was not a defeat of parental
involvement , but a measure of protection for vulnerable young women without
trusted adults in their lives .
Kneer said that young voters
helped defeat Proposition 4 , and that Planned Parenthood and its allies had
developed an excellent grassroots infrastructure that she hoped could be used
for further outreach .
SOUTH DAKOTA : Staring Down a Ban
In the entire state of South
Dakota , there is only one abortion clinic .
So it ’s not a far leap to conclude that the proponents
of a ban , including Abstinence Clearinghouse founder Lelsee Unruh , were more
interested in an ideological battle than in drastically reducing the number of
abortions .
Still , a ban is a ban , and a
coalition of family planning advocates , the SD Campaign for Healthy Families ,
worked tirelessly to fight the measure on behalf of South Dakota ’s women .
And in the end ,
South Dakota voters defeated an abortion ban there for the second time , even though this time the ban had nebulous
health and rape / incest exceptions in its language .
The margin was even wider
this time around — a solid 10 point victory in one of the reddest states in the
union .
" We were confident , leading up to
election , that the people of South Dakota
would n’t want the government intruding , and that women and families decide these matters best , " said
Kathi DiNicola , director of media relations for Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota , North Dakota , and South Dakota .
Unruh , for her part , has made it abundantly clear
again that coming back for a third round is her plan , telling Bloomberg : " This
time , I ’m here to stay . ”
But DiNicola says that serving the
women of South Dakota is Planned Parenthood ’s number one priority , and the best
way to combat ideological attacks from the other side .
" We support common sense
public policy to prevent unintended pregnancies and bring real solutions to the
table , " she said .
Indeed , on all fronts , reproductive health advocates are eager to return to the daily work of ensuring maximum access to health care
for women .
Fong , Kneer and DiNicola all feel that that focusing on the issue of
prevention of unintended pregnancies and affordable healthcare–as well as safe ,
legal abortion–is both the core of their mission and has the added bonus of
being a preemptive offense against the next slate of restrictive ballot
measures .
After all , pointing out the wastefulness of campaigns to ban abortion
when all those resources could be used to actually prevent unintended
pregnancy is not only good policy , it ’s also good PR .
And it sounds a lot like
the approach President Obama is taking .
Dopo mesi , anni , eoni di silenzio torna la rubrica SATIRICA che vi spiega cosa significa vivere per un ’intera settimana nei panni della nostra nazione , ma condensato in poche righe .
E a ‘ sto giro , pure senza mani !
( Tanto lo so che sottolineare e grassettare satirica non servirà , ma almeno ci ho provato ! )
LUNEDI – Preoccupatissimo dal crollo di Forza Italia nei sondaggi , ma soprattutto desideroso di ricominciare comizi in giro per l’Italia nella speranza di poter fare una bunga bunga veloce in un attimo di distrazione della badant Pascale , Silvio Berlusconi sgancia la bomba e decide di far cadere anche il governo Renzi .
Sconcerto del Pd : “ Ma come , aveva detto di no ! ” .
Così sul voto al Senato si sfascia il governo , che cambia finalmente verso e se ne torna a casa .
La reazione pacatissima di Napolitano è imitare un famoso gesto di Beppe Grillo
nominare Presidente della Repubblica in pectore il Siri del suo iPhone e darsi alle danze caraibiche in pensione .
L’Italia è dunque finalmente allo sbando .
MARTED ì – Matteo Renzi sale al Quirinale per cercare di convincere Siri a ri-nominarlo presidente , ma quello risponde
Come se fosse Antani ?
distruggendo ogni speranza del povero fiorentino .
Saranno quindi libere elezioni , finalmente , a decidere del futuro di questa nostra nazione allo sbando .
Il fermento fra i politici è grande : Casini tenta di fondare un partito con Siri , ma quello gli risponde “ Col cazzo ” .
Silvio Berlusconi , felicissimo , programma comizi in Brasile e a Cuba , dove notoriamente girano dei culi da paura .
Intanto nel
Pd è panico : bruciato il segretario , chi sarà il leader a cui lasciare l’arduo compito di perdere anche queste elezioni ?
Bepppe Grillo , nella sede della Casaleggio Associati , lucida i vaffanculo .
MERCOLED ì – Sulla pagina Facebook di Beppe Grillo parte il primo attacco del nuovo scenario apocalittico - elettorale :
CLAMOROSO !!!
Guarda cosa abbiamo scoperto io e Casaleggio su Berlusconi !
NON PUO CAPIRE !
FAI GIRARE O MORIRAI FRA SETTE GIORNI !
Nell ’articolo l’agghiacciante verità : una volta davanti a Berlusconi è passata una figa e lui non ha fatto nemmeno una battuta sessuale .
E’ sconcerto fra gli elettori di Forza Italia , che cola a picco nei sondaggi .
Nella sede del
Pd , intanto , continuano senza sosta i provini per il nuovo leader : chi può essere più decisionista di Renzi ?
Chi sarà l’uomo del cambiamento ?
Bocciata la mozione Pertini per impossibilità di comunicazione tramite medium ( secondo rumors di stampa , lo spirito di Pertini avrebbe sonoramente mandato affanculo la direzione durante i primi due minuti di collegamento ) , si cerca di convincere Prodi all ’ennesimo ritorno in campo , ma la sua serafica risposta sono 101 gesti dell ’ombrello .
Siri intanto è alle prese con i primi problemi da Presidente : obbligato a ricevere una delegazione grillina , fa fatica a tradurre il loro idioma in italiano e non fa che ripetere
Queste scuole elementari mi sembrano abbastanza vicine alla tua posizione
Vengono registrati decine di post sui profili grillini che denunciano il sordido complotto di Siri : erano tutte scuole private !
1!
Anche Siri è kasta!1 !
GIOVEDI – Il Pd ha finalmente deciso : il suo leader sarà quello che prenderà più voti eccetto i leader di tutti gli altri .
Una soluzione che mette d’accordo la direzione , i deputati , i senatori ma soprattutto gli elettori del Pd , che sperano nella casualità per avere finalmente una degna rappresentanza .
“ E’ l’atto più intelligente mai fatto dal partito ” commenta un vecchietto fuori dalla sede di Via dei Giubbonari .
Continua la guerra dei grillini a Siri :
INCREDIBILE ! LO HA FATTO PROPRIO SIRI !!!
NON PUOI CAPIRE !
SE NON FAI GIRARE T’AMMAZZO LA NONNA !
Recita un post sulla fanpage di Grillo , accompagnato dalla foto della Madia che sembra baciare la Boschi , solo che al posto del volto della Madia c’è incollata Siri ( oh , in tre giorni non si poteva far di meglio con photoshop raga , accontentatevi )
All ’interno dell ’articolo , quella volta che Siri consigliò un commercialista in odore di mafia .
Senza contare che essendo Siri un prodotto
Apple , è figlio dei poteri forti all ’ennesima potenza .
Pronta la crociata dei commentatori contro la “ segretaria elettronica ” : “ Siri dimmerda !
Solo a prendere cazzi sei brava ! ! ”
“ Siri bocchinara ! ” “ Ti bruciamo la batteria ! ” alcune delle critiche politico.
sociali mosse al programmino .
La risposta di Siri arriva in serata con un comunicato del Quirinale
“ Ho trovato 12 psichiatri che mi sembrano abbastanza vicini alla vostra posizione .
Ma chiamateli però .
Anche tutti e 12 ” .
VENERDI – Finalmente si vota .
Non c’è un singolo italiano che non abbia ricevuto almeno 5034687 messaggi su Facebook da parte di chiunque per essere strattonato da una parte o l’altra .
Beppe Grillo lancia la sua chiamata alle armi sui social
BRUTTO STRONZO DI MERDA !
GUARDA CHE STA SUCCEDENDO !
SE NON LEGGI E FAI GIRARE , TI STACCO LE PALLE A MORSI !
Ma i grillini sono così presi a commentare il post attaccando la kasta , denunciando le scie chimiche e propagandando le proprie pagine di informazione alternativa 5 stelle da dimenticarsi di andare a votare , anche perché Beppe non gli ha mandato la mail per ricordarglielo ( complotto ? )
Mai così sereni , quelli del
Pd attendono i risultati con una nuova consapevolezza : perdere senza avere un leader che perde fa decisamente meglio per le coronarie .
“ E’ meglio Scanzi ” risponde Siri ad Alessandro Di Battista , che le aveva chiesto di quantificare quanto fosse bellissimo .
Per la disperazione il grillino si deturpa il volto scrivendoci “ Scanzi merda ” con un uniposca indelebile .
Scanzi lo accusa di aver copiato l’idea da un suo libro del ’93 .
SABATO – Clamoroso il risultato delle elezioni : il M5S non supera il 4 % , Forza Italia il 2 , Casini è ancora nell ’angolino che piange perché Siri gli ha risposto male e Caltagirone ‘ sto mese non gli ha dato la paghetta ma soprattutto , a sorpresa , a prendere il 90 % dei voti è W LA FIGA MA ANCHE IL SEDERE NON CI FA SCHIFO , subito acclamati – giacché leader di nessun partito – a capo del Pd. Incredibilmente il Pd vince e incredibilmente per una volta l’Italia è esattamente rappresentata .
Lo sconcerto esplode nelle prime pagine dei giornali del mondo , mentre Beppe Grillo scrive un ficcantissimo post per la prima volta pieno di contenuti incredibili e rivelazioni scottantissime sulla kasta della figa e dei sederi , ma i social media manager sbagliano a postare e invece di scrivere
ORA BASTA !!!!!!!!!
GUARDATE FIGA E SEDERE COSA HANNO FATTO LO HA SCOPERTO BEPPE GRILLO !
FAI GIRARE O TI MUORE IL GATTYNO !
scrivono
ORA BASTA !
GUARDATE BEPPE GRILLO COSA HA FATTO !
LO HA SCOPERTO IL GATTYNO !
FAI GIRARE O TI MUORE IL SEDERE !
Ai grillini che arrivano a leggere fino alla fine del post ( il 6 % secondo le ultime stime ) esplode il cervello dopo l’acuto sforzo di amare e odiare Beppe Grillo nello stesso tempo , mentre il rimanente 94 % accetta serenamente il tutto e acclama il gattyno come nuovo capo politico del MoVimento .
As harrowing as the U.S. stock market 's plunges have been in recent weeks , they 've yet to be been enough to trigger the " circuit breaker " , or trading halt , mechanisms that result in an automatic timeout in trading .
The Big Board implemented the automatic halts after the stock market crashed in October 1987 to force traders to take a break from frenzied selling .
The Dow Jones industrial average would have to fall 1,100 points in a day to trigger the first halt .
If that decline is reached before 2 p.m. , the market will shut down for an hour .
If the threshold is breached between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. , the halt will last 30 minutes .
No trading stops would take place if the plunge occurs after 2:30 p.m .
If the index were to fall 2,200 points before 1 p.m. , the market would close for two hours .
If such a decline took place between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. , there would be a one - hour pause .
The market would close for the day if stocks sank to that level after 2 p.m .
In the event of a 3,350 - point decline , the market would close for the day , regardless of the time .
The thresholds are computed at the beginning of each quarter to establish a specific point value for the quarter .
The 1,100 - point drop represented a 10 percent decline at that time ; the 2,200 level , a 20 percent drop and the 3,350 level is a 30 percent drop .
The rules would halt trading on the major securities and futures exchanges in a coordinated cross -market halt if the circuit breaker is enacted .
The last time the markets were shut down was during the 9/11 period .
This guy 's taken a jail - broken iPhone and hacked it by wiring it up to a genuine physical keyboard that 's about as big as the phone itself .
Yes ... it 's clever .
But nononono : the beauty of the iPhone is its slender slippery sleekness , and I 've found myself speeding up to darn fast text - entry rates using the virtual keyboard .
This mod is like strapping a paddlewheel to a dolphin : bulky , old - fashioned and unnecessary .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( Reuters ) - Nearly 2 million acres of U.S. federal land in southwestern Alaska best known for its rich salmon runs and abundant wildlife will be available for development under a new management plan released on Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management .
The management plan covers up to 1.9 million acres of mostly flat terrain near Bristol Bay and adjacent Goodnews Bay that , up to now , had been off - limits to development .
Mining giant Anglo American and Vancouver - based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd are proposing to build a huge copper , gold and molybdenum mine -- the Pebble project -- on state land in the region .
The Pebble project has drawn fierce opposition for the potential damage it may cause to Bristol Bay salmon runs , the world ’s largest .
At the same time , the Bush administration and Alaska state government are advocating offshore oil and gas development near Bristol Bay .
Gary Reimer , manager for the BLM ’s Anchorage district , said the new plan establishes a framework for permits and regulations should any development be proposed , but that it is unlikely that the BLM land in the management plan will be the site of any major new development .
“ Do we believe this would lead to anything of any size ?
No , ” Reimer said .
“ Of the 1.9 million ( acre ) area , there is very little mineral potential . ”
Environmentalists disagree and characterize the new plan as part of a strategy to open up the entire area to mining and drilling .
Fishing and Native groups have also fought the new plan since it was proposed in draft form a year ago .
Jeremiah Millen , field representative for the Alaska Wilderness League , disputed the idea that the BLM land will not attract developers , saying that the agency used outdated economic data in its analysis and underestimated the lure of the minerals and petroleum resources .
“ You can guarantee that , by opening an additional almost 2 million acres out there , there will be a rush to development , ” said Millen , noting that the plan does not provide specific protections to salmon habitat and fishing - dependent communities .
When work on the land - management plan started in 2004 , the area under study covered 3.6 million acres , but some of the land was transferred into state ownership or into the hands of various Alaska Native corporations , according to the BLM .
More such conveyances are expected and could whittle the total area of BLM - controlled land in the region to 1.5 million acres , the agency said .
Paris Hilton is single again .
A few days ago socialite Paris broke up with her boyfriend Benji Madden .
Their relationship lasted for over nine months – a new record relationship length for Paris .
Some rumors say that Hilton is extremely upset about the break - up but the two have absolutely different goals in life .
On November 15th Paris was spotted at the night club Mokai in Miami where she was openly flirting with her old flame – Greek heir Stavros Niarchos .
Yet , Paris ’ friends see nothing warning about that night saying that the two share solely friendly relationship .
They also believe that Madden ’s temper was the reason for the recent break - up and say that Paris did not like that Benji was continuously telling her what to do .
They think that Paris could no longer cope with his habit of taking commander ’s role in their relationship ; it was putting on her a lot of pressure .
Hilton ’s friends also noted that Benji can be quite aggressive at times and that being with him is not an easy task .
Well , we almost started to get the idea that Paris could slowly turn into god-fearing and law - abiding Mrs. Madden .

October 29 , 2008 : Hug a baby
Instructions for properly hugging a baby :
1. First , uh , find a baby
2. Second , be sure that the object you found was indeed a baby by employing classic sniffing techniques .
3 . Next you will need to flatten the baby before actually beginning the hugging process .
4 . The ' paw slide ' simply slide paws around baby and prepare for possible close - up .
5 . Finally , if a camera is present , you will need to execute the difficult and patented 'hug ,
smile , and lean ' so as to achieve the best photo quality .

This is fairly disappointing non-answer answer from Al Gore to the question “ Do you think the U.S. will ever be ready for an atheist president ? ”
He means to say : “ No , we wo n’t be seeing an openly atheistic person in the White House anytime in the near future . ”
Glad I could clear that up .
Why bother with all that nuance and not offer a clear , honest answer …

" My whole body will seize and stiffen , causing me to fall over like a dead - weight .
It can be very dangerous - one year I fell over and banged my head when a firework went off and had to go to hospital and have stitches . "
It 's been nearly a month since the strains of the 175th Oktoberfest died down , but the reasons to celebrate live on .
Behind the scenes at the Auswärtiges Amt ( Foreign Office ) , the diplomats are toasting freedom — not with beer , but Open Source software .
The German Government — at all levels — has been a leader in adopting Open Source software for quite some time .
The Bundesministerium des Innern ( Ministry of the Interior ) partnered with IBM to offer Linux systems to security forces in 2002 , while in 2005 , the state of Lower Saxony loaded up Red Hat Enterprise Linux to the tune of 11,000 boxen .
The City of Munich opted to take its systems out of the proprietary loop in 2003 , and despite delays , began its implementation in 2006 .
Now the Foreign Ministry 's former IT head , Rolf Schuster — now a diplomat at the German Embassy in Madrid — reveals that the Foreign Ministry has rolled out Linux desktops to half of the 230 German consulates and embassies worldwide , and that it plans to have the remaining sites converted by mid-2009 .
A grand total of 11,000 desktops are involved in the switch , which has been ongoing since 2004 — the move came after a three - year transition of back - end systems to Open Source software was successfully completed .
Schuster said that the reduction in cost — a 66 % savings over the average for other ministries — was the primary motivation for the change , though other agencies have cited increased security as a prime selling point .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the greatest difficulty in the implementation was the proverbial " problem between keyboard and chair " : convincing the Ministry 's 200 IT workers that the change made sense .
Apparently , though , a swift sashay through Linux and Apache was all it took to bring them on board .
A comparison of C++ concepts and Haskell type classes Paper i proceeding , 2008
Earlier studies have introduced a list of high - level evaluation criteria to assess how well a language supports generic programming .
Since each language that meets all criteria is considered generic , those criteria are not fine - grained enough to differentiate between two languages for generic programming .
We refine these criteria into a taxonomy that captures differences between type classes in Haskell and concepts in C++ , and discuss which differences are incidental and which ones are due to other language features .
The taxonomy allows for an improved understanding of language support for generic programming , and the comparison is useful for the ongoing discussions among language designers and users of both languages .
Enlarge By Lorie Jewell , Reuters Gen. David H. Petraeus heads to a Blackhawk helicopter with Barack Obama at Baghdad International Airport July 21 .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Democrat Barack Obama 's presidential campaign is encouraging state elections officials to ensure that all military personnel serving away from home are able to vote , after a Virginia law threatened to toss some absentee ballots aside .
Each state has its own rules for absentee voting , often used by troops away on duty .
Obama campaign attorney Robert Bauer sent letters to every secretary of state in the country , asking them to take " all steps necessary to make sure that our military voters can vote and that those votes are counted . "
A 2002 Virginia law aimed at eliminating fraud requires that absentee voters in some cases fill our their ballot with the signature and address of a witness .
The registrar in at least one county had said he got dozens of ballots without the witness addresses and would have to cast them aside under the law .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain highlighted the issue in press statements , sparking outrage among people who said it would disenfranchise the military .
Virginia 's attorney general stepped in Monday and said all the ballots must be counted under federal law , which trumps the state law .
Federal law does not require the address of a witness to be included .
" In at least one state , there has been some question about whether state law limits this federal right , " Bauer wrote , in what the campaign said was a reference to Virginia .
" There should be no question about this matter . "

DEBT is out ; cash is in .
Financial institutions are finding it hard to borrow from anyone but the state — and they are reluctant to lend to anyone else .
Firms , aware that credit is drying up , are striving to raise cash .
They have already run down their inventories and are trimming investment and jobs .
Householders whose homes are worth less than their mortgages must save hard to reduce their debts .
Those that cannot service their mortgages will default , causing more trouble for banks and , via lower house prices , other homeowners .
Just a few months ago , the main worry of policymakers in many economies was whether , as the prices of oil and other commodities shot up , they could contain inflation .
But the flight from debt and the dash for cash , inelegantly called “ deleveraging ” , means a bludgeoning for demand .
Now central banks and governments are facing a new set of questions .
First , can they stop deleveraging from gaining momentum and wrecking their economies ?
And second , will the tools of conventional macroeconomic policy — cutting interest rates , lowering taxes and increasing public spending — be enough ?
The standard response to a demand shock is to use monetary policy : cut interest rates and increase the money supply .
Lower interest rates spur spending by making saving less rewarding .
Banks able to borrow more cash at lower cost from the central bank will usually offer more and cheaper loans to firms and households , to pay for new equipment , buildings and consumer goods , or to cover running costs .
Central banks are powerful because they control the “ monetary base ” .
This comprises the notes and coins in wallets , purses , petty - cash trays and tills , plus the cash reserves that commercial banks hold with the central bank .
When interest rates are cut , the cost of holding money goes down ; and more money in circulation means more spending .
A boost to bank reserves has a less direct , but usually larger effect .
Just as individuals carry cash to cover incidental spending , banks hold reserves to cover cash withdrawals , cheque payments and bank transfers .
So bank reserves matter because they are the foundation for other , “ broader ” kinds of money — current ( checking ) accounts , interest - bearing deposits and so on .
Because most deposits lie fallow on any one day , banks are safe in holding only a fraction of them in reserve .
The ratio of broad to base money is known as the “ money multiplier ” .
The banks are the conduit between central - bank policy and the wider economy .
The trouble is , the conduit is blocked .
Despite deep cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve , including one this week ( see article ) , the cost of bank credit for American firms and households has not dropped by much .
Investors are wary of lending to banks for even a few months , because of the risk that they may go bust or run out of cash .
Banks are loth to lend to each other for the same reason ( and fear of their own demise is leading them to hoard cash ) .
The spread between what banks pay for overnight central - bank cash and what they pay to borrow for three months is therefore far above pre-crisis levels .
The latter rate is the reference point for loans to customers .
Illustration by James Fryer
One route around this blockage is for central banks to lend directly to firms by purchasing their short - term debt at fixed rates , as the Fed started to do this week .
A drawback , however , is that it essentially turns the central bank into a commercial bank , exposing the taxpayer to lending risk .
And the fix helps only big firms .
The monetary base in big economies has been swollen by lots of liquidity from central banks .
In the euro area , for instance , it has grown by one - third since the eve of the crisis in August 2007 , even though interest rates are barely lower now than then .
Most of the increase is accounted for by a doubling of bank reserves .
Some fear that such a rapid expansion of the monetary base will stoke inflation , which is still above 5 % in America and Britain and 3.6 % in the euro area .
If the ratio of broad to base money were constant , such fears would be warranted .
But because banks are using central - bank liquidity to plug holes in their short - term funding , the money multiplier is collapsing : even as reserves swell , broad - money and credit growth is wilting .
In the year to September bank lending to British households rose by only 0.9 % .
Mortgage lending fell .
If money is not circulating , but is stashed in reserves or under mattresses , it cannot boost spending or push up inflation .
Indeed , if scared banks , firms and households cling more tightly to cash rather than lend it or spend it , the downturn will deepen .
The more confidence weakens and asset prices fall , the more eager is the rush into cash .
At the extreme , the demand for cash is so strong than not even interest rates at zero can get the economy moving .
When standard monetary - policy responses reach their limit , fiscal options , such as cutting taxes and increasing public spending , come into play .
To some extent , government budgets in rich countries stabilise the economy automatically in booms and busts .
When the economy slows and jobs are shed , the state spends more on unemployment benefits , helping to support aggregate demand .
At the same time , tax receipts shrink faster than GDP : this hurts public finances in recessions but helps ease the pain for firms and their employees .
The power of these automatic stabilisers is greater in Europe , where state benefits are more generous and the tax take higher , than in America .
The use of fiscal policy to fine - tune the business cycle in any more than this passive way went out of fashion around 30 years ago .
Policymakers have since preferred to tweak aggregate demand via interest rates rather than taxes .
One reason is that although it may be easy to increase public spending in bad times it is hard to reduce it when the economy revives .
Tax cuts might be saved , or spent on imports .
And continued budget deficits harm private enterprise by soaking up savings , pushing up interest rates and “ crowding out ” private investment .
But when skittish banks and investors are turning away from funding private spending , there is a strong case for a more active fiscal policy to prop up demand .
The dash into safe assets has cut the cost of public borrowing for most rich countries ( see chart 1 ) .
Low bond yields may be a market signal to “ crowd in ” public spending .
A well - judged budgetary stimulus would help fill the shortfall in demand while debt - laden firms and consumers get their finances in order .
It may prevent a recession from turning into a rout .
A good package would minimise the drawbacks of fiscal policy : a roadbuilding programme , for example , would cease on completion ; tax cuts could be aimed at the poor , who would be more likely to spend the extra cash than the rich .
However , fiscal policy has its limits .
A run of big budget deficits increases the risk that a government will default or repay its debts only by forcing its central banks to print money , creating inflation .
If public debt spirals upwards as the economy stagnates , investors will worry that future taxpayers will be unable to shoulder the burden .
Looser fiscal policy will stretch the public finances of countries that went into the downturn with big debts and budget deficits and have since had to fund bank bail - outs .
Markets could choke on the extra bond sales required to finance huge deficits , driving interest rates up and worsening the downturn .
They are not choking yet .
Financing government deficits is hard when investors are keen on rival uses for their money — such as companies ' shares and bonds .
In fact , investors are shying away from such assets .
The omens for business investment from recent company reports and confidence surveys are poor .
Job cuts , slumping asset prices and a worsening credit drought augur ill for consumer spending too .
If firms fear that others will cut back their spending , it will make them still more cautious .
The rot could easily feed on itself , leaving equipment and workers idle , and depressing tax revenues .
A pre-emptive fiscal stimulus may help prevent that — and shore up the government 's tax base .
If conventional monetary and fiscal policy fail , what then ?
Pessimists point to Japan 's travails as a lesson in how a deflating asset - price bubble and a vast overhang of debt can defeat all that monetary and fiscal policy can throw at it .
Since 1993 Japan 's economy has been kept afloat by heavy government borrowing : the average annual budget deficit since then has been more than 5 % of GDP .
The economy flowered after 2003 , thanks partly to a big intervention to weaken the exchange rate , but it is now close to recession again and threatened further by the rise of the yen .
Japan 's gross public debt has reached 180 % of GDP , according to the OECD ( see chart 2 ) .
The sobering lesson is that conventional policy may not prevent a prolonged deflationary slump .
This lesson has not been lost on policymakers .
The nuclear option , conceived in America but untried in Japan , is to finance public spending or tax cuts by printing money .
This requires the central bank to go along with the fiscal authorities ( which may prove easier in America than in Europe ) .
It could work like this : the government announces a tax rebate and issues bonds to finance it .
But instead of selling them to private investors , it lodges them with the central bank in exchange for a deposit .
It draws on this account to clear the cheques mailed to taxpayers .
This scheme is essentially the same as the proverbial “ helicopter drop ” of money , but with neater accounting and a less erratic distribution of cash .
It bypasses banks and money markets , and puts money directly into people 's pockets .
Monetising a slug of public debt in this way is bound to be inflationary .
But by this stage , inflation would be a blessing : an economy where conventional policy tools had failed would suffer from falling prices .
A burst of inflation would lift asset prices , ease the weight on debtors ( whose real burdens are increased by deflation ) and improve public finances .
Some central bankers will shudder at the thought .
Some , but not all .
Ben Bernanke , now the Fed chairman , recommended this course of action to Japan 's policymakers in 2003 ( when he was a Fed governor ) .
Indeed , he went further .
One way out of a slump , he argued , is for policymakers to commit themselves to a period of catch - up inflation , to break deflationary expectations and heal the wounds from past price falls .
If all else fails , it seems , the one sure way to secure solvency in the private and public sectors is to inflate away debts and buoy up asset prices .
That nuclear option is the ultimate bail - out : rescuing the indebted by hurting those with savings .
In essence , if not degree , it is not so different from conventional policy .
Interest - rate cuts are a salve for debtors and a penalty on savers .
Fiscal - stimulus schemes impose a cost on all taxpayers , even those well placed to endure a downturn .
But the cost of a prolonged slump , in terms of idle resources , lost income , decaying skills and an erosion in the trust that keeps civil society going , would be far higher .

More of the detailed info for the text descriptions of the depression scrip notes has been updated .
Here 's the latest list of states I 've updated :
Oklahoma Texas Oregon California Tennessee Minnesota Wisconsin Iowa Alabama Georgia Florida South Carolina North Carolina Maine
One of the things I did n't realize was the $ 1 Enterprise Oregon note pictured on this site is unique .
I always thought it was the common series D. But it 's actually Series B which was reported as a planned issue , but never created .
Well , that 's changed now .
Amazing the number of details that are still not known about depression scrip to this day .
That just makes collecting all that more fun .
I also created a District of Columbia page .
Why I never created one originally , I do n't konw .
It was the only state not listed .
Thanks for pointing that out John .
Lastly I added more text descriptions to the Other Scrip page and added a couple more notes to the miscellaneous section .

Well , sorry for the lack of updates lately .
I know I 've told several people that I was going to make some major updates over the long holiday weekend .
But , unfortunately my Mother lost her battle with her heart problems just before Thanksgiving .
So , things have come to a halt while I deal with that .
I always knew it was true that you truely do n't appreciate what you have until it 's gone .
The old saying about living for today and not tomorrow is so true ...
But , things are starting to get back on track and now I need to find something to help occupy my time again .
I 've decided that my work on this website is now dedicated to the memory of my mother .
And after looking through alot of family pictures , I found my favorite one .
I 've added it to the About Me page .
I miss you Mom and I will think about you every day ...
11.25.2008

Lots of new things added this time around .
I 've added two new sections to the picture archive .
Food Stamps / Scrip and Modern Local Currency .
Both of which are sections I 've meant to add for some time now .
There 's not much there yet .
I will also be adding a very special piece of history to the Food Stamp section .
Starting in April of 1980 , Jerry Schmimmel use to publish the Food Stamp Change Newsletter .
There were 17 issues and 3 supplements published in all .
With Jerry 's permission , all of these rare newsletters will be posted on this site .
There 's lots of great info in there for the food stamp collector .
THANK YOU Jerry for sending me the missing newsletters for my collection and your permission to share them here with everyone .
Lots and lots of scrip is coming ...
I 've still been buying off and on .
I 've also come accross quite a few nice items and collections I 've purchased lately .
As I add them , I will announce them .
Also , as a side note .
I 'm not the best web page writer in the world .
So this site works very well with Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator .
But some of the newer browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefow have trouble displaying it as I intended .
Once I get some of the updates done , then I will start working on it to make it more compatible accross the board .
Other changes made : Added a whole new way of displaying images .
click on any note and see what I mean .
To get the picture to go away , click on the close link at the bottom right of the picture or click on the webpage , just off the edge of the picture .
Moved the Disney Dollars to the Modern Local Currency section I 've also added alot more descriptive text for each note as well Added a few more lines to the timeline as well as fixed some of the links I also added more the the About me page
And yes , I FINALLY added a FOR SALE page .
I did n't think I would ever offer a for sale page because I never intended to go that route .
I 'm strictly a collector at heart .
But , after several years , I have extra notes that I use for trading .
It 's about time I just offer them up for sale to help fund my collection and pass them on to other collectors .
Stay tuned for more changes coming ....
And yes , there are alot of broken links and missing pictures .
That will all get fixed in the next week or so .
Keep emailing me though when you see something not working right .
Even though I try to check everything when I make changes , I can still easily miss a link or two .
10.30.2008
YUP ... I 'm back !!!
Yes , I know - FINALLY .
It 's about time I update this website .
It 's been over a year .
I 've been collecting off and on , but just not adding it to the site .
So , I 'm finally in the process of making some major changes that I have intended to do for along time , just have n't done it .
Over the next few weeks , do n't be surprised if links do n't work off and on as well as pictures missing here and there .
I 'm also going to go back and rescan some of my first notes .
I did n't have the scanner settings just right when I first started so there 's some notes that definatley need to be scanned again .
So be patient , lots of great updates coming in the next few weeks .
Feel free to keep emailing me with any info or questions you have .
05.25.2007 - Part 1
Another large update to the site .
Sorry I have n't been updating the site like I should , but something else always seems to take up my time .
The ongoing hunt for depression money still takes high priority though .
I 'll never ignore that one .
I 've taken a shot at catching up from last summer so a lot more depression scrip has been added .
Here 's what 's been added with this update :
Nebraska - 2 New Jersey - 12 Ohio - 30 Washington - 11 Iowa - 2 Michigan - 87 Alabama - 2 California - 1 Georgia - 1 Idaho - 2 Illinois - 3 Massachusetts - 1 Maine - 2 New York - 3 Oklahoma - 1 South Dakota - 1 Tennessee - 1 Wisconsin - 10 Missouri - 1 Pennsylvania - 1 Kansas - 5 Wyoming - 1
That brings the Number of known issues in the picture archive to 782 .
I also added another note to the Panic of 1907 section .
The note from Harvey Illinois is courtesy of Neil Shafer and is very rare .
It 's also a very unique note .
It was originally issued as a $ 1 note and then redeemed and re-issued as a $ 0.25 cent note .
This is the only note issued like this known to date .
Thanks again Neil for letting me add this note to the website !
Thanks also goes to David Gladfelter for a wonderfull New Jersey collection trade .
There are so many New Jersey issues and David and I worked out a mutual trade to help each others New Jersey collections .
Thanks again David !
I 've also added a rare presentation set of the State of Wisconsin depression scrip .
Presentation notes had the serial numbers ending in the same two digits .
In this case , all four of the notes in the presentation set end in 41 .
05.25.2007 - Part 2
I 've added quite a few links to the links section .
Including several links for local currencies both past and present .
I 've also added 3 more documents to the letters webpage of the Memorabilia section .
One of the documents is the meeting minutes of Thomas A. Edison Inc. authorizing depression scrip to be issued .
It 's signed by the sons of Thomas Edison - Thomas Edison Jr. , and Charles Edison .
A very unique and rare piece of history .
Also , the Numismatic Bibliomania Society , through Wayne Homren , publishes a weekly Internet email magazine called the E - Sylum .
There 's a ton of great information from fellow numismatic collectors of all types in it .
And it comes in a convenient weekly email if you choose the batch option when subscribing .
All subscribers are welcome to ask any question on numismatics .
My question on food stamp tokens was answered in 24 hours .
Some of the most respected people in numismatics are part of this email list .
Where else can you get access to so much knowledge and helpfullness from so many people so easily ?
If you do n't subscribe to The E - Sylum , I strongly suggest you do .
Just tell Wayne that Rod from Depressionscrip.com sent you .
Lastly , I 've added another article to the References and Articles section .
This one is titled " Some Unlisted New Jersey Depression Scrip " by David D. Gladfelter , NLG .
It 's a brief but very informative article about some previously unknown New Jersey depression scrip .
07.12.2006
Just a minor update , I 've changed the Who Printed Depression Scrip section .
I 've also added thumbnails and re-wrote the page with a few more details .
I 've also added 14 ice signs to the coupon books picture archive .
Just scroll down the page and you will see them .
Lastly , I added the printing plate from Brantford , Ontario , Canada to the Memorbilia section .
This is still an unknown depression scrip note from the 1930's .
No actual notes have been found as of yet .
Thanks goes to Larry Wightman for giving me permission to publish pictures of the plate and letting us see a very rare piece of history .
06.05.2006
05.14.2006
Some more minor changes .
I 've updated all the color schemes on the pages so they all match now .
Too many years of making changes here and there to experiment .
I 've also changed all the City listings on each state page to a new format .
I think the new format is easier to read and easier to navigate .
The old format worked well when there were only a few cities listed for each page .
Now that my collection is crossing over the threshold from small to large , it was time for a change .
05.13.2006
I 've added a rare uncut sheet from Cleveland Ohio to the rare and unusual scrip section .
This sheet has two versions of the 10 ¢ and 20 ¢
Put Cleveland to Work Society , Inc. notes .
Uncut sheets other than Pleasantville , New Jersey are very rare .
05.12.2006
04.28.2006
I 've added 56 more depression scrip scans to the picture archive .
Texas - 9 Utah - 4 New Jersey - 31 Oregon - 1 Massachusetts - 1 New York - 10
Some of the hightlights include a very rare stamp scrip note from the Latter - Day Saints of Salt Lake City , Utah and a complete strip of Guardsman 's scrip from Astoria , Oregon .

03.19.2006
Just some minor updates .
I 've changed the banner at the top of the page .
I wanted to create something with a little more color to it .
I think that works .
I also added a few pictures above the menu on the left .
The biggest update is I added a Who Printed section .
It 's just getting started , but this helps to answer a couple of email questions I 've received as in what companies printed the many issues of depression scrip .
As I have more time , I will add comments about each of the companies .
Believe it or not , some of these companies are still in business today .
Other updates include additional minor text all over the site .
I 'm slowly getting around to adding comments , notes , etc ... to make it easier to understand what you 're seeing .
Not just a bunch of pictures .
More updates coming ...
03.18.2006
I 've added 26 more notes .
15 added to Illinois and 11 added to Indiana .
I have over 200 more notes scanned to be added to the site .
It 's just a matter of finding the time to cut and resize the scans and then write all the webpages for the notes .
I 'm going to try and add more this weekend .
Alot more work yet to go ...
03.13.2006
03.08.2006

I 've added a great article written by Loren Gatch titled - " This is not United States Currency " , Oklahoma 's Emergency Scrip Issues during the Banking Crisis of 1933 .
I highly recommend reading this article .
There 's a ton of great information about depression money of Oklahoma .
This article was obviously painstakingly researched and written in a very logical and chronological order .
Well done Loren and thanks for letting me add this to my website .
Thanks also go to Mary Ann Blochowiak from the Oklahoma Historical Society for giving me permission to reprint the article as well .
I 've also updated the Panic of 1907 section .
I 've added an introduction and brief history of this time period as well as more pictures of 1907 scrip .
This is not a normal area of collecting for me and therefore , I have a very limited personal collection for 1907 notes .
If anyone has any scrip from 1907 they 're willing to let me add to the picture archive , I 'm more than willing to give credit to the contributor (s ) .
Just send me a quick email of what you would like to add to the site .

Minor update to the site .
I added three rare notes to the state of Minnesota section as a request to a fellow collector .
I added a ten cent note from Rolling Prairie , $ 1 stamp scrip from St. Cloud and a $ 1 note from Saint Paul .
All three of these notes are previously unknown issues unless someone can show me otherwise .
Also , the Saint Paul note has some interesting writing on the back .

Sorry , I 've been neglecting my site for awhile .
My day job keeps me pretty busy and I travel for months at a time .
Kind of nice for a change of scenery , but it 's alot of work on the road and I 'm away from friends and family for long periods of time .
The best benefit is I 'm always lookng for a coin / currency show when I 'm traveling .
Sometimes I get the chance to take a few hours and go to a local show whereever I 'm at .
My day job gives me a chance to go to some shows I would n't otherwise get to see .
It has it 's good and bad points ...
Anyways ... I have 62 new notes scanned so far and about 200 more to scan .
Just as I 'm about to catch up on scanning , I hit the road and then add a bunch more notes to my collection .
I 'm not complaining though .
I 'm guessing I should be making another major update this weekend .
Stay tuned ....

Fixed some miscellanous links and text .
I 've also made the folowing changes :
Added a Panic of 1907 section - another forgotten time in history Combined the Canada and Germany sections into a single Canada / Europe depression money catagory Added a few more links to the links section Added a commemorative set to the Alaska page issued years ago Added a rare depression note to the Arizona section Added 5 more depression notes to the Alabama section Added 18 more depression notes to the California section
It 's about time I seperate out the 1907 notes from the 1933 notes .
I 've been debating about this for some time because I do n't have all that many in my collection .
If anyone has any 1907 notes they want to add to the picture archive , just email me .
Of course credit will be given to all who contribute .
I 've also started cleaning out all the miscellaneous notes and put them under the other scrip section where they belong .
When I first started this site , it was with a small collection and limited knowledge .
Now that I am more educated about what I collect , it 's time to clean up the site .
I 'm amazed at how large this webpage has become .
I am now over 3100 files and more than 600 directories .
Thanks to everyone who has helped me build this site over the last four years !!
10.16.2005
I just added another article to the references section .
It 's titled Ellwood City , Pennsylvania , Depression Scrip by Lawrence Korchnak .
It 's a great article about a very rare piece of depression money history .
Well worth reading this interesting article .
Also thanks to Wayne Homren from Numismatic Bibliomania Society for helping me get permission to reprint this article .

More updates ...
I fixed even more of the missing picture icons .
Thanks to everyone who emailed me letting me know of the missing pictures .
I also added photos of my uncut specimen sheets from Detroit , Michigan .
Take a look at the Rare and Unusual page .
I 've also redone the Links page .
I 've added a couple of new sections .
If you would like your webpage listed on my links page , just send me an email .
I 'm in the process of doing all the miscellaneous things to my site I 've wanted to do for some time .
Once alot of these " little " projects are done , I 'll get back to adding more notes to the site .
I have over 400 new notes that need to be scanned and added to the site .
Lots of rare notes , including some from Canada .
08.06.2005
I 've done more housekeeping on the site .
The majority of the missing picture icons have been fixed .
I still have a few more states to do yet .
I also fixed some broken links .
Also , I 've updated the Checklist page .
Now all 50 states are listed .
Keep in mind this page is very large .
It may take a minute or two to open depending on your connection speed to the internet .
There are 3216 listings on the page so it 's more than worth looking at .
The majority of this info was compiled by Ralph Mitchell and Neil Shafer .
My hat 's off to them for the incredible amount of work it must of taken to compile this list .
Now , for me , part of the fun is being able to add to the list previously unknown scrip .
Also , keep in mind that all pictures , text , everything on this website is copyrighted by me .
You can not use anything from this website , including the HTML code without my permission .
If you want to use a picture for an article or something , just send me a quick email .
I 'm easy to get along with .
More updates coming soon ...
06.26.2005
Yes , I 've been ignoring this website and my email for quite some time .
I 've been very busy with work among other things .
Of course , who is n't ?
I did take a brief break from collecting .
A good friend and very important source to my depression money passed away in February .
A very large wealth of knowledge passed away with him .
Tom was very quiet , but you could see the deep wisdom and knowledge in his eyes .
I always enjoyed talking to him because he always had something new to tell me about depression money .
After I got interested in depression money , Tom is the person that set my intersts into concrete .
He opened my eyes to a whole part of history that I never knew existed .
He inspired me to research more and start a collection .
Some of my first notes are from Tom .
That , in turn , lead to this website .
So now I can share the notes and information that has made depression money interesting to me .
Tom will be greatly missed by me and all who knew him .
Rest in peace Tom .
After taking over a year off , I 'm now actively collecting again .
I have at least 400 new notes to add to this website .
Just in the past few weeks I 've bought over 600 new notes .
Some duplicates , but I can't resist a depression note .
So watch this website .
I 've started making subtle changes here and there and started adding pictures .
Plus there are even more plans in the works for buying even more depression money .
Ca n't wait - I LOVE depression money !!!
01.01.2004
I 'm in the process of uploading updates to the site over the next few days .
Do n't be surprised if you see some broken links here and there .
12.01.2003
Well , I have done a lot of scans .
I 'm alot closer to the " big " update .
I have alot of things back on track now .
I have also come to realize that I have way too many extra notes .
I hate to sell or trade them away , but it also helps make room for other notes .
Depression scrip is my passion .
But , I also enjoy helping others collect so , I 've decided to start selling off my extras on Ebay .
I also have tons of other things to get rid of , like the last of a coin collection , a stamp collection , and lots of other things stuffed away in the closet and everyone else .
Take a look at my user ID on Ebay - Depressionscrip - to see what I have up for auction .
If anyone has anything that they want to trade with me , just send me a quick email at rod@depressionscrip.com .
10.01.2003
Yup ... very little updates .
Funny how work and other things get in the way of fun .
What happened to the days of being a kid and having no responsibilities .
Oh well , I 'm slowly working on a major update to the site .
I 'm hoping to post it within a month or two .
I 'm so far behind , that it 's going to take a major effort to catch up .
Stay tuned ...
05.01.2003
Yes , I 'm still here .
I just never seem to have the time to work on this site .
I plan on getting some things organized so I can start spending more time on this site .
It has gotten well out of date compared to my collection .
For now , here 's a list of updates this time around :
Added to the Depression Scrip : an Annotated Bibliography by Loren Gatch in the References and Articles section .
Added more to the Checklist page .
Added some more entries on the Depression Era Timeline .
Added a Coupon Book Section .
Added a Cardboard Token Section .
Added a Sales Tax token Section .
Added a Wooden Nickel Section .
Just some general " house - keeping " throughout the site .
Added miscellaneous text all throughout the site .
12.01.2002
Changed the whole website to a frames page .
This makes it much eaiser for me to update the pages .
I also believe that I 'm coming closer to a webpage design that I like .
Added a Depression Era Timeline to the site .
Added more to the Checklist page .
Updated the letters page collected by and to B. J. Lazar .
All letters now online .
I 've also picked up another 50 + notes from a trade show and from numerous other sources .
They all still need to be scanned and added to the site yet .
I 've also started putting together a list of extra depression notes I have that I would be willing to use as trade
material for notes I do n't have .
Added miscellaneous text all over the place
And no , the NRA graphic at the top left of the page does not stand for National Rifle Association .
It stands for National Recovery Act .
This was a program implemented by President Roosevelt to help the nation out of the Depression era and get the economy back on track .
11.18.2002
Major update to the Checklist page .
I 'm about 60 % of the way through that list .
Lots of typing .
Do n't be surprised if that page takes a little bit to load up .
Even though it 's mostly text , it still takes some time to download .
Also started adding a few of the letters addressed to B. J. Lazaar .
Very interesting reading .
11.03.2002
Just some cleaning up and some menu changes .
Added the About page , the checklist page , other page and related interests pages .
Most of these are just links to under construction pages for future use .
The checklist page has a very small list up and running .
I did that so I could see what it would look like on the site .
Feedback is welcome as always .
Lots of new notes to scan and add .
10.28.2002
All up and running .
Let me know if you see any dead links or missing pictures .
10.27.2002
Whoops ... ran out of disk space for my site .
Some of the updates below are n't available yet .
I just have to send a request to my host and it should be fixed by tomorrow night .
SORRY ...
10.27.2002
Added another 67 examples :
California - 13 Iowa - 5 Illinois - 20 Rhode Island - 1 New York - 2 Wisconsin - 1 Missouri - 1 Pennsylvania - 5 Washington - 8 Michigan - 5 Ohio - 11
The link above is the only way to see the Rhode Island note .
Unfortunately my map gets a little small on that side to provide a clickable link .
One more thing on the list to fix eventually .
Lots of great new notes added .
There were quite a few stamp notes added which most people consider to be the better collectibles .
The best set I added was LaHarpe Illinois .
This is a previously unknown set of notes .
They are definately Illinois and not Washington state because one of the 2 cent notes is printed Bank of LaHarpe Illinois .
Some really great stuff !
I love this hobby !
10.20.2002
10.14.2002
Lots of updates coming slowly over the next few days .
I have 154 more pictures to add to the site .
Once they are all up , I 'll post a list of what states were updated .
Lots of good notes coming ... including a few rare ones .
I even found a set of play money that was posted each week in the newspaper in 1933 .
These are the actual notes cut from those newspapers .
How they survived all these years amazes me .
Lots of other good notes coming soon .
09.25.2002
All thumbnails now up and running .
Email me if you see any broken links .
I 'll be checking all links over the next few days .
09.24.2002
Major update .
All pages have been changed over to the thumbnail format .
Do n't be surprised if there are some dead links .
I have n't been able to check everything yet .
Also , the Michigan pages are not posted yet .
Only the thumbnail page is up .
I will get the rest of it done by tommorrow night .
Then I need to spend a few days cleaning up dead links and fixing little problems here and there .
Once that is all done , I can get back to the fun of scanning and adding pics and looking for more notes .
Ca n't wait ... almost there .
09.08.2002
Not much to say other than I 've been working on updating my site to the new format .
Lots of webpages to write .
I also have acquired a few more notes from various sources .
Ca n't wait for them to get here .
09.04.2002
I 've been looking at changing the way my site is displayed .
A friend pointed out that my site is not very friendly to someone on a dial - up modem .
So , to address that , I 've designed a new page .
Take a look HERE .
All links are active , so let me know what you think by sending me an email .
This is an example of a page when you click on a state .
I like it and I think that 's the layout I 'm going to change too .
09.02.2002
Added 31 more pics to Michigan .
Also added the Canada and the Europe pages .
09.01.2002
08.31.2002
Updated the following states : Alaska , Michigan , Ohio , and New Jersey .
Finally , they are all up and running .
Now I can get started on scanning in the new ones and posting those .
Still lots more to come ...
08.31.2002
Updated the following states : Kansas , Masachusetts , Minnesota , New York , North Dakota , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , West Virginia , Washington and Oregon .
The last 3 states , Michigan , Ohio and new Jersey are coming tommorrow .
Those are the 3 biggest collections I have .
Lots of work to get them online .
I also added the references and articles section and I 'm giving thought to adding a checklist of currently known scrip .
08.28.2002
Updated the following states : Florida , Georgia , Illinois , North Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , and Wisconsin .
08.26.2002
Updated the following states : Idaho , Colorado , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Montana , Nebraska , and Oklahoma .

Keep checking back ... lots more to come .
08.25.2002
Updated the following states : Missouri , Arizona , Alabama , and California .
08.25.2002
Well , things did n't go as planned this weekend .
I intended to get the majority of the picture archive up and running .
Instead , I have all the generic pages up .
Took longer than I thought to create all those pages .
Anyways , the picture archive will come online this week slowly .
08.21.2002
This is just a temporary page .
There are lots of things coming but there 's still alot of work to do .
The domain name is now up and running .
I 'm hoping to have the majority of the site up and running , including the picture archive within a week .
Check back after the weekend for a major update .
08.20.2002
Combat veterans , sexual assault survivors , and other victims of trauma are vulnerable to a condition called Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) .
People with PTSD suffer from a range of symptoms that interfere with their capacities to enjoy normal life .
People who suffered suicidal conditions , particularly conditions that were chronic , recurrent , or included one or more attempts , may also be victims of PTSD .
According to its definition , PTSD may result when a person suffers an event or situation that is outside the range of normal experience , exceeds the individuals perceived ability to meet its demands , and poses a serious threat to the loss of life .
Suicidal people meet the formal criteria for PTSD .
Severe and prolonged suicidal pain is not something that most people suffer .
People in suicidal crises feel that they are at the breaking point of what they can cope with .
Since 30,000 people die by suicide each year in the United States , it is a condition that poses a serious threat to the loss of life .
Many of us are haunted by memories of acute crises , acts of self - injury , or extended periods of severe depression .
Like citizens of a besieged city , we lived through periods of time in which we had a realistic and unrelenting fear that we would soon be dead .
We suffer PTSD simply from having been suicidal , independently of whatever particular traumas may have contributed to our becoming suicidal , such as abuse during childhood or exposure to the violent death of someone else .
Our suicide PTSD is also distinct from whatever traumatic events may happen as a result of being suicidal , such as involuntary hospitalization or job discrimination .
Undoubtedly , most of us suffered many types of traumatic events in our lives , and these events and their consequences need to be addressed in recovery .
But the suicidal crises themselves may be events that induce PTSD .
The PTSD literature for veterans and sex assault survivors lists conditions that are commonly found among survivors of those types of trauma .
Survivors typically have only some of these symptoms , and the severity of a particular symptom may vary from individual to individual .
Survivors of different types of traumatic events often have a different range of symptoms .
A remarkably large number of these conditions are common among people with long - term histories of suicidal pain : Problems with memory .
Persistent , intrusive , and vivid memories concerning the traumatic situation .
Events of daily life may trigger distressing memories related to the trauma .
Memory lapses for parts of the traumatic situation .
Many suicidal people are troubled by strong images , such as the feeling that they have bombs inside their bodies or a knife over their heads , and in recovery continue to be bothered by the memory of having had these images .
Avoidance of things associated with the traumatic experience .
Denial on the seriousness of the experience .
Persistent anxiety .
Fear that the traumatic situation will recur .
The trauma is often an event that shatters the survivors sense of invulnerability to harm .
Disturbed by the intrusiveness of violent impulses and thoughts .
Engagement in risk - taking behavior to produce adrenaline .
A feeling of being powerless over the traumatic event .
Anger and frustration over being powerless .
A feeling of being helpless about ones current condition .
Being dramatically and permanently changed by the experience .
A sense of unfairness .
Why did this happen to me ?
Holding oneself responsible for what happened .
Feeling guilty .
The use of self - blame to provide an illusion of control .
Sexual assault survivors often blame themselves :
If I hadnt been at that location , worn those clothes , behaved in that way , then it wouldnt have happened .
This pattern is also found in the survivors of a completed suicide .
If I had only done x , the suicide would not have happened , can be used to try to cope with the fear that suicide will happen again in the family - - i.e. , it is preventable if I just manage things differently .
The suicidal are often full of self - blame .
As in the other cases it is partly due to an internalization of social attitudes that blame the victim or family , and also due to the effort to gain mastery over the situation .
To imagine we could have done more is more tolerable than total helplessness .
An inability to experience the joys of life .
Feelings of being alienated from the other people and society in general .
I am different .
I am shameful .
If they knew what I was like , they would reject me .
I dont belong in this world .
Im a freak , an outcast .
When people with PTSD try to return to normal life , they are plagued by readjustment problems in the basic elements of life .
They have difficulties in relationships , in employment , and in having families .
A lack of caring attachments .
A sense of a lack of purpose and meaning .
Some chronically traumatized people lose the sense that they have a self at all .
Veterans report the feeling that they never really made it back from the war .
Formerly suicidal people feel they never really made it back to normal life .
One Viet Nam veteran with PTSD said , I dont have any friends and I am pretty particular about who I want as a friend .
PTSD was aggravated for Viet Nam veterans because they returned to a country that had negative attitudes toward them .
For sexual assault survivors , stigmatization is the second injury .
When Viet Nam veterans returned home people were angry at them .
They had shamed the country , they had done something wrong , they were potentially harmful to others , it was dangerous to be with them .
Sexual assault survivors may receive angry responses -- on the grounds that they have done something that shames the family .
Suicide attempters often experience great anger from family and care providers .
A deep distrust of co-workers , employers , authorities .
Left with unexpressed rage against those who were indifferent to their situation and who failed to help them .
In personal relationships there are problems of dependency and trust .
A fear of being abandoned , betrayed , let down .
A belief that people will be hurtful if given a chance .
Feelings of self - hatred and humiliation for being needy , weak , and vulnerable .
Alternating between isolation and anxious clinging .
Trauma often causes the victim to view the world as malevolent , rather than benign .
No sense of having a future , or , the belief that ones future will be very limited .
Feel that they belong more to the dead than to the living .
The feeling of having a negative Midas touch -- everything I get involved with goes bad .
Loss of self - confidence , and loss of feelings of mastery and competence .
A resistance to efforts to change a maladaptive world view that results from the trauma .
A mistrust of counselors ability to listen .
People who suffered traumatic experiences as children , teenagers , or young adults may simultaneously become prematurely aged and developmentally arrested .
A part of them feels old .
Another part feels stuck at the age they had when the trauma occurred .
PTSD can be worse if the sufferer experiences the trauma as an individual rather than as a member of a group of people who are suffering the same situation .
Unlike earlier wars in which units went overseas together and returned together , in Viet Nam each soldier had an individual DEROS ( Date of Expected Return from Overseas ) .
This reduced unit cohesiveness ; each soldier experienced the war from an individual point of view .
Suicidal people experience their near - death situation with extreme isolation .
They see their conditions as being completely unique - terminal uniqueness .
They have no sense of identification with others .
The severity of PTSD symptoms tends to increase with the severity and duration of the trauma .
The use of alcohol or drugs to cope with the PTSD symptoms .
Attempts to do things to gain a feeling of mastery over the traumatic situation , e.g. , become a volunteer on a hotline .
These kinds of conditions may be found again and again in the chronically suicidal .
Upon reflection , it should not be surprising that we should suffer PTSD .
Many of us suffered from suicidal pain for years - and years - and years .
The idea of dying is terrifying .
We recoil at thoughts of dying by automobile accident , plane crash , murder , cancer , AIDS , drowning , suffocation .
The idea of dying violently simply by forces generated from within ourselves is in some ways almost too horrible to apprehend .
How could anyone survive such a prolonged siege of pain and terror - and remain unaffected ?
Survivors of traumatic experiences are often told , Its in the past .
Forget about it and get on with your life ,
Why cant you just forget about all that , and enjoy life like a normal person ?
If we could simply get on with life , they would have done it .
PTSD helps explain why it is so hard for the chronically suicidal to recover .
Because we were suicidal , we subsequently suffered many of the conditions associated with post - traumatic stress disorder .
These conditions are serious problems in their own right ; they are formidable barriers in the recovery process .
We can heal from the original trauma , and we can heal from the PTSD conditions that have plagued us since the trauma .
The basic steps of PTSD recovery programs provide helpful guidelines : an environment that is physically and emotionally safe treatment for addictive behaviors patience : PTSD recovery takes time caring attachments restore sense of mastery rest and relaxation recall the traumatic event (s ) in small steps gradually assimilate painful feelings and memories fully experience fear , anger , shame , guilt , depression grieve ones losses
In a support group we have a chance to talk about our suicidal histories without the fear that we will be taken to a hospital for doing so .
We can talk about the isolation , the fears , the pain , the confusion , the acts of self - injury , the behavior of others that was stigmatizing , denying , abusive , the horrible sense of estrangement that exists when you are in a terrible situation and there is no one who understands what you are going through , the hatred and contempt for oneself and the world , the debilitating sense of personal weakness .
We see that we are not alone .
We do not have the seriousness of our condition minimized , denied , or belittled .
With time , the pain abates and the troublesome PTSD symptoms diminish .

Gordon Brown is not ruling out a change in the law on organ donation even though a panel of experts has rejected the idea of " presumed consent " .
The UK Organ Donation Taskforce said assuming organs could be used unless people opted out was unlikely to boost donation rates .
A £ 4.5 m public awareness campaign in England will be aimed at boosting voluntary donor numbers .
But the prime minister warned if it did not work a law change may follow .
We found from recipient families and donor families that the concept of gift was very important to them and presumed consent would undermine that concept
Elisabeth Buggins
UK Organ Donation Taskforce
Scots mull presumed consent Q&A : Organ donation laws
The UK has one of the lowest organ donation rates in Europe .
There are currently around 8,000 people in the UK who need an organ transplant but only 3,000 operations are carried out each year .
Every year , 1,000 people in the UK die after waiting for a transplant .
Currently , people must sign up to the organ donor register - or their families must agree - before their organs can be used .
Health Secretary Alan Johnson announced on Monday that £ 4.5 m would be spent on a public education campaign aimed at signing up 20 million people to the organ donor register by 2010 , and 25 million by 2013 .
This would double the numbers currently on the register .
A similar campaign has already has some success in Scotland .
However , Mr Brown said that if the campaign failed to have the necessary impact a switch to presumed consent was on the cards .
He said : " I 'm not ruling out a further change in the law .
" We will revisit this when we find out how successful the next stage of the campaign has been . "
Mr Brown 's comments were echoed by Nicola Sturgeon , the health minister in Scotland , who said the situation would be re-assessed in 2013 .
NHS Scotland has been asked to produce new awareness - raising material to inform people about the existing legislation .
Strong emotions Elisabeth Buggins , chair of the taskforce , said the issue raised " really strong emotions . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme
But she said the task force , which had gathered over 400 pages of evidence from across the world , had found little evidence that presumed consent would increase the number of organs available for transplant .
She said although a system of presumed consent in Spain had been followed by a rise in organ donation , that rise was not thought to be down to the switch .
Ms Buggins said : " We found from recipient families and donor families that the concept of gift was very important to them and presumed consent would undermine that concept .
" We also found that it has the potential to erode trust in doctors , and we know that is very important to the levels of donation . "
Instead , Ms Buggins said a rise in organ donations was more likely to be achieved by increasing in the number of donor coordinators who work with bereaved families , and the number of specialists who retrieve organs , and by launching public information campaigns .
" There is lots of fear out there that organs are taken from patients before they are dead - that is absolutely not true . "
Medical split
The medical profession is divided on the issue of presumed consent .
In September , intensive care doctors told the BBC they were deeply concerned about any radical changes to the law on organ donation .
We know that the majority of the population want to be organ donors , but only 25 % are on the register
Dr Vivienne Nathanson
British Medical Association Research by the Intensive Care Society suggests many specialists are worried that such a move would damage the trust between patients and doctors .
But Dr Vivienne Nathanson , chair of ethics at the British Medical Association , said she was disappointed by the task force 's findings .
She said presumed consent was not a panacea , but was likely to result in a 10 - 15 % increase in donated organs - if sufficient surgeons , intensive care beds and transplant coordinators were put in place .

She said it would also encourage families to discuss their views , and make their position clear .
The BMA supports a ' soft ' system of presumed consent , where individuals who do not want to donate their organs have a formal mechanism for registering that objection and where families are consulted to identify any unregistered objection .
Dr Nathanson said : " We know that the majority of the population want to be organ donors , but only 25 % are on the register .
" Turning it round the other way , so that you take organs from everyone unless they have either put their name on a register to opt out , or their family say they wanted to , but have n't got round to it , means you could quite significantly increase the numbers of donors . "
Lack of capacity But Tim Statham of the National Kidney Federation said organs were being wasted because of a lack of capacity in the NHS - a situation which presumed consent would not solve .
And Professor John Fabre , a former president of the British Transplantation Society , said presumed consent was a " simplistic " way to try to boost organ donation rates , which would be a " waste of time " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If the NHS and government want to increase the amount of organ donors , then they need to educate the public Martin , UK Joyce Robins , co-director of Patient Concern , said : ' We can only hope that Gordon Brown does not follow the example of the Welsh Health minister Edwina Hart , who rejected the all - party Welsh Assembly report when they decided against presumed consent after weeks of evidence and is still pressing ahead . "
A report recommending a radical overhaul of the UK organ donor network in a bid to double the number of organs available for transplant , has already been published by the Organ Donor Taskforce , and is being implemented .
The latest recommendations on presumed consent are not binding and the government could decide to press ahead with changes to the legislation .
Any change to the system would involve amending the Human Tissue Act of 2004 .

FOUR stars simply are n’t enough for Danny Boyle ’s “ Slumdog Millionaire , ” which just may be the most entertaining movie I ’ve ever labeled a masterpiece in these pages .
Great movies transport the audience , and this one left me floating on air after two viewings .
I ca n’t wait to see it again – and share it with others .
It ’s actually one of those movies that are best approached with as little advance knowledge as possible .
If you need more of a sell than that , let me just say it ’s a soaringly romantic , uproarious comedy - drama with Dickensian overtones – set mostly in a vividly rendered Mumbai , India .
A police inspector ( the excellent Irfan Khan ) describes the story , which is taken from a novel inspired by a perhaps apocryphal story , as “ bizarrely plausible . ”
That ’s about right .
Jamal ( Dev Patel ) , an 18 - year - old Muslim , is a highly successful contestant on the Indian version of “ Who Wants To Be a Millionaire . ”
He has qualified to answer a question that could bring him 20 million rupees ( about $ 460,000 ) , but the show ’s unctuous host ( Indian superstar Anil Kapoor ) is jealous of his popularity and deeply skeptical of Jamal ’s knowledge .
How can Jamal , an orphan from Mumbai ’s slums who works as a tea server at the phone company , possibly know the answers to questions that stump learned professionals ?
So he turns Jamal over to the cops , and they begin torturing our hero to confess that he ’s somehow cheating .
In the brilliantly structured screenplay by Simon Beaufoy ( “ The Full Monty ” ) , this summons forth a remarkable series of memories from Jamal , going all the way back to his childhood when his mother is killed in a religious riot .
Each story illustrates how Jamal is able to answer the questions .
We follow Jamal and his older brother Salim – well played by three sets of actors at various ages – through a series of incredibly colorful adventures , all of which adds to Jamal ’s store of knowledge .
It begins with a dive into a latrine pit to steal a glimpse of a movie star and continues with their stealing shoes at the Taj Mahal as the brothers fall in and out with various band of criminals and each other .
The driving thread is the beautiful Latika ( played as an adult by Freida Pinto ) , with whom Jamal becomes smitten as a child .
He pursues her tirelessly even after she has been sold off to become the bride of a gang boss .
Boyle ( “ Trainspotting , ” “ 28 Days Later ” ) and Beaufoy do n’t take a single wrong step as the story hurtles toward a hugely satisfying climax .
American audiences have long been notoriously cool to the
larger - than - life storytelling style of Bollywood that Boyle pays tribute to , but “ Slumdog Millionaire ” could be an even bigger game changer than “ Moulin Rouge . ”
With a gallery of unforgettable performances and indelible images of the subcontinent , this is surely one of the year ’s best movies – and the only live - action contender for the Best Picture Oscar released so far this year .
And by the way , do n’t be afraid to take kids as young as 10 .
Yes , it ’s got some subtitles – about half the film is in English – and yes , that R rating is justified by some violence and intense imagery .
But few movies ever have provided better and more entertaining lessons about the joys of learning .
Plus , they ’ll really enjoy it .
Honest .

Death is something that most people fear , simply because we do n’t know what happens after we die .
Others are n’t afraid to die , but I think it ’s safe to say that a lot of us get a bad feeling when we think about what comes next .
While we may not know when or what is next , we do know that it is sure to come .
Most people want to die a peaceful death ; usually while asleep .
However , let ’s look at a few athletes from the last few decades that have been active and awake before the time of their death .
All of these men died doing what they loved .
Maybe this is the way to go …who knows !
10 . J.V. Cain
J.V. Cain was a tight end for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1970s .
He had been the tight end for six years and was racking up great statistics for the team .
On July 22 , 1979 , Cain was taking part in the teams training camp in order to get ready for the new season .
This day was also his 28th birthday .
During camp , he was running a normal pass route and suddenly took a few steps backward , huddled over , and collapsed .
Cain died from congenital heart failure .
Though he did n’t die during the NFL Season , he still died doing something he loved .
9. Howard Glenn
Howard Glenn was an American football player for the AFL .
He joined the AFL ’s New York Titans in 1960 are a starting offensive guard .
Glenn stands as the only player to die from injuries that were sustained during a normal season football game .
While Glenn ’s future as an offensive guard looked promising , he suffered a broken neck on October 9 in a game against the Houston Oilers in the first half .
A few hours later , he died because of his injuries to his spinal cord .
His # 66 jersey was retired .
8. Bill Masterton
Bill Masterton was from Winnipeg , Manitoba and was signed by the Montreal Canadiens right out of college in 1961 .
He was an All - American player and was a great addition to the team .
He spent most of his years playing in minor league and then quit for some time to work for a corporation .
In 1967 the North Stars added him to the team and he became the first player to score a goal for the team .
On January 13 , 1968 , the North Stars were playing the Oakland Seals .
Masterton had the puck and was close to scoring , but passed the puck .
Masterton was checked by two players of the Seals ’ team and immediately feel backwards on the ice , his head slamming against it .
He died shortly after due to a massive brain hemorrhage .
It was so bad that even doctors could n’t operate .
7. Chuck Hughes
Chuck Hughes was another promising player for the NFL .
While in college , he set seven different all - time football records .
A notable record is Hughes ’ 17 interceptions in a single game against Arizona State in 1965 .
After graduating from college , he was a fourth round draft pick for the Philadelphia Eagles .
He played for the Eagles for three years until joining the Detroit Lions in 1970 .
Hughes was listed as a wide receiver on the roster , but many of his plays were made on special teams .
During the final minutes of a game against the Chicago Bears , Hughes suddenly fell forward without any type of contact .
Players and fans thought he was faking an injury to stop the clock ; however , Hughes had suffered a fatal heart attack .
The game was concluded , but in silence .
6. Ray Chapman
Ray Chapman was a Major League Baseball player .
He stands as the second player to have died as a result of injuries received during a baseball game .
In 1912 he joined the Major Leagues and played for the Cleveland Naps .
He was the leader in the American League in runs scored as well as walks .
He was known for bunting and was a great shortstop .
He was hitting .303 with 97 runs scored when he died .
On August 17 , 1920 , the Naps were playing the Yankees .
The Yankees ’ pitcher , Carl Mays , threw the ball and it head Chapman on the head .
Fans thought that the sound of the ball hitting his skull was the sound of it hitting his bat .
Chapman was taken to the hospital and died 12 hours later .
His death emphasized why players need to wear batting helmets and why the spitball has been banned .
5. Frank Hayes
Frank Hayes was a horse jockey .
He was 35 years old and had been training horses for most of his life .
He was chosen to ride a horse named Sweet Kiss by the owner .
Hayes would participate in the Belmont Park racetrack in New York .
Though the odds were against winning , Hayes was still ready to run the race and give it a try .
In February of 1923 , to everyone ’s surprise , Sweet Kiss won the race .
Once the race was over and the horse finally stopped , the horse ’s owner ran out to the field to congratulate Hayes , but he was slumped in the saddle and not moving .
Doctors confirmed that Hayes had a heart attack during the race .
As weird as it may be , Frank Hayes stands as the only jockey that has won a race after his death .
4. Scott Brayton
Brayton was a race car driver from Coldwater , Michigan .
He was able to take part in 14 Indianapolis 500s from 1981 until his death .
During the 1980s , Brayton is well known for introducing a Buick stock - block V - 6 to the racing world .
He was able to score his best finish at the Speedway in 1989 , finishing in 6th but still seven laps down .
In 1993 he matched the same stats .
When the Indy Racing League was announced in 1996 , Brayton was considered a contender of the IRL title .
Though the season started off rough , he was able to qualify and won his second Indy pole .
On May 17 , 1996 , Brayton was practicing in his backup car when a tire blew .
His car went into turn two , spun around , hit the outside of the wall , and eventually stopped .
Brayton hit the wall at speeds higher than 230 mph .
He died because of the severe impact with the wall .
3. Ed Sanders
Ed Sanders was a boxer that competed on the minor level , the professional level , and even in the Olympics .
His first Olympic boxing championship was in the 1952 summer games .
He easily knocked out his opponent , Hans Jost , and went on to beat Giacomo DiSegni in his second fight .
At this time , the only person keeping Sanders from the gold was Ingemar Johansson .
After the Olympics Sanders went professional and fought eight fights in nine months , losing two of them .
On December 12 , 1954 , Sanders was boxing Willie James .
This would be his last fight .
During the first ten rounds , the two traded heavy blows .

All of these factors have led electronics stores like Circuit City and Best Buy , and even less specialized chains like Sears , Wal - Mart and Office Depot , to put TVs front and center in their advertising recently , promoting them on the cover of Sunday circulars and on the home pages of Web sites .
They are offering discounts  like 42 - inch TVs for less than $ 700 and 32 - inch sets for $ 450  that come on top of recent steep price declines for the sets .
Image Shoppers comparing TVs on Friday at a Wal - Mart in Secaucus , N.J. Retailers use big discounts on televisions to lure consumers into stores .
Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
For the industry , the feeling is that if retailers cannot get TVs to move , the holiday season could be a bleak one indeed .
In that sense , the TV market offers a glimpse of the broader tensions this year between wary consumers on the one hand and retailers and manufacturers desperate to spur sales on the other .
“ The television becomes a litmus test of the robustness of the American economy , ” said Richard Doherty , an electronics industry analyst with the research firm Envisioneering .
In Mr. Doherty ’s consumer surveys , the early word is mixed ; many consumers want a new TV , but they think that if they wait to buy , retailers will drop prices further .
There were signs on Friday that more cuts might be necessary .
At two malls outside Portland , Ore. , the electronics stores were the only ones that were full of shoppers .
But people seemed to be gravitating toward lower - priced items like video games instead of televisions .
Mr. Doherty ’s firm tracked stores in New York and California and found that for some retailers it was the slowest Black Friday of the decade .
“ There are lots of big - screen TVs still standing on the show floor , ” he said .
“ This is not what was expected by retailers or manufacturers . ”
Store owners may cut TV prices even further with revamped sales starting on Sunday , Mr. Doherty said .
Steven Caldero , chief operating officer of Ken Cranes , a 10 - store consumer electronics chain in the Los Angeles area , painted a rosier picture .
" Barack Obama : he 's going to be the biggest disappointment EVER ! "
So said Chris Addison at his gig in London last Saturday night – and the atmosphere in the room curdled .
Addison – by no means a confrontational comic – backtracked instantly .
( " No , I mean – It 's exciting , obviously ... " )
But it brought into focus the problem with which comics worldwide are currently grappling .
Should they joke about Obama and poop the world 's party ?
And if so , how ?
US comics have been candid about their concerns .
Here 's Bill Maher , former host of Comedy Central 's Politically Incorrect , on the president - elect : " Here 's a guy who 's not fat , not cheating on his wife , not stupid , not angry and not a phoney .
Who needs an asshole like that around for the next four years ? "
Or Scot - turned - American Craig Ferguson , now presenter of CBS's The Late Late Show ( although he 'll always be Bing Hitler to me ) : " A dignified African - American man – what the hell can I do with that ? "
His conclusion ?
" My only hope is Biden ! "
This comedy crisis is magnified by the imminent exit stage right of George Bush , generally held to have been a spurting oil geyser of gags these last eight years .
In fact , Bush - baiting was a busted flush within six months of Dubya 's first term : " one of his most daunting achievements , " as Ryan Gilbey writes this week in the New Statesman , " [ was ] to present to the world a version of himself more pitiful than anything the satirists could construct . "
It got to the point , watching standup , when I longed to hear jokes supporting Bush and his world - view – anything to upset the " he 's evil and stupid " consensus .
But if comedy 's job is to subvert accepted wisdom , should n't stand - ups be bursting the Barack bubble ?
Well , not necessarily – comedians are human too , and deserve this moment , like everyone else , to recharge their optimism .
( Most of them will be broadly supportive of Obama 's politics – at least until his inevitable compromises kick in . )
But that does n't stop us speculating what the nature of the jokes will be when Obama 's sheen wears off .
The funniest so far have been at The Onion website , whose spoof headlines have included Black Man Given Nation 's Worst Job and Nation Finally Shitty Enough to Make Social Progress – both of which joke about America 's racism rather than Obama per se .
That racism , of course , makes Obama humour a delicate affair – at least for white comics .
His election has already prompted calls for more black comedians in the mainstream – on Saturday Night Live , for example , where , while Tina Fey was aping her lookalike Sarah Palin , Obama has been played by Fred Armisen , who is not African - American .
On stage at an LA comedy club last weekend , meanwhile , black stand - up Tommy Davidson performed " a bit from Obama 's upcoming inaugural speech . "
He stood at an imaginary lectern – then a shot rang out , and he dropped dead .
Ho ho ho !
As if to add to comedians ' frustration , Obama himself has proved no mean joker .
" Contrary to the rumours you have heard , I was not born in a manger , " he quipped while on the campaign trail .
" I was born on Krypton and sent here by my father , Jor-el , to save the planet Earth . "
Here , the joke is on Obama 's supposed messiah status – and I suspect that , when the dust settles , this might be comedy 's line of attack .
Obama 's grandiose acceptance speech last week could only have been made by a man with high self - regard .
Some comics are already in on the act , poking fun at his perceived rectitude and sense of entitlement .
" The presidential debate , " reported talk - show host Jay Leno mid-campaign , " was a town - hall format , which is John McCain 's favourite way to speak to crowds .
As opposed to Obama 's favourite way , a sermon on the mount . "
The tougher the going gets as president , the more a messianic air would grate .
( Remember Blair , the vicar of St Albion ?
With whom , praise the Lord , Obama seems otherwise to have little in common . )
And soon , of course , there will be actions to joke about , not just airy - fairy promises .
Normal service will duly be resumed .
In the meantime , let Obama – and the rest of us - enjoy the amnesty .

The European presence in space has become more prominent over the years .
The development of the Columbus Laboratory and the introduction of the Automated Transport Vehicle ( ATV ) are two major milestones that have opened a new era for Europe ’s presence in space .
Europe now aspires to consolidate its independence with the Large Cargo Return ( LCR ) and the Crew Transport Vehicle ( CTV ) .
The LCR and the CTV are the new versions of the ATV that are now being considered by ESA ’s Human Spaceflight Directorate .
These versions of the ATV reuse the service module of the ATV configuration .
A capsule with re-entry capability will replace the integrated cargo carrier .
In the first phase , the capsule will bring cargo from the ISS down to Earth .
The ultimate goal is to be able to carry a full crew up to the ISS and bring the crew back to Earth .
Credits : ESA Atmospheric re-entry is not a new challenge for ESA engineers .
Past programs – like the Atmospheric Re-entry Demonstrator – and future programs – like the Intermediate Experimental Vehicle ( IXV ) – will help validate models used for the simulation of the re-entry phase and also provide a solid base in designing materials for the thermal protection system .
However , one challenge that needs to be addressed is the ejection system for the CTV / Ariane V configuration .
The safety of the crew has to be ensured in the case of an anomaly on the launch pad or during the ascent phase of the flight .
ESA will have to develop new technologies to satisfy this crucial requirement .
ACORN Raid Reflects GOP Anger at Voter Registration Drive
Created : October 08 , 2008 06:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Yesterday ’s raid on Nevada offices of ACORN reflects the increasingly aggressive Republican attempts to derail voter registration efforts among poor and minority voters .
As The Washington Post reported , the Nevada chapter of the Assn. of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or ACORN , had planned a potluck dinner at its Las Vegas office Tuesday night to celebrate the 80,000 newly registered voters its staff had signed up in Clark County .
Before that dinner could start , however , Nevada officials raided the ACORN office , removing 20 boxes of documents and eight computer hard drives .
The state officials claimed that workers for the community - organizing group , who are paid by the hour , had submitted almost 300 voter registration cards that included names and addresses that do n’t exist in Nevada , or are duplicates of previous registrations .
A former ACORN employee said she started making up names to fill out the registration forms to avoid having to work in the heat outside .
Workers are expected to sign up 20 new voters per shift .
As I noted in my post yesterday , Republicans have been aggressively attacking ACORN for alleged voter fraud , and using any false or erroneous registrations submitted by the group to claim there ’s a problem of widespread voter fraud that ’s tainting the elections .
But not only are the numbers of illegitimate registrations found tiny in comparison to the 1.3 million valid new registrations the group has signed up , but neither the Nevada GOP , nor anyone else , has presented any evidence that these duplicate or false registrations have any impact whatsoever on the validity of the vote .
After all , unless poll workers are sleeping on the job , no one can show up and vote twice .
And there ’s no evidence , and likewise no charges , that anyone is showing up at the polls and impersonating the nonexistent voters that have been signed up .
Still , ACORN has been making huge efforts to try to prevent this sort of fraud — cooperating with local authorities by flagging suspicious registrations and having workers individually call new registrants to make sure their registrations are legitimate .
Of course , the group has good reason to cooperate with local authorities to prevent fraud .
After all , even assuming the Republicans ’ allegations against ACORN workers are true , the only fraud that ’s actually been perpetrated was on ACORN itself -– not on the government or the voters of Nevada , or anywhere else .
Berkeley to M.I.T .
1924
In 1924 my Great Uncle Harold Washburn and his friend Dean Smith went from California to Massachusetts .
Uncle Harold had gotten his bachelors degree from the University of California at Berkeley and was headed to M.I.T. for graduate work .
All I know about Dean Smith is what you see in the pictures .
Uncle Harold had a good camera with him and assembled the resulting pictures and his log into a scrap book .
These web pages are arranged to reproduce the ones he laid out .
The trip took thirty days .
Uncle Harold records that they covered 3540 until their speedometer chain broke outside Buffalo , New York .

Statisticians love balls and urns .
A typical Stats 101 midterm , for example , usually includes a question along these lines :
" You take a simple random sample of 1000 balls from an urn containing 120,000,000 red and blue balls , and your sample shows 450 red balls and 550 blue balls .
Construct a 95 % confidence interval for the true proportion of blue balls in the urn . "
After choking back a giggle about " blue balls , " you whip out your calculator and text your frat brother who has a copy of last semester 's midterm .
He instantly recognizes the correct formula is
95 % confidence interval for P = p +/- 1.96 * sqrt( p*( 1 - p ) / n ) * FPC
where P = the real , true , actual , honest - to - god proportion of blue balls in that great big f'ing urn
p = the sample proportion of blue balls , or 0.55
n = the sample size = 1000
FPC = the " finite population correction " = sqrt ( ( N - n ) / ( N - 1 ) ) where N=120,000,000
and the 1.96 has something to do with the 95 % probability area under a standard normal distribution
That second part , after the " +/- " , is what you know as the " margin of error . "
Your frat brother texts you back and reminds you that since the population is very large , the FPC is very close to 1 and can be dropped .
He also reminds you to uses the conservative estimate of p = 0.5 in the margin of error calculation , since you do n't know the true value of p , only the sample estimate .
So the whole formula simplifies to
p +/- 1.96 * sqrt ( .25 / n )
=p +/- 0.98 / sqrt ( n)
Assuming you still have juice in your calculator batteries and you 're not hungover from the Sig Eps kegger last night , you should get
0.55 +/- 0.031
Now you could probably say you are 95 % certain the real proportion of blue balls in that great big f'ing urn is 55 % , plus or minus 3.1 % .
If you wanted to get extra credit points , you should probably say that " 95 % of all random samples of this size will have have a computed confidence interval that contains the true population value . "
But that 's just quibbling and brown - nosing the professor , who 's probably late for a faculty meeting anyway .
This is , for all intents and purposes , how political pollsters compute the mysterious " margin of error , " which has everything to do ( and only to do ) with pure mathematical sampling error .
If you look at the formula above and round it just a smidge , you get a simple rule of thumb for the margin of error of a sampled probability :
Margin of Error = 1 / sqrt(n )
So if the sample size is 400 , the margin of error is 1/20 = 5 % ; if the sample size is 625 the margin of error is 1/25 = 4 % ; if the sample size is 1000 , it 's about 3 % .
Works pretty well if you 're interested in hypothetical colored balls in hypothetical giant urns , or survival rates of plants in a controlled experiment , or defects in a batch of factory products .
It may even work well if you 're interested in blind cola taste tests .
But what if the thing you are studying does n't quite fit the balls & urns template ?
What if 40 % of the balls have personally chosen to live in an urn that you legally can't stick your hand into ?
What if 50 % of the balls who live in the legal urn explicitly refuse to let you select them ?
What if the balls inside the urn are constantly interacting and talking and arguing with each other , and can decide to change their color on a whim ?
What if you have to rely on the balls to report their own color , and some unknown number are probably lying to you ?
What if you 've been hired to count balls by a company who has endorsed blue as their favorite color ?
What if you have outsourced the urn - ball counting to part - time temp balls , most of whom happen to be blue ?
What if the balls inside the urn are listening to you counting out there , and it affects whether they want to be counted , and / or which color they want to be ?
If one or more of the above statements are true , then the formula for margin of error simplifies to
Margin of Error =
Who the hell knows ?
Because , in this case , so - called scientific " sampling error " is completely meaningless , because it is utterly overwhelmed by unmeasurable non-sampling error .
Under these circumstances " margin of error " is a fantasy , a numeric fiction masquerading as a pseudo - scientific fact .
If a poll reports it -- even if it 's collected " scientifically " -- the pollster is guilty of aggravated bullshit in the first degree .
The moral of this midterm for all would - be pollsters : if you are really interested in how many of us red and blue balls there are in this great big urn , sit back and relax until Tuesday , and let us show our true colors .
Until then , fondle your own balls .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Archaeologists in Israel said on Thursday they had unearthed the oldest Hebrew text ever found , while excavating a fortress city overlooking a valley where the Bible says David slew Goliath .
The dig ’s uncovering of the past near the ancient battlefield in the Valley of Elah , now home to wineries and a satellite station , could have implications for the emotional debate over the future of Jerusalem , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) away .
Archaeologists from the Hebrew University said they found five lines of text written in black ink on a shard of pottery dug up at a five - acre ( two - hectare ) site called Elah Fortress , or Khirbet Qeiyafa .
Experts have not yet been able to decipher the text fully , but carbon dating of artifacts found at the site indicates the Hebrew inscription was written about 3,000 years ago , predating the Dead Sea Scrolls by 1,000 years , the archaeologists said .
Several words , including “ judge , ” “ slave ” and “ king , ” could be identified and the experts said they hoped the text would shed light on how alphabetic scripts developed .
In a finding that could have symbolic value for Israel , the archaeologists said other items discovered at the fortress dig indicated there was most likely a strong king and central government in Jerusalem during the period scholars believe that David ruled the holy city and ancient Israel .
Modern - day Israel often cites a biblical connection through David to Jerusalem in supporting its claim , which has not won recognition internationally , to all of the city as its “ eternal and indivisible capital . ”
Palestinians , saying biblical claims have been superseded by the long - standing Arab population in Jerusalem , want the eastern part of the city , captured by Israel in a 1967 war , to be the capital of the state they hope to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
“ The chronology and geography of Khirbet Qeiyafa create a unique meeting point between the mythology , history , historiography and archaeology of King David , ” said Yosef Garfinkel , the lead archaeologist at the fortress site .

Most of Alaska 's glaciers are retreating or thinning or both , a new book by the U.S. Geological Survey reports .
About 5 percent of Alaska 's area is covered by more than 100,000 glaciers — that 's about 29,000 square miles ( 75,000 square kilometers ) , or more than the entire state of West Virginia .
While a few of Alaska 's large glaciers are advancing , 99 percent are retreating , the book , " Glaciers in Alaska , " states .
The book was written by USGS research geologist Bruce Molina .
A USGS project to photograph the glaciers of Montana 's Glacier National Park also showed significant retreat .
Based on these photos and glacier recession rates , scientists predicted the park could lose its namesakes by 2030 .
Greenland , which is covered by more ice than anywhere else in the world outside Antarctica , has also seen significant melt of its glaciers in recent decades .
The new book on Alaska 's glaciers used satellite images , aerial photos , maps and other studies to document the retreat of the glaciers , which began as early as the mid-19th century .
Some glaciers have even disappeared since being mapped in the mid-20th century , the report found .
The report also said that glaciers in Alaska saw " significant retreat " in the last two decades of the 20th century .
Glaciers at lower elevations have been hit particularly hard :
More than 95 percent of the glaciers that end below an elevation of about 4,900 feet ( 1,500 meters ) are retreating and thinning .
( The glaciers that have advanced are all at higher elevations , where it is colder . )
Alaska's two largest glaciers , Bering and Malaspina , are losing several cubic kilometers of ice to melting and calving ( where chunks of the glacier break off into the sea ) each year .
The heiress who blew the Woolworth 's billions on vodka breakfasts , seven husbands and jewels galore
Frank W. Woolworth was a colossus , a man who started life in the backwoods but went on to build a worldwide business empire and a mighty New York skyscraper , the Woolworth Tower , just to remind people how powerful he had become .
He worked every day of his 66 years , and when he died he left the equivalent of a billion pounds in his will .
His family blew it all .
It has taken the Woolworth company more than 100 years to reach its nemesis .
But it took Frank Woolworth 's family a fraction of that time to ruin itself .
Woolworth millionairess Barbara Hutton with third husband Cary Grant :
She squandered her inheritance on her indulgent lifestyle
Woolie 's may be best - known for its pick ' n ' mix , but the family was a byword for sex , drugs and profligacy .
They went from rags to riches and back to rags in three generations .
A few years ago , I bumped into one of the tribe , Mary Woolworth - Donahue , in an out - of - the - way town in Illinois .
A reformed alcoholic , she was elegant but penniless and living in someone else 's house .
By this point , the fortune had long since vanished .
Money , to the Woolworths , was a curse .
Unlike families such as the Rothschilds , they never learnt how to deal with it .
So they just spent it - and bought their own destruction in the process .
The sad irony of the demise of Woolworth 's stores in Britain is that , for many decades , they continued to exemplify all the virtues instilled by their founder - hard work , cheap goods , a little pleasure - while his family took off in the opposite direction .
They despised work and indulged themselves in consumerism and debauchery instead .
Hard - working : Frank W Woolworth , the founder of Woolworths stores
The main culprits were FW 's grandchildren , Barbara Hutton and Jimmy Donahue .
Hutton was the original ' Poor Little Rich Girl ' , the child of FW 's daughter , Edna .
Donahue , the fast - talking playboy who was to ruin the reputation of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , was the son of the old man 's daughter , Jessie .
Hutton , whose mother committed suicide - Barbara found the body - was just seven when she inherited today 's equivalent of a third of a billion dollars .
The counter assistants at Woolworth 's may have been toiling ten hours a day , but she would never have to work .
Instead , Barbara Hutton went shopping .
As the richest girl in the world , she could have anything - and so she took to shopping for husbands .
In the end , she had seven .
In her secret little world , Hutton repudiated her origins and longed to be high - born .
It was no coincidence that of her husbands , two were princes , one was a count , one was a baron and one had a title bought for him .
She detested being a plain old ' Mrs ' .
Of her many husbands , the most famous was her third , Hollywood aristocrat Cary Grant - while they were together , wiseacres labelled them Cash ' n ' Cary .
Grant got the call to the altar only because he was at the time one of the world 's most famous actors - and he was only too aware that his wife fantasised about being a real princess .
Their marriage barely lasted four years and Grant gave an insight into his wife 's make - believe life as he departed :
' Barbara surrounded herself with a consortium of fawning parasites - European titles , broken - down Hollywood types , a maharajah or two , a sheikh , the military , several English peers and a few tennis bums .
' If one more phoney earl had entered the house , I 'd have suffocated . '
Nobody who met Barbara Hutton walked away the poorer - how she loved to spend her grandfather 's money .
And if people commented , so what ?
She spent the equivalent of £ 20 million on building a house in London 's Regent 's Park , now the U.S. Ambassador 's residence , and without a breath dished out half that on a suite of jewels once belonging to Napoleon .
She treated upmarket jewellers Cartier , Asprey , Van Cleef and Arpels like other people treated her grandfather 's five - and - dime stores - she 'd drop in and help herself to whatever took her fancy .
Richest girl in the world : Barbara Hutton inherited a fortune at the age of seven and regularly splashed out on expensive jewellery
Her flagrant disregard for propriety - her dictum was ' If you 've got it , flaunt it ' - caused her on one occasion to be reminded of where all that cash came from .
When Barbara declared : ' Living well is the best revenge ' , it hit the business hard - poor people were reluctant to spend their hard - earned pennies at a business which had such a gargoyle at its prow .
And the workers had to pay the price , by working longer hours for pitiful wages .
When American employees noisily threatened to strike in 1938 , the executive board blamed Barbara for their troubles .
And weeks later , groups of unruly shopgirls were picketing the swanky Pierre Hotel in New York , where Barbara had a suite of rooms , shouting : ' Barbara Hutton !
Is 18 dollars a week too much ? '
But she did n't care .
As time went on , whatever tenuous link with reality she 'd once had evaporated completely .
Between husbands , Barbara had a string of affairs - among them with Howard Hughes , one of the world 's richest men , and with Porfirio Rubirosa , one of the world 's best - endowed .
She demanded sex , often , from the men she was with , yet remained strangely aloof from the process .
One lover , after the expenditure of much energy and ingenuity , concluded she was incapable of being satisfied .
And so one of the richest woman in the world was also one of the unhappiest - and took to alcohol and drug abuse on a grand scale .
Blushing bride ... again : Barbara became the Countess Kurt Von Reventlow after she married Prince Mdivani - one of her seven husbands
With her cousin , Jimmy , she discovered in her teenage years the dubious delights of Seconal , a barbiturate - based tranquilliser which produced a damaging but lasting high .
It was to prove her downfall .
But compared with Jimmy , Barbara was a mere innocent .
The son of Frank Woolworth 's second daughter , Jimmy was born bad .
Knowing he would never have to work in his life , he devised a career for himself - that of mischief - making .
There were many pranks .
But the best was taking the Duchess of Windsor to bed .
Jimmy first met the Duchess at the Palm Beach Palace hotel , which he called home , in 1941 .
He was 25 and she was 44 .
But it was probably Jimmy 's predatory mother , Jessie Donahue , who encouraged her son , nine years later , to make overtures to the Duchess .
Certainly she paid for Jimmy 's first - class ticket on the RMS Queen Mary as it slipped away from New York on May 24 , 1950 , heading for France .
The couple started the journey as mere acquaintances , but they ended it as lovers .
For the next four years , they were inseparable as the poor , ageing Duke played the tormented cuckold .
Nobody else suspected , because Jimmy - until this point - had been a hugely promiscuous homosexual .
He had tribes of gay lovers , most of whom refused to believe he could have a sexual relationship with a woman .
But Jimmy did .
By 1950 , the Duke and Duchess of Windsor had been married for 13 years and had been lovers for 16 .
But their relationship was largely one - way traffic , with the Duke gaining gratification from his hectoring and abusive wife while she refused sexual satisfaction .
But with Jimmy , everything changed .
The Duchess , when in Paris , would go out with the Duke and Jimmy as a threesome - but the Duke , tiring now of long hours spent in nightclubs , would go home at midnight .
The Duchess and Jimmy would then repair to the black , satin - lined apartment of socialite Count Jean de Baglion , overlooking the River Seine ; and her car would not return home until after dawn .
' She married a King , but screwed a queen , ' the Count was heard to sourly observe of the Duchess 's affair with the homosexual Jimmy .
The Duchess would go home and leave notes on her bedroom door : ' Go away .
Stay away .
Do n't come in here .'
' Born bad ' : Jimmy Donahue with the Duchess of Windsor , nee Wallis Simpson , with whom it is alleged he had an affair
Meanwhile , the Duke , who only a few years earlier had given up throne , empire , riches and power for ' the woman I love ' was forced to sit out his wife 's menopausal fling with a gay playboy young enough to be her son .
One day , more of a joke than anything else , Jimmy proposed marriage to the Duchess .
And she did n't say no .
In America , where she hailed from , the name Woolworth meant a whole lot more than the name Windsor .
What , apart from her reputation , was there to lose ?
In the end , wiser counsels prevailed - and Jimmy was getting bored anyway .
There was a row , Jimmy kicked her on the shin , drawing blood , and finally the tiny Duke gathered up enough courage to shout : ' We 've had enough of you , Jimmy .
Get out !'
Jimmy walked .
It meant goodbye to a large slice of the high - life for the Windsors .
For during the length of the affair , Woolworth money had bankrolled the couple - who caved in to the onslaught of money , gifts , holidays , cars , foreign travel and jewellery which Jimmy and his mother Jessie showered on them .
Woolworth money had brought the former King - Emperor to his lowest point - one night , he 'd even worn the diamond cufflinks Jimmy had given him as a present for bedding his wife .
Jimmy went back to the life he'd known before , queening it round the Fifth Avenue bars strictly reserved for New York 's uppercrust gay set .
When people asked him about the Windsors , he would say : ' Oh , them !
Do n't you know I 've abdicated ?'
His life continued on a downward spiral of drink and drugs .
Though it was never proved ( because the police , in receipt of Woolworth kickbacks , had no desire to prove it ) , Jimmy almost certainly murdered his boyfriend , the unfortunately named ' Lucky ' Morra , by force - feeding him drugs , and soon there seemed nothing left to live for .
When he died in 1966 , of a drugs overdose , Jimmy was found in his Fifth Avenue bedroom - which contained nothing but a bed and 13 framed photographs of the Duchess of Windsor .
His mother , when told the news of her son's death , glimpsed the social oblivion that was soon to encompass her and uttered : ' Oh !
This is the worst thing that can happen to me !'
But what of Jimmy 's cousin , the Poor Little Rich Girl ?
Her biographer David Heymann recorded that by now , Barbara Hutton 's daily diet consisted of 20 bottles of Coca - Cola with spirits ( usually vodka ) , intravenous megavitamin shots mixed with amphetamines , a soybean compound , cigarettes , and a cocktail of drugs , including codeine , Valium , and morphine .
Away with the fairies , she married a Vietnamese chemist working for a French oil company and bought him an Indo - Chinese princedom from the Laotian embassy in Rabat .
She went to her grave as Princess Raymond Doan Vinh Na Champassak , the wife of a nobody .
The Woolworth family , like the stores that today still bear their name , had truly lost their way .
In recent years a determined , Anglo - Chilean woman has become a common sight in the streets of Valparaíso , the port city that was the power base of General Augusto Pinochet .
She has spoken to judges , lawyers and ordinary Chileans .
Gradually , in a remarkable tale of courage and perseverance , she has pieced together the grisly events that took place over 30 years ago , when she lost her brother to the brutality of the Pinochet regime .
Nineteen former naval officials have just been arrested as a result of Patricia Bennetts 's efforts .
Four vice - admirals , several captains and other Chilean Navy officers face being put on trial .
More importantly , justice appears finally to be possible for her brother Michael , a young priest who fell foul of one of the most notorious dictatorships in 20th - century history .
Michael Woodward was an idealistic young Englishman , a Roman Catholic priest swept along by the hopeful currents of a new radical ' liberation ' theology .
He saw his future as helping the poor raise themselves from poverty through the power of prayer and politics .
It was a vision that took him back to Chile in the early Seventies , the country where he was born in 1932 .
There he began to work and live among the people of Cerro Placeres , a working - class neighbourhood of Valparaíso .
It was a world away from his privileged childhood as a British public schoolboy .
Chile was undergoing a political transformation after the election of the charismatic new Socialist President , Salvador Allende , in 1970 .
General Augusto Pinochet and his military henchmen brought that experiment in Latin American socialism - and Woodward 's ministry to the poor - to an abrupt and violent end .
Within 10 days of the 1973 coup , Woodward had disappeared .
Eventually his family heard he was dead , though no one could tell them how , why or where his body was buried .
Thirty - five years later , as a result of the indefatigable efforts of his sister , that wall of silence is being demolished .
Woodward 's younger sister , Patricia , a mild - mannered 70 - year - old , has returned to Cerro Placeres and set about finding the answers to the questions no one would provide all those years ago .
In a country where the deceased dictator still casts a dark and occasionally sinister shadow , she has encountered intimidation and fearful silences .
' The investigation has uncovered a lot of things , ' she said .
' Other cases have come to light .
It has been discovered that all this was planned before the coup . '
Death threats , break - ins , thefts of documentation and angry demonstrations by Pinochet supporters have all formed part of a concentrated attempt to intimidate Bennetts and those helping her .
However , her single - minded pursuit of those who kidnapped , tortured and killed her brother has borne fruit .
Supported by justice officials operating in an increasingly liberal atmosphere under Socialist President Michelle Bachelet , herself a torture victim , Bennetts has uncovered many of the painful and tragic details of her brother 's fate .
Father Michael Woodward was almost certainly shot dead .
A bullet was fired into his chest - possibly while being held on an elegant , four - masted navy training ship , the Esmeralda .
Two witnesses have spoken of a chest wound .
His death followed 10 days of brutal torture .
The revelation places extra pressure on the investigating judge to bring those arrested to trial .
That judge , Eliana Quezada , regularly receives death threats and needs a police bodyguard .
' Judge Quezada has been receiving death threats for a long time .
In recent times it has got a lot worse , ' Patricia Bennetts said .
' I think it is because of this case . '
A state human rights lawyer helping prosecute the case , Karina Fernández , recently had her house broken into and her laptop computer , containing documents about the case , stolen .
' She was away from home for several hours and somebody got in and stole it , ' Bennetts explained .
' They purposely left her jewellery , money and cheque stubs on her bed as if to say , " This is the only thing we wanted " . '
Patricia Bennetts has also needed police escorts at Valparaíso's courthouse as groups of well - heeled , jeering , pro-Pinochet protesters jostled her .
' It has been very hostile , ' she said .
' One lady tried to kick me . '
Patricia and Michael were born to an English father and Chilean mother .
They spent their childhood in Latin America while their father worked as a manager for British American Tobacco .
They were sent home to Britain to attend school .
Michael went to Downside , a Catholic public school in Somerset .
He studied engineering in London but eventually returned to Chile , became a priest and ended up in Valparaíso , a navy town north - west of Santiago .
Liberation theology swept through Latin America during the Sixties , as many Catholic priests decided their faith required a commitment not just to God but also to social justice and political action .
Michael Woodward was among them and , by the early Seventies , he had joined a Christian Marxist group called the Movement for United Popular Action , or MAPU .
The group supported Allende when he came to power in 1970 , amid hopes that he would transform Chile .
Woodward had already been suspended by a conservative church hierarchy when Chile violently lurched from socialism to right - wing dictatorship .
In September 1973 the army commander General Pinochet rebelled , together with other military and police chiefs .
Allende and a handful of supporters held out briefly in Santiago 's La Moneda palace , but were surrounded by tanks and attacked from the ground and the air .
Allende is believed to have turned his own gun on himself as troops entered the palace .
The dream of a socialist Chile died with him .
Pinochet , a man whose ruthlessness , dark glasses and German - style military uniforms helped earn him a reputation as the world 's archetypal Latin American despot , took control and stayed in power for 17 years .
It was only after Pinochet stepped down as head of the armed forced in 1998 that Chileans began to hope that they might seek justice for crimes committed in his name .
' Before , people could not speak without fearing for their lives , ' Bennetts explained .
Pinochet 's 1998 arrest in London , after Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón requested his extradition , raised hopes further - although legal arguments over his British victims concentrated on the killing of stockbroker William Beausire and the torture of British doctor Sheila Cassidy .
His death two years ago , when he was being investigated for hundreds of deaths and corruption , removed many of the remaining obstacles .
Even now , however , amnesty laws make it hard to get sentences passed for murder .
' The people who are being indicted are being held for kidnapping , not for murder , ' said Bennetts .
' If they were indicted for murder , they could appeal to the law of amnesty and be freed . '
Bennetts 's investigations have helped Chileans piece together the horror of what happened in Valparaíso in the weeks that followed the coup .
Her lawyers have shown how navy units took control of the city and set up torture and detention centres in at least three places .
These included the Navy War Academy , the Federico Santa Maria University and the Esmeralda .
She has also pieced together the terrible saga of her brother 's detention , which saw him pass through all three places before , almost certainly , being shot and buried in an anonymous grave .
Woodward was picked up ten days after the coup , when he returned to his house in Cerro Placeres .
He went into hiding after the coup and naval units had already ransacked the house .
It was , in retrospect , rash to go home , but Woodward insisted he had nothing to hide .
Few people realised what was happening to those picked up by the military .
His ordeal began almost immediately .
Witnesses now say that they saw him at the university detention centre .
There he was subjected to torture sessions in the swimming pool .
' There were witnesses to say he was sunk and lifted inside the pool , ' said his sister .
From there he was taken to the Navy War Academy .
' That is where he got most of the torturing , ' Bennetts said .
' He was tied to a chair and tortured for an hour with lots of people looking on to see how it was going . '
Torturers wrapped their fists in damp towels so that the beating left fewer external marks .
He was eventually taken to the Esmeralda .
' There was violence 24 hours a day .
Prisoners were taken out , beaten and tortured , returning bruised and vomiting blood , ' a former detainee , María Aliane Comene , said .
' They took me out every night to interrogate me .
They hit me on the ears with their hands , they applied electric currents to my tongue and my vagina .
They took us out to amuse themselves , to abuse us sexually .
They raped us . '
Sergio Vuskovic , a former Valparaíso mayor , was tortured for seven days .
' They applied electrical discharges to my penis , my testicles , my torso and my back , ' he said .
Captain Carlos Fanta , the senior naval officer in Valparaíso on the day Woodward died , has admitted that a navy doctor ordered his evacuation from the Esmeralda after certifying that he would die of the internal bleeding caused by his beatings .
By then , Chilean navy officials had planted a newspaper story claiming that the ' pseudo - priest took part in various attacks on police ... and sexually abused an indeterminate number of young girls ' .
On the same day a death certificate was signed , saying Woodward had died of a ' cardio - respiratory arrest ' on a road .
Reaction to the case has been mixed .
' We have more important things to worry about than stupidities like this , ' said Ricardo Bustamante , the head of the students ' union , when told that the private Federico Santa Maria University had been used as a torture centre .
Carlos Portales , a lawyer representing the accused , used a recent celebration of the Pinochet coup ' and the things that happened afterwards ' to claim that the courts were now in Marxist hands .
' With Marxists there is no way of reaching an honourable understanding , ' he said .
' We need to change the way we act .
We have been too passive . '
For years , Patricia Bennetts has campaigned to stop the Esmeralda , also known as The White Lady , being allowed to visit ports in Britain or elsewhere in the world until the Chilean Navy publicly recognised and apologised for its use as a torture centre .
However , it was not until 2004 that the navy accepted that 100 prisoners were tortured and raped on board .
Navy officials still claim today that only a minority of officers and sailors were involved .
Bennetts is now satisfied that many of those involved in the arrest and torture of her brother have been found .
She hopes that sentences will be passed before the end of the year .
She and her husband , Fred Bennetts , now spend much of their time in Cerro Placeres among the people her brother had tried to help .
' It is encouraging to see how people in the street react , ' she said .
' They stop and ask us how it is going .
We feel their support . '
The final piece of the puzzle , however , has yet to be put into place .
Woodward 's body is thought to have been sneaked into the city 's Playa Ancha cemetery at night by naval personnel .
Two years ago Bennetts persuaded Judge Quezada to dig up a section of the cemetery after a tip - off .
Her brother 's corpse was not found , however .
Now the family is in possession of new information .
A former grave - digger has said that he was forced at gunpoint to bury three men together , all of whom had been shot in the chest .
' The location of the grave has been pinpointed within a relatively small area , ' said Fred Bennetts .
' The area is just a few metres away from another grave in which a skull with a bullet wound was found next to a bullet casing of a calibre used only by the armed forces .
I saw the skull and the bullet casing myself . '
For the moment , Patricia Bennetts is concentrating on the court case .
She says that she will not be put off by the small crowd of former naval personnel who try to intimidate her at the courthouse doors .
Nor , like her brother before her , will she respond in kind .
' We will keep our cool , ' she said .
' We certainly wo n't shout . '

The Christian Science Monitor has a valuable update on the international fight over curbing emissions tied to millions of premature deaths and tens of billions of dollars in health - care costs each year — the emissions from cigarettes .
( Hat tip : SEJ.org news roundup . )
As the world heads toward nine billion people seeking a decent life , it ’s vital to examine the continuing promotion ( and spread ) of smoking in developing countries even as the rich North increasingly succeeds at curtailing the habit .
Several hundred million shortened lives are projected by midcentury without big changes , according to international health agencies .
Along with the global antitobacco treaty that took effect in 2005 , efforts are being mounted by philanthropists like Bill Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg .
The Monitor story describes how developing countries are offering more resistance to the tobacco industry than had been expected by experts , and perhaps even the industry itself :
Times have been hard for the tobacco industry in the developed world , as smoking diminishes in Europe and North America – evidence that education on tobacco ’s harms [ is ] starting to pay off .
But as the tobacco industry shifts its attentions farther south to Africa , Latin America and Asia – betting that weaker governments or corrupt officials will smooth the path for their product to be sold – it has met surprising resistance from individual nations and citizens groups who refuse to allow their countries to be dumping grounds for what has been called the world ’s largest preventable epidemic .
Last year , I wrote about how John Holdren of Harvard University came up with roughly similar losses in years of life from the afflictions attending affluence and poverty .
( Poverty still wins out , over all ; his paper , “ Science and Technology for Sustainable Wellbeing , ” is worth reading top to bottom . )
Smoking - related illness straddles both worlds .
Here ’s a video about the global antismoking initiative being pursued by Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Gates :

The buttons function by opening a menu , from which you choose to switch from None to the China Channel .
Much like the IE Tab extension , the page will then render as if your IP address is inside China .
The toolbar is interesting for a slightly different workflow that results in a Web page that informs you of your IP address and its country of origin .

Or at least it was when I tested out China Channel : while sensitive material seems to be permanently blocked , the 30,000 employees of the Great Firewall appear to apply their censorship in a more arbitrary manner for less topical Web sites .

A comment I ’ve seen posted frequently is that “ replacing table tags with div s that display as tables is no different ; you may as well just use tables . ”
The argument is interesting because it sounds like the commenter is implying that the only reason not to use table tags is the number of tags involved .
I ’m going to stick my neck out and say yes , even if you just replace all your table , tr , and td tags with div tags that display like those table elements , it ’s better than using HTML tables for layout .
No one is negatively affected by the overuse of structural div tags .
The same ca n’t be said for the use of HTML tables for layout .
A web page that uses nested tables for layout will be difficult to print , difficult to view on a mobile device , and difficult to navigate for users of screen readers .
A screen reader application will often stumble over nested HTML tables , announcing something like “ table with 5 rows and 2 columns ” as it enters the table content and “ table end ” as it leaves .
The same web page using nested div elements can be styled to stack neatly for print and viewing on a mobile device , and screen readers ignore div elements .
By using HTML tables you are implying that the contents of each cell relate to the contents of other cells in 2 dimensions : in the same row and in the same column .
On the other hand a div implies no such relation with other div elements .
It ’s simply content scaffolding , and no meaning is derived from their use .
OK , blindly replacing all table - related tags with div elements may not be the correct approach to the problem , but to say that it is “ just as bad ” as using HTML tables for layout is wrong .
HTML 4.01 defines the div as a “ generic language / style container ” or more specifically :
The DIV and SPAN elements , in conjunction with the id and class attributes , offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents .
These elements define content to be inline ( SPAN ) or block - level ( DIV ) but impose no other presentational idioms on the content .
Thus , authors may use these elements in conjunction with style sheets , the lang attribute , etc. , to tailor HTML to their own needs and tastes .
So we can use div elements to define content blocks ; sounds like using nested div elements for structuring content is perfectly valid .
As long as you do n’t use div elements in place of more appropriate ones like headings , paragraphs , blockquotes , lists , and of course , tables for tabular data , then you ’re doing fine .
The approach you take when creating a layout using HTML table elements is to first lock - in the layout in HTML before you style your web page .
This is wrong and flies in the face of established best practice : separate your presentation from your content .
5 Things You Didn't Know : The NFL
Page 1 of 2
Its season is shorter and has fewer scheduled games than any other major American pro sport ; nonetheless , the NFL has a firm hold on the title of " national obsession " in the U.S.
In fact , it ’s a Sunday and Monday night ( and sometimes Thursday night ) ritual from September through early February for its tens of millions of fans .
As the nation ’s top dog , the powerhouse league has faced more than its share of challengers through the years , all eager to get a piece of its hugely lucrative pie .
They include the World Football League of the early 1970s , the USFL of the early ‘ 80s , Vince McMahon ’s 2001 XFL , and ( excluding the AFL of the 1960s ) its toughest challenge , the All - America Football Conference of the 1940s — none of which lasted beyond four seasons .
The NFL has an impressive — though not perfect — winning record as the defendant in antitrust lawsuits , and its tremendous influence is slowly stretching beyond America ’s vast and lucrative borders .
Without further ado , we present five things you did n’t know about the NFL .
1- The Redskins were the NFL ’s last segregated team
By 1961 , 13 of the league ’s 14 teams had , to some degree , been desegregated and featured black players on their rosters .
The one hold - out could be found in the nation ’s capital .
The Washington Redskins were the league ’s last all - white team , and whether it was coincidental or not , they were also the worst ( from 1959 through 1961 , their record was 5 - 30 ) .
Team owner George Marshall had staunchly refused to desegregate , claiming he would do so when the Harlem Globetrotters hired white players .
That all changed with the incoming presidential administration .
JFK had been elected , in part , thanks to his pro-civil rights platform , and having the league ’s only all - white team in the nation ’s capital was an eyesore for the administration .
JFK , therefore , instructed his Secretary of the Interior , Stewart L. Udall , to threaten Marshall with federal retribution if the team did n’t hire black players ; namely , they would be evicted from District of Columbia Stadium .
In doing so , it became the first time in history that the federal government had attempted to desegregate a professional sports team .
2- The NFL scores forfeits 2-
0
According to the official NFL rulebook , a forfeit occurs : “ ... when a game is not played because of the failure or refusal of one team to participate .
In that event , the other team , if ready and willing to play , is the winner by a score of 2 - 0 ” ( the points earned in a safety ) .
Why a two - point safety ?
Because those points are the league ’s only scores that are not credited to any one player .
This little - discussed rule is even less frequently applied , since dating back to 1920 there has been just one forfeit .
Specifically , December 4 , 1921 , when the Rochester Jeffersons lost by forfeit to the Washington Pros / Senators .
Since the league was just a year old and this rule was not yet established , the referee scored the game 1 - 0 .
No word on whose stats got padded with the point .
3- It was created in an automobile showroom
Organized professional football dates back to 1920 and a legendary meeting in Canton , Ohio .
Fittingly , it featured a handful of former athletic standouts , such as George Halas and Jim Thorpe , hanging out in an automobile showroom , slamming beers and talking sports on a Friday night .
Among other things , they settled on a name , the American Professional Football Association , and a membership fee , $ 100 .
Since then , more than just the name has changed .
Today , the NFL is a revenue juggernaut .
According to Forbes , the mean value of the NFL ’s 32 teams exceeds $ 950 million , making the NFL the world ’s richest and most profitable professional sports league .
It can further boast of having the world ’s most valuable sports franchise , the Dallas Cowboys , valued at a cool $ 1.5 billion .
We have two more facts about the NFL you did n’t know …

Mr. Putin typically gave the speech in the spring , using it to announce crowd - pleasing investments in infrastructure projects and social welfare programs .
Mr. Medvedev , by contrast , had to address the two shocks that had befallen Russia since he became president , the financial crisis and the war in Georgia , while combating the impression that Mr. Putin retained control over major decisions .
The speech he gave Wednesday , originally planned for Oct. 23 , gave scant information about the government ’s economic strategy going forward .
It did , however , squarely lay blame for Russia ’s troubles on the United States .
Mr. Medvedev said that American regulators had inflated a financial bubble and that the ensuing collapse “ carried in its downfall to the trajectory of recession all financial markets of the planet . ”
He also said Washington had started the war in Georgia , saying , “ Tskhinvali ’s tragedy is , among other things , the result of the arrogant course of the U.S. administration , which hates criticism and prefers unilateral decisions . ”
But it was the planned missile deployment , a possible early foreign policy test for Mr. Obama , that captured attention in the West on Wednesday .
Mr. Medvedev described specific measures Moscow would take if Washington went ahead with a plan to station a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
He said Russia would post mobile Iskander missiles — tactical weapons designed for use against targets like long - range artillery and airfields , in addition to missile defense systems — around Kaliningrad , an enclave at Russia ’s western border .
He also said Russia would use radio equipment to jam the Western missile defense system .
" What Do You Think of Ted Williams Now ? "
June 1986
" He 's always first , 8:00 A.M. , at the tennis club .
He 's been up for hours , he 's ready .
He fidgets , awaiting appearance by some other , any other , man with a racket , whereupon Ted bellows , before the newcomer can say hello , " WELL , YOU WANNA PLAY ? "
Ted 's voice normally emanates with gale force , even at close range .
Apologists attribute this to the ear injury that sent him home from Korea and ended his combat flying career .
But Ted can speak softly and hear himself fine , if it 's only one friend around .
The roar with which he speaks in a public place , or to anyone else , has nothing to do with his hearing .
It 's your hearing he 's worried about . "
The first issue in the Missouri ballot for Nov. 4 asks this : “ Shall the Missouri Constitution be amended to add a statement that English shall be the language of all governmental meetings at which any public business is discussed , decided , or public policy is formulated whether conducted in person or by communication equipment including conference calls , video conferences , or Internet chat or message board ? ”
The proponents of the measure say a common language in the state has a vital part in integrating it to the American culture .
Opponents say it is an unnecessary issue that picks on immigrants for a problem that does n't exist and it is just a ploy to increase the Republican turnout at the polls .
Nonetheless , the main issue here is not just about using English in state business .
It is about the aspect of assimilation among immigrants .
This is one of the most contentious issues when it comes to immigration .
Yet , just the fact that we have a dispute about it is a disgrace for the state of political discourse in the country .
Let me be clear , I do consider America as a nation of immigrants and I too came to the United States from India as one a few years ago .
However , the knee - jerk reaction against assimilation is a counter - productive argument , whether it is for the country or for the immigrants themselves .
While arguing against assimilation , the liberals conveniently forget the fact that America has always been a nation of immigrants .
They mistake the push for assimilation as a nativist reaction against immigration .
This is not the first influx of immigrants to come into the country .
There have been waves of immigrants from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Poland and countless other countries .
There has never been a demand for them to be able to do daily business in their own native languages , let alone in the dealings with the government .
It was understood that once you are in America , you are expected to learn English to be able to be a part of the country .
Nobody asked for sign boards in German or license tests in Italian .
It must have been tough , but it was a hardship that the immigrants were willing to take on their quest to pursue the American dream .
There are two dangers when you do not require the immigrants to learn English or worse , if you make it easy for them not to learn it .
First , failing to learn English denies them the opportunity to pursue their dreams by not being able to work or do business in the mainstream .
This vastly diminishes their chances of moving up the financial ladder .
Second , it will lead to the rise of a segregation system where the immigrants live a separate life unconnected to the mainstream America .
This amounts to the same kind of separatism that the liberals have always fought against .
Read in this context , their push for Spanish language schools for the children of immigrants is a dire one .
This effectively calls for keeping even the second generation of the immigrants chained to the same barriers that their parents faced , for a foreseeable future .
Take a look at history : Something that most immigrants always had in common was the language hurdle .
The first generation immigrants had to always face some level of a challenge crossing the language or the accent barrier .
Nonetheless , fast - forward two or three generations and you can see that the children and grandchildren of all these immigrant groups have all become a part of mainstream America .
On the other hand these Spanish language programs would in fact create a second string group of citizens who are perpetually stuck in their virtual isolation to the rest of the society .
This does not mean that America should take away the heritage of the immigrants .
Immigrants and their children would still keep certain aspects of their culture that , in turn , will part of the American culture .
Whether it is the St. Patrick ’s Day parades across the country or pizza , these traditions always enrich the American society and this is exactly what makes America the melting pot of the world .
However , a melting pot requires that its ingredients be melted indistinguishably into the greater mixture , not stay afloat or sink to the bottom and stay separate like oil and water .
Coming back to the Missouri ballot issue , one can claim that the issue is pointless as the state business or meetings are always held in English and this issue is nothing but an election tactic .
However , as a word of caution , states may have to revert to multiple languages when it comes to communication on certain subjects like health and safety where it cannot afford to miss anyone , especially the immigrants who are usually the most at risk .
So , when it comes to immigration policy , the aim should be to promote assimilation rather than creating aeonian dumping grounds for groups of second - class citizens separated by a language barrier .
This is not picking on immigrants .
This is not racism .
This is the way things have been done and it has been proven successful over the centuries .
When you come to America , learning English is a small sacrifice that you can make on your journey to achieve your American dream .
This is what I did as an immigrant myself a few years ago .
It worked just fine for me .
Workers Struggles : Europe & Africa
14 November 2008
The World Socialist Web Site invites workers and other readers to contribute to this regular feature .
Europe
Irish airline workers strike
Workers employed at Aer Lingus have set a date for industrial action , November 24 , if the company attempts to implement its plan to cut 1,245 jobs .
The union SIPTU has called on Aer Lingus management to re-enter talks as shop stewards establish strike committees to prepare for the dispute .
National Industrial Secretary Gerry McCormack said he had informed shop stewards that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions had written to the secretary general of the Taoiseach ’s ( prime minister ’s ) department , Dermot McCarthy , asking for a meeting of the National Implementation Body to seek a resolution to the dispute .
“ We are available to attend a meeting if asked and we would urge the company to do so and help avert a potentially very damaging dispute , ” he said .
Workers have voted by a wide majority to take action at three major airports , Dublin , Cork and Shannon .
Fourteen days official notice of industrial action has been served .
Italian transport workers strike
Mass transit and rail workers across Italy staged a strike November 10 .
This was followed by a wildcat protest by staff at Alitalia which forced the national airline to scrap dozens of flights .
Around 200 Alitalia flight attendants and pilots staged a surprise protest by blocking the crew entrance at Leonardo da Vinci airport and preventing staff wanting to fly from entering the terminal .
The striking workers oppose a plan to salvage the bankrupt airline by cutting routes and jobs .
According to the Associated Press , “ Roads were jammed as many people took cars or motor scooters to work instead of public transportation .
The walkout by railway and transit workers was meant to push the government and transport companies to open contract renewal negotiations .
“ Further misery awaited travellers at Rome ’s Leonardo da Vinci airport , where a separate , unannounced protest by some Alitalia flight attendants and pilots caused delays and cancellations . ”
Alitalia said a total of 124 flights were cancelled due to the strike , as well as a work - to - the - rule job action by pilots .
The airline predicted a further 50 flights would have to be scratched .
Industrial action by railway workers was scheduled to run until 9 p.m. and the mass transit strike was due to end at midnight .
The striking airline workers voted to continue their protest through November 11 .
Adding to the transport chaos , Italy ’s civil aviation authority said Ciampino , Rome ’s second - largest airport and a low - cost hub , would remain closed for a further day , November 11 , as workers removed a Ryanair plane that made a hard emergency landing Monday after hitting a flock of birds .
The plane damaged its left gear and ended its run leaning on the left wing .
Two crew members and four passengers suffered minor injuries .
UK : Bus staff strike disrupts schools
A one - day strike by Stagecoach bus staff was held November 11 over pay .
Aberdeenshire Council said 4,000 pupils were affected .
Stagecoach said 160 staff from elsewhere in the UK had arrived in the north of Scotland to help provide a strike - breaking force .
The millionaire owner of Stagecoach , Brian Souter , was among those drafted in to drive a bus in Aberdeen .
Further action is planned for November 21 and 24 .
UK port workers demonstrate to prevent job cuts
Hundreds of workers employed at the Dover Harbour Board will take part in a rally and demonstrate on November 15 and will go out on a 48 - hour strike the following week to demand that their jobs not be outsourced .
Officials at Unite , the UK ’s largest trade union , are reportedly angry that the port ’s chief executive has stated they are not prepared to negotiate on their plans to outsource work , but only inform the union of their proposals .
Africa
Teachers strike in Nigeria
Primary school teachers in Enugu State , southern Nigeria , took strike action on November 10 in protest against the authorities ’ failure to increase their wages in line with the decisions of the state government .
Teachers from several schools across the state carried placards in a demonstration through the streets of the capital city .
State officials , including the permanent secretary of the State School Board , called on the teachers to return to work but did not explain what would be done about their grievances .
Truck drivers on strike in Botswana
Truck drivers employed by Unitrans in Botswana are on strike to oppose their poor conditions and low wages .
The drivers travel long distances from home without receiving any allowances for meals or other expenditures .
The drivers say they have been raising their grievances with management since the year 2000 to no avail .
“ People who have been working here for several years are paid P3,500 [ US $ 443 ] or P3,600 [ US $ 456 ] ” per month according to an employee interviewed by Gaborone based newspaper , the Reporter .
One driver said , “ A guy in South Africa makes my monthly salary in a week and we are wondering what the difference is . ”
Another added , “ When you are first hired they will give you three months [ probation ] but you can [ continue ] for several years without being confirmed while they keep extending your probation . ”
Liberian public works employees hold sit - down protest
Employees of the Liberian Ministry of Public Works held a sit - down strike that continued for several days .
The employees had earlier voiced their anger over “ the level of corruption ” within the ministry and called for the immediate removal of Minister Donzo , who presides over it .
They accused Donzo of hiring family members and giving them government scholarships .
On November 10 , the employees resolved to return to work after receiving assurances that the issues would be addressed .
Blind workers on strike in South Africa to demand payment of arrears
Employees of the Itireleng workshop for the blind in Ga-Rankuwa , in the North West Province of South Africa , are on strike to demand payment of their salary increases from April this year .
Only a few of the employees have received any increase at all .
Casual worker Emily Matsemela has been employed in the workshop for more than 20 years .
She accused management of withholding her pay and of wanting to get rid of her .
Another worker complained , “ We ’ve been working for such a long period at Itireleng , but we are being ill treated . ”
Women doctors protest in Morocco
Women doctors are protesting at the decision to insist that they take up posts anywhere in the country .
Previously they were assigned to posts within 65 miles of their homes .
The ministry of health has threatened to suspend their salaries after the doctors held a number of sit -in protests at the ministry .
“ We ’ll go on campaigning even if they stop our wages , ” said Maha Benjelloun .
“ We have no choice . ”
Dr. Benjelloun , a nephrologists , has two young children , but has been sent to work in Oujda which is 440 miles away from her home in Casablanca .
( CNN ) -- U.S. President - elect Barack Obama is expected to begin building his transition team Thursday , little more than a day after securing an historic election victory .
Barack Obama could start naming his Cabinet as early as Wednesday .
The Democratic party leader was expected to officially name his White House chief of staff as Rahm Emanuel , a Chicago colleague who helped lead the party to majority control of Congress in 2006 .
Other key appointments , primarily the treasury chief who will help craft policy to lift the county out of financial crisis , were expected to be named shortly .
President George W. Bush has pledged full cooperation with Obama , who beat Republican rival John McCain to become America 's first African - American president , ahead of his inauguration on January 20 .
A team of intelligence briefers has been named and is ready to discuss with Obama the Presidential Daily Brief , similar to the one provided to President Bush , CIA Director Michael Hayden said in a message to CIA employees obtained by CNN .
CNN Political Editor Mark Preston said Obama 's victory speech on Tuesday launched the transition .
Possible appointees for Obama 's administration »
" The campaign was over when McCain called to concede , " Preston said .
" [ His ] speech was about governing .
It was a very serious tone -- he was setting the tone , taking his first steps as president . "
Watch Obama 's acceptance speech »
CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger said that it was important to take steps quickly to set the right tone , pointing to President Clinton , who waited weeks to fill Cabinet positions and announced many of his top staffers just five days before he was sworn in .
" Everything you do early on in a presidency gets magnified .
You do n't want to make the same mistakes that Bill Clinton made , " Borger said .
iReport.com : What 's Obama 's biggest challenge ?
Obama held no public events on Wednesday .
He will most likely travel to Hawaii soon for the funeral of his grandmother , who died on Monday .
John Podesta , a former chief of staff under President Clinton , will be among those leading Obama 's transition team .
Valerie Jarrett , one of Obama 's top advisers , and Peter Rouse , Obama 's Senate chief of staff , will also be involved the effort .
Jarrett told CNN that Obama would begin making public his plans for the transition soon .
" In the days ahead , you will be hearing more directly from Sen. Obama ... about the steps that he 'll be taking to get prepared to lead on January 20 . "
Filling out his economic team is a top priority for Obama as he begins to implement a strategy to quell the economic crisis .
" This is one of the first times that I can remember that the secretary of the treasury is going to be almost as important as the secretary of state , " said David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN , who served in the Reagan and Clinton administrations .
Names circulating for the secretary of the treasury position include Timothy Geithner , Lawrence Summers and Paul Volcker , among others .
Geithner helped deal with Wall Street 's financial meltdown earlier this year , overseeing the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase and the bailouts of AIG and Lehman Brothers .
He was appointed president of the New York Federal Reserve in November 2003 .
Summers was appointed treasury secretary in July 1999 and served as the chief economist of the World Bank from 1991 through 1993 .
Prior to his career in government , he taught economics at Harvard .
Volcker is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve , serving under Presidents Carter and Reagan .
He also worked in the private sector as an investment banker and headed the investigation into the United Nations ' oil - for - food program for Iraq .
Obama 's national security team is another priority as the country fights wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It could also be an area where he goes outside his party for an appointee .
Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel and current Defense Secretary Robert Gates are among the names being floated .
Hagel , who was elected to the Senate in 1996 and is a Vietnam veteran , has been a fierce critic of the Bush administration 's handling of the Iraq war .
Gates has served in Bush 's cabinet for almost two years .
He worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for 27 years , serving as its director from 1991 through 1993 .
He also served as deputy national security adviser under President George H. W. Bush .
" What Barack Obama has to do in the transition time is set the tone , " Borger said .
" If he reaches out to Republicans in the cabinet -- if he decided to keep Bob Gates at Defense -- that 's really , really important . "

Gordon Brown has criticised Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross for their " inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour " on Brand 's radio show .
He said the BBC must take " appropriate action " over a series of prank calls made to Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs , and broadcast on 18 October .
The BBC and watchdog Ofcom have both launched investigations .
BBC audio and music director Tim Davie said it was " too early to speculate " on whether Brand or Ross will face action .
" This is clearly inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour , as is now widely recognised , " Mr Brown said .
The main question is why did they allow this programme to be broadcast , given that it was pre-recorded ?
David Cameron
How the story unfolded " Ofcom have said they will investigate the matter and it is for the BBC , the BBC Trust and Ofcom to take any appropriate action . "
The BBC has now received more than 10,000 complaints about the broadcast .
Obscene comments Sachs , 78 , said he was upset after Brand and Ross left a series of lewd messages on his voicemail as part of a pre-recorded show , taped on 16 October .
The pair made obscene comments about the actor 's 23 - year - old granddaughter Georgina Baillie during four separate phone calls .
Sachs had been scheduled to appear as a guest on the programme , but was unable to take part due to unforeseen circumstances .
In the first of the phone messages , Ross suddenly swore and said Brand had slept with Ms Baillie .
Georgina Baillie deserved an apology , her grandfather said Conservative leader David Cameron has called for the BBC to be " transparent " about how the programme came to be broadcast .
" The main question is why did they allow this programme to be broadcast , given that it was pre-recorded ?
" So we need to know who made the decision to broadcast it ?
How high up the editorial chain did it go ? "
Ross ' in trouble '
He made no excuses and he was very frank and open
Sachs on Ross ' personal apology Meanwhile , Mr Sachs has told the BBC that on the day the show was recorded , " the producer called me on my mobile to ask whether they could play the recording in question " .
He added : " The signal was poor and I could n't really hear what was being played down the line to me .
" But I asked whether they would consider allowing me to come in the following week and then the recorded segment would not have to be included . "
He said Ross had " personally delivered a letter of apology and some flowers " since the broadcast .
HAVE YOUR SAY
My solution is to hold them both to their contracts but just do n't let them on air Joe P , Dunfermline " He made no excuses and he was very frank and open , " he added .
" He is in a lot of trouble and I do n't want to pile any more on him . "
He has not " heard anything " from Brand - whose spokeswoman earlier told the BBC the comedian had " issued a private apology " .
Sachs noted that his granddaughter had not heard from either broadcaster and said both men " owe her an apology " .
Unacceptable broadcast A Radio 2 spokeswoman said on Monday the BBC was " reviewing how this came about " and apologised to listeners for any offence caused .
Please turn on JavaScript .

And , on Tuesday , Ofcom launched an investigation into the incident , reminding the BBC of its obligation to " ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by the context " .
Speaking on Tuesday afternoon , Mr Davie , the BBC 's head of audio and music , refused to be drawn on whether Ross or Brand would be disciplined .
" We do offer an unreserved apology to Andrew Sachs and his family , " he added .
" We do recognise this was an unacceptable broadcast and I am leading an investigation to ascertain the facts . "
Meanwhile , the pair have received strong support from Radio 1 listeners .
Most of those who sent text messages to the youth - orientated station said reaction to the pranks had been " over the top " .

General Motors has posted a propaganda video to YouTube in an attempt to gain support for a bailout of the US car industry .
The bailout itself is currently in dispute , with House Democrats calling on the Bush Administration to dip into the financial industry rescue package , and Bush arguing that Congress should restructure a previous $ 25 billion subsidy scheme originally targeted at the development of environmentally friendly vehicles .
The reception on YouTube so far has n’t been positive , with the video gaining only 2 stars and a pile of negative comments .
As Owen Thomas points out on Valleywag , the video has resulted in “ predictably disastrous results .
GM marketers have clearly fallen for the myth of Internet PR — that taking a company ’s message directly to the people through social media will give it a much friendlier reception than if it is filtered through the mainstream media .
The reality ? ”
Before Hillary Clinton has been formally offered the job as Secretary of State , a purge of Barack Obama 's top foreign policy team has begun .
The advisers who helped trash the former First Lady 's foreign policy credentials on the campaign trail are being brutally shunted aside , as the price of her accepting the job of being the public face of America to the world .
In negotiations with Mr Obama this week before agreeing to take the job , she demanded and received assurances that she alone should appoint staff to the State Department .
She also got assurances that she will have direct access to the President and will not have to go through his foreign policy advisers on the National Security Council , which is where many of her critics in the Obama team are expected to end up .
The first victims of Mrs Clinton 's anticipated appointment will be those who defended Mr Obama 's flanks on the campaign trail .
By mocking Mrs Clinton 's claims to have landed under sniper fire in Bosnia or pouring scorn on her much - ballyhooed claim to have visited 80 countries as First Lady they successfully deflected the damaging charge that he is a lightweight on international issues .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Foremost among the victims of the purges is her old Yale Law School buddy Greg Craig , a man who more than anyone led the rescue of his presidency starting the very night Kenneth Starr 's lurid report into the squalid details of the former president 's sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky were published on the internet in 1998 .
Despite his long and loyal friendship with the Clintons , Mr Craig threw his lot in with Mr Obama at an early stage in the presidential election campaign .
As if that betrayal to the cause of the Clinton restoration was not enough , Mr Craig did more to undermine Mrs Clinton 's claims to be a foreign policy expert than anyone else in the some of the ugliest exchanges of the battle for the Democratic nomination .
Until this week he was poised to be the eminence grise of the State Department , organising as total revamp of America 's troubled foreign policies on Mr Obama 's behalf .
Its turns out that Mrs Clinton 's delay in accepting the president elect 's offer to be his top foreign policy adviser had much to do with her negotiating the terms of the job and insisting on the right to choose her own state department staff and possibly even some of the plumb Ambassador postings .
She wanted guarantees of direct access to the president – without having to go through his national security adviser .
Above all she did not want to end up like Colin Powell who was completely out - manoeuvred by the hawkish Vice President Dick Cheney who imposed neo-conservative friends like John Bolton on the State Department and steered the US towards a policy of using torture to achieve its aims .
Mr Craig 's crime was not so much that he enthusiastically backed Mr Obama for President and helped run his foreign policy advisory panel , it was his lacerating attacks on the putative Secretary of State 's claims that she passed the " Commander - in - Chief test " as a foreign policy expert in the Clinton Administration .
In a devastating memo of 11 March last , which he addressed " to interested parties , " Mr Craig said :
There is no reason to believe , however , that she was a key player in foreign policy at any time during the Clinton Administration .
She did not sit in on National Security Council meetings .
She did not have a security clearance .
She did not attend meetings in the Situation Room .
She did not manage any part of the national security bureaucracy , nor did she have her own national security staff . "
" She did not do any heavy - lifting with foreign governments , whether they were friendly or not .
She never managed a foreign policy crisis , and there is no evidence to suggest that she participated in the decision - making that occurred in connection with any such crisis . "
The memo went on to say that Mrs Clinton " never answered the phone either to make a decision on any pressing national security issue – not at 3 AM or at any other time of day . "
Earlier this week Mr Craig was tapped to become White House counsel , a totally anonymous position , and shunted him out of the line of fire from the Secretary of State .
A question remains about the fate of Susan Rice , the public face of Mr Obama 's foreign policy throughout the campaign .
She too had been expected to take a prominent position at the State department , but in a conference call with reporters during the campaign she ridiculed Mr Clinton 's claims to foreign Policy experience .
She may now end up as Deputy national Security adviser to the president , in the expectation that she would be frozen out by Mrs Clinton at the State Department , a situation that does not augur well for the future .

1 Plitvice Lakes ( Croatia ) : Sixteen Lakes interconnected by Spectacular Waterfalls
The Plitvice Lakes are a series of sixteen lakes interconnected by spectacular waterfalls , set in a deep woodland and populated by deers , bears , wolves , boars and rare bird species .
A UNESCO World Heritage Site , the lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours , ranging from azure to green , grey or blue .
The colours change constantly depending on the quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of sunlight .
2 Boiling Lake ( Dominica ) : A Flooded Fumarole
The Boiling Lake is situated in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park , Dominica ’s World Heritage site .
It is a flooded fumarole , or hole in the earth ’s surface , 10.5 km east of Roseau , Dominica , on the Caribbean .
It is filled with bubbling greyish - blue water that is usually enveloped in a cloud of vapor .
The lake is approximately 60 m across .
3 Red Lagoon ( Bolivia ) : Red ( algae ) +
White ( borax )
The Laguna Colorada ( Red Lagoon ) is a shallow salt lake in the southwest of the altiplano of Bolivia , close to the border with Chile .
The lake contains borax islands , whose white color contrasts nicely with the reddish color of its waters , caused by red sediments and pigmentation of some algae .
4 Five - Flower Lake ( China ) : Beautiful Multi-Coloured Lake with Fallen Tree Trunks
The Wuhua Hai , or Five - Flower Lake , is the signature of the Jiuzhaigon National Park in China .
The lake is a shallow multi-coloured lake whose bottom is littered with fallen tree trunks .
The water is so clear that you can see the trunks clearly .
The water comes in different shares of turquoise , from yellowish to green , to blue .
It is located at an elevation of 2472 meters , below Panda Lake and above the Pearl Shoal Waterfall .
5 Dead Sea ( Israel and Jordan ) : Lowest Point on Earth
The Dead Sea is a salt lake situated between Israel and the West bank to the west , and Jordan to the east .
It is 420 meters ( 1,378 ft ) below sea level and its shores are the lowest point on the surface of the Earth on dry land .
The Dead Sea is 330 m ( 1,083 ft ) deep , the deepest hypersaline lake in the world .
It is also the world ’s second saltiest body of water , after Lake Assal in Djibouti , with 30 percent salinity .
It is 8.6 times saltier than the ocean .
This salinity makes for a harsh environment where animals cannot flourish and boats cannot sail .
The Dead Sea is 67 kilometers ( 42 mi ) long and 18 kilometers ( 11 mi ) wide at its widest point .
It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley , and its main tributary is the Jordan River .
The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years .
Biblically , it was a place of refuge for King David .
It was one of the world ’s first health resorts ( for Herod the Great ) , and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products , from balms for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers .
6 Lake Baikal ( Russia ) : Deepest and Oldest Lake in the World
Lake Baikal is located in Southern Siberia in Russia , and it ’s also known as the “ Blue Eye of Siberia ” .
It contains more water than all the North American Great Lakes combined .
At 1,637 meters ( 5,371 ft ) , Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world , and the largest freshwater lake in the world by volume , holding approximately twenty percent of the world ’s total fresh water .
However , Lake Baikal contains less than one third the amount of water as the Caspian Sea which is the largest lake in the world .
Lake Baikal was formed in an ancient rift valley and therefore is long and crescent - shaped with a surface area ( 31,500 km² ) slightly less than that of Lake Superior or Lake Victoria .
Baikal is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals , two thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 .
At more than 25 million years old , it is the oldest lake in the world .
7 Lake Titicaca ( Bolivia and Peru ) : World ’s Highest Navigable Lake
Lake Titicaca is a lake located on the border of Bolivia and Peru .
It sits 3,812 m ( 12,500 ft ) above sea level making it the highest commercially navigable lake in the world .
By volume of water it is also the largest lake in South America .
Lake Titicaca is fed by rainfall and meltwater from glaciers on the sierras that abut the Altiplano .
8 Caspian Sea ( Russia ) : World ’s Largest Lake
The Caspian Sea is the world ’s largest lake or largest inland body of water in the world , and accounts for 40 to 44 percent of the total lacustrine waters of the world .
With a surface area of 394,299 km² ( 152,240 mi² ) , it has a surface area greater than the next six largest lakes combined .
9 Crater Lake ( USA ) : its waters are considered one of the World ’s Most Clearest
Crater Lake is a caldera lake located in Oregon ; due to several unique factors , most prominently that it has no inlets or tributaries , the waters of Crater Lake are considered one of the world ’s most clearest .
The lake partly fills a nearly 4,000 foot ( 1,220 m ) deep caldera that was formed around 5,677 ( ± 150 ) BC by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama .
Its deepest point has been measured at 1,949 feet ( 594 m ) deep , making it the deepest lake in the United States , and the ninth deepest in the world .
10 Lake Karachay ( Russia ) : Most Polluted Spot on Earth
Lake Karachay is a small lake in the southern Ural mountains in western Russia .
Starting in 1951 the Soviet Union used Karachay as a dumping site for radioactive waste from Mayak , the nearby nuclear waste storage and reprocessing facility , located near the town of Ozyorsk .
According to a report by the Washington , D.C. - based Worldwatch Institute on nuclear waste , Karachay is the “ most polluted spot ” on Earth .
The lake accumulated some 4.44 exabecquerels ( EBq ) of radioactivity , including 3.6 EBq of Caesium - 137 and 0.74 EBq of Strontium - 90 .
For comparison , the Chernobyl disaster released from 5 to 12 EBq of radioactivity , however this radiation is not concentrated in one location .
I KNOW Sarah Palin , and so does my wife .
Neither of us ever actually met the governor of Alaska , but we grew up with her – in the small - town America despised by the leftwing elite .
One gal - pal classmate of my wife ’s has even traveled from New York ’s Finger Lakes to Alaska to hunt moose with her husband .
( Got one , too . )
And no , Ms. Streisand , she is n’t a redneck missing half her teeth – she ’s a lawyer .
The sneering elites and their mediacrat fellow travelers just do n’t get it :
How on earth could anyone vote for someone who did n’t attend an Ivy League school ?
And having more than 1.7 children marks any woman as a rube .
( If Palin had any taste , her teenage daughter would ’ve had a quiet abortion in a discreet facility . )
And what kind of retro-Barbie would stay happily married to her high - school sweetheart ?
Ugh .
She even kills animals and eats them .
( The meat and fish served in the upscale bistros patronized by Obama supporters appears by magic – it did n’t really come from living things .
. .)
Palin has that hick accent , too .
And that busy - mom beehive ‘ do .
Double ugh !
Bet she has n’t even read Ian McEwan ’s latest novel and ca n’t explain Frank Gehry ’s vision for a new architecture .
She and her blue - collar ( triple ugh ! ) husband do n’t even own a McMansion , let alone an inherited family compound on the Cape .
And she wants to be vice president ?
The opinion - maker elites see Sarah Palin clearly every time they look up from another sneering article in The New Yorker :
She ’s a country - bumpkin chumpette from a hick state with low latte availability .
She ’s not one of them and never will be .
That ’s the real disqualifier in this race .
Now let me tell you what those postmodern bigots with their multiple vacation homes and their disappointing trust - fund kids do n’t see :
Sarah Palin ’s one of us .
She actually represents the American people .
When The New York Times , CNN , the NBC basket of basket cases and all the barking blog dogs insult Palin , they ’re insulting us .
When they smear her , they ’re smearing every American who actually works for a living , who does n’t expect a handout , who does n’t have a full - time accountant to parse the family taxes , who believes in the Pledge of Allegiance and who thinks a church is more than just a tedious stop on daughter Emily ’s 100 K wedding day .
Go ahead , faux feminists and Hollywood deep thinkers : Snicker at Sarah America ’s degree from the University of Idaho , but remember that most Americans did n’t attend Harvard or Princeton as a legacy after daddy donated enough to buy his kid ’s way in .
Go ahead , campaign strategists : Mock Americans who go to church and actually pray .
But you might want to run the Census numbers first .
And go right ahead : Dismiss all of us who remember how , on the first day of deer season , our high school classrooms were half empty ( not a problem at Andover or Exeter ) .
That rube accent of Palin’s ?
It ’s a howler .
But she sounds a lot more like the rest of us than a Harvard man or a Smithie ever will .
Why does Sarah Palin energize all of us who do n’t belong to the gilded leftwing circle ?
Because she ’s us .
We sat beside her in class .
We hung out after school ( might ’ve even shared a backseat combat zone on prom night ) .
And now she lives next door , raising her kids .
For the first time since Ronald Reagan , our last great president , we , the people , see a chance that one of us might have a voice in governing our country .
Speaking of Reagan ( Eureka College , Illinois ) , every chief executive we ’ve had since the Gipper snapped his final salute as president has had the imprimatur of an Ivy League university .
And we ’ve gone from bad to worse :
* George Herbert Walker Bush : Yale .
* William Jefferson Clinton : Georgetown , Oxford , Yale Law .
* George W. Bush : Yale and Harvard Business School .
The first lacked the sense to finish the job in Desert Storm ; the second lacked the guts to go after al Qaeda when it was just a startup – and the third , well , let ’s just say he disappointed our low expectations .
Now we have the Ivy League elite ’s “ he ’s not only like us but he ’s a minority and we ’re so wonderful to support him ” candidate , Sen. Barack Obama ( Columbia and Harvard Law ) .
Our country can’t afford another one of these clowns .
Harvard is n’t the answer – Harvard ’s the problem .
So here ’s the message Palin is sending on behalf of the rest of us ( the down - market masses Dems love at election time and ignore once the voting ’s done ) :
The rule of the snobs is over .
It ’s time to give one of us a chance to lead .
Sen . John McCain ‘s one of us , too .
He raised hell at Annapolis ( quadruple ugh : military ! ) , and he ’ll raise the right kind of hell in Washington .
McCain ’s so dumb he really loves his country .
Sarah Palin ’s dumb that way , too .
How terribly unfashionable .

Scaling Ruby – The Informative , 40 Minute Screencast
By Peter Cooper
Earlier this month , Rails Envy's Gregg Pollack gave a talk at RubyConf08 called Scaling Ruby ( without the Rails ) .
He answered questions like " How do existing Ruby applications use Threads / Processes to scale ? " , " How do we implement an Event Driven application using Ruby EventMachine ? " , " What are the current bottlenecks with speeding up Ruby and how can they be fixed ? " , and " What does Ruby 1.9 bring to the table to speed things up ? "
From what I hear , it was a very well received and informative session .
Not all of us could be at RubyConf08 , however , so Gregg has taken the whole Ruby scalability topic and put together a solid 40 minute screencast called Scaling Ruby ( note : it is NOT a recording of the talk - but a separate , professional production ) .
It costs $ 9 ( cheaper than RubyConf , of course ) but it 's a very solid primer on Ruby scaling issues .
Almost every topic is illustrated through Gregg 's unique diagrams , and he goes into depth on topics as diverse as event - based applications , threads , Rinda , process messaging , and even " dropping in to C " to write high performance sections of code .
I 've been very impressed with the quality of the EnvyCasts I 've seen so far , and this is no exception .
Lots of practical knowledge delivered in a memorable way .
$ 9 will still seem too rich to many - especially those who think all forms of documentation and instruction should be free ( as in speech and beer ) - but if it takes Gregg and Jason 's fine commercial attempts to encourage others to produce higher quality , free documentation , I 'm all for it !
They also have screencasts covering Rails 2.2 ( see the Rails Inside review ) and ActiveRecord .
( Disclaimer : I 've received free , promotional copies of the EnvyCasts for review .
I have no other relationship - financial or otherwise - with the Rails Envy guys , other than being one of the first to promote them back in the day - does n't time fly ! )

Jon Stewart to Fox host : ' You and Shep ... have your moments ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This When Fox News 's Chris Wallace appeared on the Daily Show on Wednesday , Jon Stewart was prepared with footage to confront him on Fox 's unrepentant Obama - bashing .
However , Wallace revealed himself to be fully aware of Fox 's biases and even admitted he had been moved by Barack Obama 's election .
Wallace began by announcing that when Karl Rove brought cookies in the shape of a Fox News screen to the set on election night , he had handed two to Wallace , saying , " This one , specifically , give to Jon Stewart . "
Stewart took the cookie nervously , as if wondering whether it might explode in his hands .
When Wallace insisted that he eat it on the spot , Stewart responded solemnly , " Let me tell you something .
...
Let me tell you why I 'll eat it .
Karl Rove can't hurt me any more . "
" I have to say this , " Stewart went on to acknowledge -- as Wallace protested " you 're going to get me in trouble " -- " you and Shep Smith both have your moments . "
Smith recently berated " Joe the Plumber " Wurzelbacher for saying that an Obama presidency would mean " death to Israel " and called out Ralph Nader for using the phrase " Uncle Tom . "
" We 're all very happy , " Wallace replied to Stewart .
" Except for Sean Hannity , who 's too busy in the bathroom crying . "
" The last week , bless their hearts , they tried so hard , " Stewart suggested sweetly .
" ACORN was a legitimate story , " insisted Wallace straight - faced , after which both men broke up in laughter .
Stewart then showed Wallace " a little compendium of , like , the last two days on Fox News . "
The clips included the introductions to an hour - long feature on " Obama & Friends : History of Radicalism , " a story asking " Will Senator Obama deliberately bankrupt the coal industry if he becomes president ? " and segments on Rashid Khalidi , Rev. Wright , and " whether or not Obama 's half - aunt is registered to vote . "
" You did n't see our coverage , " challenged Wallace , " because you and Stephen Colbert were crying when at 11 o'clock when they announced the president . "
" Yes , imagine people having human emotions to an historic moment , " Stewart retorted , as the audience erupted in cheers .
" Imagine a country coming full circle from slavery and that affecting me on a deeply personal level . "
" Coming over here seemed like such a good idea 45 minutes ago , " Wallace confessed ruefully .
However , he quickly snapped back and asked Stewart , " Do you really think that Barack Obama is not going to mess up like every other politician ? "
Stewart explained that for him , despite Obama 's imperfections , " For the first time since I can remember , and this includes the Clintons , somebody is speaking in a manner that matches my sensory perceptions .
...
This guy speaks , I recognize him as human . "
Wallace acknowledged in response , " Honestly ?
I am excited .
...
Anybody who was a child of the civil rights movement and of the 60's ...
I never thought I would see it in my life , and I think it 's wonderful for the country .
... I hope he does great . "
" For a second there ... you looked like you were welling up , " observed Stewart .

Filmmaker and animator David O’Reilly ( who came up with the concept for iHologram ) has noticed an interesting property in this animated GIF :
He writes :
While working in 3D last year , I discovered this optical illusion : A large grid seen rotating at a certain speed will appear to group itself into smaller grids , spinning independently .
See O’Reilly ’s website for more examples ( and his theory on why this happens ) .
For more optical illusions , watch Al Seckel ’s TEDTalk on how easily we are fooled ; or Dan Dennett ’s talk on our gullible minds .
As Dennett says , we need to understand how easily we are fooled , in order to understand the nature of consciousness itself .
Washington D.C. ( July 6 , 2008 ) " Twenty - five family farm , dairy , and consumer groups sent a letter on June 26 to the Senate Judiciary Committee requesting immediate public hearings and oversight of the nation 's largest dairy cooperative , Dairy Farmers of America , concerning antitrust abuses and rampant corruption .
Recent articles in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal in May exposed former DFA CEO Gary Hanman 's covert and illegal payment of $ 1 million to former DFA Board Chairman Herman Brubaker .
DFA is now under investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , while the two - year investigation into DFA completed by the Department of Justice 's Antitrust Division has yet to see the light of day due to the U.S. Attorney General 's Office repeated stonewalling and refusal to bring the case forward .
National Family Farm Coalition Dairy Subcommittee member Donna Hall , a Pennsylvania dairy farmer , said , " As a farmer who was forced to do business with DFA , it is extremely frustrating and outrageous that the DOJ refuses to bring the DFA case forward after years of work by U.S. antitrust attorneys .
DFA has not been working for the interests of dairy farmers for a long time and the recent news revelations expose just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DFA 's criminal behavior .
I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee can finally look into DFA 's detrimental impact on our dairy industry .
Dairy farmer and Ohio Farmers Union vice - president Bryan Wolfe said , " For the sake of our rural communities , we need the Senate Judiciary Committee to take immediate action in seeking justice for America 's dairy farmers .
Dairy farmers have complained for years about DFA 's frightening market power and predatory business practices which have led to the demise of thousands of dairy farms and an increasingly consolidated industry that limits farmers ' options on where they can market their milk . "
Pennsylvania dairy farmer and Progressive Agriculture Organization member Brenda Cochran noted that many more organizations wanted to sign onto the letter , but fear of reprisal from DFA and loss of market access made them reluctant to do so .
Cochran disclosed , " Farmers are scared .
Our independent cooperatives remain silent out of fear as well .
DFA has basically intimidated so many of us while rewarding those farmers and associations who support its corrupt practices and wo n't rock the boat .
But we are sick and tired of DFA 's behavior and it's high time the U.S. Senate look into how DFA keeps hiding behind laws designed to protect farmer cooperatives when they have long ceased being a farmer - controlled coop . "
In addition to producers , consumers have also suffered from DFA 's antitrust violations .
Patty Lovera , Assistant Director of consumer group Food & Water Watch said , " Consumers impacted by the recent rise in milk prices and interested in having a safe , fresh , local supply of milk should be extremely concerned with the corrupt business practices of DFA .
Their antitrust tactics have driven dairy farmers out of business in many parts of the country , leaving consumers without local options and forced to pay higher prices for milk .
Neither farmers nor consumers have benefited from DFA 's control of the dairy markets . "
NFFC urges the Senate Judiciary Committee to exercise proper oversight into the activities of Dairy Farmers of America that have left the U.S. with only 60,000 remaining dairy farmers .

Linux Foundation has announced Linux Standard Base 4.0 beta .
LSB attempts to provide a consistent Linux platform for ISV’s .
These are a number of changes .
Following Red
Hat ’s efforts to consolidate on NSS , LSB has endorsed it as the cryptography solution as well as providing new distribution tests and tools for certification of third party applications .
This new version of LSB promises to accomplish these goals in a more powerful way .
“ We have a new set of LSB tools to make it much easier for ISVs to development applications that are LSB compliant , and to test to see how portable their applications are via the Linux Application Checker , ” Ted T’so , Chief Platform Strategist and Fellow with the Linux Foundation , explained .
The choice of NSS is driven by the need for better backward compatibility , FIPS certification and reduced maintenance costs .
Additionally , the new standard scripts are more portable and will help catch issues .
The second half of the fourth season of Battlestar Galactica start January 16 , and the Sci Fi Channel has a new promo out .
Fans should n’t be too disappointed .
New Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Promo as follows :
Sarah Evans is the director of communications at Elgin Community College ( ECC ) in Elgin , Illinois .
She also authors a PR and social media blog .
The inaugural celebration of International Baby Wearing Week also serves as a platform for the Motrin brand ’s launch of their new ads ( below ) targeting what else , “ baby wearing moms . ”
Touting the tagline “ we feel your pain , ” the Motrin IB ad in particular takes a snarky approach towards moms who carry babies in a pouch or sling .
And on the surface at least , the company accomplished the ultimate in outreach goals :
1. Reach target audience 2 .
Get them to engage in dialogue about your brand 3 .
Find way to track message and outreach
The Wrong Move
Sounds great , right ?
Wrong .
While the ads are the number one discussion trend on the microblogging platform , Twitter , the overall grade ?
A great big “ Fail Whale ” .
Avid Twitter user and mom , Jessica Gottlieb is the originator of the conversation via her Twitter network .
The dialogue ( and overwhelming outrage ) is growing exponentially .
Already there are thousands of comments on #motrinmoms and almost all are negative with many saying they will no longer use the brand name product .
It took only a few short hours to go viral .
Katja Presnal , founder of SkimbacoLifestyle.com and LadybugLandings.com , wants Motrin to know that the ads themselves are giving moms headaches .
Presnal says , “ Moms have brains , do n't treat us like that and learn to market for us .
We spend 75 % of our families ' money . ”
Will Motrin Respond ?
The world of social media is reaching a tipping point and my bet is yes , they will respond .
This is their opportunity to engage and connect with a powerful ( and influential ) audience .
( Perhaps the one they should have consulted before launching the ads ? )
So , what should they do first ?
1. Deliver an apology .
( From a person , not just the brand . )
2 . Offer an outlet for people ( not just the target audience ) to share their feelings and emotions – especially important – let people share how they felt when they watched the ads .
3 . Talk about what will change or be different ( and incorporate feedback ) 4 .
Get a social media presence !!!
If they do respond , their response will be blogged , chatted and tweeted about and will serve as a case study for social media engagement for years to come .
No pressure .
I ’m waiting with baited breath .
Sarah writes her own blog PRsarahevans.com and is the director of communications at Elgin Community College ( ECC ) in Elgin , Illinois .
She also worked for Advocate Health Care , the largest health care system in Illinois , as the manager of communications and government relations at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital .
She brings a comprehensive background in the knowledge of non -for - profit and health care management .
Oil is far below the record of $ 147 a barrel reached in July
Opec energy ministers have decided to leave oil production quotas unchanged after talks in the Egyptian capital following falls in the price of oil .
Opec President Chakib Khelil said any such decision would be made at a meeting in Algeria next month .
The price of a barrel of oil has tumbled to below $ 55 after peaking at a record $ 147 in mid-July .
Opec members have lost billions of dollars as demand has dropped in the face of the global economic downturn .
Opec member Venezuela favours a cut in output of a million barrels a day to try to boost prices .
But several Opec ministers had already dampened expectations that a cut in production would be announced this weekend .
Balancing demand
After Saturday 's meeting , Opec President Chakib Khelil said ministers had agreed " to take any additional action on 17 December to balance oil supply and demand " .
Falls in demand in the US , the world 's top energy consumer , and other industrialised countries , have helped drive prices down from a record peak of more than $ 147 a barrel .
Opec , which accounts for 40 % of global oil production , cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day last month , but the move failed to stop prices from declining .
While cartel members have not ruled out making another output cut , some say the impact of the existing cuts still have to be felt .
" Combined with weakening non-Opec supplies , the projected ... output curtailment suggests that the oil market could actually tighten moving into 2009 , " Barclays Capital said in a research note .
From Mike Allen at Politico :
Retired Gen. Colin Powell , once considered a potential running mate for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , now may endorse his opponent , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , according to Republican sources .
But an air of mystery surrounds Powell ’s planned live appearance Sunday on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press , ” and no one is sure what he will say .
Powell ’s unassailable national security credentials could sway voters who are vacillating about whether Obama is ready to be commander in chief , and his endorsement of the Illinois senator would make a national security emphasis by McCain in the election ’s closing days extremely difficult .
Powell , 71 , a professional soldier for 35 years , has advised the last three Republican presidents .
The general ’s camp is being coy about what he might or might not say on Sunday .
But some McCain advisers suspect , without being sure , that Powell will endorse Obama .
“ It ’s going to make a lot of news , and certainly be personally embarrassing for McCain , ” a McCain official said .
“ It comes at a time when we need momentum , and it would create momentum against us . ”
Flip flops will replace " inappropriate " footwear say police
Late night revellers in a Devon resort are being offered flip - flops to help them get home .
Police in Torquay say it makes it easier for women , rather than struggling along in high heels .
Campaigners The Taxpayers ' Alliance said the £ 30,000 cost of the scheme was an " idiotic waste of money " .
Police say it is part of a wider package of the measures including advice on safer sex and a police team who have reduced crime .
The flip - flops , which will be given out from December , will have messages about safe alcohol limits printed on them .
The footwear will be paid for by £ 30,000 of funding secured from the Home Office by Safer Communities Torbay , an alliance of local authority , police and health services .
The scheme is the latest late - night policing idea in Torbay where " mop cops " order people who urinate in the street to clean up after themselves .
Matthew Elliott of the Taxpayers '
Alliance said : " This is an idiotic waste of money .
This is part of a forward - thinking , innovative partnership to make it a safer place to be
Supt Chris Singer
" People do n't pay taxes for drunk women to get free flip - flops , they want police to fight crime .
" Police are n't there to be an emergency supply of flat shoes . "
Supt Chris Singer , Torbay Police Commander , said the flip - flops were part of a wider campaign to make the area safer at night .
These included extra officers on duty at night in the harbour area and safer - sex advice , as well as the " mop cops " .
He said : " I would be surprised if the cost of the flip - flops was more than £ 200 .
" This is part of a forward - thinking , innovative partnership to make it a safer place to be . "
Teenage girls are particularly vulnerable to co-ruminating  and depression and anxiety  because “ there are so many stressors in adolescence and a lot are ambiguous , ” Dr. Rose added .
“ So things like starting dating or starting serious relationships with boys , concerns about cliques , being popular  these very social stressors , they can be really hard to control and they really lend themselves to rumination . ”
Dr. Rose first published a paper on co-rumination in 2002 , in the journal Child Development , and has , along with other psychologists , continued to study it .
In her study published last year , she followed 813 third - , fifth - , seventh - and ninth - grade girls and boys over six months .
Researchers at the State University at Stony Brook will soon publish another paper on co-rumination .
Both studies confirm Dr. Rose ’s earlier findings .
The relationships the experts looked at will certainly be familiar to many teenagers and parents .
Ms. Lee ’s daughter Tessa Lee-Thomas said she sometimes felt worse after talking to friends about problems .
“ Sometimes we get into disagreements , ” said Tessa , who lives in Prospect Heights , Brooklyn .
“ And we have to settle them .
My friends think that my other friend did something wrong , but she did n’t do something wrong .
Sometimes it makes the situation worse than where we were when we began .
It spiraled into something bigger than it was . ”
Patricia Letayf , a sophomore at Tufts University , said she tended to overanalyze situations and ask many different friends for advice about the same problem , which at times made her feel more anxious .
“ It ’s like you want to solve a problem whatever it may be , but the advice of one person never satisfies you and you ’re constantly on the hunt for more advice , ” she said .
“ I think a lot of times you are looking for empathy and you want someone to feel the way you do .
You want your feelings to be justified .
In the end , I hope to feel better .
You want them to say , ‘ It ’s O.K . he dumped you , you failed the test . ’
You ’re seeking reassurance . ”
Ms. Letayf , 19 , spent the summer as a camp counselor and said she noticed that the nine - year - old girls at the camp were already starting to obsess about their problems  talking about the boys at the camp and about conflicts between two groups of girls .
" It sounds to me like the level of rhetoric is a bit too high .
At the same time , it is not a non-issue .
It 's a real issue .
It 's just that there was an opportunity to fix this .
They [ the Republicans ] let it go to the last minute to get some headlines out of it . "
Election observers : Facebook , text messages aim to suppress youth turnout Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Traditional misinformation campaigns aimed at suppressing Election Day turnout have gone high tech , with some voters reporting misleading text message and Facebook updates listing the wrong day to vote .
The Election Protection Coalition says its representatives have fielded complaints from voters who were informed that Election Day had been moved to Wednesday .
It 's unclear precisely how many messages were sent , or who was behind the effort , but the medium suggests an effort to keep young voters away from the polls .
Some of the text messages are deliberately aimed at Democratic voters , saying that Obama supporters should cast ballots the day after Election Day , said Heather Smith , who 's been coordinating outreach efforts for Rock the Vote .
Rock the Vote has fielded complaints of inaccurate txt messages sent to Florida State Students and messages listing the wrong day to vote posted to several Facebook groups .
Smith said the high - tech efforts join more traditional means , such as fliers distributed in neighborhoods around Drexel University in Philadelphia warning that unpaid parking tickets could disqualify someone from voting .
Voters in a closely contested Virginia congressional district also received a forged flier last week that inaccurately said Democrats should vote on Wednesday .
Jonah Goldman , who directs the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law's National Campaign for Fair Elections , said observers noticed a similar pattern among many different means of suppression .
" We do n't have any evidence that there 's any coordination , " he said , although " the messages are identical throughout the country , the means are not identical . "
Rock the Vote 's Smith also said Rock the Vote was concerned that a polling place to serve students at Virginia Tech was six miles from the university , even though the precinct including the university was large enough to require two polling locations .
She would n't speculate whether the distance was part of an organized effort , but she did observe , " It sure feels like they 're trying to keep students away from voting in this very tight election . "

Proofs of a Conspiracy by John Robison [ 1798 ]
John Robison ( 1739 - 1805 ) was a Scottish scientist , who late in life wrote the one of the definitive studies of the Bavarian Illuminati .
He was a contemporary and collaborator with James Watt , with whom he worked on an early steam car , contributor to the 1797 Encylopedia Britannica , professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh , and inventor of the siren .
Although Robison was very much an advocate of science and rationalism , in later life , disillusioned by the French Revolution , he became an ardent monarchist .
In this work , Proofs of a Conspiracy , Robison laid the groundwork for modern conspiracy theorists by implicating the Bavarian Illuminati as responsible for the excesses of the French Revolution .
The Bavarian Illuminati , a rationalist secret society , was founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776 in what is today Germany .
They had an inner core of true believers , who secretly held radical atheist , anti-monarchist and possibly proto - feminist views , at that time considered beyond the pale .
They recruited by infiltrating the numerous ( and otherwise benign ) Freemasonic groups which were active at the time on the continent .
Necessarily they had a clandestine , compartmentalized , hierarchical organizational form , which has led some modern conspiracy theorists to identify them as the original Marxist - Leninist group .
However , this is most likely simply a case of parallel evolution .
Since we do n't have convenient access to the source documents of the Bavarian Illuminati we have to rely on Robison and the Abbé Barruel 's Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism , both in the ' opposing views ' category , for information on this group .
The Illuminati have today become a byword for a secret society which hoodwinks its junior members and puppet - masters society at large .
This reputation is in no little part due to Robison 's book .
However , reading between the lines , it becomes obvious that the Bavarian Illuminati were what the American Old Left called a ' talk shop , ' barely able to organize a picnic , let alone the Terror .
Instead , it seems , they were only expressing views widespread in intellectual circles of the day .
They were not , as Robison claims , the fuse that lit the downfall of the French Monarchy .
Nonetheless , this book make fascinating reading , and in conjunction with other historical accounts of the French Revolution , helps dimensionalize the period for students of history .
Production Notes :
This text was scanned from the retypeset 1967 Americanist Classics reprint , and the page numbering is from that edition .
The 1967 edition modernized the typography systematically , except on the dedication page ( particularly , substituting 's ' for ƒ) but left the original spelling intact .
Note that the 1967 edition makes no additional copyright claim on Robison 's text ( only on their modern introduction , which I have omitted ) .
US copyright law requires extensive creative changes to a public domain text to allow a new claim of copyright .
I have corrected in the usual way a few obvious typos ( which may have been introduced in the 1967 edition ) , but all of the non-conforming spelling has been tacitly preserved .
I have also added a ( public domain ) translation of the Latin epigram on the dedication page .
-- John Bruno Hare , November 18th 2006
While organizations like the Church of Latter - day Saints and the Knights of Columbus are getting gay flack for their roles in pushing Proposition 8 , which would overturn gay marriage in California , there ’s one man who deserves more public outcry : Howard F. Ahmanson .
The reclusive banking heir has given more money than any other individual – $ 800,000 .
And his mission ’s far more insidious than simply destroying same - sex marriage right .
He ’s looking to establish an entire Christian nation .
Max Blumenthal helps paint the horrific picture over at The Daily Beast :
While Ahmanson once resided in a mental institution in Kansas , he now occupies a position among the Christian right ’s power pantheon as one of the movement ’s most influential donors .
During a 1985 interview with the Orange County Register , Ahmanson summarized his political agenda : “ My goal is the total integration of biblical law into our lives . ”
Blumenthal goes on to explain that Ahmanson , has been heavily influenced by Armenian theorist R.J. Rushdoony , who wanted nothing more than to collapse the division between church and state :
Describing his philosophy as “ Christian Reconstructionism , ” Rushdoony painstakingly outlined plans for the church to take over the federal government and “ reconstruct ” it along biblical lines .
He provided detailed plans for how it would provide healthcare , pave roads and reorganize schools , and how it would mete out justice .
While certainly dangerous to the lavender set , Ahmanson ’s vision spells disaster for American democracy .
It ’s for that reason – among others – that he and his ilk must be defeated today .
They need to be taken down a notch .

The incriminating word had long been a land mine because of its potential to damage the presidential candidate making the accusation .
In 1988 , Senator Bob Dole , running for the Republican nomination , appeared on an NBC interview with his rival , Vice President George Bush , and snapped at him , “ Stop lying about my record . ”
It cemented an image of Mr. Dole as a meanie  which he had to wrestle with as the party ’s nominee in 1996 , when , for instance , some television viewers bristled as he accused Katie Couric of carrying water for the Democrats .
Neither Ms. Couric nor Tom Brokaw , the NBC interviewer in 1988 , tried to be an arbiter in those moments , leaving viewers to make up their own minds about Mr. Dole .
Mr. Kerry , meanwhile , hoped that the news media would judge a lie as a lie when he was battered by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth over his military record in Vietnam , but the media only did so much .
“ When politicians ignore a lie and it does n’t go away , they can be tainted , and when they deny it , they can sound defensive , ” said Geoff Stone , a University of Chicago law professor and an informal adviser to Mr. Obama .
“ Americans need someone who many people watch who has credibility and can be an independent arbiter  a Walter Cronkite , say  and there is n’t one . ”
Mr. Kerry ’s hesitancy may have been related to his constitutional disposition for Marquess of Queensbury rules ; the prep - school - bred , Yale - educated Brahmin was never comfortable with slashing attacks .
But mostly his concern was strategic : Mr. Bush enjoyed approval ratings of 50 percent or more in the fall of 2004 , and he was often ahead in the polls of a closely divided electorate .
“ We wanted to force a general election vote around the issues , especially domestic issues , and calling Bush a liar would have taken us off in a different direction , ” said Bob Shrum , Mr. Kerry ’s chief strategist .
Some Obama advisers were gun-shy early on about calling out an alleged lie  especially against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  but they snapped to it with Mr. McCain .
Mr. Obama himself , who has often spoken of elevating the political debate , still acts a little hesitant in his accusations : in Nevada last week , he would only say that a variety of McCain ads were “ patently wrong . ”
Whether he drops the L bomb in the televised debates over the next three weeks is now a point of discussion within the Obama campaign , aides say .
Saying that word in front of tens of millions of viewers could be a very risky proposition for the candidate running on a platform of hope .
No lie .

According to the New York Times , Social elites in Washington are busy gossiping about which fancy private school Barack Obama 's children will be going to .
In Britain ( where I 'm from ) , the prime minister would never send his children to a private school , as it would indicate a lack of faith in public education ( something every politician must be seen to advocate ) .
Obama has made a big deal about public education , and by sending his children to a private institution , it implies he does not believe in his own rhetoric .
Maybe the Obamas will make an example out of their children , sending them to the same type of school the majority of the population has to go to .
That would be change we could believe in .
A reader writes :
I live in Charlotte NC , where today is the first day of early voting .
I drove by two polling places before 8 this morning and they were both completely mobbed .
My husband has driven to two others in his attempt to vote today , and the scene has been so ridiculous that he has given up and will try again next week .
At two of the spots where he tried to vote , he witnessed and was approached by two exceedingly aggressive McCain / Palin volunteers who were pulling people out of line , handing out brochures , and telling them " You really need to think carefully about your vote .
If you plan to vote Obama , we would ask that you read this material and reconsider your vote . "
At one location , after approaching my husband aggressively , these volunteers were forcefully asked to leave by an employee and were told the police would be called if they did not cease and desist .
None of this is indicative of anything , obviously .
I just thought it was interesting .
I have voted in three presidential races since I have lived in Charlotte , and I have never been approached by anyone campaiging so close to a polling location .
Desperation , perhaps ?
Thank you for your interest in the Mercy Corps Action Center in Portland , OR .
Considering the impact of COVID ‑19 on public spaces and gatherings , we have made the difficult decision to close the Action Center and significantly scale back our public events at this time , effective immediately .
When and if it is deemed safe to have team members and visitors return to the Mercy Corps building , we will examine the best use of the Action Center space and how and if we move forward with public events in Portland .
Since 2009 , it has been an honor to host the Portland community at our headquarters , featuring lectures , panel discussions and other presentations , as well as thousands of youth in workshops exploring global challenges through the lens of a humanitarian organization .

Antifascist Calling
October 11 , 2008
Antifascist Calling reported October 6 that nine months prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks , Donald Rumsfeld signed off on revisions for the Pentagon ’s secretive Continuity of Operations Program ( COOP ) .
Under cover of the " war on terror , " driftnet surveillance and moves toward suppressing dissent , most recently on display when protests during the Democratic and Republican National Conventions were criminalized and organizers were charged with " domestic terrorism " under the Patriot Act , are but the tip of the proverbial iceberg .
Based on a document ( AR 500 - 3 ) published by the whistleblowing website Wikileaks , it described “ all hazards COOP planning ” as the mechanism by which “ the Army remains capable of continuing mission - essential operations during any situation , including military attack , terrorist activities , and natural or man-made disasters . ”
The Wikileaks document is all the more relevant since a September report in Army Times described how the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) would be deployed October 1 “ under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , ” the “ service component ” of NORTHCOM .
Since that article appeared September 8 , Army Times has done a partial climb - down and now claims that the “ non-lethal crowd control package ” described earlier for operations in the heimat , “ is intended for use on deployments to the war zone , not in the U.S. , as previously stated . ”
But this mendacious claim by Army Times is belied by current political trends in the U.S.
Under cover of the “ war on terror , ” driftnet surveillance and moves toward suppressing dissent , most recently on display when protests during the Democratic and Republican National Conventions were criminalized and organizers were charged with “ domestic terrorism ” under the Patriot Act , are but the tip of the proverbial iceberg .
Wholesale spying on activists by the Pentagon ’s now defunct Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) , as well as revelations that State police agencies in Maryland routinely spied on antiwar organizers , shared this information with the National Security Agency and classified them as “ terrorists ” in government - run databases , are viewed as exemplary means to “ keep the rabble in line ” –and under wraps , if necessary .
A highly - disturbing report by Christopher Ketchum in the May / June 2008 issue of Radar Magazine , outlined how the top secret Main Core database linked to Continuity of Government contingency planning , “ includes dissidents and activists of various stripes , political and tax protesters , lawyers and professors , publishers and journalists , gun owners , illegal aliens , foreign nationals , and a great many other harmless , average people . ”
Reporting in July for Salon , investigative journalist Tim Shorrock was told by a source that Main Core is “ ‘ an emergency internal security database system ’ designed for use by the military in the event of a national catastrophe , a suspension of the Constitution or the imposition of martial law .
Its name … is derived from the fact that it contains ‘ copies of the ‘ main core ’ or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community ’. ”
As the historic economic and political crisis gripping capitalism deepens and intensifies , and as stop - gap measures deployed by the U.S. Treasury Department intended to shore - up the crumbling financial sector crash , one by one , “ forward thinking ” ruling class factions are openly preparing a “ Pinochet option ” for the American people .
In this context , the militarization of domestic law enforcement is now coupled with the military ’s own rapid development and deployment of “ non-lethal weapons ” systems which inevitably , will be “ shared ” with civilian police for “ crowd control . ”
As with data mining , DHS spy - satellite surveillance , blanket CCTV coverage of American cities , illegal FBI deployment of infiltrators and provocateurs , “ mission creep ” by the Pentagon into civil affairs are signs that stronger measures to blunt the crisis may be in the offing .
( For more on the Pentagon ’s development of NLW ’s , see : Antifascist Calling , “ ‘ Non-Lethal ’ Weapons : Where Science and Technology Service Repression , ” July 8 , 2008 ; and , Antifascist Calling , “ The Calmative Before the Storm , ” July 12 , 2008 )
During the recent Vibrant Response exercise at Fort Stewart , Georgia , three units of NORTHCOM ’s Consequence Management Response Force ( CCMRF , pronounced “ sea- smurfs ” ) , including two combat units from the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 3rd Army Division and the elite 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade participated in mock drills designed to “ coordinate with local governments and interagency organizations such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency , ” according to a report on U.S. Northern Command News .
Interestingly enough , Fort Stewart is also the site of a top secret NSA listening post that routinely “ intercepted and transcribed satellite phone calls of American civilians in the Middle East for the NSA , ” according to a whistleblower and former Arab linguist attached to the illegal NSA project , Wired reports .
Code - named “ Operation Highlander , ” the top secret program was initiated in the wake of the September 11 attacks on orders from the Bush administration .
According to Wired ,
If the allegations are true , it would seem to indicate that warrantless spying of Americans approved by President Bush following 9/11 expanded rapidly beyond U.S. borders to citizens overseas , notwithstanding United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18 , or USSID 18 –an NSA rule that bars overseas surveillance of Americans without authorization and probable cause .
( Kim Zetter , “ Inside Operation Highlander , ” Wired , October 10 , 2008 )
While the ostensible purpose of Vibrant Response was to wargame scenarios where chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , or high - yield explosive incidents ( CBRNE ) were launched “ in the nation ’s heartland , ” what other events could trigger the declaration of a “ national security emergency , ” or even martial law in the U.S. ?
As Amy Goodman reported in a column for Democracy Now !
Military participation in domestic operations was originally outlawed with the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878 .
The John Warner National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2007 , however , included a section that allowed the president to deploy the armed forces to “ restore public order ” or to suppress “ any insurrection . ”
While a later bill repealed this , President Bush attached a signing statement that he did not feel bound by the repeal .
( “ Invasion of the Sea - Smurfs , ” Democracy Now ! , October 2 , 2008 )
As I pointed out in my October 6 article , current Army doctrine is heavily - weighted towards contingency planning for “ civil disturbances . ”
While these programs are not new and in fact , plans such as Garden Plot and Cable Splicer have been integral to military doctrine since the late 1960s , what is new–and highly disturbing –is the launch of NORTHCOM ’s Joint Task Force Civil Support ( JTF - CS ) .
Located at Ft. Monroe in Hampton , Virginia , JTF - CS is described on NORTHCOM ’s website as “ a subordinate command of U.S. Northern Command , a unified combatant command formed in October 2002 to plan , organize and execute both homeland defense and civil support missions . ”
While NORTHCOM claims that JTF - CS would be deployed “ only after a Governor requests federal assistance from the President , and after the President issues a Presidential Disaster Declaration , ” the Bush signing statement as well as secret annexes in updated Continuity of Government planning documents , National Security Presidential Directive 51 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 ( NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 ) means , as Commander - in - Chief ,
The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government .
In order to advise and assist the President in that function , the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism ( APHS / CT ) is hereby designated as the National Continuity Coordinator . …
Federal Government COOP , COG , and ECG plans and operations shall be appropriately integrated with the emergency plans and capabilities of State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure , as appropriate , in order to promote interoperability and to prevent redundancies and conflicting lines of authority .
The Secretary of Homeland Security shall coordinate the integration of Federal continuity plans and operations with State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure , as appropriate , in order to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency .
( The White House , President George W. Bush , NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 , May 7 , 2007 )
It should be kept in mind that top secret annexes of this document have been withheld from Congress , despite repeated requests–and legal oversight requirements –by the House Homeland Security Committee , as Peter Dale Scott reported in March for CounterPunch .
NORTHCOM avers that ,
The Primary Federal Agency [ PFA ] is the federal civilian agency designated to coordinate and direct the government ’s response to a disaster or emergency situation .
Presidential Decision Directive 39 designated the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the PFA for managing the consequences of CBRNE events .
In most instances , FEMA will be the PFA , however , the Federal Bureau of Investigation serves as the PFA for crisis management in events designated as an act of terrorism .
Although the JTF - CS supports the PFA throughout a CBRNE consequence management operation , the unit operates within a clear Department of Defense chain of command .
( U.S. Northern Command , Joint Task Force Civil Support , FAQ , no date )
In other words , although civilian agencies are the nominal PFA ’s during a “ disaster or emergency situation , ” JTF - CS “ operates within a clear Department of Defense chain of command ” that begins and ends with the Executive Branch , that is , the President in his role as the leader of the “ unitary executive branch ” and Commander - in - Chief .
Were a “ national emergency ” of any kind declared by the President , rules governing Continuity of Government operations would place civilian agencies , including “ State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure , ” under the effective control of the military .
This is clearly delineated in Department of Defense Directive 3025.12 ( DoD 3025.12 ) , “ Military Assistance for Civil Disturbances ( MACDIS ) ” :
Ensure continuous planning by the DoD Components , both in the Department of Defense and in cooperation with civil government agencies for MACDIS operations that may be required during any time or condition of peace , war , or transition to war , including any national security emergency . …
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The President is authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States to employ the Armed Forces of the United States to suppress insurrections , rebellions , and domestic violence under various conditions and circumstances .
Planning and preparedness by the Federal Government and the Department of Defense for civil disturbances are important due to the potential severity of the consequences of such events for the Nation and the population .
Military resources may be employed in support of civilian law enforcement operations in the 50 States , the District of Columbia , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , and the U.S. territories and possessions only in the parameters of the Constitution and laws of the United States and the authority of the President and the Secretary of Defense , including delegations of that authority through this Directive or other means .
The primary responsibility for protecting life and property and maintaining law and order in the civilian community is vested in the State and local governments .
Supplementary responsibility is vested by statute in specific Agencies of the Federal Government other than the Department of Defense .
The President has additional powers and responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States to ensure that law and order are maintained .
( “ Military Assistance for Civil Disturbances [ MACDIS ] , ” Department of Defense Directive , No. 3025.12 , February 4 , 1994 , pp. 1 , 3 ) [ emphasis added ]
The Executive Branch ’s leading role in MACDIS operations are underscored by the following :
Delegations of Authority .
The Secretary of Defense shall be assisted in executing his responsibility for MACDIS by the following :
The Secretary of the Army shall be the DoD Executive Agent and shall act for the Secretary of Defense in accordance with this Directive and any supplemental direction or guidance received from the Secretary of Defense .
In that capacity , the DoD Executive Agent shall develop planning guidance , plans , and procedures for MACDIS , in accordance with this Directive .
The DoD Executive Agent has the authority of the Secretary of Defense to task the DoD Components to plan for and to commit DoD resources , in response to requests from civil authorities under MACDIS .
The DoD Executive Agent shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff any commitment of Military Forces assigned to the Combatant Commands .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall communicate to the Commanders of the Combatant Commands appropriate guidance issued by the DoD Executive Agent for their compliance with this Directive , and also shall assist the DoD Executive Agent in developing MACDIS planning guidance for all conditions of war or attacks on the United States or its territories . …
For response to domestic terrorist incidents and other purposes , the DoD Executive Agent shall obtain authority from the Secretary of Defense for any employment of U.S. counterterrorism forces .
The DoD Executive Agent shall coordinate with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff any request , contingency plan , directive , or order affecting the employment of such forces and , simultaneously , shall provide all applicable information to the Assistant Secretary of Defense ( Special Operations and Low - Intensity Conflict ) , who provides policy oversight for the Secretary of Defense , in accordance with DoD Directive 5138.3 ( reference ( h ) ) .
The Secretary of Defense reserves the authority to modify or terminate the Executive Agency established by this Directive if operational needs so require in a particular situation .
( MACDIS , op . cit. , pp. 5 - 6 )
What those “ operational needs ” are that might require the Secretary of Defense to “ modify or terminate ” the “ Executive Agency ” are not specified in the MACDIS Directive .
However , in this regard , it is clear that a leading role of U.S. military “ civil disturbance ” operations will be assumed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) and not a “ Prime Federal Authority , ” that is a civilian agency .
The JCS will ,
In coordination with the DoD Executive Agent , facilitate communications by the DoD Executive Agent with Commanders of Combatant Commands , as appropriate .
Ensure the compatibility of MACDIS plans with other military plans .
Assist in the DoD Executive Agent ’s determination of military units and capabilities sufficient for all contingencies of the GARDEN PLOT plan .
Support training for and coordinated evaluation of MACDIS plans and capabilities by the Commanders of the Combatant Commands through exercises or other means , as appropriate .
( MACDIS , op. cit. , pp. 10 - 11 )
Clearly , NORTHCOM ’s Vibrant Response exercise , initiated by the Joint Task Force - Civil Support falls under the broad purview of Garden Plot and other planning “ contingencies . ”
In terms of dealing with a “ national security emergency ” declared by the Executive Branch under rules governing Continuity of Government operations , DoD 3025.12 describes “ civil disturbances ” as ,
Group acts of violence and disorders prejudicial to public law and order in the 50 States , the District of Columbia , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , the U.S. possessions and territories , or any political subdivision thereof .
The term “ civil disturbance ” includes all domestic conditions requiring the use of Federal Armed Forces under this Directive .
( MACDIS , op. cit. , p. 17 )
Would , let ’s say , the eruption of mass protests as a result of a stolen presidential election or mass actions as a legitimate and exemplary civilian response to limiting bank withdrawals , a freeze on Social Security payments , a prohibition on strikes or the declaration of a “ national security emergency ” as a result of prerevolutionary challenges to the legitimacy of federal authority ( as took place in Argentina in 2000 during that nation ’s economic meltdown ) trigger MACDIS and other Continuity of Government operations ?
DoD 3025.12 states , “ Under reference ( r ) , the terms “ major disaster ” and “ emergency ” are defined substantially by action of the President in declaring that extant circumstances and risks justify Presidential implementation of the legal powers in those statutes . ”
In other words , “ extant circumstances ” are “ defined substantially ” by the President .
Once triggered by Executive Order , the scope of operations undertaken by the military acting as the enforcement arm of the “ unitary executive branch ” are virtually unlimited .
Under these rules , martial law , suspension of habeas corpus , indefinite detention would render lawful rules guiding a constitutional republic moot ; mere footnotes written on the “ blank page ” of America ’s “ new normal , ” what Naomi Klein has termed “ disaster capitalism . ”
Klein writes ,
A more accurate term for the system that erases the boundaries between Big Government and Big Business is not liberal , conservative or capitalist , but corporatist .
Its main characteristics are huge transfers of public wealth to private hands , often accompanied by exploding debt , an ever - widening chasm between the dazzling rich and the disposable poor and an aggressive nationalism that justifies unlimited spending on security .
For those inside the bubble of extreme wealth created by such an arrangement , there can be no more profitable way to organize a society .
But because of the obvious drawbacks for the vast majority of the population left outside the bubble , other features of the corporatist state tend to include aggressive surveillance ( once again , with government and large corporations trading favors and contracts ) , mass incarceration , shrinking civil liberties and often , though not always , torture .
( The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , New York : Metropolitan Books , 2007 , p. 15 )
Now that the economic bubble for the vast majority of Americans has burst , “ shrinking civil liberties ” are rushing headlong towards the vanishing point .
While DoD 3025.12 states that “ any employment of Military Forces in support of law enforcement operations shall maintain the primacy of civilian authorities , ” as noted above JTF - CS “ operates within a clear Department of Defense chain of command , ” answerable to the President , the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army as the “ DoD Executive Agent for MACDIS . ”
Clearly , a “ terrorist attack ” or “ any national security emergency ” so designated by the President would trigger MACDIS guidance for “ civilian law enforcement operations ” and fall under the purview of NORTHCOM and JTF - CS as “ a subordinate command ” and would play a leading role in responding to “ any national security emergency ” declared by the President .
Despite the repeal of the “ Insurrection Act Rider ” to the 2007 Defense Appropriations bill that gave the President sweeping emergency power to deploy the military for any “ condition ” he might cite , not merely a terrorist atrocity or CBRNE “ event , ” the Bush “ signing statement ” reported by Amy Goodman above , effectively nullified Congress ’ intent not to give the president carte blanche to station U.S. troops on American streets .
While NORTHCOM insists that JTF - CS , “ will not be called upon to help with law enforcement , civil disturbance or crowd control , but will be used to support lead agencies involved in saving lives , ” as I have outlined above , citing the DoD ’s own documents and Executive Branch National Security Presidential Directives , contingency plans for suppressing “ civil disturbance ” such as the Garden Plot scenario are , like an iron fist inside a velvet glove , already in place and capable at a moment ’s notice of striking the American people .
During these dark times , it is well - worth recalling the sage advice of the great American revolutionary Thomas Jefferson :
The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government .

The media ’s finally starting to vet acquaintances of Barack Obama .
Wurzelbacher registered as an apprentice with the Ohio State Apprenticeship Council in November 2003 , according to Dennis Evans , spokesman with the Department of Job and Family Services .
Records show his training , which was sponsored by A & W Newell Co. of Toledo , should have been wrapped last year .
“ We do n’t have a record of completion , ” Evans said .
“ All we know is that he registered in the program and has gone through to the point where we should have record of completion , but we do n’t . ”
And that ’s not the only record that ’s missing from Wurzelbacher ’s file .
He does n’t have a plumbing license required by the city of Toledo to practice , according to a staffer with the Toledo Division of Building Inspection .
Wurzelbacher , who now works for Newell Plumbing & Heating Co. , said the owner , Al Newell , has a plumbing license and that “ because he works for someone else , he does n’t need a license . ”
But even that ’s not true , according to the Toledo Division of Building Inspection .
Wurzelbacher can’t legally do plumbing work without a license , regardless of his boss ’s certification .
A staff person with the Toledo Division of Building Inspection told On Call this afternoon that her division will contact Wurzelbacher to notify him that he can’t work without a license .
“ We ’re trying to track him down , ” she said .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - False rumors that Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim or had ties to Islamic extremism angered Muslim - Americans , who overwhelming supported him in Tuesday ’s presidential election , experts said on Thursday .
President - elect Senator Barack Obama speaks to supporters during his election night rally after being declared the winner of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Campaign in Chicago , November 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
Unpublished polling data indicated that the Democratic President - elect got somewhere between 67 percent and 90 percent of the Muslim vote , probably nearer the higher end , Ahmed Younis of Gallup Center for Muslim Studies , said in a telephone briefing .
A “ watershed ” moment for U.S. Muslims occurred in mid-October , he said , when former Secretary of State Colin Powell , a Republican who endorsed Obama , addressed the Obama - is - a - Muslim rumors which had circulated for months , and condemned the idea that this would be a slur .
“ Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? ” Powell asked on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ The answer ’s no , that ’s not America ...
Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion ‘ he ’s a Muslim and he might be associated with terrorists . ’”
Younis said that for U.S. Muslims
Powell ’s comment capped a decades - long search “ to become part and parcel of the nation . ”
Muslims make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population of 305 million , according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , though some believe that number is low .
Obama , whose father was Kenyan and whose mother was a white woman from Kansas , has the middle name Hussein , and lived for part of his childhood in predominantly Muslim Indonesia .
He is a Christian .
Jen’nan Read , professor of sociology at Duke University , told the same briefing that not only did the whisper campaign about Obama being a closet Muslim fail , but that distribution in closely contested states of a video on Islamic extremism backfired .
VIDEO BACKFIRED
More than 20 million copies of a film called “ Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West ” were included as advertising supplements in newspapers , distributed by a private group unaffiliated with Republican John McCain ’s campaign .
The film features suicide bombers , children being trained with guns , and a Christian church said to have been defiled by Muslims .
Read said the video was a subtle attempt to link Obama to Islamic extremists but many of the states where it was handed out “ were strongholds of Muslim American voters ” who were prompted to work for Obama .
“ It may actually have brought out voters for Obama , ” she said .
But beyond that issue , she added , Muslim voters looked a lot like many other American voters .
They moved away from the Republican party , which they had backed heavily in 2000 but less so in 2004 -- and voted their concerns for issues such as the economy and a desire for a change in leadership .
Mukit Hossain , executive director of the Muslim American Political Action Committee , said at the briefing that support for Obama among Muslims “ changed dramatically ” in the last three to four weeks of the campaign “ when people started calling Obama a terrorist ” in the crowds at Republican rallies .
He also said a concern for erosion of civil liberties since the attacks on the United States of September 11 , 2001 , has driven Muslims away from the Republican party in recent years .
Although hard numbers are difficult to find , Hossain said from 2 million to 3 million Muslims were probably registered to vote in this year ’s election .
David Hay , a BT historian , said legend had it that the government wanted to keep the location of the tunnels so secret that it hired foreign workers with no knowledge of the London streets to build them .
BT staff members are still under strict orders not to reveal the exact location of the system , though incomplete maps have surfaced on the Internet .
“ We just do n’t know what the future owner will want to use it for , so we ca n’t disclose more information , ” David Hembra , one of the maintenance workers who now visits the tunnels several times a week to check for gas leaks and other problems , said .
When Mr. Hembra started to work in the tunnels 10 years ago , their pivotal years were behind them , and little remained from the turbulent days of World War II .
The offices were removed after the war ended , when new tenants moved in .
Britain ’s public records office needed the space to store more than 400 tons of documents .
But it was not long before the documents had to be moved again to make room for a secure international telephone center that the government deemed necessary as relations between Washington and Moscow grew tense .
During the cold war , the British government instructed its telephone department , which later became BT , to set up a secret communications system based on the latest technology that would be able to survive a nuclear attack .
It was the beginning of the busiest period for the tunnels , with almost 200 workers spending their days and nights underground to route up to two million calls a week across the 6,600 phone lines .
In 1963 , the hot line established between Moscow and Washington after the Cuban missile crisis ran through the London tunnels .
The buzzing complex soon became known as “ underground town , ” with its own recreation room complete with dartboards and billiard tables , a movie theater and two dining halls .
Workers often spent the night in sleeping rooms .
By the early 1980s , technology had advanced so much that the tunnels ’ telephone center became obsolete , and BT ’s technicians moved back above ground .
You might even say it 's a landslide .
That 's Bob Bacon ( D ) vs. Matt Fries ( R ) running for Colorado 's State Senate District 14 .
See the final tally here .
I hope Bacon can reach across the aisle to Fries .
I think their common ground is anywhere you can find a good burger .

A pretty staggering exchange on O'Reilly just now .
O'Reilly had African - American Temple University professor Marc Lamont
Hill on the show .
O'Reilly went into Colbert mode at one point , saying that when he thinks about a metaphorical " Joe Six - Pack " , he has no race in mind : " The immediate image that comes to my mind is a guy of no color , " O'Reilly said .
Try that for a second : imagine a man of no color .
Then this staggering quote from O'Reilly to a black professor :
" Man , I 'm glad I did n't have you in school , boy .
I would have gotten a D . "
Boy ?
Did O'Reilly just call a black professor a " boy " on cable television ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

In Russia , for example , banks and corporations rushed to borrow abroad , because dollar interest rates were lower than ruble rates .
So while the Russian government was accumulating an impressive hoard of foreign exchange , Russian corporations and banks were running up equally impressive foreign debts .
Now their credit lines have been cut off , and they ’re in desperate straits .
Needless to say , the existing troubles in the banking system , plus the new troubles at hedge funds and in emerging markets , are all mutually reinforcing .
Bad news begets bad news , and the circle of pain just keeps getting wider .
Meanwhile , U.S. policy makers are still balking when it comes to doing what ’s necessary to contain the crisis .
It was good news when Mr. Paulson finally agreed to funnel capital into the banking system in return for partial ownership .
But last week Joe Nocera of The Times pointed out a key weakness in the U.S. Treasury ’s bank rescue plan : it contains no safeguards against the possibility that banks will simply sit on the money .
“ Unlike the British government , which is mandating lending requirements in return for capital injections , our government seems afraid to do anything except plead . ”
And sure enough , the banks seem to be hoarding the cash .
There ’s also bizarre stuff going on with regard to the mortgage market .
I thought that the whole point of the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the lending agencies , was to remove fears about their solvency and thereby lower mortgage rates .
But top officials have made a point of denying that Fannie and Freddie debt is backed by the “ full faith and credit ” of the U.S. government  and as a result , markets are still treating the agencies ’ debt as a risky asset , driving mortgage rates up at a time when they should be going down .
What ’s happening , I suspect , is that the Bush administration ’s anti-government ideology still stands in the way of effective action .
Events have forced Mr. Paulson into a partial nationalization of the financial system  but he refuses to use the power that comes with ownership .
Whatever the reasons for the continuing weakness of policy , the situation is manifestly not coming under control .
Things continue to fall apart .
Some Republicans are in a really severe state of denial about the ass - kicking they just received Great Repudiation .
To wit , Colorado's Marilyn Musgrave :
Bitterness generated by the bruising battle between Betsy Markey and Marilyn Musgrave apparently lingers days after voters decided the winner of the 4th Congressional District .
Incumbent Republican Musgrave , who lost to Democrat Markey by a 56 to 44 percent margin Tuesday , has yet to call and congratulate Markey on her win .
Musgrave also has n't conceded the race , said Markey spokesman Ben Marter .
" She has yet to admit defeat , " he said .
" It 's a little bizarre . "
Calls to Musgrave 's campaign and congressional office went unanswered Friday .
Ah yes , we remember Musgrave well :
She was one of the co-sponsors of a Federal Marriage Amendment , and once declared that gay marriage " is the most important issue that we face today . "
Musgrave 's residence on Planet Bizarro appears to be permanent .
Kat Von D Has Taken a Sobriety Oath
Tattoo artisthas decided to give up her hard partying ways and is crediting her boyfriend Motely Crue band memberfor leading her down the right path .
Kat really rose to fame with her reality show L.A .
Ink but after her divorce from Oliver Peck she turned to the bottle .
With the love and support from her current man Nikki , Kat is ready to change her life .
In an interview with Latina magazine she said :
" For a long time I felt like there 's no God , there 's no karma .
Meeting Nikki was an eye - opener .
He helped restore my faith in general .
I 've taken an oath to be honest and open with my life .
( Before that ) I found myself drinking in the daytime , and that 's when I realized that it was for function versus fun .
I was gaining weight .
I was hung over all the time .
I could n't remember anything ... One day I woke up and said , " I do n't wanna drink anymore . "
We wish Kat much success with her sobriety !

“ After being found guilty on seven felony counts , I had hoped Senator Stevens would take the opportunity to do the statesman - like thing and erase the cloud that is covering his Senate seat , ” Ms. Palin said in a statement released by the campaign .
“ He has not done so .
Alaskans are grateful for his decades of public service , but the time has come for him to step aside . ”
Ms. Palin also made a direct reference to the hope that Republicans in Alaska are clinging to and is being chatted up on talk radio here .
“ Even if elected on Tuesday , ” she said , “ Senator Stevens should step aside to allow a special election to give Alaskans a real choice of who will serve them in Congress . ”
With just a week before Election Day , it is too late to add or remove names from the ballot .
“ If there ’s going to be any opportunity for people to vote for a conservative candidate in the future , people have to vote for Stevens now , ” Mr. Pierre said .
“ Otherwise we have Mark Begich .
We want folks to remember that Alaska ca n’t afford to have a Democratic supermajority in the Senate . ”
Of course , Mr. Stevens , 84 , would also have to resign for there to be a special election .
He could possibly do so if he loses his appeals in court or if he is threatened with a vote of expulsion by the Senate .
Yet Mr. Stevens , a 40 - year incumbent and long the state ’s most powerful politician , has said he has no intention of resigning , now or in the future .
The senator plans to return to Alaska to campaign on Wednesday , and he has signaled that he will try to tap into many Alaskans ’ distrust for the federal government by arguing that his conviction in Washington on Monday was flawed and came from a biased jury in a liberal city .
The human mind is a remarkable device .
Nevertheless , it is not without limits .
Recently , a growing body of research has focused on a particular mental limitation , which has to do with our ability to use a mental trait known as executive function .
When you focus on a specific task for an extended period of time or choose to eat a salad instead of a piece of cake , you are flexing your executive function muscles .
Both thought processes require conscious effort - you have to resist the temptation to let your mind wander or to indulge in the sweet dessert .
It turns out , however , that use of executive function — a talent we all rely on throughout the day — draws upon a single resource of limited capacity in the brain .
When this resource is exhausted by one activity , our mental capacity may be severely hindered in another , seemingly unrelated activity .
( See here and here . )
Imagine , for a moment , that you are facing a very difficult decision about which of two job offers to accept .
One position offers good pay and job security , but is pretty mundane , whereas the other job is really interesting and offers reasonable pay , but has questionable job security .
Clearly you can go about resolving this dilemma in many ways .
Few people , however , would say that your decision should be affected or influenced by whether or not you resisted the urge to eat cookies prior to contemplating the job offers .
A decade of psychology research suggests otherwise .
Unrelated activities that tax the executive function have important lingering effects , and may disrupt your ability to make such an important decision .
In other words , you might choose the wrong job because you did n't eat a cookie .
Taxing Tasks
But what types of actions exhaust executive function and affect subsequent decision - making ?
Until recently , researchers focused on activities that involved the exertion of self - control or the regulation of attention .
For instance , it 's long been recognized that strenuous cognitive tasks — such as taking the SAT — can make it harder to focus later on .
But recent results suggests that these taxing mental activities may be much broader in scope - and may even involve the very common activity of making choices itself .
In a series of experiments and field studies , University of Minnesota psychologist Kathleen Vohs and colleagues repeatedly demonstrate that the mere act of making a selection may deplete executive resources .
For example , in one study the researchers found that participants who made more choices in a mall were less likely to persist and do well in solving simple algebra problems .
In another task in the same study , students who had to mark preferences about the courses they would take to satisfy their degree requirements were much more likely to procrastinate on preparing for an important test .
Instead of studying , these " tired " minds engaged in distracting leisure activities .
Why is making a determination so taxing ?
Evidence implicates two important components : commitment and tradeoff resolution .
The first is predicated on the notion that committing to a given course requires switching from a state of deliberation to one of implementation .
In other words , you have to make a transition from thinking about options to actually following through on a decision .
This switch , according to Vohs , requires executive resources .
In a parallel investigation , Yale University professor Nathan Novemsky and his colleagues suggest that the mere act of resolving tradeoffs may be depleting .
For example , in one study , the scientists show that people who had to rate the attractiveness of different options were much less depleted than those who had to actually make choices between the very same options .
Choosy about Choices
These findings have important real world implications .
If making choices depletes executive resources , then " downstream " decisions might be affected adversely when we are forced to choose with a fatigued brain .
Indeed , University of Maryland psychologist Anastasiya Pocheptsova and colleagues found exactly this effect : individuals who had to regulate their attention — which requires executive control — made significantly different choices than people who did not .
These different choices follow a very specific pattern : they become reliant on more a more simplistic , and often inferior , thought process , and can thus fall prey to perceptual decoys .
For example , in one experiment participants who were asked to ignore interesting subtitles in an otherwise boring film clip were much more likely to choose an option that stood next to a clearly inferior " decoy " — an option that was similar to one of the good choices , but was obviously not quite as good — than participants who watched the same clip but were not asked to ignore anything .
Presumably , trying to control one 's attention and to ignore an interesting cue exhausted the limited resource of the executive functions , making it significantly more difficult to ignore the existence of the otherwise irrelevant inferior decoy .
Subjects with overtaxed brains made worse decisions .
These experimental insights suggest that the brain works like a muscle : when depleted , it becomes less effective .
Furthermore , we should take this knowledge into account when making decisions .
If we 've just spent lots of time focusing on a particular task , exercising self - control or even if we 've just made lots of seemingly minor choices , then we probably should n't try to make a major decision .
These deleterious carryover effects from a tired brain may have a strong shaping effect on our lives .

If this country had n't re-defined marriage , black people still could n't marry white people .
Sixteen states had laws on the books which made that illegal in 1967 .

The parents of the President - Elect of the United States could not have married in nearly one - third of states of the country .
Their son grew up to lead .
It 's worse than that .
If this county had not redefined marriage , some black people could n't still marry other black people .
It is one of the most overlooked and cruelest parts of our sad history of slavery . "

With the news that Howard Dean will stepping down from his post as chairman of the DNC once his term ends in January , I wonder if Howard Dean helped or hurt the Democratic Party .
The answer depends on whether we are talking Dean the spokesperson , or the man in charge of the DNC .
Howard Dean inherited an organization and a party that was politically adrift .
More than anything the party needed a daily voice of opposition against the Bush administration .
Dean was perfect for this role .
He was able to make passionate arguments against the culture of corporate welfare that guided the administration ’s tax policies .
He was able to speak out against the Iraq war before Democrats took back the Congress in 2006 , and he played a key in attacking John McCain while the Democratic Party was still locked up in the Clinton / Obama contest .
Some people will give Dean credit for his 50 state strategy in the 2006 election , but that strategy was largely a bust as Democrats mostly made their congressional gains in states that were already blue , or trending that way .
No , Dean ’s 50 state strategy did not pave for Obama ’s strategy in 2008 .
Obama had superior field organization and loads of cash which allowed him to compete in red states .
All of the credit for the 2006 win belongs to the House and Senate masterminds , Rahm Emanuel and Chuck Schumer .
They recruited the candidates and raised the money , not Dean .
Advertisements
In fact when it comes to building the DNC as an organization , Dean struggled .
Elected Democrats paid little attention to Dean , and as an organization the DNC was low on funds by the time Obama won the nomination .
Dean was viewed by some as using the DNC to further his own political ambitions , but it is clear , that he did a great job trying to restore order to the Democratic primary schedule by holding a firm line on Michigan and Florida .
His decision may have caused a great deal of drama , but stripping Michigan and Florida of their delegates for violating the rules was the right thing to do .
All in all , I think Dean ’s time as the DNC chair was a positive for the party , but now that Democrats have a clear voice and leader in president elect Obama , they need a different kind of person at the DNC .
Dr. Dean was the right person at the right time , but now a chair is needed who can speak from the position of the White House and majority .
It is traditional that the incoming president appoints the next party chair .
If history is a guide , Obama will appoint someone from his campaign .
Let ’s hope that they make it a goal to strengthen the DNC along with state and local parties .
Single Gal Seeks Date in Super Bowl Ad Amy Borkowsky hopes to find a man with a $ 3 M personal ad during the Super Bowl .
Oct. 24 , 2008  -- Amy Borkowsky needs a date -- and badly .
So badly , in fact , that the native New Yorker is trying to raise $ 3 million through donations on her Web site , superbowlsinglegirl.com , to fund a 30 - second commercial that she hopes will air during the Super Bowl Feb .
1 .
" I tried the obvious approaches first , went to all the singles events , wine and cheese , singles picnics , dances and online dating .
I met a lot of great guys but none of them turned out to be Mr. Right , " Borkowsky told ABCNews.com .
Borkowsky , who declined to give her age , would only say that it falls somewhere between that of Carrie 's and Samantha 's from " Sex and the City . "
A background check by ABCNews.com found records that indicate Borkowsky is 48 years old .
The former advertising exec -- now an author and a comedian -- said that her failed attempts at dating the old - fashioned way had spurred her to think more creatively .
" I said , 'hey , why not run a personal ad where the greatest number of guys will see it ? ' " said Borkowsky , whose never been married .
So what 's she looking for in her perfect man ?
" I threw out my checklist a long time ago -- checklists are for butter and eggs , " said Borkowsky .
" I 'm trying to be open . "
Admitting that she once dreamed of ending up with " the standard good - looking , professional " type , Borkowsky says that she 's willing to give anyone a chance .
" There could be a carpenter in the Midwest or some guy in Arizona who owns a bakery and even though they would n't be an obvious choice for me , I want to be open , " she said .
" The one thing I know for sure is that the guy has to be nontraditional enough to appreciate the creativity of someone who would run a personal ad during the Super Bowl , " said Borkowsky .
And for those men who might be interested in scoring a date with Borkowsky , feel free to check out her stats on her Web site .
According to the site , Borkowsky says she 's 5 feet 6 inches and 110 pounds and has already fielded approximately 19 passes from " all the wrong guys " this year .
Hesitant to give too many details away about how she will fill her 30 - second spot if she earns enough money and if NBC accepts the ad , Borkowsky said she 's debating between airing testimonials from old boyfriends or using a side - by - side comparison of " other women on the market . "
" Maybe I 'll use a jingle , " said Borkowsky .
" Part of the excitement of the Super Bowl is the suspense -- I 'm not going to reveal everything . "
Borkowsky has raised $ 1,121 since launching her site Monday and said she knows many of the people who have donated have been strangers .
She has $ 2,998,879 to go before reaching her goal .
Not overly confident that she 'll earn enough to buy the ad space , Borkowsky said that if she does n't raise the money in time she 'll donate the proceeds to the United Way charity .
" Either I get united or United gets it , " she said .
Messages left with a representative at NBC who is handling advertisements for the Super Bowl were not immediately returned , but Borkowsky said that as of Monday she was told that there were eight spots remaining .
Responding to criticisms in the blogosphere that repeatedly label her as " desperate " and " pathetic , " Borkowsky says it does n't bother her .
" I 'd say it 's creative , not desperate , " she said .
Admittedly ignorant about football , Borkowsky said that she'd be willing to " read a magazine " while the man of her dreams cheers on his favorite team .
That , or learn .
" I know absolutely nothing about football , " she said .
" But I 'd be open to converting to football fan . "
Oct. 27 , 2008  --
Though a jury in Washington , D.C. has convicted Alaska Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens on federal corruption charges , casting doubt on the future of his 40 - year political career , the senator maintains his innocence and blames the verdict on " prosecutorial misconduct . "
A federal grand jury indicted Stevens , 84 , in July on seven counts of making false statements , for allegedly lying on U.S. Senate financial disclosure forms for the years 1999 to 2006 .
The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for five hours Monday before returning guilty verdicts on all seven counts .
Stevens held his hand to his stomach as the verdict was read in court .
Deliberations came to a halt late last week after a juror needed to leave town because of her father 's death .
The jury restarted its deliberations Monday with an alternate taking the place of that juror .
Prosecutors claimed that Stevens accepted $ 250,000 worth of gifts , primarily from now - defunct oil services company Veco Corp. and its former CEO , Bill Allen .
Among the alleged gifts was the value of a home renovation project that transformed the senator 's Girdwood , Alaska , home from a quaint cabin to a sizeable house , a $ 2,700 massage chair and a Viking gas grill .
The defense had said in court that the Stevens family paid more than $ 160,000 for the renovations , and Stevens testified that some of the gifts were instead loans , and others were left at his home by Allen .
The defense contended that anything left off the disclosure forms was merely an oversight .
Stevens lashed out at prosecutors , releasing a statement saying he 's " obviously disappointed in the verdict but not surprised given the repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct in this case . "
The defense had filed mistrial requests , and the judge has said he 's reviewing the actions of prosecutors after they sent a witness under subpoena home without telling the court and allegedly kept key evidence from the defense team .
" I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have , " Stevens said .
" I am innocent .
This verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the Justice Department lawyers conducted this trial .
I ask that Alaskans and my Senate colleagues stand with me as I pursue my rights .
I remain a candidate for the United States Senate . "
Before boarding a plane in Virginia Monday afternoon , Alaska Governor and Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin commented on the verdict , calling it a " sad day " for Alaska , Stevens and his family , but added that " the verdict shines a light though on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company up there in Alaska that was allowed to control too much of our state . "
Palin vowed a continued fight against corruption in her state , and said she 's confident that Stevens " from this point on will do the right thing for the state of Alaska . "
Each charge carries a maximum five years in prison and $ 250,000 fine .
U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan will sentence Stevens in January .
Stevens , the longest - serving Republican senator , has been in office since 1968 .
During his four decades on Capitol Hill , he has become legendary for funneling millions in federal dollars to Alaska , including the " bridge to nowhere " project .
Buildings and facilities all across Alaska , including the state 's biggest airport , bear Stevens ' name .
But the senator is also known for his orneriness .
On days when he was spoiling for a fight in the Senate , Stevens often wore a tie bearing the angry comic book hero the Incredible Hulk .
He even referred to himself as " a mean , miserable SOB . "
Next week , he will face off with the Democratic challenger to his seat in the U.S. Senate , Anchorage mayor Mark Begich .
Recent polls show a tight race , and Republican officials have admitted that the outcome of Stevens ' trial will weigh heavily on the minds of Alaska voters and fellow senators who could vote to oust Stevens .
" If the trial comes to a conclusion and , as he believes , that he is found innocent , I think that he will win that election up there , " National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman Sen .
John Ensign , R - Nev. said last Tuesday .
" If it goes the other way , obviously , it really wo n't matter what happens in the election . "
Stevens is the latest Alaska Republican to fall amid the wide - ranging public corruption probe in that state .
The investigation began in 2004 , expanded to include Allen 's company two years later and ensnared the senator after investigators became suspicious of Stevens ' relationship with Allen .
Last year , federal agents searched Stevens ' Girdwood home -- which he calls the " chalet " -- and Allen , the millionaire oilman , pleaded guilty to his own separate corruption charges .
Seven other Alaskans , including the ex-speaker of the statehouse , a former vice president of Veco and a lobbyist , have been convicted as part of the probe .
Allen is the man on the other end of Stevens wiretaps , collected by the FBI .
Prosecutors believed the recordings , which they played for the jury , proved that Stevens was aware he might be in legal trouble .
" They 're not going to shoot us , it 's not Iraq , " Stevens can be heard saying on one tape .
" We might have to pay a fine , might have to serve a little time in jail . "
Stevens ' attorneys are expected to appeal the conviction , but the senator 's words could come back to haunt him soon enough .

Prompted in part by a presentation I have to give tomorrow as an OU eLearning community session ( I hope some folks turn up – the 90 minute session on Mashing Up the PLE – RSS edition is the only reason I ’m going in … ) , and in part by Scott Leslie ’s compelling programme for a similar duration Mashing Up your own PLE session ( scene scetting here : Hunting the Wily “ PLE ” ) , I started having a tinker with using Google spreadsheets as for data table screenscraping .
So here ’s a quick summary of ( part of ) what I found I could do .
The Google spreadsheet function =importHTML ( “ ” , ” table ” , N ) will scrape a table from an HTML web page into a Google spreadsheet .
The URL of the target web page , and the target table element both need to be in double quotes .
The number N identifies the N’th table in the page ( counting starts at 0 ) as the target table for data scraping .
So for example , have a look at the following Wikipedia page – List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population ( found using a search on Wikipedia for uk city population – NOTE : URLs ( web addresses ) and actual data tables may have changed since this post was written , BUT you should be able to find something similar … ) :
Grab the URL , fire up a new Google spreadsheet , and satrt to enter the formula “ =importHTML ” into one of the cells :
Autocompletion works a treat , so finish off the expression :
= ImportHtml ( “ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_United_Kingdom_settlements_by_population”,”table”,1)
And as if by magic , a data table appears :
All well and good – if you want to create a chart or two , why not try the Google charting tools ?
Where things get really interesting , though , is when you start letting the data flow around …
So for example , if you publish the spreadsheet you can liberate the document in a variety of formats :
As well publishing the spreadsheet as an HTML page that anyone can see ( and that is pulling data from the WIkipedia page , remember ) , you can also get access to an RSS feed of the data – and a host of other data formats :
See the “ More publishing options ” link ?
Lurvely :-)
Let ’s have a bit of CSV goodness :
Why CSV ?
Here ’s why :
Lurvely … :-)
( NOTE – Google spreadsheets ’ CSV generator can be a bit crap at times and may require some fudging ( and possibly a loss of data ) in the pipe – here ’s an example : When a Hack Goes Wrong … Google Spreadsheets and Yahoo Pipes . )
Unfortunately , the *’s in the element names mess things up a bit , so let ’s rename them ( do n’t forget to dump the original row of the feed ( alternatively , tweak the CSV URL so it starts with row 2 ) ; we might as well create a proper RSS feed too , by making sure we at least have a title and description element in there :
Make the description a little more palatable using a regular expression to rewrite the description element , and work some magic with the location extractor block ( see how it finds the lat / long co-ordinates , and adds them to each item ? ;-) :
DEPRECATED ….
The following image is the OLD WAY of doing this and is not to be recommended …
… DEPRECATED
Geocoding in Yahoo Pipes is done more reliably through the following trick – replace the Location Builder block with a Loop block into which you should insert a Location Builder Block
The location builder will look to a specified element for the content we wish to geocode :
The Location Builder block should be configured to output the geocoded result to the y:location element .
NOTE : the geocode often assumes US town / city names .
If you have a list of town names that you know come from a given country , you may wish to annotate them with a country identify before you try to geocode them .
A regular expression block can do this :
This block says – in the title element , grab a copy of everything – .* – into a variable – (.*) – and then replace the contents of the title element with it ’s original value – $ 1 – as well as “ , UK ” – $ 1 , UK
Note that this regular expression block would need to be wired in BEFORE the geocoding Loop block .
That is , we want the geocoder to act on a title element containing “ Cambridge , UK ” for example , rather than just “ Cambridge ” .
Lurvely …
And to top it all off :
And for the encore ?
Grab the KML feed out of the pipe :
… and shove it in a Google map :
So to recap , we have scraped some data from a wikipedia page into a Google spreadsheet using the =importHTML formula , published a handful of rows from the table as CSV , consumed the CSV in a Yahoo pipe and created a geocoded KML feed from it , and then displayed it in a Yahoo Google map .
Kewel :-)
PS If you “ own ” the web page that a table appears on , there is actually quote a lot you can do to either visualise it , or make it ‘ interactive ’ , with very little effort – see Progressive Enhancement – Some Examples and HTML Tables and the Data Web for more details …

Once you have scraped the data into a Google spreadsheet , it ’s possible to treat it as a database using the QUERY spreadsheet function .

As a fresh wave of sectarian violence is unleashed across the Indian state of Orissa , Gethin Chamberlain talks to homeless survivors in Kandhamal district who were forced to abandon their religion
Hundreds of Christians in the Indian state of Orissa have been forced to renounce their religion and become Hindus after lynch mobs issued them with a stark ultimatum : convert or die .
The wave of forced conversions marks a dramatic escalation in a two - month orgy of sectarian violence which has left at least 59 people dead , 50,000 homeless and thousands of houses and churches burnt to the ground .
As neighbour has turned on neighbour , thousands more Christians have sought sanctuary in refugee camps , unable to return to the wreckage of their homes unless they , too , agree to abandon their faith .
Last week , in the worst - affected Kandhamal district , The Observer encountered compelling evidence of the scale of the violence employed in a conversion programme apparently sanctioned by members of one of the most powerful Hindu groups in India , the 6.8 - million member Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP ) - the World Hindu Council .
Standing in the ashes of her neighbour 's house in the village of Sarangagada , Jaspina Naik , 32 , spoke nervously , glancing towards a group of Hindu men watching her suspiciously .
' My neighbours said , " If you go on being Christians , we will burn your houses and your children in front of you , so make up your minds quickly " , ' she said .
' I was scared .
Christians have no place in this area now . '
On her forehead , she wore a gash of vermilion denoting a married Hindu woman , placed there by the priest at the conversion ceremony she had been obliged to attend a day earlier , along with her husband and three young children .
' I 'm totally broken , ' she said .
' I have always been a Christian .
Inside I am still praying for Jesus to give me peace and to take me out of this situation . '
She and her neighbour , Kumari Naik , 35 , gazed forlornly at the charred remains of the house .
The mob that arrived one evening in the first week of the violence , armed with swords and axes , had looted what they wanted before dousing the building with petrol and setting it alight .
Kumari had fled into the nearby forest with her husband , Umesh , and 14 - year - old son Santosh .
A smoke - damaged child 's drawing of Mickey Mouse pinned to one wall was all that remained of their former lives .
Shattered roof tiles crunched underfoot as the women moved through the blackened rooms .
The priest had given them cow dung to eat during the ceremony , they said , telling them it would purify them .
' We were doing that , but we were crying , ' Jaspina said .
The roads between the villages are rough and potholed , adding to the difficulties in accessing what is already a remote region , a six - hour drive from the state capital , Bhubaneshwar .
The remoteness has undoubtedly played a part in the continuation of the violence , making it harder for police to move about quickly , even if they were minded to do so .
Christian leaders , though , have accused the authorities of dragging their feet , claiming they are reluctant to antagonise the majority Hindu community in the run-up to parliamentary elections next year .

Relations between the Hindu and Christian communities were already at a low ebb when the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati on 23 August provided the trigger for the current wave of violence .
The VHP blamed Christians and the mobs descended on the homes of neighbours and friends .
Those who were too slow to get away were killed .
Amid the savagery , two incidents stood out : a young Hindu woman working in a Christian orphanage was burnt alive and a nun was gang - raped .
Yet the VHP is unrepentant and appears to be involved , at least at grassroots level , with the campaign of forced conversions .
One priest who converted 18 Christians in the village of Sankarakhole last week told The Observer that he had been approached by local VHP representatives to carry out the ceremony .
' The VHP people came with letters that said they wanted to be converted , so I converted them , ' said Preti Singh Patra , who is the brother of a senior VHP official .
Crouching on the ground in front of his temple , set in a small walled garden beneath a huge banyan tree , he ran through the details of the ceremony : first some fruit to eat , followed by a mixture of cow dung and urine mixed with milk and curd , a dip in water from the Ganges , an hour of prayers and then the painting of a bindi on the forehead .
Some local men stepped forward to speak to him .
' Do n't say too much , ' they warned .
The priest seemed unconcerned .
The 18 had been the only Christians in the village , he said .
They were happy to convert .
Around the village , the countryside is a sea of green , a beautiful lush vista that offers , at a distance , no clues to the turmoil .
Yet up close it is a landscape scarred by the ugly remains of homes and churches which lie shattered between other houses still inhabited and unscathed , those belonging to Kandhamal 's Hindus .
A few miles down the road from Sankarakhole , in the village of Minia , Sujata Digal , 38 , stood outside her own burnt - out home .
The mob had arrived at 3 am , she said .
She and her husband Hari hid in the forest and watched the house burn .
When they came out of the forest , the mob returned and told them to convert , and it was not a hard decision .
' They said , ' If you do n't become Hindu , we 'll burn your houses too and start killing you ' , ' said Ashish Digal , the former Christian pastor .
' I 've been forced to convert .
Everyone is being converted .
They beat us in the fields .
I went to the temple .
We had to say that we belonged to the Hindu state of Orissa , and that from this day we are Hindus . '

Before the violence started , Christians outnumbered Hindus in Minia : now 115 have converted , roughly half of their original number .
The rest have fled .
Burn your Bibles , the men told Ashish Digal .
He told them he had , but hid them instead .
Every couple of days people come to his house to search , hoping to catch him out .
Those people are not strangers ; they are his neighbours .
They had been sitting idly in the main road when The Observer 's car pulled up .
Now the young driver , Sudhir , was rushing down the path that led to what remained of Sujata Digal 's house , holding his head , visibly shaken .
' We must leave now , ' he said .
He had been standing by the car when the men closed in around him .
They left the talking to Prashant Digal , a teacher and organiser for the local VHP youth wing .
' Why did you bring these people here ? ' , he demanded , punching Sudhir in the head .
' Take the vehicle and go .
Leave them here for us . '
They surrounded him , a young Hindu , and slapped him around again .
No one came to his aid .
' If you stay , we will burn you with them in the car .
You will all be killed .
Just leave them , ' they told him .
But he did not , which was a decent thing for a frightened boy to do .
He drove a little way down the road and parked around a corner , out of sight , and came back to raise the alarm .
Back on the main road , the men were waiting .
' Put your notebook and your cameras away .
You will take no pictures and record nothing , ' the VHP man said .
' You want to know what is happening ?
Now I will tell you why this is happening . '
He blamed the Christians for taking the jobs of Hindus , for the murder of the Swami .
The only solution was for Christians to convert , he said .
' This is a Hindu community .
Everyone can stay here , as long as they are part of that community .
And now you should go . '
