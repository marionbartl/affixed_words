CIPPIC has filed a privacy complaint with the Privacy Commissioner of Canada over Bell 's deep packet inspection practices .
With CAIP raising the privacy issue in its submission to the CRTC , it was only a matter of time before the Privacy Commissioner was asked to intervene .
CIPPIC highlights several privacy concerns with Bell 's network management practices including :
Bell 's failure to obtain consent for the collection of personal information through DPI from customers of the independent ISPs
Bell 's failure to obtain informed consent from its own customers given the lack of information on network management practices
Bell 's violation of the principle of limiting collection , since the evidence " suggests that Bell can manage its network adequately without inspecting the content of user communications . "
CIPPIC notes that other providers do not engage in the same practice and that there are less privacy invasive means to address network congestion concerns .
Bell 's violation of the openness principle , given its failure to disclose " in a clear and conspicuous manner to the public its use of DPI for traffic management purposes . "
The case obviously has implications that extend beyond just Bell .
Indeed , CIPPIC urges the Privacy Commissioner to also investigate DPI usage by other Canadian ISPs .
Internet Explorer 6（IE6）は2002年と2003年に使用率およそ95%というピークに達してから(リンク)、急速に市場シェアを失っている。2008年末が近づくにつれ、重要
なオンライン・サービスやベンダー、WebフレームワークがIE6のサポートをやめている。今年でIE6は終わりを告げるのか。そしてそれはWeb 2.0開発者にとって何を意味するのか。
Ruby on Railsフレームワークを支持している企業37signalsは、2008年8月15日から同社の全製品を対象に、徐々にIE6のサポートをやめていくと最近発表した(リンク ) 。
ブラウザ のInternet Explorer 6は2001年にリリースされ、IE6に取って代わるInternet Explorer 7は2年近く前の2006年にリリースされました。IE7やFirefox、Safariのような最新Webブラウザを使うと、オンラインエクスペリエンスは格段に良くなります。我が社の顧客に占めるIE6利用者がついに少数派の限界値を下回ったので、ついにIE6を越えて前進する時がやってきました。
IE6は前世代のブラウザです。つまり、最新ブラウザが提供可能なWebエクスペリエンスをIE6では提供できないのです。IE6を継続サポートしている
と、インターフェースの最適化や、我が社のアプリケーションで、より機能強化したカスタマーエクスペリエンスを提供できないことになります。IE6をサ
ポートしていれば、それは遅い進歩、限られた進歩、場合によってはまったく進歩がないことを意味します。我が社の顧客の圧倒的多数にとって最高のエクスペリエンスになることを確実にしたいのですが、IE6のサポートを続けると、その妨げになるのです。
アップルは最近、.MacサービスをMobileMe(リンク)と商標変更したが、このMobileMeでIE6のサポートをやめた。2008年6月9日に.Mac利用者に送った電子メールで、アップルは次のように知らせている。
新しいWebアプリケーションを使用するには 、Safari 3 、Internet Explorer 7 、 Firefox 2以降のブラウザのうちの1つを必ずご用意ください。
アップルのMobileMeサービスを支えているJavaScriptフレームワークのSproutCoreは、今後IE6をサポートしない(リンク)
。Peter Bergströmがサポートフォーラムで次のように発表している。
IE6 からは脱却することを検討しています。なぜなら、( a ) 欠落している機能が多すぎますし、( b ) クライアント側のフル・アプリケーションを構築するには、遅すぎてあまり使い物にならないからです。
SaveTheDevelopers.orgのサイトでは、「 IE6はお断り」(リンク)というキャンペーンを行っている。
現在のキャンペーンでは 、Webブラウ ザInternet Explorer 6をアップグレードするユーザの手助けに焦点を当てています。このキャンペーンは、時代遅れになったIE6ブラウザの引退を早めることにより、前IE6 ユーザがネットをさらに楽しめるという結果をもたらしながら、それと同時に、Web開発者にとって、よりストレスが少なく、分かりやすい環境を（うまくい
けば）作り出せるでしょう。
SaveTheDevelopers.orgに関して はErick Schonfeld がTechCrunch で「 Webに はInternet Explorer 6という名の悩みの種が存在する」(リンク ) と報告している。
プログラマーからすれば、このアップグレードの遅れは受け入れられないのです。プログラマーは5つの異なるブラウザでWebアプリケーションが間違いなく機能するようにしなければならないので、とても大変です。そればかりでなく、IE6では他のブラウザと互換性のない非標準の特徴や機能もサポートしていま
す。セキュリティ上の脆弱性もあまり愉快なものではありません。
Rob Pegoraro はWashington Postのブログで 、Internet Explorer 6のサポートはこれで終わりだと確信している(リンク ) 。
ま だIE6を使っているなら、潮時です。IE6で助けが必要になっても、もう手を差し伸べることはしません。代わりに、もっと優れたブラウザを入手して、問題を根本から修正するよう提案します。
Windows XPをお使いなら、IE 7にアップグレード可能です。しかし、新しいインターフェースに慣れるまでに要する時間という点から考えると、大部分のユーザにとってはMozilla Firefoxへのアップグレードが簡単でしょう。
IE6 でFacebookにアクセスしても、次のようなメッセージが表示される。
お読みください！ ブラウザをアップグレードしてはいかがでしょうか。
Facebookの閲覧に現在お使いになっているのは 、Internet Explorer 6 です 。Internet Explorer 7もしくは別のブラウザにアップグレードされた方が、Facebookの機能が向上します。
多 数( リンク ) の企業( リンク ) がオンライン・サービスでIE6をサポート対象から外すと発表している。
それでも、IE6のサポートをただちにやめてしまうことに反対する意見もあり、MozillaのJavaScriptエバンジェリストでjQuery(リンク)を作成したJohn Resigは、IE6のサポートをやめてしまうと、アップルやSproutcore、Web開発者全般が損害を被るとツイッターしている(リンク ) 。
非常にたくさんのユーザがいるのに、開発者がそのサポートに尽力しないことに憤りを覚えます。まるで不可能かのように思わせて、開発者に濡れ衣を着せています。
InfoQはこの件についてResig氏に直接問い合わせ、氏から次のような返事を得た。
Internet Explorer 7を限定付きでしかサポートしないというアップルの対処には、非常に失望していますが、Internet Explorer 6をまったくサポートしないことには完全に失望しています。アップルには、同社に追随する開発者の良い先例となる責任があるのに（開発者がブラウザのベン
ダーであることを考慮すると、とりわけその責任は重いです）、市場の二大ブラウザを無視するということは、Web開発に対するアップルのコミットメントの
欠如と無責任を表しています。 37signalsはアプリケーションを作成する小さなショップにしかすぎないので、Webに対する責任はそれほど重くないと思いますが、 37signalsが顧客を失いたいと思っているとしたら、つまり、特定の方向に進むよう顧客に強制しようと思っているなら、それは37signalsの特権でしょう。
SitePenの最高経営責任者 でDojoを共同制作し たDylan Schiemannが次のように述べているように、Dojoツールキット(リンク)は今後も同様に長くIE6をサポートし続けるようである。
Internet Explorer 4、5、5.5、6が最初にリリースされたとき、その最先端の機能によってWeb開発者の暮らしは飛躍的に向上しましたが、IE6のリリースからは7年が経過しました。現在では、IEのバグが出る動作をめぐり、何十億ドルもの金を給料という形で、開発者全体が浪費しているのではないかと推定します。
Dojoの場合、IE6の市場シェアが統計学的に無意味な数字になり、ユーザがIE6のサポートを要求しなくならない限り、IE6をサポートし続けるしか選択の余地がありません。37signalsが公式にサポートを終了するという大胆な動きに出たことで、いよいよ拍車がかかれば、と願っています。その時
まで、他のツールキットや技術と競合し続けるためには、私たちはIE6をサポートし続けて、ユーザが求めている幅広いブラウザのサポートを提供しなければ ならないのです。 SitePenで は、Dojoを使って作成するアプリケーションではIE6をもうサポートしたくないのですが、お手上げ状態です。もしDojoの主要コントリビュータの中
にIE6を使ってアプリケーションを作れない人がいたら、Dojoに良くない影響を与える可能性があります。他の主要ブラウザはみな、より積極的なアップ
グレードと前修正版の最終サポート行い、Safari 2や、そして間もなくFirefox 2でも、サポート打ち切りが容易になっていますが、マイクロソフトは企業が求めているものを提供する上でどんな苦労も惜しまないので、少なくともあと一年
は IE6から離れられないのでは、と思っています。
YahooのJavaScriptシニア・アーキテクトで、JSON(リンク )を作成し たDouglas Crockfordは、問いかけに対して次のように述べている。
ソフトウェアをインストールしないユーザという大人数のグループが存在し、こうしたユーザはソフトがたとえ無料であってもインストールしないのです。こういう人達はIE6を使っており、非常にたくさん存在します。もしあなたがこのデモグラフィックにアピールしないフリンジサイトを運営しているなら、IE6 のサポート打ち切りは気が利いています。この時代遅れのブラウザについて回るたくさんの問題から、自分自身と他のユーザを解放することになるのですから。
全ユーザに広く訴えるメインストリームのサイトを運営しているなら、IE6のシェアが無意味な値に低下するまで、残念ながらIE6をサポートし続けなけれ ばなりません。
Webデザイン的見地に立った反応が欲しかったので、Webデザインに関する著書が5、6冊あり、Web Standards Project ( リンク ) の共同設立者であ るJefferey Zeldman氏にInfoQはコンタクトを取ったが、氏の返答は次のとおりである。
2000 年 、IE6はマイクロソフトにとって、標準準拠の大躍進を象徴するものでしたが、今では頭痛の種です。IE6は、Webの極めて複雑な設計やク
リーンなセマンティックマークアップを最も阻害するブラウザとなっています。IE6のサポートをやめてしまう余裕があなたの会社にあるのなら、今がその時
です。可能か不可能かは、オーディエンスとビジネスモデルにかかっています。
みなさんの考えはどうだろうか 。Internet Explorer 6は今秋、衰亡の時を迎えるのか、そうではないのか…？

Nina Matsumoto of Space Coyote ( of the Simpsonzu fame , blogged on Neatorama here ) , made another fan art .
This time , it 's her take of Bill Watterson 's classic comic Calvin and Hobbes :
Few historians know of the heartwarming friendship between French Reformation theologian John Calvin and English political philosopher Thomas Hobbes , the latter of whom may or may not have been real , considering he was not even born yet .
Print ( and larger pic ) available at deviantART : Link - via Locust & Honey
For the past few years , the technology press has been eulogizing desktop and server - based software while proclaiming that the era of Software as a Service ( SaaS ) is now upon us .
According to the lessons of the Innovator 's Dilemma the cheaper and more flexible SaaS solutions will eventually replace traditional installed software and the current crop of software vendors will turn out to be dinosaurs in a world that belongs to the warm blooded mammals who have conquered cloud based services .
So it seems the answer is obvious , software vendors should rush to provide Web - based services and extricate themselves from their " legacy " shrinkwrapped software business before it is too late .
What could possibly go wrong with this plan ?
Sarah Lacy wrote an informative article for Business Week about the problems facing software vendors who have rushed into the world of SaaS .
The Business Week article is entitled On - Demand Computing : A Brutal Slog and contains the following excerpt
On - demand represented a welcome break from the traditional way of doing things in the 1990s , when swaggering , elephant hunter - style salesmen would drive up in their gleaming BMWs to close massive orders in the waning days of the quarter .
It was a time when representatives of Oracle ( ORCL ) , Siebel , Sybase ( SY ) , PeopleSoft , BEA Systems , or SAP ( SAP ) would extol the latest enterprise software revolution , be it for management of inventory , supply chain , customer relationships , or some other area of business .
Then there were the billions of dollars spent on consultants to make it all work together — you could n't just rip everything out and start over if it did n't .
There was too much invested already , and chances are the alternatives were n't much better .
Funny thing about the Web , though .
It 's just as good at displacing revenue as it is in generating sources of it .
Just ask the music industry or , ahem , print media .
Think Robin Hood , taking riches from the elite and distributing them to everyone else , including the customers who get to keep more of their money and the upstarts that can more easily build competing alternatives .
But are these upstarts viable ?
On - demand software has turned out to be a brutal slog .
Software sold " as a service " over the Web does n't sell itself , even when it 's cheaper and actually works .
Each sale closed by these new Web - based software companies has a much smaller price tag .
And vendors are continually tweaking their software , fixing bugs , and pushing out incremental improvements .
Great news for the user , but the software makers miss out on the once - lucrative massive upgrade every few years and seemingly endless maintenance fees for supporting old versions of the software .
…
Nowhere was this more clear than on Oracle 's most recent earnings call ( BusinessWeek.com , 6/26/08 ) .
Why is n't Oracle a bigger player in on - demand software ?
It does n't want to be , Ellison told the analysts and investors .
" We 've been in this business 10 years , and we 've only now turned a profit , " he said .
" The last thing we want to do is have a very large business that 's not profitable and drags our margins down . "
No , Ellison would rather enjoy the bounty of an acquisition spree that handed Oracle a bevy of software companies , hordes of customers , and associated maintenance fees that trickle straight to the bottom line .
…
SAP is n't having much more luck with Business by Design , its foray into the on - demand world , I 'm told .
SAP said for years it would never get into the on - demand game .
Then when it sensed a potential threat from NetSuite , SAP decided to embrace on - demand .
Results have been less than stellar so far .
" SAP thought customers would go to a Web site , configure it themselves , and found the first hundred or so implementations required a lot of time and a lot of tremendous costs , " Richardson says .
" Small businesses are calling for support , calling SAP because they do n't have IT departments .
SAP is spending a lot of resources to configure and troubleshoot the problem . "
In some ways , SaaS vendors have been misled by the consumer Web and have failed to realize that they still need to spend money on sales and support when servicing business customers .
Just because Google does n't advertise it 's search features and Yahoo !
Mail does n't seem to have a huge support staff that hand holds customers as it uses their product does n't mean that SaaS vendors can expect to cut their sales and support calls .
The dynamics of running a free , advertising based service aimed at end users is completely different from running a service where you expect to charge business tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to use your product .
In traditional business software development you have three major cycles with their own attendant costs ; you have to write the software , you have to market the software and then you have to support the software .
Becoming a SaaS vendor does not eliminate any of these costs .
Instead it adds new costs and complexities such as managing data centers and worrying about hackers .
In addition , thanks to free advertising based consumer services and the fact that companies like Google that have subsidized their SaaS offerings using their monopoly profits in other areas , business customers expect Web - based software to be cheaper than its desktop or server - based alternatives .
Talk about being stuck between a rock and a hard place as a vendor .
Finally , software vendors that have existing ecosystems of partners that benefit from supporting and enhancing their shrinkwrapped products also have to worry about where these partners fit in a SaaS world .
For an example of the kinds of problems these vendors now face , below is an excerpt from a rant by Vladimer Mazek , a system administrator at ExchangeDefender , entitled Houston … we have a problem which he wrote after attending one of Microsoft 's partner conferences
Lack of Partner Direction :
By far the biggest disappointment of the show .
All of Microsoft ’s executives failed to clearly communicate the partnership benefits .
That is why partners pack the keynotes , to find a way to partner up with Microsoft .
If you want to gloat about how fabulous you are and talk about exciting commission schedules as a brand recommender and a sales agent you might want to go work for Mary Kay .
This is the biggest quagmire for Microsoft – it ’s competitors are more agile because they do not have to work with partners to go to market .
Infrastructure solutions are easy enough to offer and both Google and Apple and Amazon are beating Microsoft to the market , with far simpler and less convoluted solutions .
How can Microsoft compete with its partners in a solution ecosystem that does n’t require partners to begin with ?
This is another example of the kind of problems established software vendors will have to solve as they try to ride the Software as a Service wave instead of being flattened by it .
Truly successful SaaS vendors will eventually have to deliver platforms that can sustain a healthy partner ecosystems to succeed in the long term .
We have seen this in the consumer space with the Facebook platform and in the enterprise space with SalesForce.com 's AppExchange .
Here is one area where the upstarts that do n't have a preexisting shrinkwrap software businesses can turn a disadvantage ( lack of an established partner ecosystem ) into an advantage since it is easier to start from scratch than to retool .
The bottom line is that creating a Web - based version of a popular desktop or server - based product is just part of the battle if you plan to play in the enterprise space .
You will have to deal with the sales and support that go with selling to businesses as well as all the other headaches of shipping " cloud based services " which do n't exist in the shrinkwrap software world .
After you get that figured out , you will want to consider how you can leverage various ISVs and startups to enhance the stickiness of your service and turn it into a platform before one of your competitor 's does .
I suspect we still have a few years before any of the above happens .
In the meantime we will see lots more software companies complaining about the paradox of embracing the Web when it clearly cannibalizes their other revenue streams and is less lucrative than what they 've been accustomed to seeing .
Interesting times indeed .

Durbin kept silent on prewar knowledge
The Senate 's No. 2 Democrat says he knew that the American public was being misled into the Iraq war but remained silent because he was sworn to secrecy as a member of the intelligence committee .
" The information we had in the intelligence committee was not the same information being given to the American people .
I could n't believe it , " Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , said Wednesday when talking on the Senate floor about the run-up to the Iraq war in 2002 .
" I was angry about it .
[ But ] frankly , I could n't do much about it because , in the intelligence committee , we are sworn to secrecy .
We can't walk outside the door and say the statement made yesterday by the White House is in direct contradiction to classified information that is being given to this Congress . "
Mr. Durbin 's comments come after years of inquiries and debate about prewar intelligence , and as congressional leaders clash over Democrats ' calls to pull out of Iraq .
The White House responded by saying Congress had access to the same intelligence and voted overwhelmingly to go to war .
" We all understand today that there were intelligence failures , but there was no effort to mislead either members of Congress or the American people , " said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
Mr. Durbin yesterday said there was no " ethical " way to notify the public of specific misleading information being touted by the Bush administration because it would have required revealing top - secret information being provided to the intelligence committee .
He cited the White House 's claim that Iraq was trying to acquire aluminum tubes needed for a nuclear weapons program -- details of which have since been declassified -- as an example of bad intelligence , saying that there was an ongoing debate within the administration as it was being used in public .
Mr. Durbin , whose floor comments were part of the debate before yesterday 's passage of an emergency war - funding bill , said he and half the Democrats on the intelligence committee voted against the war over concerns of the White House 's " very flimsy case , but it was given to the American people as a proven fact . "
Congress authorized the 2003 use of armed force against Iraq by votes of 296- 133 in the House and 77 - 23 in the Senate .
Five of nine Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted for the measure as did all eight Republicans .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 's office circulated an e-mail Wednesday highlighting Mr. Durbin 's comments , but his office did n't respond to requests yesterday to elaborate on the e-mail .
The e-mail said Mr. Durbin 's comments were inconsistent with the words of other Democrats on the committee , including Sens. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Carl Levin of Michigan .
Those two Democrats said publicly before the war that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was intent on pursuing nuclear weapons .
Mr. Rockefeller voted for the war , but Mr. Levin did not .

I ’ve been putting together a presentation to be given internally at work on what Ojay is and why we ’re doing it .
It occurred to me that I ’ve not spoken very much about it here , hoping the documentation and examples would speak for themselves .
So , today I ’m going to go through how to take an animation sequence that would be really complicated in YUI and make it so simple that you ’ll never want to write another callback function again .
The really core thing about Ojay ’s chaining API is that each function that does something asynchronous ( like an animation , or an HTTP request ) returns a MethodChain object , which is essentially a magic object that remembers methods called on it so they can be replayed later .
This allows you to construct complex instruction sequences with far fewer ( sometimes none ! ) nested callback functions .
For today ’s example , let ’s assume you want to do the following .
You have an element called trigger and another called logo .
When you click the trigger , you want the logo to move around the edges of square .
During the animation , the logo should pause for half a second at each corner .
So , your starting point might be :
< div id= " trigger " ></div > < div id= " logo " ></div > < script type= " text/ javascript " > YAHOO . util .
Dom .
setStyle ( ' logo ' , ' position ' , ' absolute ' ) ; YAHOO . util .
Dom .
setStyle ( ' logo ' , ' left ' , ' 200 px ' ) ; YAHOO . util .
Dom .
setStyle ( ' logo ' , ' top ' , ' 200 px ' ) ; var points = [ [ 400 , 200 ] , [ 400 , 400 ] , [ 200 , 400 ] , [ 200 , 200 ] ] ; </ script >
The question is , how are you going to implement the animation sequence ?
In this example , I ’m going to show how this case can be simplified using loops , but other sequences of events do n’t lend themselves to this simplification .
My hope is to show that Ojay scales to very complicated asynchronous sequences without making your head ( or your typing fingers ) hurt .
Let ’s try a really dumb implementation .
And , remember that this is only dumb because this case lends itself easily to looping .
With more complex effect combinations you wo n’t be so lucky .
The dumb implementation is to simply list all the animations by hand , chaining them together using onComplete callbacks .
We use setTimeout ( ) to handle the pauses .
YAHOO . util .
Event .
addListener ( ' trigger ' , ' click ' , function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ 0 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 0 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim .
onComplete .
subscribe ( function ( ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ 1 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 1 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim .
onComplete .
subscribe ( function ( ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ 2 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 2 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim .
onComplete .
subscribe ( function ( ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ 3 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 3 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } , 500 ) ; } ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } , 500 ) ; } ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } , 500 ) ; } ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } ) ;
There are several things wrong with this , aside from the fact that it just looks wrong because of all the repetition .
First up , it does n’t tell a story , at least not one that ’s easy to follow .
Instead of flowing down the page , it flows outwards in this nested structure , so that pause intervals are specified nowhere near where the pause actually happens in the sequence .
Similarly , the call to initiate each animation is miles away from the code that runs after the animation .
To follow the story , you have skip up and down the text .
You can make this easier by specifying each callback externally and chaining them afterwards ; the event handler will tell a better story but the chain will probably be even harder to follow .
So , let ’s try a more digestable approach by turning this into a loop .
If this really did n’t lend itself to looping , then we’d be stuck with the above code , but we can make this case shorter so let ’s have a go .
We ’ll make a loop that kicks off the four stages of the animation , but we do n’t want all of them to run at once so we ’ll delay each stage by an appropriate amount such that the whole effect works properly .
YAHOO . util .
Event .
addListener ( ' trigger ' , ' click ' , function ( ) { for ( var i = 0 , n = points .
length ; i < n ; i ++ ) { ( function ( x ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ x ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ x ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } , ( 700 + 500 ) * x ) ; } ) ( i ) ; } } ) ;
This is just about the shortest way I managed to write this code using YUI .
It perhaps looks nicer than the first example , but it ’s broken in a pretty fundamental way : it works sort of ‘ by accident ’ in that you happen to have timed everything just right so that it does what you expect .
You ’ve not actually chained the animations together using callbacks , so each one runs regardless of whether the one before it has actually finished .
This is especially important if there are other side effects of the animation running , if other actions need to occur at the same time .
If one step fails , the next step will still run .
There are some other issues , like that funny - looking closure to make sure the correct step runs , and the whole thing is n’t that readable really .
So , you need to chain the steps together properly .
We can still do this using a loop by building an array of animations , and when each one finishes it shifts the next animation off the stack and runs it :
YAHOO . util .
Event .
addListener ( ' trigger ' , ' click ' , function ( ) { var anim , anims = [ ] ; for ( var i = 0 , n = points .
length ; i < n ; i ++ ) { anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' logo ' , { left : { to : points [ i ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ i ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) ; anim .
onComplete .
subscribe ( function ( ) { var nextAnim = anims .
shift ( ) ; if ( ! nextAnim ) return ; setTimeout ( function ( ) { nextAnim . animate ( ) ; } , 500 ) ; } ) ; anims .
push ( anim ) ; } anims .
shift ( ) . animate ( ) ; } ) ;
This has made the code longer , but at least it ’s robust now : the start of each animation is properly synchronized with the end of the previous one .
This is the shortest robust implementation that I could find in YUI and Plain Old JavaScript .
It might be called elegant but I ’m not sure it ’s that much easier to follow than the first huge example .
At least it ’s explicit about the fact that animations are chained , which makes it better than the previous snippet .
Now , let ’s use Ojay to translate our ‘ dumb ’ example from above :
$ ( ' # trigger ' ) . on ( ' click ' ) . _ ( ' # logo ' ) . animate ( { left : { to : points [ 0 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 0 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) . wait ( 0.5 ) . animate ( { left : { to : points [ 1 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 1 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) . wait ( 0.5 ) . animate ( { left : { to : points [ 2 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 2 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) . wait ( 0.5 ) . animate ( { left : { to : points [ 3 ] [ 0 ]} , top : { to : points [ 3 ] [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) . wait ( 0.5 ) ;
I do n’t expect I ’ll meet much opposition if I suggest that this is incredibly readable .
There is no cruft aside from the punctuation required to make JavaScript parse the code correctly .
It tells a nice linear story , where each stage and parameter is mentioned in the order the sequence actually takes place .
There is no nesting – one mantra I have in my mind pretty often is a snippet from ‘ Why Why Functional Programming Matters Matters ’ : “ there ’s nothing inherently nested about what we ’re trying to do ” .
And , it ’s actually shorter than the final YUI attempt above ( both with whitespace removed ) .
And if you feel like going super - minimal , Ojay includes the JavaScript 1.8 Array#reduce ( ) function that makes shrinking the chain really simple :
$ ( ' # trigger ' ) . on ( ' click ' , function ( ) { points .
reduce ( function ( chain , point ) { return chain .
animate ( { left : { to : point [ 0 ]} , top : { to : point [ 1 ]} } , 0.7 ) . wait ( 0.5 ) ; } , $ ( ' # logo ' ) ) ; } ) ;
Back to my assertion that Ojay scales better than other libraries to complex sequences .
This example was fairly contrived , mostly for sake of focusing on the code rather than the application .
I could just as well have illustrated all this with this example : when we click a button , fade in a ‘ loading ’ indicator , make a search request to the server , print the result to the page and fade out the loading indicator .
This would be an irreducible pile of nested callbacks in YUI , and indeed in Prototype or jQuery .
In Ojay :
var getSearchTerm = function ( ) { return $ ( ' # q ' ) . node .
value ; } ; $ ( ' # search ' ) . on ( ' click ' ) . _ ( ' #loading ' ) . animate ( { opacity : { to : 1 }} , 0.3 ) . _ ( $ . HTTP ) .
GET ( ' / search ' , { q : getSearchTerm } ) .
insertInto ( ' #results ' ) . _ ( ' #loading ' ) . animate ( { opacity : { to : 0 }} , 0.3 ) ;
Notice how $ .HTTP.GET can take functions as query parameters : the getSearchTerm function returns the value of an input field at the time the event fires .
The equivalent YUI code , just for completeness :
YAHOO . util .
Event .
addListener ( ' search ' , ' click ' , function ( ) { var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' loading ' , { opacity : { to : 1 } } , 0.3 ) ; anim .
onComplete .
subscribe ( function ( ) { var term = YAHOO . util .
Dom .
get ( ' q ' ) . value ; YAHOO . util .
Connect .
asyncRequest ( ' GET ' , ' / search?q= ' + term , { success : function ( response ) { YAHOO . util .
Dom .
get ( ' results ' ) . innerHTML = response .
responseText ; var anim = new YAHOO . util .
Anim ( ' loader ' , { opacity : { to : 0 } } , 0.3 ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } } ) ; } ) ; anim . animate ( ) ; } ) ;
This is basically what I mean when I say that Ojay scales : it does n’t get confusing when you add more and more async behaviour .
In fact , Ojay code does n’t really get more complicated at all in the sense that YUI does ; it might get bigger , but it remains easy to understand .
McCain's $ 520 loafers put ' elitist ' shoe on the other foot David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This Normallly presidential campaign season finds Republicans accusing Democrats of being out - of - touch elitists -- but this time it seems the shoe may be on the other foot .
Huffington Post blogger Isabel Wilkinson reported on Wednesday that Senenator John McCain " has worn a pair of $ 520 black leather Ferragamo shoes on every recent campaign stop  from a news conference with the Dalai Lama to a supermarket visit in Bethlehem , PA . "
The story was quickly picked up by CNN's Jeanne Moos , who noted wryly that " Ferragamo narrowly missed getting buried in an applesauce avalanche " on that supermarket stop .
Meghan Cleary , author of The Perfect Fit : What Your Shoes Say About You , told Moos , " I wonder if McCain fancies himself a bit of a fashion plate . "
" Maybe the senator has some help in the shoe - shopping department from his fashion - plate wife , " Moos speculated .
" But was n't Senator Obama the guy being called an elitist ? "
Moos then played footage of Michelle Obama telling Access Hollywood during a family interview that Obama was wearing ten year old pants and a worn - out belt and hurriedly adding , " Do n't pan down to the shoes -- because we 've talked about getting new shoes for him . "
Obama had told a newspaper last spring , " Michelle has asked me to clean up because when she first met me I had one suit .
Michelle always finds this funny because I basically buy five of the same suit and then I patch them up and wear them repeatedly .
I have four pairs of shoes .
Recently , I 've taken to getting a haircut more frequently than I used to because my mother - in - law makes fun of me . "
Moos concluded with footage of McCain wearing his $ 520 imported loafers to walk with the sandal - clad Dalai Lama and suggested , " Shouild they meet again , perhaps this simple $ 275 Prada sandal might work for Senator McCain . "
Christopher Hayes blogging at The Nation was skeptical about the significance of the loafer story , seeing it as one that right - wing bloggers would have loved to run with if the shoes had belonged to Obama , but " I 'm not a right - wing blogger .
And the $ 520 shoes belong to John McCain .
And frankly , I do n't think how much his shoes cost matters one whit for how he'd govern the country . "
However , as Glenn Greenwald recently pointed out at Salon , " It 's long been obvious ... that McCain 's only prospect for winning would be to move the election away from debates over issues ( where his positions are widely rejected by the public ) and instead demonize Barack Obama as an effete , elitist , effeminate , far Leftist , terrorist - loving radical .
...
What is far more notable than McCain 's now almost - complete reliance on Rovian demonization themes is how obediently the establishment media has been spouting and disseminating them . "
So the shoe story may have some legs after all , if only as ammunition for left - wing bloggers to fight back .

As part of their trip to the Lego factory in Denmark , Gizmodo have made a video showing one of the gigantic warehouses that stores the Lego bricks prior to decoration and boxing .
There are four warehouses , dubbed cathedrals by Gizmodo , that store 900 million pieces at any given time .
They are over 65 ft high and cover 65.6sq / miles .
Inside each cathedral are four robots that whiz around at up to 2.5 metres per second collecting boxes .
The impressive operation is completely automated .

Physics can explain the cycle of the earth around the sun , but what drives cellular cycles ?
Two of the most important cycles in cells are the series of events that take place when cells divide , and circadian rhythms - the cycle of day - night events that even bacteria participate in .
Unlike a planet , a cell 's cycle can't be described by simple physical laws , nor does it have a CPU like a computer to keep time and and control the order of events .
So how do cells control their cycles ?
Researchers have been trying to reverse engineer cell cycles , and two recent successes give a fascinating molecular view of what 's going on .
Your bike chain drives your wheels forward , but when you stop pedaling , your wheels still spin .
It turns out , a yeast cell does the same thing .
In order to replicate itself , a cell executes a series of complex events , each of which has to be precisely timed : the cell has to make sure it has the resources to divide ready , it then has to replicate its DNA , and finally it has to actually divide - splitting all of the contents of the cell in two , making sure each new cell gets all of the right chromosomes .
Obviously , if any of these events happens out of order , the result is a major problem .
If a cell tries to divide before copying its DNA , there wo n't be enough DNA to go around .
If a cell copies it 's DNA more than once before dividing , the new cells will be loaded with extra chromosomes , which also creates problems .
So how does a cell control the timing of these events ?
The cell 's equivalent of a bike chain is something called a cyclin / CDK complex , which is a pair of proteins that orchestrate the major events of cell division .
But just which events are controlled by this pair has been unclear , especially when it comes to regulating genes during the cell division process .
Before we look more closely at the cell 's cyclin / CDK bike chain , we need to take a detour and look at how genes behave when cells divide .
Obviously , cells do n't keep all of their genes on all of the time .
During cell division , genes are often turned on when they 're needed , and off when they 've done their job .
In a yeast cell , about 1000 genes get turned on and off at some point during the cycle of cell division , as you can see below in this figure showing the behavior of about 1000 genes during the cell cycle :
Orlando et al , Nature ( 2008 ) , DOI : 10.1038/nature06955
Here 's what the figure means : each row corresponds to the behavior of one gene , and as you move from left to right , you can follow the behavior of that gene over time .
Yellow means the gene is on , blue means it 's off .
As you can see , a group of genes comes on early in the cell cycle ( the blob of yellow in the upper left corner ) , other genes come on later - you get the picture .
The question is now , how much of this gene behavior controlled by the cyclin / CDK master timer , and how much of it is a separate , self - perpetuating cycle ?
In other words , if you stop pedaling during cell division , does the wheel of gene regulation still spin ?
A group led by Steven Haase at Duke University demonstrated that yes , it does keep spinning .
They shut down the cyclin / CDK complex , and followed the behavior of these cell cycle genes .
Without the driving force of the cyclin / CDK complex , the cells themselves froze up - they did n't replicate their DNA , and they did n't divide .
But about 70 % of their cell cycle genes kept oscillating in a self perpetuating cycle :
Orlando et al , Nature ( 2008 ) , DOI : 10.1038/nature06955
What this teaches us is that cell division is actually made up of at least two cycles - one driven by the cyclin / CDK protein complex , and another self - perpetuating cycle of gene expression .
And when it comes to cell division , what goes for a yeast cell usually goes for a human cell as well - scientists believe it 's critical to understand how the cell division cycle is driven , because cell division plays such a crucial role in so many biological process , from the development of a single stem cell into groups of specialized cells like muscle or nerve cells , to diseases like cancer .
In addition to the cell division cycle , cells have a cycle that follows a major rhythms that dominates everything on our planet - the cycle of day and night , which produces what 's called a circadian rhythm .
You feel the effects of your circadian rhythm when it's out of whack , after a long transatlantic flight , or after staying up all night drinking beer and watching South Park reruns .
Amazingly , single - celled organisms like cyanobacteria have a circadian rhythm as well .

Unlike the cycle of gene expression in yeast , the cyanobacterium circadian clock does n't need to have sets of genes turned on and off .
In fact , it does n't even need most of the bacterium : you can take just three key proteins from Synechococcus elongatus , put them in a test tube , and they will spontaneously start cycling .
What exactly is cycling ?
One of these key three proteins , called KaiC , gets modified in a rhythmic fashion : it gets decorated with phosphate molecules , and once it 's fully decorated , the phosphates are pulled off .
Once the phosphates are off , they get put back on again - in cycle after cycle .
Inside the actual bacterium , this cycle drives important biological events , but in a test tube , these three proteins , including KaiC , just participate in a perpetual cycle of dressing and undressing KaiC .
What happens is this ( follow the black line , which tells you how dressed or undressed KaiC is by phosphates )
Figure 1 , from Rust et al. , Science 318:809-812 ( 2007 )
Here 's the key question :
How does KaiC know whether it 's getting dressed or undressed ?
When it 's halfway up or down in a cycle , how does it know whether the cycle is going up or down ?
Obviously this 3 - protein circus is able to come together in a test tube and put on this cycling act ; how does it work ?
A group lead by Erin O'Shea from Harvard University figured out the answer , which turns out to be fairly simple , although it took a lot of biochemistry to sort it out .
It turns out that there is an order to how KaiC gets dressed and undressed with phosphates , and that order only happens when all three necessary proteins are placed in a tube .
Phosphates can be attached at two different types of amino acids in the KaiC protein - either at a serine or a threonine .
In the cyanobacterium cycle , phosphates get put on threonines first , and then on serines .
When it comes time to pull the phosphates off , they go in the same order : off the threonines first , and then off the serines .
So that 's how this cycle knows whether it 's coming or going .
If you look closely at the figure above , you can see the details : T - KaiC ( that is , KaiC with phosphates only on threonine - the green line ) shows up early in the cycle , while S - KaiC ( KaiC with phosphates only on serine - the red line ) is the last form of KaiC to go down .
Why should you care ?
Besides the amazing fact that such simple biological devices can be made by tossing three proteins in a test tube , it also shows us how reverse engineering these small , simple systems that we can really start to gain insight into how biological parts form coherent wholes .
Three rocks in a tube do n't oscillate , but proteins , by sheer chemistry , can .
Biochemical cycles drive so much of our biology , so learning how to reverse engineer these cycles , starting in microbes , is important science .
Carrying on from Cedric ’s Challenge ( C# , Erlang ) I decided to do some of the Programming Challenges problems in Erlang , because the problems are small , but fun .
My first is Reverse And Add # 110502 and here is my solution :
- module ( revandadd ) .
- export ( [ rev_and_add /1 , test /0 ] ) . % % number to list ntl( Num ) -> ntl( Num , [ ] ) .
ntl( 0 , List ) -> List ; ntl( Num , List ) -> ntl ( Num div 10 , [ Num rem 10 ] ++ List ) . % % list to number ltn( List ) -> ltn( List , 0 ) . ltn( [ ] , Num ) -> Num ; ltn( [ H|T ] , Num ) -> ltn( T , ( Num * 10 ) + H ) . % % is palindrome is_pal( Num ) -> ntl( Num ) == lists : reverse ( ntl ( Num ) ) .
rev_and_add ( Num ) -> rev_and_add ( Num , 1 ) . rev_and_add ( Num , Count ) -> Pal = ltn( lists : reverse( ntl ( Num ) ) ) + Num , case is_pal ( Pal ) of true -> [ Count , Pal ] ; false -> rev_and_add ( Pal , Count +1 ) end. test ( ) -> [ 4,9339 ] = rev_and_add ( 195 ) , [ 5,45254 ] = rev_and_add ( 265 ) , [ 3,6666 ] = rev_and_add ( 750 ) , true .
I ’m not too happy with the number - to - list functions as I ’m sure there should be a built in way to - do this already , which Joe implies therefore there probably is .

Sameer Mishra , 13 , won the $ 40,000 competition this year ( Photos : Mark Bowen / Scripps National Spelling Bee )
For the past seven years the Mishras have packed their bags and set off on an annual pilgrimage from their home in Indiana to Washington DC , to watch their children participate in the top US spelling championship .
Elder daughter , Shruti , was first in the family to participate in the contest , but it was her 13 - year - old brother , Sameer , who spelled his way to the coveted first prize - worth more than $ 40,000 - in this year 's National Spelling Bee. SPELLING BEE WORDS 2008 Nacarat , n. A bright orange - red colour Chorion , Anat .

The spelling contest is a big event in the US .
Children study hard for months and have to get through regional contests to make the final .
Children of South Asian origin dominated the top 10 spots in the gruelling competition this year .
The second prize was bagged by Sidharth Chand , 12 , of Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , while Kavya Shivashankar , 12 , of Olathe , Kansas , tied for fourth place , and Jahnavi Iyer , 14 , of Enola , Pennsylvania , tied for eighth .
On top of that - eight - year - old Sriram Hathwar of New York made history by becoming the youngest contestant .
Over the years many children of South Asian origin have left their mark at the spelling event , but why do they dominate it ?
Family support Chicago - based Dr Balu Natarajan , who won the Spelling Bee in 1985 and was a judge at this year 's contest , says there is one common thread among nearly all winners regardless of ethnic background - extensive involvement and support from family .
The Mishras moved to the US from Delhi 15 years ago " This is not a contest which many kids can win by preparing solely by themselves .
I think that many South Asian families are willing and able to provide this level of support , " said Dr Natarajan .
His parents helped him by finding word lists , looking up definitions and pronunciations and quizzing him on them .
They even took days off work in order to help him prepare .
The Mishras moved to the United States from Delhi 15 years ago .
Daughter Shruti's success in a math contest won her scholarships at top universities .
Krishna Mishra , who teaches microbiology at Ivy Tech Community College in Lafayette , Indiana , said his wife , Alka , encouraged Sameer to participate in the Spelling Bee because she felt he too could win a scholarship to ease the burden of his tuition .
Mr Mishra says the Spelling Bee has been a good educational experience for his children and a great way for them to learn English .
Over the past year Sameer practised " dictionary reduction " .
He split the third edition of Webster 's Dictionary into 26 books - one for each letter - and would spend his days learning the words .
The Spelling Bee provides contestants with a list of 45,000 words , which Sameer did n't include in his books because , his father says proudly , " he knows them all " .
' Just like celebrities '
Besides the prospects of a scholarship , Mr Mishra says his wife , who teaches anatomy and physiology at Ivy Tech Community College , was attracted by the lure of the red carpet laid out for the finalists and their parents .
" In this country being on the red carpet is like being a celebrity .
She wanted Sameer to take us on that red carpet , just like the celebrities , " he said , laughing .
Sameer Mishra credits his sister for being his " coach and inspiration " and his parents for providing emotional support .
He won the contest by correctly spelling " guerdon " , which means a reward .
Sidharth Chand bagged second prize Sameer admits investing a lot of hard work in the year before the contest .
" I enjoy reading books and playing video games but had to do less of that because of the time I needed to put into studying for the Bee , " he said .
But for Sameer the investment has been " very worthwhile " .
" I have learned to work hard and persevere , " he said .
What advice does he have for future spellers ?
" Keep working hard .
Even if you do n't win you will always learn something new . "
Dr Natarajan says what spellers take back from such contests depends on the child .
" I did not know the meaning of every word I was asked to spell , " he admitted .
" But based on my observations of many spellers during recent years , I am convinced that many of them have studied the meanings of the words . "
He says he was struck by the fact that many of the participants were able to approach the words by asking if they contained specific root words from various other languages , suggesting that they were well - versed in etymology , not just rote spelling .
' Smart kids '
Inspired by the success of South Asians in spelling contests , Rahul Walia , CEO of New Jersey - based Touchdown Media , set up the South Asian Spelling Bee .
" We wanted to give South Asians a platform within the community to excel , " explained Mr Walia .
Jahnavi Iyer was in the top 10
The first contest will be held later this month in New Jersey and Washington DC .
Mr Walia attributes the success of South Asian spellers to their roots .
" Our parents tend to be more focused on a child 's education .
Participating in such competitions is seen as an opportunity to enhance those skills , " he said .
He sees such contests as being not just about learning big words but getting the opportunity to gain confidence and enhance people skills .
Dr Natarajan said the Spelling Bee gave him " a confidence that I could achieve things if I put my mind to it , but that failures would be needed before success " .
" After all , " he added , " I had to compete in the National Bee in 1983 and 1984 before I could win in 1985 .
" These are definitely smart kids . "

What are these ?
A POINT OF VIEW
Alarming stories of a rise in knife crime + lack of confidence in understanding statistics = more fear for ourselves and our children , says Lisa Jardine .
I am someone who has always been fascinated by numbers .
So I find it disconcerting when those around me confess that they are filled with apprehension whenever they are asked to do a simple mathematical calculation .
This week the graduation ceremonies have taken place at my college in the University of London .
My own small research centre runs a Masters in Research programme , and the marks accumulated by students from the various exercises and modules have to be collated and tabulated to work out their degree result .
If so many find simple calculations hard to manage , how are they supposed to recognise whether the sensational claims are correct ?
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View Since each module 's mark represents a proportion of the sum total of those available , this involves calculating percentages - a task which seems to fill several of my otherwise highly competent members of staff with dismay , even though they are accustomed to processing arcane information from documents and archives .
Over the past couple of weeks we have been bombarded with figures by the media , on a range of topics , all apparently calculated to cause the person in the street the maximum amount of concern .
Some of the stories based on these statistics have been the talking point at practically every social gathering I have attended .
Fear factor
In the aftermath of what has felt like an avalanche of shocking news stories , multiple arrays of statistics have been produced , purporting to show a sudden , alarming rise in knife - related murders of school - age young people .
Tributes to Ben Kinsella , stabbed in Islington
These have whipped up public anxiety to near - panic levels with headlines proclaiming an " epidemic of knife and gun crime " , " spiralling out of control " , creating a level of youth disorder which adds up to " a national crisis " .
The first thing to say is that discrepancies in data collection methods make it hard to get a coherent story out of these numbers , though the journalists have certainly tried hard .
In spite of the statistics selectively used to fuel an alarmist story , all the available figures from reliable sources like the Home Office and the police seem to be showing that incidences of knife crime have remained relatively steady over the past five years , while violent crime as a whole has actually declined .
The 2007 British Crime Survey reported that the drop in violent crime " is part of a long - term trend - crime rates peaked in 1995 , then fell by 42 % over the subsequent 10 years " .
A lengthy report by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies - Guns , Knives and Street Violence published last month - summarises as follows : " The evidence on knife crime contains a number of ambiguities , but combining the various data sets , a rather clearer picture emerges .
Despite increased media attention , levels of knife crime have remained fairly stable at around 6 - 7 % of all violent crime . "
Maths allergy
On the other hand , the concern that those involved in knife crime have got significantly younger does appear to be borne out by the statistics .
Home Office figures obtained recently by a Liberal Democrat frontbencher show that the number of young people sentenced for possessing an offensive weapon in school rose from 15 to 90 a year between 1996 and 2006 .
Investigating a stabbing in Bristol And Department of Health statistics reveal that almost 14,000 people were treated in hospital for stab wounds last year , over 400 of them aged 14 and under .
According to the latest police figures for England and Wales published this week , there were 22,000 serious offences involving knives in 2007 - 8 .
The 2008 British Crime Survey report reveals that over the same period 13 % of violent offenders were school - age or under .
The total number of knife murders committed a year has hovered around the 250 mark for years , and those most at risk are urban , male and under 25 .
Given the numbers - allergy I detect all around me , though , it is small wonder that the public at large is being swept along on a media - generated tide of fear .
If so many people find simple numerical calculations hard to manage , how are they supposed to assess the data sensibly , or to recognise whether the sensational newspaper claims are correct ?
How can any of us decide on the basis of many column inches of figures what our personal reaction should be , and how each of us ought to behave - or modify our behaviour - as a consequence ?
Whether rising rapidly or holding steady , the numbers for knife crime are still small when compared to , say , deaths on the road .
But for many it is enough that the threat feels real .
As Cherie Blair has said : " Anecdotally it seems clear that the perception is that it 's much worse . "
Gordon Brown acknowledged recently that " too many people , young and old , do not feel safe in the streets , and sometimes even in their homes , as a result of the behaviour of a minority " .
Perceived danger has made many people desperately anxious - particularly for the safety of their children .
Pricey education
This brings me to the second set of tabulated numbers to have caught my eye this week .
Figures produced by Halifax Financial Services reveal an unexpectedly sharp rise in private day school fees over the past five years .
Anecdotally it seems clear that the perception is that it 's much worse
Cherie Blair
Fees have risen by 40 % , according to this report , which is double the national inflation rate over the same period .
The average annual private school fee is now about a third of gross annual average earnings .
In 2003 it was a little over a quarter .
In this case , on the evidence of those I spoke to this week , people are apparently more comfortable processing the numbers .
They can do some very simple arithmetic to understand the costs of what is now happening .
There is clearly a serious issue here to be faced by families who take the option of educating their children privately .
If fees continue to rise at this rate , a child starting their private schooling this autumn could end up costing their parents £ 170,000 by the time they leave at 18 , according to the Centre for the Economics of Education .
Figures like these might be expected to produce significant changes in patterns of education .
Yet despite the increasing sacrifices that have to be made by parents , the number of children educated privately has gone up by almost 6 % between 2001 and 2006 .
Meanwhile , the number going to state schools has fallen .
Parents who have chosen private education will , it seems , struggle determinedly with the fee increases , rather than move their children to the local comprehensive .
Faced with the lurid stories currently dominating our newspapers , of 11 - to 16 - year - olds with knives concealed in their school backpacks , is it any wonder that parents should be looking for any way they can to insulate their children from the threats of exposure to crime and intimidation on the streets and in the playground ?
The alarm generated by the banner headlines about escalating knife - crime spills over into fear for our children in the classroom .
Blade runners
It is just such fear of what might happen in the next encounter , on the next street corner , that drives school - age boys to carry knives in the first place , according to Deputy Assistant Police Commissioner Alf Hitchcock , appointed by the Government to tackle the problem .
Some of the knives seized by police Only 15 % of knife - carriers intend to take part in crime or gang activity .
The other 85 % carry knives out of fear , in a world where they believe nobody else is there to protect them .
In both cases , fear drives rational , responsible behaviour out of the frame .
The problems that underlie the apparent casual carrying and use of knives by young teenagers have deep roots .
To begin to solve them , the debate has to be brought back from headline - grabbing expressions of moral panic and social despair , to a clear - headed and reasonable debate about long - term solutions .
We need to sift and analyse the increasing volume of data that has been assembled on the where and why and how of violent crime , to arrive at a clearer picture of what is really going on .
Adolescent gang members who carry and use knives feel powerless , isolated and out of control .
Responsible adults are not thus disadvantaged .
They can , if they wish , take time to concentrate steadily on the facts before them , and to exercise their thinking and their influence to deal with the problem identified .
But we have to master the data if we are to get to the root of that problem and find solutions .
A good start to overcoming our irrational fear for our children on the city street would be to begin by mastering our equally irrational fear of figures .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Considering that the British Crime Survey relied on by the Home Office does not interview people under the age of 16 , I fail to see how reliable their statistics are .
I suspect the fear many in this country feel is less due to an inability to understand statistics and more to do with the fact that we live under a government which would rather manufacture pretty numbers than deal with the root problems .
TY , London I 'm a data analyst for the NHS and am forever exasperated by reports quoting the latest doom and gloom to overtake our apparently horrendous service when actually the real figures show a fairly robust performance .
Not that the newspaper figures are made up , just interpreted in a very particular way .
Lies , damned lies and statistics as they say .
Kate , Gravesend
The reports on knife crimes in the media are rarely presented with percentages , rather we are told how many people have been killed so far this year , but this information is presented with no reference to previous years .
It is also presented as a stand - alone number , not as percentage of the amount of crime committed .
The public 's perception does not come from bad analysis , but is based on the media 's presentation of the facts .
When there was a spate of dog attacks a few years ago , any dog attack would immediately become headline news .
However , as knife crime is now the main topic of discussion , dog attack stories end up as sideline stories in the middle of newspapers .
Rarely a day goes by without reference to a knife attack story and it is this statistic , not those on the level of crime , which is creating the public fear .
DS , Croydon , England Fantastic article .
But it 's not only about the figures , is it ?
We need to find out why it is that we 're so desperately keen to believe news and gossip about how terrible things are now , about how horrible kids are , how asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are taking our jobs and benefits etc .
Why do we fling our arms around the faintest possibility that things are awful and grim and beyond our control while refusing to actually get out and make it our responsibility to involve ourselves in our communities ?
Kaz , Macclesfield , UK
The comparison of the over - the - top headlines with the very real effect of the excessive increase in the costs of private schools is a good lesson in exactly why we need to keep a cool head .
Steve Molloy , Belfast ( living in US )
This story is only partly fair .
I suspect to the individual the key is the very local changes in crime .
Living in Tufnell Park , I sense that there is a peak in very serious knife crime .
Martin Dinnegan murdered a few hundred yards from the bottom of my road and now a 43 - year old at the top of the hill .
Is it really irrational to feel fear ?
Tom , London , UK
It was the Conservative governments of Thatcher and Major who famously changed the calculation of unemployment statistics 19 times .
Is there any reason to suppose that this massaging of statistics has ceased under New Labour ?
Perhaps public concern over the statistics relating to knife crime is fuelled by suspicion that they are not true .
John Stockton , Nottingham I heard two people talking behind me the other day .
One said , " Statistically , the levels of crime are going down . "
The other said " but that 's because people are n't reporting it , and anyone , the numbers do n't prove anything , they can be changed to suit anyone . "
And these were law students .
People believe stories rather then numbers - they mistrust numbers .
Nona , London
You say " fear drives rational , responsible behaviour out of the frame " .
Indeed it does , and yet in a world where no - one else is in a position to stop you being assaulted , taking extreme measures for one 's own protection are rational and responsible .
What seems less rational and responsible is the apparent desire of the state and media to whip up this fear , which drives more and more people into carrying a weapon .
James Marwood , UK Let 's not fool ourselves , the government could make a few common sense changes to the law and stop knife crime immediately if it wanted to .
It 's therefore easy to conclude that that the government is letting crime happen on purpose in order to create a fear - based society which does n't protest when more CCTV cameras are installed in the local ( terrified ) community .
Dean , Reading
Thank you for putting risk in a sensible context .
Nearly 3,000 people die every year on the roads ( a disproportionately high number of them also under - 25s ) .
It is clearly far riskier to set children a poor example by speeding or not making them wear seat belts - something we can actually do something about - than any danger they will ever face from knives , or paedophiles for that matter .
The media wilfully miss the point , preferring stories most of their audience can feel smugly responsible about .
Understandable perhaps .
But why do our representatives in Parliament always seem to fall for it ?
Bill , London
Yet another example of something that is inadvertently contributing to the problem that it decries - confusing maths with arithmetic .
People generally do n't make any direct use of any of the subjects they learn at school in adult life , except for English & arithmetic .
Maths has little or no relevance in the everyday lives of most people , whereas arithmetic is very useful .
Children & adults reject " maths " as they see it , since they instinctively know that calculus , trigonometry & algebra play almost no part in most people 's lives - you do n't need to know these things to work in a call centre , supermarket , hairdressers , or behind the counter at a bank .
As long as schools do n't treat arithmetic as a separate subject from maths , children will reject arithmetic automatically when they reject maths and enter the adult world innumerate .
So when they are presented with figures & statistics , they are unable to comprehend them .
When Lisa Jardine says " those around me confess that they are filled with apprehension whenever they are asked to do a simple mathematical calculation " , what she really means is " a simple ARITHMETICAL calculation " .
This sloppy substitution of maths for arithmetic needs to stop everywhere in society .
Diamond Dave , Edinburgh , Scotland , UK A very interesting and thought provoking article .
I am a maths teacher and recognise a lot of what Ms Jardine observes .
However , on what evidence does she state that " gang members who carry and use knives feel powerless " ?
I thought it was the general public who felt these emotions .

Composting is n’t just for food , silly !
You ’ll be surprised at all the strange , random junk you can toss in the compost bucket .
Do n’t draw the line at peach pits and coffee grounds – start chucking the following items into that bucket and watch your garbage bill go down while you create top - drawer dirt ( and help the planet , of course ) .
1. Bills – because somehow it ’s a lot more satisfying shoving bills in with melon rinds and egg shells than the recycle bin .
Trust me .
2. Latex condoms – both latex and sheepskin condoms are biodegradable ; note that sheepskin does not protect against STDs .
3 . Junk mail – if you ’re like me not even the Do Not Mail list has managed to alleviate the jubilant deforestation companies are undertaking on your personal behalf .
4. Catalogs and magazines – just shred them first .
5 . Old fish food and stale catnip
6. Abandoned hide / bone dog chews
7 . Worn out rope and used masking tape
8 . Any old leather – shoes , gloves , wallets , belts , “ sexy ” Halloween cat costume from college .
Note : the leather should be fairly worn out , otherwise you ’ll be dead before it degrades .
Composting does not guarantee that your friends will stop calling you Cat Woman , however .
9 . White glue – yes , you can !
10 . ATM and gas station receipts
11 . Ticket stubs , post-its , stickers , labels , price tags
12 . Ratty wool or 100 % cotton socks
13 . Old Halloween candy – when the chocolate tastes like Jelly Bellies , it ’s time to part ways .
Good times .
14 . Holey cotton underwear – come on !
15 . Dirt , crap and grime from your shoes or boots
16 . Cardboard cereal boxes – shred them up first
17 . Vacuum cleaner bag / bin contents and dryer lint
18 . Skunked beer , ancient candy bars , expired protein bars
19 . Cotton tampons and cardboard applicators – really !
20 . Expired dairy and moldy cheese – but hold the meat .
21 . Used tissues and paper towels
22 . Aquarium plants and wilted flower bouquets
23 .
Cat fur , dog hair , and nail clippings
24 . Your hair – you could even bring the clippings home from your hair dresser .
If you want .
25 . Matches
26 . Wood chips from the BBQ
27 . Fireplace and campfire ashes
28 . That cute little brie cheese box
29 . Cardboard toilet paper and paper towel rolls
30 . Hamster / guinea pig /rat / bird cage cleanings
It may seem like weird science , but all of the above objects are fully compostable .
You can compost anything of organic origin : fruit peels and pits , sandwich crusts , gluey pasta , oatmeal that ’s gone the way of cement , soggy cereal , stale pastries , nut shells , orange rinds , tea bags , coffee filters , onion skins , melon rinds , seeds , cores , old milk , stale potato chips …
Wait …you compost , right ?
Composting is free , easy , and one of the best things you can do for the environment , next to cutting down on fossil fuel consumption and minding your three R’s – reducing , reusing , recycling .
Call me juvenile , but I also feel like I ’m somehow getting away with something .
Burying bills in the dirt ?
Great !
Even if you are n’t a gardener , your green thumb neighbors will be glad to reap the benefits of all your bizarre biodegrading – and you ’ll cut down on your garbage pickup fees .

A Bronx woman is agreeing to pay the Recording Industry Association of America $ 6,050 to settle allegations she purloined eight tracks on the file sharing network Kazaa .
That 's $ 756.25 a song from artists ( .pdf ) DMX , Lenny Kravitz , Eagles , Sade , Ready For the World , Uncle Sam and Tamia .
The settlement ( .pdf ) came three weeks after the woman , Denise Barker , admitted liability and challenged ( . pdf ) the constitutionality of the Copyright Act , the law under which the RIAA sued Barker and thousands of others for copyright infringement .
Among other things , Barker alleged the act 's fines , up to $ 150,000 per track , were unconstitutionally excessive and against U.S. Supreme Court precedent .
The woman 's attorney , Ray Beckerman , said Monday that Barker decided to settle .
" The client makes the decision .
I would have loved to litigate this , " he said .
" I think we had good defenses . "
The RIAA has sued more than 20,000 individuals for illegal file sharing .
Most of the accused settle out of court for a few thousand dollars .
Barker will make 55 monthly payments of $ 110 , ending in February 2013 , according to the settlement agreement in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York .
Only one RIAA file sharing case has gone to trial , resulting in a $ 222,000 penalty , or $ 9,250 for each of the 24 purloined tracks .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A bomb killed 10 people including two U.S. government employees and two U.S. soldiers at a council meeting in the Baghdad stronghold of Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr on Tuesday , officials said .

Police said six Iraqis were killed and 10 wounded in the attack at a local council building in southern Sadr City .
The U.S. military blamed renegade Shi’ite militias called “ special groups ” for the bombing .
That is jargon for rogue elements of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia that the military says are equipped , trained and funded by Iran .
Tehran denies the charges .
U.S. forces also blamed a special group cell for a truck bomb that killed 63 people in a Shi’ite neighborhood of Baghdad a week ago .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the deaths of the American civilians , one from the State Department and the other from the Department of Defense , were “ a terrible reminder of the dangers that our colleagues face daily in advancing our critical foreign policy goals ” .
The U.S. military said a suspect who had tested positive for explosives residue had been caught trying to flee the scene .
That suggests a bomb was planted in the council building .
Lieutenant - Colonel Steven Stover , a U.S. military spokesman , said the target of the attack was believed to be a high - ranking council member .
It was unclear if that person survived .
Stover said the rogue Shi’ite militant groups were unhappy the council member was working with U.S. forces .
Mahmud al - Zamili , a member of Sadr City ’s council , said the blast occurred inside the office of the deputy head of the council .
Police said the deputy was among the wounded .
“ Special groups are afraid of progress and afraid of empowering the people , ” Lieutenant - Colonel John Digiambatista , operations officer , 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division , said in a statement .
The U.S. military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , told U.S. lawmakers in April that the “ special groups ” were the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq .
Sadr City is the bastion of Sadr ’s Mehdi Army militia , where battles between gunmen and security forces raged for weeks until a truce took effect in May .
EFFORTS TO BOOST GOVERNANCE
Scores of Americans work closely with local authorities across Iraq in an effort to improve governance and restore essential services following five years of war .
Those efforts have picked up as violence has dropped .
Senior Iraqi officials have stressed it is vital to restore government services quickly in Sadr City , a Shi’ite slum , now that fighting has ended , to give residents an alternative means of support besides the Sadrist movement and the Mehdi Army , which dispenses food and other supplies .
There has been little central government control over Sadr City for years .
Some 2 million people live in the area .

Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has sought to weaken the stranglehold of the Mehdi Army and other Shi’ite militias with a spate of military operations in areas where they have held sway , including Baghdad and the southern cities of Basra and Amara .
Iraqi and U.S. forces have also launched a crackdown against al Qaeda in the northern city of Mosul , which U.S. officials describe as the last major urban stronghold of the Sunni Arab insurgents in Iraq .
But regular attacks continue there .
On Tuesday , a car , driven by a suicide bomber , exploded near a police station in Mosul , 390 km ( 240 miles ) north of Baghdad , killing a policeman and a child and wounding 73 people , including seven policemen , police said .
The U.S. military said as many as 90 civilians were wounded in the bombing , which it blamed on al Qaeda .
It said a coffee shop was destroyed by the blast .
On Monday a gunman killed two U.S. soldiers and wounded three as they left a council building southeast of Baghdad .
Iraqi security officials said a local official in the town of Madaen had shot the U.S. soldiers who had gone to visit him .
The U.S. military said the soldiers had just attended a council meeting in the town when they were ambushed .
The identity of the attacker was unclear , the military said .
Deploying a long - promised tool to track high school dropouts , the state released numbers Wednesday estimating that 1 in 4 California students -- and 1 in 3 in Los Angeles -- quit school .
The rates are considerably higher than previously acknowledged but lower than some independent estimates .
The figures are based on a new statewide tracking system that relies on identification numbers that were issued to California public school students beginning in fall 2006 .
The ID numbers allow the state Department of Education to track students who leave one school and enroll in another in California , even if it is in a different district or city .
In the past , the inability to accurately track such students gave schools a loophole , allowing them to say that departing students had transferred to another school when , in some cases , they had dropped out .
The new system -- which will cost $ 33 million over the next three years , in addition to the millions spent for the initial development -- promises to eventually provide a far better way to understand where students go , and why .
But state and school district officials acknowledged that the data initially available Wednesday , after a final one - day delay , were limited in usefulness .

“ I think as the system stabilizes , you will get better data , ” said Esther Wong , assistant superintendent for planning , assessment and research in the Los Angeles Unified School District .
For now , she said , the numbers tell only part of the story , albeit more accurately than in the past .
Jack O’Connell , state superintendent of public instruction , presented the new data , based on the 2006 - 07 school year , as a quantum leap forward in understanding the nature of the dropout problem .
But , he said , “ no one will argue that the number of dropouts is good news .
. . .
It represents an enormous loss of potential . ”
State data analysts were able to come up with a four - year “ derived ” dropout rate , which estimates how many students drop out over the course of their high school careers .
For the state overall , it was 24.2 % , up substantially from the 13.9 % calculated for the previous school year using an older , discredited method .
Statewide , 67.6 % of students graduated and 8.2 % were neither graduates nor dropouts .
The last category included those who transferred to private schools or left the state .

School districts have until the end of August to correct data , so figures could change .
The statistics highlight a problem that is getting worse in California , said Russell Rumberger , a professor of education at UC Santa Barbara who directs the California Dropout Research Project .
Even using the old system of measurement , he said , the number of dropouts has grown by 83 % over five years while the number of high school graduates has gone up only 9 % .
“ So that ’s sobering , it ’s really sobering , ” he said .
Advertisement
Rumberger attributed the trend to three primary factors : an increase in Latino immigrants , who are among the most likely to drop out ; the raising of academic standards ; and insufficient funding for public education .
For Los Angeles Unified , the new dropout rate was 33.6 % .
The rate was 25.3 % under the old system in 2005 - 06 .
Critics , including Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , have said that as many as half of Los Angeles Unified students drop out .
But a recent report by an independent research group , Policy Analysis for California Education , put the district ’s dropout rate at 25.7 % .
O’Connell chose Birmingham High School in Van Nuys for his announcement , noting that it was the focus of a Times series on dropouts in 2006 .
He said he was particularly concerned by data showing a dropout rate of 41.6 % for black students and 30.3 % for Latino students , compared with 15.2 % for whites and 10.2 % for Asians .

“ This is a crisis , ” he said .
In Los Angeles Unified , African American students dropped out at a lower rate than their counterparts statewide .
That was not true of the other three groups .
Among large , comprehensive L.A. high schools , the highest dropout rates were recorded at Jefferson , 58 % ; Belmont , 56 % ; Locke , 50.9 % ; Crenshaw , 50 % ; and Roosevelt , 49.6 % .
Those with the lowest rates were Palisades Charter High , 2.5 % ; Granada Hills Charter , 6.4 % ; Canoga Park , 11 % ; Cleveland , 12.8 % ; El Camino , 13 % ; Taft , 13.1 % ; Chatsworth , 14.5 % ; and Fairfax , 14.9 % .
Advertisement
State officials acknowledge that even the latest figures are less than ideal .
The four - year rate is based not on students ’ actual progress over four years but on one year ’s worth of data for all four grades .
In the spring of 2011 , data will be released based on students ’ actual journey over four years .
Moreover , it remains difficult to say why students left school because codes designed to explain that , listing choices such as “ graduated , ” “ died ” and “ no show , ” are based on a different time period than the dropout rate itself .
Eventually , the two sets of figures will be synchronized , but the state was unable to do that before the release of the latest dropout figures .
The new system drew accolades even from some critics of the Department of Education .

“ Though it has taken far too long and it is only partial progress , we applaud today ’s advances , ” said John Affeldt , managing attorney of Public Advocates , which has battled the department in court over the high school exit exam , among other matters .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger hailed the data , but said it was important “ that we do n’t just look at numbers . ”
“ It ’s good information , ” he said at a briefing for reporters in Sacramento , but “ what we need to find out is , what is the reason for the dropouts ? . . .
We ’ve got to find out what the reason is and then we can work on that to eliminate those problems . ”
Some of the new dropout numbers are open to misinterpretation .
For instance , some continuation schools -- which cater to the most troubled students -- show dropout rates of more than 100 % .
That is because their enrollment is based on a single date in October , but such schools typically have students who come and go throughout the year , so more students can drop out by June than were enrolled in the fall .
Advertisement
Nevada County , a semirural swatch of Northern California whose schools generally perform well , showed a dropout rate of nearly 77 % .
The explanation , Associate Supt .
Stan Miller said , is that the county charters one of the largest dropout recovery programs in California , with campuses spread throughout the state but reported as if they were in Nevada County .
Even the most successful of such programs have high dropout rates , and the Nevada County program is large enough to outweigh the relatively low dropout rate of the county ’s own students .
What is inescapable , ultimately , is that the effort to statistically capture the complications of teen life does not lend itself to the simple analysis that a dropout rate suggests .
Susana Garcia , 18 , counts as neither a dropout nor a graduate but as a “ completer ” because she elected to take the general educational development test , or GED , rather than earn a diploma .
Advertisement
“ Obviously , people ask you , ‘ Did you graduate or do you have your diploma or GED ? ’ ” she said .
“ I do n’t want to be seen as a failure -- or a complete failure . ”
She added : “ In my mind , I still want to go back and get the diploma . ”

WASHINGTON  President Bush on Monday approved the first execution by the military since 1961 , upholding the death penalty of an Army private convicted of a series of rapes and murders more than two decades ago .
As commander in chief , the president has the final authority to approve capital punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , and he did so on Monday morning in the case of Pvt. Ronald A. Gray , convicted by court - martial for two killings and an attempted murder at Fort Bragg , N.C. , the White House said in a statement .
Although the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty in the military in 1996 , no one has been executed since President Ronald Reagan reinstated capital punishment in 1984 for military crimes .
The last military execution was ordered by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 , although it was not carried out by hanging until 1961 .
President John F. Kennedy was the last president to face the question , in 1962 , but commuted the sentence to life in prison .
WASHINGTON June 6 , 2008  --
The government of Zimbabwe is giving its impoverished citizens a stark choice , U.S. Ambassador James McGee said today : Vote for President Robert Mugabe in the upcoming election — or starve .
Millions rely on food aid in Zimbabwe , but yesterday the regime ordered that foreign aid organizations cease operations .
The Zimbabwean government 's own food aid programs are now the only source of sustenance for much of the population .
McGee told reporters during a videoconference from the capital , Harare , this morning that his embassy has solid evidence that in order to receive food aid from the government , Zimbabweans must first show their party registration cards .
If they have a card from Mugabe 's ruling party they can have access to food , but if they only have opposition cards they must turn over their national identification cards in order to receive the food they need .
The government holds onto the cards until after the June 27 election , McGee says — meaning opposition party members will not be able to identify themselves when they go to vote .
The result , McGee said , is that many in the opposition party are forced to give up their right to vote in exchange for vital food aid .
" What we have is a bunch of greedy people who want to stay in power at any cost , " the ambassador said .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called the move " outrageous . "
" That is cruel in the most sinister kind of way ; using food as a weapon , using the hunger of parents ' children against them to prevent them from voting their conscience for a better kind of Zimbabwe , " McCormack said .
" That 's an example of the kind of thing that is going on in Zimbabwe today . "
The United States is providing $ 200 million in aid to Zimbabwe this year , $ 171 million of which comes as food aid .
The balance comes mainly in the form of medical assistance like AIDS prevention .
McGee says the U.S. has no plans to cut that aid , but currently America 's help is blocked by the Mugabe government 's ban on foreign aid operations .
McGee said that around 1 million people depend on food aid from international sources .
He warns there may be " massive , massive starvation " unless the block is lifted .
State Department officials estimate that 110,000 people will go hungry this month because they wo n't have access to food aid provided by only one of the international charities that were distributing food before yesterday 's ban .
A professor of political science at the University of Zimbabwe , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears government retaliation , sees another reason for the ban on international aid groups .
" Aid groups being suspended is part of ( President Mugabe 's party ) ZANU - PF 's strategy to create a situation … where there [ will be ] a virtual information blackout in the country . …
It is likely that in the event of a complete meltdown , information about massacres and other human rights abuses will be slower in reaching the outside world .
Many people in the rural areas are truly desperate and do not know how they will survive from one day to the next , " he told ABC News .
At the end of the month Mugabe will face off against his political rival Morgan Tsvangirai in a run-off election .
Tsvangirai was detained by police Friday , his second detention this week .
McGee said he fears for Tsvangirai 's safety .
" Given the excesses of the government here , we are not sure what they will do , " he said .
Despite the political violence and intimidation McGee said the run-off should proceed as scheduled on June 27 .
" Anything less would give the Mugabe regime a victory they do not deserve , " he said .
Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in the first round of elections in March , but did not garner enough votes to avoid the run-off .
Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since it 's independence in 1980 , but has resorted to increasingly desperate measure to stay in power in recent years .
McGee called on regional powers , in particular South Africa which has significant leverage with Zimbabwe but has been reluctant to use it , to send in election monitors to ensure as fair an outcome as possible and to protect the voters .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that the U.S. is n't currently considering imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe .
However , McGee left the door open to other options pending the outcome of the elections .
The United States protested yesterday 's harassment of its diplomats on a road north of Harare to Zimbabwe 's ambassador in Washington and to Zimbabwe 's delegation to a United Nations food conference in Rome .
ABC News ' Dana Hughes contributed to this report from Nairobi , Kenya
David Davis became an unlikely hero of liberal Britain yesterday by sacrificing his political career to launch a one - man crusade against the Government 's plan for suspected terrorists to be detained for 42 days without charge .
The former SAS reservist , who supports the death penalty for premeditated murder , shook Britain 's political establishment to its roots by announcing he would stand down as an MP to fight a by - election to stop the " slow strangulation of fundamental British freedoms " .
The former shadow home secretary 's bombshell left David Cameron and many Tory colleagues seething .
But outside the Westminster village , the reaction was very different .
Mr Davis 's Commons office was flooded with telephone calls and emails from members of the public praising him for putting his principles before his career .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
While Tory MPs queued up to denounce Mr Davis as " barmy " and " mad " , the reaction of the party 's grassroots was more favourable .
A poll of 1,200 Tory members by the ConservativeHome website showed that 65 per cent of them were " inspired " by his decision .
Only 24 per cent share Mr Cameron 's anxiety that the Tories need to be careful not to get on the wrong side of public opinion on 42 - day detention , while 72 per cent disagreed .
Some 70 per cent of Tory members want Mr Davis to be reinstated as shadow home secretary if , as expected , he wins a by - election that neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats will contest .
The findings pose a headache for Mr Cameron , who tried but failed to talk Mr Davis out of his move after MPs voted narrowly to support 42 days ' detention on Wednesday .
The Tory leader has no intention of restoring Mr Davis to his former post .
Cameron aides made clear last night that he could not leave such an important position on hold when issues such as knife crime had to be addressed .
They said the appointment of Dominic Grieve , the new shadow Home Secretary , was a permanent one .
Ironically , after 21 years in Parliament , the prospect of a seat in the Cabinet finally beckoned for Mr Davis , with the Tories enjoying a commanding lead in the polls .
Some will find it bizarre that he has almost certainly given it up even though , as home secretary , he would have had enjoyed much more power to defend civil liberties than he would as a mere backbencher .
Mr Davis knows that .
He thinks it is more important to make a stand now ; that 42 - day detention is such an infringement of our liberties dating back to Magna Carta that his ambitions must take second place .
It may sound pious in the Westminster village but it may play well in the real world , where people have switched off from political parties – the MPs and MEPs who fiddle their expenses and do grubby backroom deals , as Mr Brown did to squeak through 42 - day detention with the votes of nine Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) MPs who are normally natural bedfellows of the Tories .
It was the manner of Mr Brown 's hollow victory that pushed Mr Davis over the edge .
He was spitting blood that the Prime Minister had resorted to offering " 30 pieces of silver " to the DUP to overturn civil rights enjoyed in Britain for 800 years .
The political cross-dressing has been extended by Mr Davis 's announcement .
The Ramadhan Foundation , a Muslim youth group , said : " His principled defence of civil liberties and the rule of law is an inspiration for the nation .
We look forward to a debate based on the issues and evidence and not jumped - up proposals for political benefits . "
Mr Davis is already planning his campaign for an " anti-Big Brother by - election " on 10 July .
He wants to start a debate on aspects of Britain 's " surveillance society " , including what he regards as " the most intrusive identity card system in the world " and the scale of the DNA database .

Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , backed Mr Davis .
" I think it is right from time to time to signal as a party leader that we are capable of setting aside the pursuit of narrow party - political advantage in the name of that wider principle , " he said .
The Haltemprice and Howden declaration
" The name of my constituency is Haltemprice and Howden – [ which ] is derived from a medieval proverb meaning noble endeavour .
Until yesterday I took a view that what we did in the House of Commons – representing our constituents was a noble endeavour because for centuries ... we defended the freedom of people .
Well , we did , up until yesterday .
" This Sunday is the anniversary of Magna Carta , a document that guarantees the fundamental element of British freedom , habeas corpus .
The right not to be imprisoned by the state without charge or reason .
But yesterday this house allowed the state to lock up potentially innocent citizens for up to six weeks without charge .
The Counter - Terrorism Bill will , in all probability , be rejected by the House of Lords very firmly .
After all , what should they be there for , if not to protect Magna Carta ?
" But because this is defined as political , not security , the Government will be tempted to use the Parliament Act to overrule the Lords .
" It has no democratic mandate to do this since 42 days was not in its manifesto .
Its legal basis is uncertain ... but , purely for political reasons , this Government is going to do that .
Because the generic security argument relied on will never go away – technology , development complexity , and so on – we 'll next see 56 days , 70 days , then 90 days .
But in truth perhaps 42 days is the one most salient example of the insidious , surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental British freedom .
" And we will have shortly the most intrusive identity card system in the world .
A CCTV camera for every 14 citizens , a DNA database bigger than any dictatorship has , with thousands of innocent children and millions of innocent citizens on it .
" We have witnessed an assault on jury trials , a bolt against bad law and its arbitrary use by the state .
And short cuts with our justice system , which will make our system neither firm nor fair and a creation of a database state opening up our private lives to the prying eyes of official snoopers and exposing our personal data to careless civil servants and criminal hackers .
The state has security powers to clamp down on peaceful protest and so - called hate laws to stifle legitimate debate , whilst those who incite violence get off scot - free .
This can not go on ... and for that reason today I feel it is incumbent on me to take a stand .
" I will be resigning my membership of this House and I intend to force a by - election ...
I will fight it , I will argue this by - election against the slow strangulation of fundamental British freedoms by this Government .
" Now , that may mean I have made my last speech to the House ...
But at least my electorate and the nation ... would have had the opportunity to debate and consider one of the most fundamental issues of our day ...
And if they do send me back here , it will be with a single message – that the monstrosity of a law that we passed yesterday will not stand . "
New Technology Could Make Roads a Solar Energy Source
August 18th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The most efficient form of renewable energy may be right underneath us .
Researchers at Worchester Polytechnic Institute ( WPI ) in Massachusetts announced today that they have discovered a method to use road surfaces for solar collection .
The key is using the plentiful heat absorbed by asphalt pavement .
By experimenting with different asphalt compositions , the team discovered that heat absorption in pavement can be significantly increased with the addition of highly conductive aggregates such as quartzite .
Heat exchangers could be placed a few centimeters under the pavement to collect and use solar energy .
Hot water coming from an asphalt - powered system could be used for industrial processes or to heat buildings .
According to WPI , retrofitting roads and parking lots could turn them into massive solar farms , potentially eliminating the need independently constructed solar farms .
This would be a huge boon for the solar energy industry , which currently uses huge swaths of land for its projects .
The WPI research might also make solar viable in places where it might not be otherwise , as asphalt absorbs more heat than many other surfaces .
Pretty soon , you might just appreciate your local highway a little more .

Cheney may get Secret Service after office
A bipartisan bill the House is scheduled to take up next week would require the Secret Service to protect Vice President Dick Cheney for six months after he leaves office .
The Homeland Security Department would be authorized to determine if additional protection is necessary after the initial deadline ends .
The bill ( H.R. 5938 ) was introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) and Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) , ranking member of the committee .
Reps. Bobby Scott ( D - Va. ) and Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) , the chairman and ranking member of the Crime , Terrorism and Homeland Security subcommittee , are also co-sponsors of the bill .
The legislation would require the Secret Service to protect the vice president and his or her spouse — as well as any children 16 or under — for six months after leaving office .
Cheney would be the first vice president covered by the new bill , but it would also apply to future holders of the office .
Once the six - month deadline is reached , the secretary of Homeland Security is authorized " to direct the Secret Service to provide temporary protection for any of these individuals at any time thereafter " if a senior DHS official " determines that information or conditions warrant such protection . "
Recent vice presidents , including Al Gore and Dan Quayle , were given Secret Service protection after leaving office , but that was under temporary legislation or executive order , according to a May 16 Congressional Budget Office report .
To give Cheney that same protection would cost $ 4 million next year , CBO estimated .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) has been given Secret Service protection since she left the White House in 2001 , and Sens. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) and John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) have received it as well as part of their presidential candidacies .
Cheney , who has been called the most powerful vice president in U.S. history , has been a hugely controversial figure during his time in office , and congressional sources expect that he would require additional protection once the statutory six - month term expires , if the legislation is in fact enacted .
The House is scheduled to take up the bill under suspension on Monday .
It will require a two - thirds vote to approve the legislation , but because of its bipartisan nature , the measure is not considered controversial , according to House aides .
Update and Correction — I had originally reported that former presidents get lifetime Secret Service protection .
That is not correct .
Under a 1997 law , Bill Clinton is the last president accorded such treatment .
George W. Bush will only get 10 years of Secret Service protection once he leaves office .
I apologize for the error .

It 's not only humans who suffer from the depredations of viruses .
Viruses do , too .
If that seems surprising , no wonder : until a team of French researchers watched one virus invade another , hijacking its genetic machinery and making copies of its victim 's DNA , scientists did n't even know this was possible .
At this early stage , the importance of viral parasites to human health or the environment is unknown .
At the very least , it expands our idea of what is possible in the viral world .
" It 's not the first time such a satellite pair was discovered , but this host - parasite pair is unique , " said Eugene Koonin , a virologist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and co-author of the findings , which will be published in Nature .
" It 's the first time that these viruses have actually exchanged genes . "
The players in this debut drama , entitled " The virophage as a unique parasite of the giant mimivirus , " are stories unto themselves .
Playing the traditional role is a miniscule virus composed of just 21 genes and dubbed Sputnik – a term best - known for the Russian spacecraft , and literally translated as " satellite . "
Sputnik 's victim is one of a family of physically immense viruses , the first of which was isolated from a British cooling tower by Koonin 's colleagues in 2003 .
That virus contained more than 900 genes – three times as many as any other virus .
The researchers called it a mimivirus .
The virus described in the latest study was found in a Parisian cooling tower , and is even larger .
They called it a mamavirus .
Sputnik , said Koonin , probably first evolved to infect bacteria , as is the tendency of other viruses .
But for some unknown reason , it evolved to invade the mamavirus in which his team found it .
Once inside a mamavirus , Sputnik hijacks its genetic machinery .
It uses these to make copies of the mamavirus ' genes , which it adds to its own .
While this happens , the mamavirus has difficulty replicating :
It is sick .
Some of Sputnik 's genes appear to come from an unknown viral family that 's only distantly related to already - identified viruses .
Similar genes were found in oceanic water samples taken by the J. Craig
Venter Institute .
Because Sputnik and its relatives may pass genes as readily as they steal them , University of British Columbia marine virologist
Curtis Suttle told Nature that they " could be major players in global systems . "
Koonin agreed that this was possible .
However , he cautioned , " the emphasis should be on could . "
Almost any statement about the role of parasitic viruses is speculation .
Bernard La Scola , a University of the Mediterranean virologist and co-author of the paper , speculated to New Scientist that Sputnik - like viruses could be used to target viruses that infect humans .
Koonin disagreed , noting that human - relevant viruses are too small to support parasites , and have been exhaustively studied without finding evidence of parasitism .
There is , alas , no flu season for the flu .

Wow , so many narrow minded comments .
Which is to be expected by the gaming community btw .
I see lots of guilty people that now buys games and thinks it 's right to oversimplify piracy because , oh well , I 'm not one anymore , so let 's bash them all .
Or people who thinks " it 's against the law , so it 's wrong for me " .
Because of course , it is rather easy to make statements like that .
Kudos to Cliff Harris , because at least he tried to understand the subject before sproutting nonsense on blogs or communities .
Here 's the thing : I rarely pirate things nowadays , except for stuff I can't get my hands otherwise ... like animes that did n't get licensed in my country yet , or big pricey sofware I want to fully test .
Animes and other medias only have a huge market on western countries nowadays because of piracy .
Sony Playstation only got as big as it is today because of piracy .
Lots of bands , musicians and other types of media only got known worldwide because of piracy .
And well , computers ... do I have to say anything else ?
Yes , games , music albums and DVDs really are too pricey .
And not only because this or that person is poor , but because it 's sometimes 2000 % the cost of production .
It 's hard to put a price on creativity and talent , but I do n't think that it 's fair to have people like doctors and firefighters working long hours or endangering their own lives just to get a small fraction in a month of what an artist can get in on day 's work .
Things are completely messed up nowadays .
People tend to blame piracy for lots of things , but I never saw artists giving up on their careers because of it .
I mean , TRUE artists , not people who are there only for the money .
Because long ago , most people wo n't remember this anymore , being a musician was all about making musics for people to enjoy and listen ... not making music to make money and fortune .
That said , yeah , lots of people pirate stuff because it 's for free .
Lots of people also get free samples twice because it's for free , even if they have the money to pay for it .
It 's a cultural problem , and no law will ever correct it .
If we want people to pay for stuff they value , we have to work on the education system , not forcing laws on it .
I always buy movies , licensed animes , music albums and other stuff , even though I still think the price is unfair , to support the works of those I like .
For games it 's the same .
But I will only pay those ridiculous prices when I 'm shure the game is worth it .
I 'm really sorry for companies that goes bankrupt because of games that people do n't buy , but games are risky business .
If they were n't prepared to take the plunge , they should 've never began with it in the first place .
Lots of companies will say they gone bankrupt because of piracy , but those who actually tries to understand what really happened behind the scenes will know that piracy was not the reason .
A game that went bad , a failed marketting strategy , unexperienced programmers and other stuff like that are usually the real reasons behind it .
I know lots of people will disagree with me , but I think some oversimplifies the matter .
Piracy is n't something localized , is n't something that some few assholes do ... it 's a worlwide phenomena , and it does have legitim reasons to exist .
So , that 's it .
I can only hope big companies stops trying to delay the matter , stops with the DRM / RIAA / MPAA crap , stops with failed anti-piracy plots , and do something like this guy did .
Try to undestand what 's going on , listen to the other side , and work with that to solve the problem .

How high is high ?
Posted Sunday , March 30 , 2008 6:17 am
In a 4 - 1 decision , the justices said the helicopter was n't high enough when it went looking for marijuana plants outside his home .
The lone dissenter , Justice John Dooley , agreed that airspace is protected but said the majority went overboard in reversing the 2005 conviction of Stephen Bryant .
" It does n't matter if the invasion comes on wheels or on helicopter rotors , " said Bryant 's lawyer , William Nelson .
" Vermonters have a right to expect the government will not be intruding on their privacy , whether it's in their house , in their backyard or on their property . "
Bryant , a 57 - year - old contractor , testified at his 2005 trial in Vermont District Court in Middlebury that he uses marijuana as an analgesic , to cope with pain he suffers as the result of a construction accident in the 1970s .
His property , on a wooded hillside in a remote area of Goshen , is accessible by a locked gate on a U.S. Forest Service road .
The case began after a Forest Service official , believing Bryant " paranoid " about his privacy , suggested to Vermont State Police that it might be a good idea to do a fly - over to look for marijuana .
On Aug. 7 , 2003 , a state trooper and an Army National Guard pilot flew over the property , the National Guard helicopter hovering about 100 feet above it for 15 to 30 minutes , according to Friday 's court opinion .

They spotted two plots of marijuana growing about on his property and applied for a search warrant based on what they saw , eventually finding about 45 plants .
Bryant , who was charged with cultivation and possession of marijuana , lost his bid to suppress the marijuana evidence before his trial .
At trial , a jury convicted him of cultivation but acquitted him of possession .

Under National Guard rules , aircraft participating in counter - drug surveillance are supposed to maintain a minimum altitude of 500 feet .
Under Vermont law , the standard for aircraft is the same , except for when they 're flying above open water or sparsely - populated areas .
The trooper and pilot testified that they maintained that altitude throughout the flight , but witnesses  including one who said the helicopter was so low he could 've hit it with a rock  said the helicopter was 100 feet up at most .
A trial judge said the trooper and pilot were n't credible in saying they stayed at 500 feet , but also ruled that Bryant had no reasonable expectation of privacy from the sky .
In Friday 's ruling , the justices disagreed .

" The occupants were law - enforcement officers , trained in the identification of marijuana , who conducted an overflight at illegal altitudes solely for the purpose of discovering evidence of crime within a private enclave into which they were constitutionally forbidden to intrude at ground level without a warrant , " they said in the ruling .
" The actions of law enforcement  flying only 100 feet above the ground for up to 30 minutes over a hillside home  were an unreasonable intrusion of privacy that triggers constitutional protection , " they wrote .
Bryant could not be reached for comment .
He does n't have a telephone , according to Nelson , who called the ruling an important one for privacy  and for naked sunbathers .
" It 's an opinion that will have broad effect , because it sets out a constitutional rule that applies to aerial surveillance throughout the state .
Exactly how the rules will evolve is up in the air , if you 'll pardon the pun , " he said .

This is more Haskell translation of my reading of “ Functional Programming with Bananas , Lenses , Envelopes and Barbed Wire ” , this time concerning fixed points of data types .
First , what is a fixed point ( aka. fixpoint ) ?
In calculus , functions can have fixed points .
These are values such that .
As an example , has a fixed point at both 0 and 1 .
For , every is a fixpoint !
The notion of fixpoints in programming is somewhat different , though related .
In programming fixed points are about self - application , rather than the calculus definition above .
I hope the distinction will become clear with some examples .
First , consider the following definition of a simple pair - like type :
data Pair a b = Pair a b
I can use any type I like for a and b , including , say , Pair a b :
example1 = Pair 1 ( Pair 2 'a ' )
I could go further :
example2 = Pair 1 ( Pair 2 ( Pair 3 ( Pair 4 ( Pair 5 ' a ' ) ) ) )
Is that starting to look familiar ?
This is an approximation of lists , though not exactly a pleasant one to work with .
Note that Pair a is a Functor .
This idea of applying a Functor to itself is exactly fixpoints of data types .
With the Pair a Functor , there is nothing to stop the self - application , so we have something isomorphic to an infinite [ a ] .
Augmenting Pair to include a second , nullary , constructor , thus :
data Pair a b = Stop | Pair a b
We can then take the fixpoint of the Functor Pair a , which is isomorphic to :
data PairFix a = Stop | Pair a ( PairFix a )
And that is clearly isomorphic to desugared lists :
data List a = Empty | Cons a ( List a )
We can even abstract this notion of self - application of a Functor in a curious newtype :
newtype Functor f =>
Mu f =
In ( f ( Mu f ) )
Such that PairFix a = Mu ( Pair a ) , assuming we ’ve declared an instance of Functor for Pair a .
Lists are actually only one example .
Mu can be applied to any Functor .
Using the binary tree implementation from a previous post ,
data Tree a = Empty |
Tree a ( Tree a ) ( Tree a )
This is the fixpoint of the following type :
data Cell a b = Empty | Cell a b b
Since Cell a forms a Functor , Mu ( Cell a ) == Tree a .
This is all merely an intriguing bit of type theory until we make the realization that all of these structures have something in common .
That something is that they can all be recursed over .
This can be seen most clearly by looking at lists , which as I demonstrated above are isomorphic to Mu ( Pair a ) using the second definition of Pair .
The main thrust of Functional Programming with Bananas , Lenses , Envelopes and Barbed Wire is that recursion patterns ( ie. higher - order functions ) we generally think of as being for lists are in fact applicable to any fixpoint data structure .
The paper goes on to describe four core “ foomorphisms ” : catamorphisms , anamorphisms , hylomorphisms and paramorphisms .
The names are from Greek , and like “ monad ” and “ functor ” are far scarier than the things they name .
These are generalizations of foldr , unfoldr , primitive recursion and primitive recursion with an accumulating parameter , respectively .
I had originally planned to describe these in more detail here , but Edward Kmett ( edwardk ) has begun writing a Field Guide to all of these recursion schemes .
His posts on each of the foomorphisms include both category theory and concrete examples , and are an excellent read .
As you can see from the front page of his Field Guide , there are many , many more than the four described in the original paper .
Implementations of all of these and much more are available in category - extras on Hackage .
I will still describe some of the core examples and definitions from the paper in later posts .
In particular my explorations of the standard examples ( Peano numbers , factorial , trees ) from Edward Kmett ’s Guide and elsewhere .
My goal is to learn to recognize them well “ in the wild ” , since they aid understanding even when the function does n’t explicitly use the foomorphism .

Because of its use of stem cells , a skin regenerating gun would certainly cause a stir among conservative types - but if you were caught out on a battlefield with a gaping wound , you would be begging for technology like this .
That is why the Armed Forces Institute for Regenerative Medicine invested $ 250 million in a project focused on therapies like the famous " Pixie Dust " that can help heal soldiers on the front lines in Iraq .
As for the the " skin gun , " it could spray skin - healing stem cells over a wound - helping it heal in a matter of hours .

Given the relatively small amount of funding and the potential ethical roadblocks the military would run into trying to develop a skin gun , my guess is that we probably wo n't see a device like this in our local pharmacy anytime soon .
But it is interesting to think that it could be possible somewhere down the line .

Want to quit smoking ?
Next time the urge to light up strikes , think of snow - capped peaks instead of the fleeting pleasure of a white cigarette .
That ’s the conclusion of a new brain study which shows that thinking happy thoughts could help dampen cravings .
Mauricio Delgado , a cognitive neuroscientist at Rutgers University in Newark , New Jersey , and his colleague Elizabeth Phelps of New York University measured the brain activity of 15 volunteers as they played a simple game .
The researchers told their subjects to associate blue cards with a real $ 4 payoff , and yellow cards with nothing .
To control for potential biases , they swapped the colour assignments for half the volunteers .
Before either a yellow or blue card flashed onto a computer screen , the volunteers received an instruction to either concentrate on their prize or instead on some calming , natural object – a blue ocean , for instance .

Delgado ’s team measured how excited volunteers were by attaching an electrode to each volunteer ’s finger , as increased excitement changes the electrical behaviour of the skin , possibly because of changes in sweat levels .
When there was not $ 4 up for grabs , volunteers stayed perfectly calm no matter what they were thinking .
Sweaty palms
But with the flash of a blue card and money on the line , volunteers who thought about the cash showed more excitement than those who pictured the sea , the sky or some other succour .
The same trend held for the volunteers told to link yellow cards to cash .
Under an fMRI scanner , thoughts of clouds and oceans slightly lowered activity in the brain ’s reward centre – the striatum – compared to thoughts of money , but only when the card promised a payoff .
Phelps , for one , is n’t surprised .
Whether it ’s a child ignoring the smell of cookies baking or a former smoker fighting the itch to light up at a bar , we all fight our impulses .
“ Anybody who ’s functioning well in the world is doing it , ” she says .
Holding back
If drug addicts , gambling addicts or alcoholics are worse at ignoring their cravings than others , cognitive control might help them kick their habit , Delgado says .
Yet promise of a high will be harder to temper than the chance to win a few bucks .
Brian Knutson , a neuroscientist at Stanford University in California , notes that in the study , as well as in real life , people ca n’t totally subvert their brains ’ whims .
“ If it were so easy to do , then why do we eat the chocolate cake when we ’re on a diet , why do we smoke crack cocaine when we see a pipe ? ” he says .
But Delgado says that making addicts think about more precious things could make the technique even more powerful .
“ The cocaine addict might not care about fluffy clouds , but they ’ll really care about thinking about their family or loved ones , ” he says .

Study finds a healthier diet and a return to traditional farming can help reduce energy consumption in US food system by 50 percent .
An estimated 19 percent of total energy used in the USA is taken up in the production and supply of food .
Currently , this mostly comes from non-renewable energy sources which are in short supply .
It is therefore of paramount importance that ways of reducing this significant fuel consumption in the US food system are found .
David Pimentel and his colleagues at Cornell University in New York set out a number of strategies which could potentially cut fossil energy fuel use in the food system by as much as 50 percent .
The first , and very astute suggestion they put forward is that individuals eat less , especially considering that the average American consumes an estimated 3,747 calories a day , a staggering 1200 - 1500 calories over recommendations .
Traditional American diets are high in animal products , and junk and processed foods in particular , which by their nature use more energy than that used to produce staple foods such as potatoes , rice , fruits and vegetables .
By just reducing junk food intake and converting to diets lower in meat , the average American could have a massive impact on fuel consumption as well as improving his or her health .
Further savings are possible in the food production industry .
The authors suggest that moving towards more traditional , organic farming methods would help because conventional meat and dairy production is extremely energy intensive .
Similarly , in crop production , reduced pesticide use , increased use of manure , cover crops and crop rotations improve energy efficiency .
Finally , changes to methods of food processing , packaging and distribution could also help to reduce fuel consumption .
Although well - established energy - saving considerations in lighting , heating and packaging materials all have their part to play , the authors again highlight individual responsibility as having the biggest impact .
They contend that the most dramatic reduction in energy used for food processing would come about if consumers reduced their demand for highly processed foods .
This would also help cut down food miles and its related fuel cost as US food travels an average of 2,400 km before it is consumed .
This study argues strongly that the consumer is in the strongest position to contribute to a reduction in energy use .
As individuals embrace a ‘ greener ’ lifestyle , an awareness of the influence their food choices have on energy resources might be added encouragement for them to buy good , local produce and avoid highly processed , heavily packaged and nutritionally inferior food .
As well as leading to a cleaner environment , this would also lead to better health .

I 've heard rumors for years that performance in PCMark 2005 could change depending on what CPUID was handed to the benchmark , but this is the first opportunity I 've ever had to test that theory .
The term CPUID refers to a processor - specific character string that stores information on the chip 's manufacturer , available features , make , and model .
Different manufacturers use different CPUIDs , including GenuineIntel , AuthenticAMD , CentaurHauls , and the now - obsolete CyrixInstead .
Intel and AMD both lock their CPUIDs to prevent them being changed by a third party , but VIA does n't — and that gives us an opportunity to explore a question that normally can't be explored .
By changing Nano's CPUID , we can change what value is handed off to FutureMark and expose any irregularities in the benchmark results .
If everything is five by five , we should n't see any meaningful performance variation at all .
According to the PCMark 2005 whitepaper , " The cornerstones of our design process are transparency and neutrality .
We make a strong effort to document all processes that make up the benchmark ...
Also , we always maintain the highest standards of neutrality , neither favoring nor dis- favoring any party .
I 'd say that lays out the company 's position in no uncertain terms , so lets take a look at how different CPUIDs impact Nano 's performance .
The graph above covers all of PCMark 2005 's test suites except for the memory benchmark .
As you can see , everything here is as it should be ; PCMark does n't care if Nano identifies itself as GenuineIntel or CentaurHauls .
Memory subsystem performance , on the other hand , looks a wee bit different .
My my .
Swap CentaurHauls for AuthenticAMD , and Nano 's performance magically jumps about 10 percent .
Swap for GenuineIntel , and memory performance goes up no less than 47.4 percent .
This is not a test error or random occurrence ; I benchmarked each CPUID multiple times across multiple reboots on completely clean Windows XP installations .
The gains themselves are not confined to a small group of tests within the memory subsystem evaluation , but stretch across the entire series of read / write tests .
Only the memory latency results remain unchanged between the two CPUIDs .
At the very least , this suggests some incredibly sloppy coding on Futuremark 's part , as the company may be enabling or disabling CPU optimizations based on a processor 's vendor name in CPUID instead of actually checking CPUID for SIMD support .
In this case , PCMark 2005 's memory subsystem test does n't appear to be aware that Nano supports SSE2 and SSE3 , and is instead running a decidedly less - optimized code path .
There are two factors , however , that make this explanation a bit difficult to swallow .
First , there 's the issue of timing .
PCMark 2005 was released ( obviously ) in 2005 , and was obviously coded with an eye towards supporting current and future processors .
This is standard operating procedure for Futuremark , which always builds benchmarks designed to last for at least a year , and often two .
VIA 's C5N - T ( Nehemiah ) core may have only supported MMX and 3DNow ! , but the C7 launched in 2005 , and that processor supported SSE2 and SSE3 from day one .
Even if proper extension support was n't built into the first version of PCM2K5 , we tested version 1.2.0 , and that patch was released on or around 11 - 29-2006 .
Second , there 's the issue of performance when Nano is identified as AuthenticAMD .
If performance between the AMD and Intel CPUIDs was identical , there would n't really be a story here , but it is n't , and that 's curious .
Futuremark could plausibly argue that VIA 's C3/C7 processors were n't exactly on the radar back in 2004 - 2005 , but AMD and K8 certainly were , and K8 launched with full SSE and SSE2 support , with SSE3 added in 2005 .
None of this constitutes proof of wrongdoing , but it flies in the face of Futuremark 's neutrality claims .
Bad code is a fact of life , but companies that write benchmarks for a living and sell those benchmarks as evaluation tools have a responsibility to ensure that their software delivers the neutral framework that it promises .
Based on the information I 've gathered thus far , it seems Futuremark may have created three paths — one for Intel , one for AMD , and one generic " other " path .
There 's nothing wrong with optimized code paths , but our results would seem to indicate that some paths are decidedly more optimized than others .

I am tired of hearing pathetic Democrats cry about stolen elections .
Fine ... it has been proven that George W. Bush and his handlers stole the last two presidential elections .
The evidence is voluminous .
The fact is that we have been living under the rule of enemies domestic for almost eight years and Congress , along with our military , have allowed these enemies of the state to remain in control of our government .
Does n't that tell you something ?
Do n't you see a larger problem here ?
Let me tell you whiny Democrats something ... the Bush cartel did not steal the elections from the Democrats ... they stole the election from the other criminal cartels who decide in advance which men we may choose from to be our president !
The battle over who becomes president does not take place among the citizens of this nation , it takes place among groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg Group .
Let me tell you something ... the Cheney / PNAC cabal stole the elections from George H.W. Bush , James Baker , George Schultz and associates , not from the Democrats .
They are the ones who assembled the Bush administration and rigged the 2000 election to place them in power as a proxy presidential administration .
The problem was that the Neocons , once in office , took control and did what they wanted to do , not what their sponsors wanted them to do .
Here is how it used to work .
The media , which is controlled by the real power brokers in this nation , have controlled elections in the past by presenting and withholding selected information from the public in order to influence their voting .
By doing so , they pretty much guarantee the outcome of an election .
Do you think that if the media did their job and actually informed the public accurately about who George W. Bush was and what his qualifications were he would have stood a chance of becoming a US President ?
This guy was less qualified to be president than Brittney Spears is qualified to be a parent !
He was a proxy for the real power brokers - the Bush Sr. / James Baker gang .
The problem was that those guys underestimated Cheney and his re-assembled crazies !
In 2000 , the Internet came to the rescue of the electorate .
For the first time , the public saw through the media mind control and voted against the pre-selected winner .
Even the US media could not make a case for the pathetically unqualified historical failure known as W. , becoming the next US president .
The people were not going to follow the propaganda of the media and they were going to cast their votes accordingly .
So the power brokers rigged the election in a new way ... they messed with the votes .
In 2000 , Al Gore was the people 's choice , or so it seemed .
You see Gore was the choice of the people only because the media , at the behest of the power brokers , only present us with their menu .
We think we get to choose our president , but we only see the menu after it is prepared by the global power broker chefs .
You can never become president .
No matter how qualified you are your message will never be heard by your fellow Americans unless you are accepted by the power brokers .
The damn media admit this to you every damn election !
They tell you right out who is and who is not " electable ! "
They say this on the air !
Pardon my language but what the fuck does that mean ?
Who the hell are they to tell me , a voter , who is electable ?
In a democracy we tell the media who is electable , in a dictatorship they tell us !
Wake up folks ... it 's obvious !
The fact is that in order to be a US president , or a member of Congress who has even the slightest relevance , you must be approved by either the Bilderberg Group , the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission ( Obama ) or these days the Neocons ( McCain ) .
And guess who has the last say about whom you can elect , or I should say " select " ?
AIPAC !
That 's right ... if Israel does n't pre-approve our politicians ... forget it ... they are not selectable !
And that 's a fact !
Wake up folks ... the system is broken and for the life of me I can't think of a single way to use the system to fix the system .
We need a new system .
" Selecting " a Democrat is not the answer .
Our problems are bigger than that .
Until we accept this fact we will continue to tear our nation apart with the red herring known as the " our guy is better than their guy " game .
Republicans , Democrats and all other party members ... get this through your heads ... NONE OF THEM ARE OUR GUYS !
Left & Right Unite !
Think about it !

The Stolen 200 Election
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Alzheimer ’s patients given a popular rheumatoid arthritis drug showed seemingly dramatic improvements in a small study , but some doctors worried that the early findings will raise premature hopes in patients and their families .
The study , reported on Sunday in the journal BioMed Central BMC Neurology , involved 12 patients who had greatly improved language recall shortly after treatment with Enbrel , or etanercept , an anti-inflammatory drug co-marketed by Amgen and Wyeth .
“ We often see verbal effects within a few minutes of the first dose , ” said Dr. Edward Tobinick , director of the Institute for Neurological Research , a private medical group inc. , in Los Angeles , who led the study .
Tobinick invented and holds several patents on a special method of injecting the drug into the neck .
He said he charges anywhere between $ 10,000 and $ 40,000 per patient for the treatments .
In January , Tobinick ’s report on a single patient , and release of a striking video , drew the attention of the Alzheimer ’s Association , which released a statement expressing concern .
“ People with Alzheimer ’s and their families may place undue value on this new finding based on the dramatic language used in its description and the apparent immediate effect , ” the group said .
INDEPENDENT RESULTS NEEDED
“ We need to see work in other laboratories by scientists without financial interest in the product , ” it added .
Dr. Sam Gandy , chairman of the Alzheimer ’s Association ’s medical and science council , said the latest study , done at Tobinick ’s clinic , does not offer that independent confirmation .
“ It ’s still not a proper trial , ” Gandy said .
Tobinick believes the drug may work in the brain by blocking an excess of tumor necrosis factor - alpha or TNF - alpha , which may affect communication in the brain .
The study looked at language difficulties , such as in finding words , in 12 patients with mild - to - severe Alzheimer ’s disease who were administered etanercept weekly for six months .
“ There was a significant improvement in the majority of the verbal measures that were studied .
The remainder showed a tendency toward improvement , which was not significant , ” Tobinick said in a telephone interview .
He said the study provides evidence that “ excess TNF , in the Alzheimer brain , may offer a new way to address this language dysfunction . ”
Tobinick acknowledged the study is limited because people knew they were getting the drug .
Alzheimer ’s patients in such open - label studies often show improvement .
“ Placebo effect is an enormous problem in open - label studies , ” said Dr. Scott Turner , incoming director of the Memory Disorders Program at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington .
Turner said the true test must come from a more scientifically rigorous double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized clinical trial .
In such studies , patients receive either a dummy treatment or an active agent , and neither the doctor nor the patient knows which .
Amgen has also expressed concern about the research , claiming there has been insufficient evidence so far .
“ This off - label , unapproved treatment , administered by Dr. Edward Tobinick , is not supported nor endorsed by Amgen , ” the company said in April on its Web site .

If you 're just looking to play through Wario Land : Shake
It , finish its levels and see the ending , I have a feeling that it 's not going to put up much of a fight .
But dig a little deeper and I think there will be plenty of challenge .
The* Wario Land series of * 2 - D platform games starring Mario 's disgusting blob of an alter ego generally take the Mario formula and adding lots of punching , kicking and slamming things around .
As you might imagine , Shake
It adds shaking :
By grabbing on to most anything and shaking the controller , you can shake things out of it – things like money .
Money is key .
Collecting cash in the various levels is what allows you to buy the maps that open up even more levels .
If you 've played a* Wario * game before , you mostly know what to expect here – you 'll run through levels smashing , bashing and shaking everything in sight , turning up coins and treasures .
There are three treasures hidden in each level , and finding each means going a bit off the beaten path .
But this is n't what I 'm alluding to when I say the game will ramp up the difficulty the deeper you go .
Each stage also has three mini-missions that you can choose to complete when you 're playing through it .
In the first stage , for example , the missions were :
Get 10,000 coins
Jump on a bandanna - clad enemy
Kill the golden enemy
The first two of these , I finished simply while playing through the level normally , but the last one I had to go back into the level to find .
And to get credit for doing it , you have to finish the level – no going in , completing the mission , and then jumping back out .
The thing is , the hardest of these missions will likely all center around the stages ' final moments .
At the end of each stage , you 'll find one of the fairy - people that you 're trying to rescue .
At that point , an alarm blares , a timer starts counting down and you have to race back to the beginning of the stage .
There 's always a device hidden somewhere nearby that will eject you out of it at lightning speed , and you 'll be able to maintain that momentum as long as you do n't run into anything .
Many stages have a mission requirement that you make it back to the beginning under a certain amount of time , so maintaining this momentum is key – and if you lose it , you 're likely SOL .
More than simple time - based races , though , these mad dashes are through areas of the level that you 'll only get to visit this one time , and so there will be coins and things scattered about that you 'll need to collect .
In one early level , one of the missions is " explode all of the exploding blocks " , and there 's a whole bunch of them above the sky during this mad dash to the exit .
If you do n't hit them all on your first pass , or fall off of the sky bridge they form , you 'll have to try it all over again .
I expect a fair few people will take up all of Wario 's extra challenges , mostly because the game itself is fun .
The platforming is just how Wario should feel – a little more sluggish than Mario , but still precise .
The animation – with an opening sequence produced by * Ghost In The Shell makers Production I.G – is excellent , the music is great and everything feels highly polished .

It will be released in the United States on September 22 .

New Study Says City - Based Rooftop Wind Power Does n’t Pay Off
August 7th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
A new study put out by the UK ’s Carbon Trust reports that domestic windmills in urban locations are actually net carbon emitters , as more energy goes into their production , shipping , and maintenance than is saved by their use .
Additionally , the study notes that home wind power could only provide .4 % of UK electricity consumption and will only save .6 million tons of carbon dioxide .
For reference , the Carbon Trust says that 1.5 TWh could be produced annually using urban windmills — and the UK used 2,700 TWh of energy in 2006 .
The reason why urban windmills are n’t useful is fairly simple .
The Carbon Trust explains that small wind turbines require open , exposed locations that have high wind speeds .
These locations are usually found in rural areas , which can produce nine times more wind energy than urban areas .
Since the output from urban windmills is low , the cost of the resulting energy ends up being high .
But while wind energy may not be the way to go in cities , that does n’t mean that urban homes ca n’t make use of alternative energies .
Solar power is becoming increasingly popular , and plenty of cities around the world get more than enough sunshine to utilize it effectively .
Additionally , transmission lines can deliver wind power from rural areas to urban areas .
So if you ’re really stuck on powering your apartment or townhouse with wind , the future is n’t entirely bleak .

This morning I received a request to sign an â€œEconomistsâ€ ™ Statement in Support of John McCainâ€™s Economic Plan.â€ 
The statement laid out his plans to prevent taxes from rising , to reduce some taxes , such as the corporate income tax , to support free trade agreements , and to restrain the growth of domestic government spending .
Notice something missing ?
I did .
Hereâ€™s the answer I sent to the co-chair , economist James Carter :
There ’s nothing in there I disagree with .
[ I later found a few things but I agreed with the vast majority . ]
The problem is that it leaves out a huge part of his economic policy that will make it virtually impossible to achieve what ’s in the statement .
That huge part is his policy on war–with Iraq and maybe with Iran .
War is very expensive and is part of an economic policy .
So by signing the statement , I would be helping Senator McCain maintain the fiction that there ’s no connection between war and economic policy .
I ’m unwilling to do that .
Diplomats from around the world have urged an end to the persistent plague of sexual violence during armed conflicts , at a meeting at UN headquarters .
" Rape is a crime that can never be condoned .
Yet women and girls in conflict situations around the world have been subjected to widespread and deliberate acts of sexual violence , " said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
She was chairing debate on Thursday in the UN Security Council to demand an immediate end to the use of rape and all acts of sexual violence against women as weapons of war .
The day - long debate , at the initiative of the United States , which chairs the 15 - member council this month , was to adopt a resolution that " demands the immediate and complete cessation by all parties to armed conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians with immediate effect . "
" Today 's resolution establishes a mechanism for bringing those atrocities to light , " the US chief diplomat said .
Monsanto , the leader in agricultural biotechnology , pledged Wednesday to develop seeds that would double the yields of corn , soybeans and cotton by 2030 and would require 30 percent less water , land and energy to grow .
The announcement , coming as world leaders are meeting in Rome to discuss rising food prices and growing food shortages , appears to be aimed at least in part at winning acceptance of genetically modified crops by showing that they can play a major role in feeding the world .
Much of what is in the commitment are things the company was doing anyway .
But Monsanto ’s chief executive , Hugh Grant , said in an interview Wednesday that the company wanted to make the goals public “ so this is n’t just a bound report on some library shelf . ”
He said it was only coincidence that the announcement was made at the same time as the meeting in Rome .
Monsanto said it had developed its commitment after consulting farmers , political leaders , academics and advocacy groups as to what needed to be done to increase food production without converting more forests into farmland or increasing pollution .
Washington ’s new alibi for a criminal war : the “ surge has worked ”
By Bill Van Auken
26 June 2008
A growing consensus has emerged within the US political establishment , extending to both major parties and the predominant sections of the mass media that the so - called “ surge ” — the Bush administration ’s euphemism for military escalation — has “ worked . ”
Supporters of this thesis point to figures supplied by the Pentagon showing a decline in death tolls — among both US troops and Iraqi civilians alike — compared to the horrific totals recorded at the beginning of last year , before the arrival of the additional 40,000 US troops .
According to figures compiled by Iraqi security forces , 532 Iraqis were killed last month either by US occupation troops , Iraqi government forces , insurgent attacks or sectarian violence .
Nineteen US soldiers and Marines lost their lives in Iraq in May .
Both represent roughly a quarter the number killed in January 2007
While a significant reduction compared to the appalling 1,920 Iraqi civilians reported killed in January of last year , this official toll undoubtedly represents a gross underestimation of the real number of deaths , many of which go unreported .
Even on its face — at nearly 18 a day — it represents a terrible loss of life and the continuation of a simmering insurgency .
Moreover , nearly three times as many US troops were killed in April as in May while the Iraqi death toll numbered in the thousands , as fighting raged in Basra and the slums of Baghdad ’s Sadr City .
There is no evidence that the underlying social and political tensions , much less the strength of the US - backed Iraqi regime , have been transformed over the space of a month .
Indeed , the Government Accountability Office , the nonpartisan investigative arm of the US Congress issued a report this week stressing the narrow character of the surge ’s supposed success and insisting that a new strategy is needed .
The GAO reported that the number of armed attacks in Iraq had declined from about 180 a day in June 2007 to about 50 per day in February 2008 .
It attributed the decline to the pouring in of the additional US combat troops as well as the Pentagon ’s arming and paying Sunni militia forces like the Sons of Iraq , and the ceasefire maintained by the Mahdi Army , the militia loyal to Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr .
Clearly , these are hardly firm foundations for the success claimed by the surge ’s proponents .
The additional combat troops are to be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of next month .
The Sunni militias ’ alliance of convenience with the US occupation forces is based upon their fear of and hostility toward the US - backed Shia - dominated central government , while , as the fighting this spring demonstrated , the Mahdi Army truce can collapse at any time .
“ The security environment remains volatile and dangerous , ” the report concludes .
It paints a picture of an Iraqi regime that is wholly dysfunctional .
Barely 10 percent of Iraqi security forces are capable of operating independently of US occupation troops , the GAO points out , while the government has failed to spend more than 24 percent of the funds allocated for the country ’s reconstruction because of “ violence and sectarian strife , shortage of skilled labor , and weak procurement and budgeting systems . ”
As a result , despite nearly $ 5 billion in US investment in the country ’s electricity sector , it is capable of meeting barely half the country ’s demand for power , with electricity available in Baghdad barely eight hours a day .
Other essential social indices are just as bad .
According to the GAO , due to the continuing breakdown of basic infrastructure as well as the mass displacement of the Iraqi population by armed violence , “ only one in three Iraqi children under the age of 5 has access to safe drinking water , and only 17 percent of Iraq ’s sewage is treated before being discharged into the country ’s rivers and waterways , ” creating the conditions for deadly epidemics .
There are , as well , signs that the May lull in casualties has come to an end in June .
A series of violent incidents took place this week , two of them at meetings of local councils formed by the occupation to assist in controlling hostile areas .
On Monday , a Sunni council member in a town southeast of Baghdad , described as someone the US forces “ used to love , ” opened fire on American troops after a weekly meeting , killing two and wounding three , as well as an interpreter , before being killed himself .
At a council meeting in Baghdad ’s Sadr City the next day , a bomb went off , killing 10 people , including two US soldiers and two US civilian government employees .
Just hours later , three American soldiers and an interpreter were killed by a roadside bomb in the northern province of Nineveh .
None of this dissuades the surge ’s proponents , who are fully engaged in the spinning of a “ new narrative ” about Iraq , based on the thesis that the “ surge has worked . ”
How or why the US war began , they insist , is irrelevant , the only question is to build on this purported success .
The campaign of the Republican Party ’s presumptive presidential candidate Senator John McCain rests heavily on this contention , with McCain claiming credit for backing the surge .
Together with the bulk of the media , the Republicans have shamed their Democratic rivals into embracing this theory .
Thus , Obama recently declared “ how encouraged ” he was by “ the reductions in violence in Iraq ” and vowed that “ an Obama administration will make sure that we continue with the progress that ’s been made in Iraq , that we wo n’t act precipitously . ”
While he postured in the Democratic primaries as an antiwar candidate , vowing to withdraw US troops from Iraq , Obama ’s platform has always envisioned a substantial US force remaining in the country for “ counter - terrorism ” operations and to protect US interests .
A more concrete insight into the thinking of the Democratic establishment came in the form of a paper drafted in April by Obama ’s key adviser on Iraq , Colin Kahl , professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service .
Entitled “ Stay on Success : A Policy of Conditional Engagement , ” Kahl proposal calls for negotiations with the Iraqi government to allow Washington “ to transition to a sustainable over - watch posture ( of perhaps 60,000 - 80,000 forces ) by the end of 2010 . ”
So much for illusions that the election of Obama in November will spell an end to the five - year - old war and occupation .
Meanwhile , from the media there is a steady drumbeat from the editorial pages of the major dailies as well as from the broadcast pundits along the same lines .
This one - sided debate over the merits of the surge unfolds in the context of a virtual blackout of news about the ongoing struggle in Iraq .
While on the whole never too penetrating , reporting by the media has all but disappeared .
According to a recent survey published by the Project for Excellence in Journalism , major news outlets are devoting less than 1 percent of their coverage to events in the occupied country .
During the second week of this month , in which the deaths of 153 Iraqis and seven US troops were recorded , the media gave the Iraq war less than half the coverage it devoted to the tomato salmonella scare .
Under these conditions , Thomas Friedman , the foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times , a leading media propagandist for the war in 2002 - 2003 , now writes that “ debating the merits of the war ” is pointless , and that , based on the surge ’s supposed gains , the real question is : “ can something decent still be salvaged there at an acceptable cost — something that can still serve our interests , do right by Iraqis and maybe put in place the seeds of an open society that will pay long - term benefits ? ”
Meanwhile , Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post , one of the most enthusiastic cheerleaders for American militarism in the Middle East , wrote a column demanding that McCain to “ make the election about Iraq , ” while insisting that “ everything is changed , ” and “ we are winning on every front . ”
Finally , David Brooks , one of the right - wing editorial columnists of the New York Times published a column Tuesday entitled “ The Bush Paradox , ” attempting to utilize the surge to salvage the reputation of a man who is arguably the most unpopular occupant of the White House in US history .
“ One thing is clear , ” writes Brooks .
“ Every personal trait that led Bush to make a hash of the first years of the war led him to make a successful decision when it came to this crucial call . ”
Among the traits Brooks attributes to Bush are “ stubbornness , that unwillingness to accept defeat on his watch , ” without which , he says , “ he never would have bucked the opposition to the surge . ”
He describes the US president as “ outrageously self - confident , ” a quality that supposedly allowed him to “ overrule ” generals who opposed the escalation .
Brooks criticizes Bush as being “ secretive ” and having listened “ too much to Dick Cheney , ” but quickly adds : “ the uncomfortable fact is that Cheney played an essential role in promoting the surge .
Many of the people who are dubbed bad guys actually got this one right . ”
As this column makes clear , this entire cynical exercise in propagandizing about the success of the surge is aimed at exonerating US officials guilty of war crimes , while accustoming the American population to the prospect of an indefinite occupation of Iraq .
But what precisely is the “ success ” that they are all talking about , how was it achieved and what purpose is it to serve ?
These questions are glided over with fatuous phrases such as Friedman ’s talk about “ sowing seeds of an open society . ”
What has been sown is death and destruction on a massive scale .
In Iraq , Washington has carried out the greatest crimes against humanity of the new century .
The secret to the supposed success of the surge is plain to see .
If you kill over a million people , wound and maim perhaps three times that many , turn five million more into exiles or refugees in their own land , round up tens of thousands of the young men who have survived this slaughter and imprison them without charges in detention camps , it is possible to achieve a temporary suppression of popular resistance .
The “ personal traits ” of George W. Bush that equipped him to preside over such a venture are gross ignorance , sadism , an unflinching commitment to the interests of the financial aristocracy into which he was born , and an absolute contempt for the suffering of working people .
He is , in short , a mental cipher and a moral cripple .
No doubt from Berlin in 1939 the Nazi “ surge ” into Poland also seemed a great success , achieved by similar methods , and there were many who attributed this to the “ personal traits , ” including the stubbornness and self - confidence , of Germany ’s Führer .
For the millions upon millions of people in the US and around the world who have opposed the US intervention in Iraq from the outset , the issue was not whether mass killing and the systematic destruction of a society would “ work , ” but rather opposition to a criminal war of aggression .
That such arguments have an impact upon the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate only underscores the bipartisan political consensus in Washington over the central aim of this war : US hegemony over the Persian Gulf and control over Iraq ’s oil reserves .
Now , with the report that the Iraqi regime has signed no -bid contracts with the big oil conglomerates — the very same US and British firms kicked out of the country 36 years ago when Baghdad nationalized its oil industry — the purpose of all this killing comes clearly into focus and , along with it , the source of the official consensus that “ the surge is working . ”
This conventional wisdom is not shared , however , by the masses of people in either Iraq or the US itself .
Recent polls in Iraq show three quarters of the population wanting US troops out of their country and barely one quarter expressing the belief that they have improved security .
In the US , poll after poll has shown two thirds of the people opposing the war and supporting the withdrawal of American occupation forces .
In the end , neither the surge nor the war as a whole have laid the foundations for stability in Iraq .
The destruction of a society and the killing , maiming or violent displacement of fully a third of its population can create only continuous turmoil and ultimately a resurgence of mass resistance .
Meanwhile , in the US itself , the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on this war have contributed to the onset of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , creating the conditions for an eruption of mass social struggles .
The Dalai Lama has cancelled trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic
The Dalai Lama is suffering from exhaustion and has cancelled all his international trips , officials say .
The exiled spiritual Tibetan leader , 73 , has cancelled two forthcoming trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic , said a statement issued by his office .
The 1989 Nobel peace prize - winner had recently been experiencing " discomfort " which his doctors attributed to " exhaustion " , the statement said .
Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of stirring up unrest in Tibet .
The spiritual leader is due to travel to Mumbai ( Bombay ) for medical tests and all international engagements scheduled for the next three weeks have been cancelled , according to the statement released on his website .
The Dalai Lama , who fled to India in 1959 during an uprising against Chinese rule , has said he only wants limited autonomy for his homeland , but Beijing accuses him of wanting full independence .
He usually spends large parts of the year teaching Buddhism and promoting the Tibetan people 's cause around the world .

Small and neat , there are little fir trees dotted around the lawn , tubs of flowers on the terrace and rows of firewood stacked neatly by the fence .
Rabbit owners in Witten and Dortmund are worried about their pets
There used to be a rabbit hutch , too , at the end of the garden .
But not any more .
" One morning , when I came out to feed my rabbits , I was surprised to see that the hutch door was open , " recalls Elfriede .
" I looked inside and saw Rocco just lying there .
His head was missing .
A little later I found Felina in the bushes .
She 'd been killed , too .
I just cannot understand why . "
Rocco and Felina are among the 30 pet rabbits killed in the towns of Witten and Dortmund since last summer .
Many of the rabbits have been decapitated and the blood drained from their bodies .
Deadly discovery
It is one of the most shocking cases of animal cruelty that Germans can remember .

" This place is so quiet .
You can leave your car open and everything 's fine .
Yet there are people who murder rabbits ! "
Sabrina tells me about another incident .
She says dead rabbits were discovered in the sandpit of a local school .
" The rabbits were there without any heads and the children found them in the morning while playing in the playground .
That 's even more horrible than finding them in your own garden . "
Down at the police station , officer Volker Schuette shows me disturbing photographs of headless pet rabbits .
A gruesome pattern is emerging .
Elfriede Dumont cannot understand the motive for killing her pets " It 's always the same , " Officer Schuette explains .
" Detectives find the rabbit lying dead in a hutch .
An unknown person has cut off the head and drained off the blood in a box or a bottle .
So we find no blood and no head . "
Police fear the attacker could switch from killing rabbits to killing people .
They have set up a special task force to try to track down the killer .
Satellite spy
They are examining rabbit torsos for possible traces of DNA and they have questioned 300 people .
But police admit they still have no idea who is decapitating the rabbits and why .
It is also unclear how the killer has been locating his victims .
Most of the beheaded pets were hidden from public view , locked away in back yards or back gardens .
It has raised the possibility that the killer has been using satellite images on the internet to find houses with rabbit hutches .
Police admit they have no idea who might be carrying out the crimes
On the edge of Witten , rabbit owner Julia Perkun unlocks her new rabbit pen .
She has installed so many locks and latches , it is like a Fort Knox for rabbits .
Inside the enclosure , Julia introduces me to her 13 rabbits which are scurrying across the straw and nibbling at their vegetable breakfast .
Among them are fluffy white Reebok , and Samson , who has big brown ears right down to the ground .
Julia says she chose this remote spot in a forest to keep her rabbits , so that they would be well hidden from the rabbit killer .
She asks me not to reveal the exact location .
" This place is n't visible from the street , " says Julia , " and I try not to tell anyone where this place is .
People know that I have rabbits , but I do n't tell anyone where this place is , so I hope my rabbits are safe . "
Fear is driving German rabbit - owners to hide their pets away in the woods , like Julia , or in their garages , or in cellars .
The pet rabbits of the Ruhr Valley are being forced to go to ground , while the killer is still at large .

The XB 15 was the largest plane ever built in the United States until the Spruce Goose came along .
The heavy bomber was so massive it had passageways in the wings and bunks for the crew .
But big planes need big engines and no one made one big enough to give the XB any kind of speed for its maiden flight in 1937 .
The plane maxed out at 200 mph , and the U.S. Army Air Corps killed the project .
The only XB ever built saw duty as a cargo plane in the Caribbean during World War II .

Wolf Blitzer , in vintage buffoon mode , just asked what impact , if any , will John Edwards ’ affair will have on Barack Obama .
Huh ?
Let ’s review , Wolf :
It ’s the GOP nominee , John McCain , who has the history of having extra-marital affairs .
Remember last February , after the NY Times reported on rumors of an affair between John McCain and lobbyist , Vicki Iseman , how Cindy McCain ardently defended her husband ? :
“ More importantly , my children and I not only trust my husband , but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family , but disappoint the people of America .
He ’s a man of great character . ”
That quote just stuck in my head because it was so patently absurd .
As the Los Angeles Times reported , Cindy McCain met and began dating John McCain when he was married .
So , Cindy met John when he was cheating on his wife , but she knows he ’d never cheat on his wife .
Right .
Has anyone seen Vicki Iseman lately ?
Seriously .
UPDATE : At a town hall in Virginia today , Mike Stark asked McCain point blank if he ’s always been faithful to Cindy .
Brilliant move by Stark … but , McCain never answered the question .

The row over US inaction on carbon emissions reached new heights yesterday after the White House allowed Congress to look at last year 's government proposal to officially deem climate change a threat to public health – a plan that aides to George Bush refused to acknowledge or read .
The climate plan was finished in December by the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in response to a supreme court ruling that required the Bush administration to state whether carbon emissions should be regulated to protect public health .
The EPA concluded that regulation was needed , but whistleblowers have revealed that the White House ordered the agency to scrap its proposal .
Democratic attempts to investigate the backroom dealings were stymied until this week , when senators were finally permitted a look at the plan .
The chairman of the Senate environment committee , California Democrat Barbara Boxer , released a summary of the proposal to reporters .
Boxer was allowed to take notes on the plan but not given a copy .
" Based on the evidence before him , the [ EPA ] administrator believes it is reasonable to conclude current and future emissions of greenhouse gases will contribute to future climate change , " the proposal stated .
" The US has a long and populous coastline , " the EPA continued .
" Sea level rise will continue and exacerbate storm surge flooding and coastline erosion … in areas where heat waves already occur , they are expected to be more intense , more frequent , and longer - lasting . "
The EPA proposal also predicted that warming temperatures would lead to more wildfires in western US states and " additional strain " on already overtaxed water resources in the dry south - east and western regions .
Democrats asked the EPA administrator , Stephen Johnson , to testify next week at a hearing exploring allegations of White House obstruction on climate change .
But Johnson refused , citing executive privilege and forcing the cancellation of the hearing .
" The American people are poorly served by an administration whose head of environmental protection cannot appear before a Senate committee and honestly discuss what he did and why he did it , " senior Democrat Patrick Leahy said .
The next step may be holding Johnson in contempt of Congress , which would effectively move the dispute into the judicial system .
White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former Bush counsellor Karl Rove were found in contempt last year after refusing to cooperate with a different investigation , but their case has yet to move forward .
Boxer decried the White House 's decision not to release the full EPA proposal to the public .
" It is clear .
It is chilling .
It is detailed , " she said to colleagues yesterday .
" That information belongs to the American people and we must get it to them .
Then they will decide whether we should act to prevent this coming crisis or sit on our hands . "
The EPA attempted to downplay the controversy in a statement to the Washington Post that called the proposal " a pre-decisional draft document " and " nothing new " .
( Corrects Bullard ’s first name to James instead of Alan in second paragraph )
CHICAGO , July 3 ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve ’s use of core inflation measures is harming its credibility , the new president of the St. Louis Fed wrote in an editorial released on Thursday .
James Bullard , who took over from William Poole in April , said focusing on inflation indices that exclude food and energy work well when those prices are rising at rates similar to those of other prices , “ but that is not what is happening today .
“ It is hurting Fed credibility to say that we are trying to keep inflation low and stable , but at the same time we are not counting some of the prices that are going up at the most rapid pace , ” Bullard wrote in the bank ’s magazine , “ The Regional Economist . ”
Bullard ’s public appearances have shown a similar hawkish bias to his predecessor .
In June he said the Fed needed to start raising interest rates this year to tamp down inflation .
“ Price stability should be the number one goal of policy - makers today , ” he wrote , defining price stability as “ a small , positive rate of inflation , say 0.5 to 1.5 percent a year , depending on the price index being used . ”

No one disputes the fact that Google dominates the online video space .
The company controls an estimated 34 percent of the market , according to comScore , and its closest competitor – Fox Interactive – only has about a 6 percent share .
The lion 's share of Google 's dominance , though , comes from its YouTube acquisition .
In fact , there are millions of Americans who are n't even aware that Google has a separate branded video site .
" YouTube is the only video site that 's at the top of mind with people , " says Adam Wright , a director at market research firm Ipsos MediaCT .
" Four out of ten people think of YouTube [ for online videos ] , and from an unaided awareness perspective , Google Video does n't even show up .
Nor does MySpace , iTunes or any other site . "
Google Video may have a loyal user base but it's not unreasonable to assume that at some point the company will shutter the property and integrate it with YouTube – especially since Google seems to be looking for ways to cut costs .
Over the last six months we 've heard a stream of complaints about Google Video ; users also gripe that the company is n't adequately addressing the problems on the site , which might indicate that the service is n't a top priority .
One of the key advantages of Google Video over YouTube is the fact that filmmakers can upload longer pieces – it's not unusual , for example , to see clips that run an hour or longer on the site .
YouTube videos , by contrast , are capped at 10 minutes .
But if YouTube opens the doors to longer videos – which the site is reportedly testing out right now – Google Video 's edge could evaporate entirely .
The company , which plays everything close to the vest , tell us " not so fast . "
Google Video is still distinguished by its search engine , they say .
" The strength of Google and Google Video has always been in search and search technology , and Google Video continues to focus on technologies that make the information contained in online video more available and accessible , " said a Google spokesperson by e-mail .
But that 's been a standard line for close to two years now .
When the YouTube acquisition was first announced , Google said it was a " complementary " service and that Google Video was n't going anywhere .
" Google Video has lots of interesting partnerships , a tremendous amount of content on it and it's on a path to a very , very tight integration inside of Google , " said CEO Eric Schmidt , back in 2006 .
Of course , what Google really meant was that its – video efforts were dwarfed by YouTube and that it could never catch - up on its own .
Two years later , its prospects do n't look much more promising , as it languishes in the shadows of YouTube .
And we 're not convinced that search is enough to sustain Google Video as a stand - alone product .
Or why they can't just point their huge search and search technology guns on YouTube as well – or instead .

ORLANDO , Florida ( CNN ) --
The search teams comb through the backyards of the half - million - dollar homes with metal detectors , placing red flags on the manicured lawns every time they get a hit .
To the shock of residents , they sometimes find live bombs .
The Army Corps of Engineers digs up metal in search for live bombs in an Orlando neighborhood .
The bombs are left over from a 12,000 - acre World War II bombing range .
The area has become an Orlando neighborhood with thousands of homes .
The Army Corps of Engineers has launched a $ 10 million cleanup of what used to be the PineCastle Jeep Range , but it said bombs could remain there once they 're done .
" Chances are , it 's not a problem , " said Mike Ornella , the man leading the Army Corps cleanup .
But he conceded , " We 're never going to be 100 percent sure .
We 're never going to give a 100 percent guarantee that the properties are clear . "
The developer refused comment for this story .
Residents are enraged .
Watch the Army Corps blow up bombs »
" It 's incomprehensible , " said Frank Kruppenbacher , the general counsel of the Orange County school board .
" It starts with my wondering why the U.S. military ever allowed any of these properties [ to ] be developed without first saying you have to go through X - checklist . "
The first bomb was found last summer next to the Odyssey Middle School track .
Since that time , 126 rockets and bombs -- with high explosives -- have been found on school property , along with other military debris .
No children have been injured by the explosives .
Two adults who found munitions on school property suffered minor burns , including a worker , who while making repairs on the track , uncovered a fragment that was buried under concrete and it caught fire .
A handful of explosives have been found in the housing developments , but no residents have been hurt , officials said .
Kruppenbacher is furious .
" Before they get to walk away and claim ' we 're done , ' we 're going to have a real day of reckoning and assurances , " Kruppenbacher said .
Danette Lamb said she and her husband , Russell , raided their retirement savings to pay for their townhouse in the Vista Square subdivision .
Their son , Johnny , attends Odyssey Middle School .

" It makes you feel bad as a parent because I do n't have the funds to go and take my son and put him in private school , " she said .
She added that her property value has plummeted since the bomb discoveries .
" What am I going to do with this ?
Nobody wants to touch this neighborhood .
I 'm stuck .
So this is not my little American family dream that we had . "
Red flags mark spots in the ground where metal has been found and needs further inspection .
" For Sale " and " For Rent " signs are everywhere .
Most want to know :
How could this happen and who 's responsible ?
The Army Corps of Engineers maintains it 's not responsible .
" It was known that this was a demonstration area for war fighting , " said Ornella .
" People knew it and the information was available .
Absolutely available . "
Asked if the Army Corps raised enough concerns , Ornella said , " I believe the Army Corps followed the process we are required to follow . "
The Army Corps of Engineers did publish government reports more than a decade ago about the bombing range .
A 1994 report said the site " is a possible danger to the public , " and a 1997 report cited " strafing , practice bombing , air - to - ground rocket firing , some high explosive bombing . "
Ornella said the Army Corps was n't required to do more to inform anyone about the possible dangers , even though their records show they knew construction was coming .
" Development expected in near future , " read a July 1994 report .
The bombing site in Orlando is one of 9,000 formerly used by the Pentagon in the United States , according to the Army Corps of Engineers .
Some are being cleaned up , but they said most are not .
As in Orlando , some have been the target of lawsuits and some , including a site in Dallas , Texas , have been developed .
The Orlando site jumped to the top of the priority list last summer , when live bombs were found in the area .
Local officials say it 's disturbing that home construction was allowed anywhere near the property .
The school board , builders and engineering firms all say they did n't ask because they had no idea it was an old bombing range .
Multiple lawsuits have been filed , accusing builders of gross negligence and seeking unspecified monetary damages .
John K. Overchuck , a lawyer representing homeowners , is suing one builder , Lennar .
" They 're the ones who made the money off this property .
They 're the ones who bought this for dirt , and built these houses for up to a half a million dollars , " he says .
" They 're the ones who made the profit , they 're the ones who are responsible because they 've got these people suckered into these houses . "
Lennar would not consent to an interview to CNN , but did provide a written statement .
Lennar says it relied on studies that " made no mention of ... a military range , " and claims the military did not show up in property ownership records because , " it had leased the land . "
But at the same time , it was no secret that the military once used the property .
Nearly two decades ago , the 1989 development order , in which the county granted the permission to develop the land , shows that builders and developers knew " of the site 's history of military use . "
The order specifically says that " project construction personnel shall be notified ... of the site 's history of military use . "
It states that construction management must be notified of " suspected findings of potentially hazardous military material . "
It further states that in the event of such findings , " the developer shall immediately stop construction at the site of discovery and notify Orange County and the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation . "
Homeowner Danette Lamb wants answers .
" Somebody knew something .
A lot of somebodies turned their heads and tried to make a quick buck , " she said .
Meanwhile , the Army Corps of Engineers continues to survey the land and homeowners ' properties .
But they can only survey the common areas and grassy areas .
Sensors and examining equipment cannot see under roads , cement or the foundations of homes .
Local and federal law enforcement officials say that the issue is a civil matter and that no criminal investigations have begun .
Orlando Mayor Buddy
Dyer says homeowners deserve to be angry about the situation .
" We have to make sure that the federal government , who has the ability to right this wrong , does so , " he said .
" They [ the Army Corps ] need to restore the faith in the neighborhood , that their neighborhood is safe and making it a neighborhood that somebody would want to come buy a house in . "
But that faith may be a long way away -- if even achievable .
" You can't even give this place away right now .
I 've tried to re-finance .
... I can't do anything , " Lamb said .

As you may have noticed , Firefox 3 is released today .
Excited by this prospect , the first thing I did when I got up was to rush to my computer to download it ( yes , pathetic , I know ) .
And what do I find ?
That only Firefox 2 is on offer .
I go to the main Download Day 2008 site , and for all its flash / Flash zoomable graphics , I can't find any information about exactly when Firefox 3 will be publicly available , which seems crazy : the one thing this site should be doing is making it easy for as many people as possible to download Firefox 3 .
The danger here is that like me , others may rush expectantly to download Firefox 3 as soon as they wake up today , only to find that it is not available – and that there is no explanation as to why that is .
Is it because there 's some last - minute hitch with Firefox 3 ?
Did they get the day wrong ?
Was it all just a big con ?
In any case , the public perception of Firefox is unlike to benefit from this confusion .
Not everyone will persist , as I did , trying to find out exactly what it going on .
The answer , when I finally found it , was surprising : Firefox 3 is not actually being launched today , it is being launched at 10 am PDT today .
So what ?
You might say .
Well , just step back and think about the implications of that : 10 am PDT corresponds to 7 pm in Poland ( one of the leading countries in terms of the numbers of people who have pledged to download Firefox 3 today ) , 10.30 pm in India , 1 am on Wednesday in Beijing , and 5 am Wednesday in New Zealand .
In other words , for the vast majority of the world , Firefox 3 is being launched inconveniently late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday .
That means huge numbers of people will be kicking their heels for hours , waiting for the fateful moment when they can join in the global fun .
I suspect that quite a few will get bored or find better things to do ( like sleeping , maybe ) before the great moment arrives .
If the launch is Tuesday , 17 June , and Firefox belongs truly to the world , the logical thing would be to launch it at the one time that is independent of specific locations : the moment when midnight passes on the International Date Line – the first place it becomes Tuesday , 17 June .
That way , everyone , without favouring any geographical or national spot , could download Firefox 3 as they wake up – a suitably affimative way to begin the day .
It would also be a natural way to spread the load on the download servers across the day .
Choosing 10 am PDT suggests a blinkered viewpoint – as if anything outside Silicon Valley is of secondary importance .
That 's sad .
One of the signal achievements is that Firefox – particular through the splendid Spread Firefox site – has become a beacon of open , egalitarian participation , something shared excitedly between friends as a gift , rather than handed down from on high with august pomp and circumstance by the stern priests in the cathedral .
Releasing Firefox 3 at 10 am PDT flies in the face of all that ; it says that contributions to the open source Firefox are of course welcome from anyone , wherever they may be – but never forget where the true centre lies .
Ignoring the obvious neutral solution is insensitive to all those people living in timezones well east of California , and strikes a discordant note on what should be a day of global harmony and celebration .
Glyn Moody writes about open source at opendotdotdot .
Over at the National Review on Saturday , Kathryn Jean Lopez suggested a novel future for George W. Bush after he completes his disastrous tenure in the White House .
The most unpopular President in modern times , Lopez insists , would " make an awesome high - school government teacher . "
But leaving aside for the moment his obvious aversion to academic study and the English language ( as well as the U.S. Constitution ) , Bush has already made up his mind about his " post - service service . "
Upon leaving office , President Bush has said he plans to " replenish the ol ' coffers . "
Ignoring the inconvenient truth that many Republicans do n't want the radioactive George Bush at their own national convention in Minneapolis , the NRO 's Lopez would foist him instead on America 's school children :
" A totally crazy Saturday - morning thought : Would n't George W. Bush make an awesome high - school government teacher ?
Would n't it be something if his post - presidential life would up being that kind of post - service service ?
How 's that for a model ?
Who needs Harvard visiting chairs and high - end lectures ?
How about Crawford High ?
( Or wherever ? )
Reach out and touch the young before they are jaded , or break them of the cynicism pop culture and possibly their parents have passed down to them .
Whatever you think of President Bush , he 's a likable guy in love with his country with some history and experience to share . "
Unfortunately for Lopez , President Bush has already decided that he will cash in , and not give back , when his days in the Oval Office are done .
In a series of interviews which appeared in Robert Draper 's 2007 book Dead Certain , Bush confirmed that the banality - and venality - that defined his presidency will characterize his post - presidency as well :
First , Mr. Bush said , " I 'll give some speeches , just to replenish the ol ' coffers . "
With assets that have been estimated as high as nearly $ 21 million , Mr. Bush added , " I do n't know what my dad gets - it 's more than 50 - 75 " thousand dollars a speech , and " Clinton 's making a lot of money . "
Then he said , " We 'll have a nice place in Dallas , " where he will be running what he called " a fantastic Freedom Institute " promoting democracy around the world .
But he added , " I can just envision getting in the car , getting bored , going down to the ranch . "
Some former presidents grow in status - and the people 's esteem - only after they leave the White House .
Jimmy Carter 's failed term was redeemed in part by his charitable works and efforts for world peace .
Bill Clinton 's foundation and campaigns to battle AIDS , disease and natural disasters have made him perhaps the last globally respected American president .
Even Richard Nixon 's partial resurrection earned him elder statesman status .
But not President Bush .
Already a small man , he will only decrease in stature as leaves the stage in Washington to " replenish the ol ' coffers " and , apparently , just hang out .
As Dubya put it last year , " Sixty - two is really young and yet I 'll be through with my presidency . "
When that time comes , Kathryn Jean Lopez has concluded , George W. Bush should bring the lessons of his failed presidency to school children .
( Who knows - waterboarding kids for talking in class might even be legal in Texas . )
But assuming she 's not joking , in one sense she 's surely right about his role in educating future generations .
If nothing else , he would serve as a horrible example .
The Web site did the work of finding people for him , providing a list of likely connections by searching its own database of people who had overlapped with him at past jobs .
All Mr. Lunn had to do was review the list and select contacts he wanted to add to his network .
“ Some of them are now doing very useful jobs , ” he said .
That ’s the point .
You do n’t have to fear you ’ll be perceived as using them ; they are on the site for the same reason .
They might well intend to use you .
Even so , do n’t go crazy trying to connect with everyone you brushed past in the hallway 20 years ago , or friends of friends .
Too many people can weaken your network .
“ We try to discourage promiscuous linking , ” said Kay Luo , a spokeswoman for LinkedIn .
But do n’t be afraid to network strategically .
You want to connect to people who can get you jobs .
“ People usually invite up — people above them in hierarchy , ” said Ms. Luo .
“ When you ’re talking about a professional network , quality is so important . ”
So if the No. 1 tactic is to connect with people who are useful and successful , how do you make sure you ’re one of their worthy connections ?
There are a few helpful approaches .
Ask for recommendations .
Mr. So , who so quickly parlayed his connections into job offers , said that having updated recommendations with his résumé on Linked In was crucial to being noticed .
“ The only way to get recommendations is to go out and ask for it , ” Mr. So said .
“ It ’s kind of a weird system .
I typically go to my bosses and peers and say , ‘ Do you mind ? ’ ”
Lea said , “ It ’s disappointing , because I was under the assumption that the mask was approved for use because it was issued by the U.S.O.C . ”
Darryl Seibel , a spokesman for the U.S.O.C. , said he was not aware of any reprimand .
But he said the Olympians should feel free to wear their masks around the athletes ’ village .
Other United States teams , including the swimming squad , have been discussing when and where to use the masks .
“ We ’ve said all along that it is the athletes ’ choice whether to wear one if they feel it ’s necessary , ” Seibel said .
“ I ’m no scientific expert , but walking through an airport does n’t seem like the place where it would be necessary to wear them . ”

Earlier this year , Jacques Rogge , the president of the International Olympic Committee , said he was confident the air would be clean because Chinese officials “ are not going to let down the world . ”
Officials in Beijing , one of the world ’s most polluted cities , promised the sky would be clean for the Olympics , but as the Games have drawn closer , officials have been forced to take extraordinary measures .
Factories in the city and in the surrounding provinces were shut down or moved .
Major construction was halted .
Cars were taken off the road on alternate days .
But the sky remained thick gray this week , prompting some athletes to take precautions .
Months ago , Wilber , who did not respond to e-mail messages late Tuesday night , said he feared this would happen .
He knew that wearing the masks ran the risk of offending the host country and creating political tension .
In turn , he advocated that many teams train away from Beijing until just before their events .

A new drug list was revised by Britain 's drug experts to reveal that alcohol and tobacco put your health at greater risk than such dangerous drugs as LSD , cannabis and ecstasy .
Experts conducted a new all - compassing research with the government top advisory committee involved to make a shocking conclusion on the harm of regular tobacco and alcohol .
A modern classification of drugs does n't reflect the real situation on harmful substances .
Thus more than 20 drugs were tested on their social and individual impact and results lead to revision of ABC system .
A team of 29 psychiatrists took part in the the study to classify all drugs into nine groups that were analyzed on the physical harm , addiction and social danger .
Another group consisted of 16 experts did the research in several fields including chemistry , pharmacology , psychiatry and legal field to say a final word on drug ranking .
According to this new drug list , alcohol is named A drug .
It slightly outruns heroin and cocaine .
Tobacco was placed ninth and fell within a category B drug , after amphetamine .
Such dangerous drugs as cannabis , LSD , ecstasy were left far near the end of the drug list .
This latest study raised the question that government 's drug policy was not paying enough attention to modern state of affairs and did n't take notice of the scientific findings .
There should be no surprise that ecstasy drug was placed almost at the end of the list .
One person a day dies from acute alcohol poisoning in comparison to 10 people a year who die from ecstasy overdose .
A new classification brings to light many issues concerning drug policy with a more thoughtful approach and corresponding legal response .
Drug and alchohol abuse is more common than we think .

A drug addiction is usually a very difficult segment of one 's life , but with the proper care , it can be beat .
Spam ( and the malware it contains ) may be a tremendous concern to most IT companies , but information from a new Trend Micro survey suggests that it has become more of a managed concern , and is being superseded as a top priority threat by another issue : data leaks .
While they may or may not be intentional , data leaks have the potential to expose thousands or even millions of records to theft .
Despite growing concerns over data security , Trend Micro reports that only some 46 percent of companies even have leak prevention strategies in place .
That 's surprisingly few , given the string of high - profile data losses in the past 12 months .
Some of these incidents might seem to focus more on device loss and less on data leaks , but in many incidents , the occurrence of one automatically results in the other .
If the FBI loses 160 laptops , it has effectively leaked all of the data they collectively contain into the public domain .
Trend Micro surveyed 1,600 companies in the US , UK , Germany , and Japan and found worker attitudes and perceptions of data security vary significantly across international boundaries .
74 percent of US employees felt they could properly distinguish between confidential and nonconfidential data , while only 67 percent of UK employees , 68 percent of Germany employees , and just 40 percent of Japanese employees felt capable of doing the same .
US employees are n't just more confident ( rightly or wrongly ) that they can distinguish confidential corporate data vs. nonconfidential data ; they have also received more training on the topic .
Among companies that have data leak prevention policies in place , some 70 percent of US employees report that they have received training on how to prevent such leaks , compared to just 57 percent of UK employees .
The need for formal leak prevention policies is , perhaps , even stronger than the survey states .
One of the more interesting findings is that " U.K. and German users place less faith in the protection provided with their work PC than U.S. end users do , yet they are just as likely as U.S. end users to open suspicious emails or Web links . "
This would seem to imply that employees , even when operating in good faith , are a poor judge of what actions could or could not expose sensitive data to the outside world .
A healthy dose of paranoia can go a long way toward keeping a system malware ( and leak ) - free , but only if that paranoia results in measurably different surfing behaviors .
Those of you concerned about these issues , take heart .
Trend Micro just happens to sell a software package it believes can effectively prevent data leaks .
In fact , according to Glen Kosaka , one of Trend Micro 's marketing directors , " Trend Micro LeakProof is designed to help reduce data leaks , data threats and insider leaks by using a unique approach that combines endpoint - based enforcement with highly accurate fingerprinting and content - matching technology . "
LeakProof , folks .

The top ten things that math probability says about the real world
Talk given at Cornell University , April 14 2008 .
Like most scientists , I habitually just write slides and extemporize the actual spoken words .
For this one talk I wrote the following script , though ( being hard to break the habits of 30 years ) I did n't stick closely to the script .
Each link is one slide .
click here to read Belorussian translation .
Every academic discipline has its own peculiarities , and let me start by pointing out a peculiarity that my own topic ( math probability ) inherits from its parent mathematics .
Just about every University offers an undergraduate course in math probability , and as a student in such a course what you actually do is about 100 homework problem of this kind .
The top ones are ``just math " without any attempt at a real - world explanation , and the bottom two are weird made - up stories ( poisonous mushrooms and car mufflers ) referring to real - world items but not attempting to be empirically realistic .
If you come from say Medieval History , you might think I 've chosen some extreme example , but ( alas ! ) different textbooks differ only in the the relative proportions of these two genres .
Why is this peculiar ?
Let 's take some other discipline , say Evolutionary Biology ( which I have an amateur interest in ) .
There 's a similarity between math probability and Evolutionary Biology ; in relation to their parent disciplines , there 's a substantial body of ``popular science " literature .
On my homepage I maintain a list on non-technical books relating to probability -- 50 or so books in different categories .
One could make a similar list of popular books on Evolutionary Biology or 19 'th century American History .
For those subjects , I 'm pretty sure there 's a considerable overlap between what 's done in popular books and what 's done in an undergraduate course -- in both contexts , surely one should start by deciding what 's important and interesting , and then talk about it .
But in math probability there 's an almost complete disconnect between what we teach undergraduates and what writers of popular books think is important and interesting .
What we teach is technique -- and you learn technique in math just like you learn it in tennis or oil painting , by spending time doing it yourself .
Of course I 've nothing against learning technique , but it 's peculiar that we just teach technique .
To give an analogy , reconstructing evolutionary trees from fossils often reduces to minute study of fossil teeth and a professional paleontologist needs to learn this , but it would be odd to emphasize it in a first undergraduate course .
So here is my manifesto .
What 's interested me for a while is : in at least some undergrad math probability courses , can we try to focus less on technique and more on what theory actually says , in the sense of predictions for the real world ?
I 've tried to do this both in freshman seminar courses and in a junior - senior seminar course .
And you then realize it's hard to do -- it 's just hard to decide what 's actually important .
So I finally forced myself to compose a top 10 list -- and here it is .
At least , here are 6 of them .
These are the ones I 'm not going to talk about , except briefly now .
Opinion polls , like airplanes , actually work rather well -- they only get into the news when things go wrong .
I 'm using opinion polls as a proxy for other textbook concepts like randomized controlled experiments -- we really do know how to determine whether medical drugs work , but again the subject only gets into the news when things go wrong .
Separating skill from luck in the aggregate is one conceptual aspect of the regression effect .
The 5 baseball teams with best records in 2007 were Boston , NY Yankees , LA , Cleveland and Arizona .
Without knowing anything about baseball , one could confidently bet that at least 3 of these 5 will have worse records in 2008 than in 2007 .
As a predictable statistical effect -- part of their success was chance .
The Ludic Fallacy is a cute neologism ( by Nassim Nicholas Taleb , about whom more later ) for thinking that most real - world uncertainty is analogous to simple games of chance -- mostly it 's not .
Injecting randomness refers to game theory ; in a football game , the offense does n't want opponents to know whether they 're doing a passing or running play , so they implicitly put some randomness into the choice .
The fact that most letter strings JQTOMXDW KKYSC have no meaning is what makes most simple letter substitution ciphers easy to break .
In a hypothetical language in which every " monkeys on typewriters " string had a meaning , a letter substitution cipher would be impossible to break , because each of the 26 x 25 x 24 x .... x 2 possible decodings might be the true message .
Now if you want to transmit or store information efficiently , you want every string to be possible as a coded string of some message ( otherwise you 're wasting an opportunity ) and indeed you ideally want every string to be equally likely as the coded string of some message .
This is " coding for efficiency " , but with such an ideal public code one could just apply a private letter substitution cipher and get an unbreakable " code for secrecy " .
The final item is more frivolous .
Genetics is one of the classic application of probability but rather than attempting to say anything portentious about Evolution , here 's a down home calculation .
You have 2 parents , 4 grandparents , 8 great - grandparents , and back 10 generations you have somewhat less that 1,024 ancestors ( not all different ) .
How many have you actually inherited DNA from ?
Under a common simplified model , about 370 .
Less than half .
So even if you can prove that one of your ancestors was a relative of King George III , this does n't mean you have royal blood .
Here are the 4 topics I will talk about today .
Note that only 2 or 3 are these 10 ideas are treated in a typical undergrad course .
Let 's jump into the first topic :
Coincidences are more likely than you think .
That 's a math prediction ; and you can check how well it works with e.g. baseball teams .
I get kids to do this in a freshman seminar , but of course you could get elementary school kids to do it just as well .
Baseball team rosters are easy to find online , and happen to have players birthdays , and happen to have about 25 players on an active roster .
This is today 's Toronto Blue Jays roster , and indeed we see two players -- Jeremy Accardo at the top and Vernon Wells second from bottom -- with the same birthday , December 8th .
This is a setting where you can check that math theory works -- the prediction is that slightly more than half the baseball teams have two players with the same birthday , and every time I 've checked it , it works .
But it 's a long way away from the kind of real - life coincidences that people find striking .
As illustrated by this sign one sometimes sees on church signboards , there 's a long tradition outside mainstream science of assigning spiritual or paranormal significance to coincidences , by relating stories and implicitly or explicitly asserting that the observed coincidences are immensely too unlikely to be explicable as ``just chance " .
Rationalists dispute this , firstly by pointing out that ( as illustrated by the birthday paradox ) untrained intuition about probabilities of coincidences is unreliable , and secondly by asserting that observing events with a priori chances of one in a gazillion is not surprising because there are a gazillion possible other such events which might have occurred but did n't .
In other words , it 's not surprising when {\bf somebody} wins the lottery , because there are millions of people who did n't .
I 'm on the rationalist side , but must admit that they 've never provided actually evidence that interesting real - life coincidence occur no more often than " pure chance " predicts .
That is , rationalists are stuck in the playground " oh no they 're not " mode rather than offering empirical evidence .
Their difficulty is that the sort of things that mathematicians can make predictions for , are what I call " small universe " models ( like the birthday paradox ) where we specify in advance what coincidences might happen .
If we want to take one step toward real - life coincidences , I think we should pay attention to three features of real - life coincidences :
( i ) coincidences are judged subjectively -- different people will make different judgements ;
( ii ) if there really are gazillions of possible coincidences , then we 're not going to be able to specify them all in advance -- we just recognize them as they happen ;
( iii ) what constitutes a coincidence between two events depends very much on the concrete nature of the events .
The birthday paradox has nothing mathematically to do with birthdays -- if there were 365 equally common hair colors the answer would be the same .
Here 's my attempt to study a setting with these three features .
Alas this will mark me as a complete nerd .
Let me seek some reassurance that I 'm not the only complete nerd here , by asking for a show of hands on the following question .
Be honest now
Have you ever spent more than 2 minutes clicking on the Wikipedia " random article " link ?
Of course Wikipedia is n't exactly " real life " but it does have the 3 essential features mentioned before , and also what I 'm doing is a " repeatable experiment " -- we can actually do science here .
In particular , after seeing a specific coincidence one can go back and interrogate Wikipedia to calculate the a priori chance of seeing that coincidence in two random pages .
For instance if you click " random article " twice , the chance both pages are Hindu religious figures is about 12 in 100 million .
This data helps us focus on the ``gazillions " argument .
We do see unlikely coincidences -- figures are ``per 100 million " .
If you repeated the experiment then almost all your 28 coincidences would be different from my 28 .
On the other hand with a lot of work ( in progress with undergraduates ) one can go up from specific coincidences to ``coincidence types " -- " people with similar occupations " -- in the table we see ( aside from sports people and historical people ) country music singers , children 's lit authors , College Presidents , filmmakers .
We can learn from examples and think exhaustively of other occupations , to estimate the chances of unseen coincidences of this general type .
We hope to identify maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of " coincidence space " , and in this way check the rationalist assertion .
Of course Wikipedia is another " small universe " which wo n't impress spiritualists , but it 's a step in an interesting direction .
100 % Kelly strategy marks the boundary between aggressive and insane investing .
This thought applies to gambling ( on horse races or football games , say ) and to stock market type investments ; you do n't need a crystal ball that says what 's going to happen , you just need to know the probabilities , and indeed you do n't need to know probabilities exactly , you just need to know them better than other people .
Talking about the general topic of finance , risks , investments carefully requires some prior discussion of issues like utility functions and risk aversion .
The issue is : compare in your mind the prospects of gaining $ 250 or losing $ 250 .
If your net worth is say $ 500,000 the $ 250 is so small that you should regard these as equal and opposite .
That is , it 's irrational to be risk - averse with small amounts .
On the other hand with $ 250,000 it 's perfectly rational to be more worried about the risk of losing half your wealth .
In fact people are predictably irrational in such matters , which is a different item on our top 10 list -- for instance the majority of affluent Americans have irrationally small insurance deductibles -- they 're paying for something they do n't need -- but here I 'll stick to rationality .
I 'll talk about long - term investment -- imagine you fortunately inherit a sum of money at age 25 and you resolve to invest it and not start spending it until age 65 .
Here compounding plays a substantial role ; if you could get a fixed real interest rate of 7 % and ignore taxes , then the " rule of 70 " says you money will double in 10 years and so double 4 times -- that is grow to 16 times the original -- over a 40 year period .
What I 'll talk about -- the Kelly criterion -- envisages a particular setting .
( i) You always have a choice between a safe investment ( pays interest , no risk ) and a variety of risky investments ( suppose we know the probabilities of the outcomes of these investments ) .
( Of course in practice we do n't know probabilities , so need to use our best guess instead . )
( ii ) Fixed time period -- imagine a year , could be month or a day -- at end you take you gains / losses and start again with whatever you 've got at that time ( " rebalancing " ) .
The Kelly criterion gives you an explicit rule for how to divide your investments to maximize long - term growth rate .
We can say the formula in an undergraduate class , but the conceptual point is rarely emphasized .
To illustrate , short - term fluctuations of stock prices are " purely random " to first order , but quantitatively inclined speculators pore over data seeking non-randomness to exploit ; suppose you 've found such scheme , and we 'll invent some numbers .
Here 's the model .
Each day there 's a bet :
51 % chance to double money
49 % chance to lose all money .
Looks good -- expected gain 2 % per day -- but you do n't want to risk all your money on one day .
Instead use strategy : bet fixed proportion p of your capital each day .
Theory says : the long - term growth rate depends on p , but in an unexpected way .
Optimal strategy is to bet p = 2 % of your capital each day ; this provides growth rate 2/10,000 per day , which ( 250 trading days per year ) becomes 5 % per year .
This 5 % looks small -- you could get that in a bank -- but we 're only betting a small proportion of our money so we can keep the rest in the bank , so we 're getting " 5 % above the risk free interest rate " .
The math above depends on hypothetical assumptions -- but completely generally the Kelly criterion says how to divide your portfolio between different investments .
The numbers for growth rates that come out of the formula of course depend on the numbers you put in , but there 's one aspect which is " universal " .
In any situation where there are sensible risky investments , following the Kelly strategy means that you accept a short - term risk which is always of the same format : 50 % chance that at some time your wealth will drop to only 50 % of what it you started with .
Here the percents match up : 10 % chance that at some time your wealth will drop to only 10 % of what it you started with .
It 's OK to be uncomfortable with this level of risk and to be less aggressive -- get less long - term growth but with less short - term volatility .
This is a matter of personal taste , like $ 3 latte vs $ 1 cup of joe .
The universality above is remarkable , but there 's something more subtle here that in a sense is even more remarkable .
One can make a rather loose analogy with the light speed barrier .
Common sense says objects can be stationary or more slowly or most fast or move very fast , and that there should be no theoretical limit to speed -- but physics says in fact you can't go faster than the speed of light .
And that 's a very non-obvious fact .
Similarly , we know there are risk - free investments with low return ; by taking a little risk ( risk here equals short - term fluctuations ) we can get higher long - term reward .
Common sense says this risk - reward trade - off spectrum continues forever .
But in fact it does n't .
As a math fact , you can't get a higher long - term growth rate than you get from the " 100 % Kelly strategy " .
You 've free to take more risk if you like excitement but you do n't benefit from it .
There 's a rather nice book on this topic -- Fortune 's Formula by William Poundstone -- and this is my review on my web page .
He uses the slogan I 've borrowed -- 100 % Kelly strategy marks the boundary between aggressive and insane investing -- and it's a pretty accurate slogan .
In everyday life actions under uncertainty , people are predictably irrational .
Here 's the most famous example : decisions can be strongly affected by how information is presented .
Imagine a rare disease is breaking out in some community .
if nothing is done , 600 people will die .
There are two possible programs .
For half our subjects , describe the alternatives as
( A ) will save 200 people .
( B ) will save everyone with chance 1/3 and save no - one with chance 2/ 3
For the other half of our subjects , describe the alternatives as
( C ) 400 people will die
( D ) no -one will die with chance 1/3 ; 600 people will die with chance 2/3 .
Here 's what happens .
Given the " A or B " choice , most people choose A .
Given the " C or D " choice , most people choose D .
Of course these are logically the same : A = C and B = D but because they 're presented differently , people react differently .
If I say " your action will for sure save 200 people " , you want to do that .
If I say " 400 people will die for sure because of your action " , then you do n't want to be responsible for that .
In my undergraduate course , students do course projects , and one option is to repeat some classic experiment .
Here 's a fun example .
Subjects : college educated , non-quantitative majors .
Equipment : bingo balls ( 1 -- 75 ) and 10 Monopoly $ 500 bills .
Draw balls one at a time ; subject has to bet $ 500 on whether next ball will be higher or lower than last ball ; prompt subject to talk ( recorded ) about thought process .
Repeat for 5 bets .
Say : we 're doing this one last time ; this time you have option to bet all your money .
Prompt talk .
risk - aversion ; good or poor chances to win
feeling ( or have been ) lucky or unlucky .
My ( non-expert ) bottom line ?
We have a ``medium - scale " understanding of how people think about uncertainty -- rational or irrational -- at least in a laboratory setting .
That is , in maybe 15 settings like the two mentioned , we can abstract the structure of the situation and predict that in similar situations , people will behave in the similar rational or irrational ways .
But no consistency across all 15 settings .
For any setting when we can predict people will be irrational in one direction , there 's another setting where we can predict they 'll be irrational in the other direction .
Bottom line : humans not basically rational ; different parts of our mental structure come into play with these different settings .
In predicting the future , remember inertia , trends , statistical fluctuation , unpredictable unique events
Had Cleopatra 's nose been shorter , the face of the world would have changed .
( Pascal )
Predict the state of the world in 2033
( or : how good were 1983 predictions for 2008 ? )
Of course we do n't expect to be very accurate ........
I 'm not going to reveal any new crystal ball for making predictions , but I am going to share my intellectual tools for thinking about other people 's predictions .
My point is that people making predictions tend to focus on just some of these , according to their own mind - set .
And that 2 of these 4 tools are somewhat related to probability .
Inertia :
In much everyday life we just assume aspects of the world will be unchanged in 25 years .
Imagine a student deciding to be a doctor or a lawyer , or to learn French ; or someone building an office building or planting a tree .
In all these matters you 're assuming that in 25 years there will still be doctors and lawyers and French - speakers and that people will work in office buildings , etc .
Now I 'm not disputing these examples .
However , to relate a personal example , let me tell you the only bad advice I ever got from my father .
Son , do n't bother to learn typing , soon enough you 'll have a secretary to do that !
Point : when you think about how the future might be different , you unconsciously assume that aspects you 're not thinking about will stay the same .
Trends .
Easy to look back over 25 years and identify trends -- what trends you pick out depend on your own interests .
Moore 's law
China 's economic growth
continued slow increase in life expectancy
How good were past predictions ?
Two examples :
1982 best - seller Megatrends ( John Naisbitt ) does pretty good job
1972 " Limits to Growth " was embarassingly wrong .
It 's surprisingly hard to statistically estimate how good past predictions were , because of selection bias and survivorship bias : the predictions that are remembered or are easy to find tend to be those that were spectactularly right or wrong .
I do n't have anything to say here other than the obvious : it 's silly to ignore trends , and equally silly to blindly extrapolate trends .
Statistical fluctuations .
Imagine you wake after 25 years sleep , and decide to look at the 9,000 daily headlines you missed .
I say : about as useful as looking at results of dice throws .
Because you 'll see
earthquakes , hurricances , plane crashes
small wars
political sex scandals
partisan politics as a game
Dow drops 3 %
Impact of unique unpredictable events .
My final topic -- back to Cleopatra 's nose -- the impact of unique unpredictable events -- is prompted by the recent bestseller The Black Swan :
The impact of the highly improbable by Nassim Taleb .
He writes that a black swan is an event of
.... rarity , extreme impact , and retrospective ( though not prospective ) predictability .
A small number of Black Swans explain almost everything in our world .....
I 've spent a long time thinking of the right phrase to describe this book , and my current humorous phrase is " like the da Vinci Code as written by Humpty Dumpty "
That is , the author is widely read , has a fertile imagination and writes in a lively way , but the proposition as formulated above is rather absurd .
Like Alice 's Humpty Dumpty , the author uses words to mean whatever he wants at the moment , and like the nursery rhyme the book resembles fragments hard to assemble into a coherent whole .
In particular , there is no attempt to make a quantitative assessment of " unique events versus trends " or versus other alternatives .
But it would be interesting to do so .
Project for a young person .
Write down a long list ( 5,000 ? ) of possible " Black Swans " for the next 10 years -- events generally reckoned to have chance less than 1 % , say .
Any science ficton fan like myself can rattle off 100 without pausing for thought !
Wait 10 years .
Then see :
How many happened ?
how many others happened that you did n't think of ?
This would provide empirical evidence in place of idle speculation .
Having been critical of Mr Taleb 's book , it is only fair to give him the the last word .
I show this slide without comment , except to remark it may be the only time you ever see the words " mathematics " and " expensive suits " in such close juxtaposition .
The nova V598 Puppis , accidentally discovered in the XMM - Newton slew survey .
The X - ray contours , which indicate the position of the nova , are overlaid on image composite ( infrared , red and blue channels ) from the SuperCOSMOS Sky Surveys ( SSS ) , Royal Observatory , Edinburgh .
An orbiting X - ray observatory has discovered an exploding star in the Milky Way which somehow escaped notice by the usual crowd of star gazers .
Calculations show that the star ’s sudden brightness was clearly visible to the naked eye , but no one reported anything until the European Space Agency ’s XMM - Newton telescope spotted an unexpected burst of cosmic X - rays .
On Oct. 9 , 2007 , XMM - Newton was turning from one target to another when it passed across a bright source of X - rays that no one was expecting .
The source was not listed in any previous X - ray catalog , yet the mysterious object was lighting up XMM - Newton ’s view of the cosmos .
The XMM - Newton team looked up three possible celestial candidates as at this location , including a normally faint star known only by its catalog number USNO - A2.0 0450-03360039 .
Acting quickly , Andy Read of the University of Leicester and Richard Saxton of ESA 's European Space Astronomy Centre ( ESAC ) , Spain , e-mailed other astronomers about the newly - discovered X - ray source .
More sleuthing
Astronomers turned to the 6.5 - meter Magellan - Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile , and found that USNO - A2.0 0450 - 03360039 had become 600 times brighter than normal .
Analyzing the light from the source meant that they could classify the object as a nova .
Novae occur when a small , compact star , called a white dwarf , feeds off the gas of a nearby companion star .
Gas builds up on the white dwarf until a nuclear reaction begins releasing large quantities of
energy , causing the white dwarf to explode in brightness .
That led to a puzzle .
An explosion of this type does not immediately release X - rays , because the expanding cloud of debris created in the detonation temporarily masks them .
That meant the explosion must have taken place many days before XMM - Newton spotted the X - ray burst , although no one reported seeing it .
Amateur and professional astronomers usually find novae by regularly sweeping the night sky for stars or other objects that suddenly brighten — but humans are not alone in watching the sky .
Saxton contacted the robotic All Sky Automated Survey project and asked astronomers to check their data .
They found the nova had taken place on June 5 , 2007 , and had been clearly visible , and that it would have been bright enough to see with the unaided eye .
" Anyone who went outside that night and looked towards the constellation of Puppis would have seen it , " Saxton says .
Still tracking
The nova has now received the official name of V598 Puppis and has become one of the brightest for almost a decade , despite not getting spotted during its brilliant peak .
As news of its existence spread , the global effort to track its fading light became intense .
" Suddenly there was all this data being collected about the star , ” Read says .
“ For variable star work like this , the contribution of the amateur community can be at least as important as that from the professionals . ”
This story has a happy ending thanks to XMM - Newton , which has covered 30 percent of the sky and documented 7,700 X - ray sources .
However , the event does make astronomers wonder whether there are other discoveries going unnoticed .
Russian troops have pulled back through Abkhazia French President Nicolas Sarkozy has agreed an outline plan with Russia and Georgia to try to resolve their crisis .
A key element calls for all forces to return to the areas where they were before fighting broke out last week .
EU foreign ministers in Brussels are discussing the plan at an emergency meeting on the crisis .
Some 100,000 people are estimated to have been displaced by the conflict , which has created huge tensions in international relations .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse , in Georgia , says fighting in the South Ossetia region does now seem to have ended .
On Tuesday , Russia announced its military activity in the area was completed and witnesses saw troops pulling out .
However on Wednesday , journalists and eyewitnesses reported seeing Russian tanks patrolling the streets of Gori , the nearest major Georgian town to the South Ossetian border .
Russia has held all the cards in this conflict and looks set to end up with both a diplomatic and a military victory , says the BBC's Caroline Wyatt , in Moscow .
It has shown its power within the region and the weakness of the West , which has been unable and unwilling to come to Georgia 's aid with anything other than words of support , our correspondent adds .
Fiery rhetoric
Despite the diplomacy and apparent withdrawal , rhetoric on both sides remained fiery and analysts were predicting a long road to peace .
On Wednesday , Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili accused Russia of violating the ceasefire with troop movements around the country , while asserting that the ceasefire on the Georgian side was always in force .
FIVE - POINT PEACE PLAN
No more use of force Stop all military actions for good Free access to humanitarian aid Georgian troops return to their places of permanent deployment Russian troops return to pre-conflict positions
Peace deal all in the timing Defiant but helpless in Tbilisi Gori smoulders after fighting Falling victim to pipeline politics
Send us your comments " They went through our towns and they are rampaging and they are also shooting , " he said at a news conference in the Georgian capital , Tbilisi .
He also said he had been getting reports of large - scale violations of human rights by Russian forces : " What we are seeing is classic Balkan - type and WWII - type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns , " he said , speaking of a Russian " rampage " through Georgian - controlled villages in South Ossetia and in Abkhazia .
A BBC correspondent in Tbilisi says there have been reports of extensive looting and kidnappings by gunmen around the town of Gori .
Shortly after the Georgian president spoke , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov condemned the actions of the Georgian leadership in South Ossetia .
" Georgia - of course , not Georgia , but the Georgian leadership - gave an order which led to an act of genocide , which resulted in war crimes , ethnic cleansing .
And this , of course , cannot go unanswered . "
Russian troop reinforcements would be withdrawn from South Ossetia , depending on the extent to which Georgian troops did the same , he added .
Mr Lavrov also said that Russian peacekeepers would remain in South Ossetia .
See map of the region Aid agencies on the ground say they have not come across any evidence of human rights violations .
" It is clear that both sides are exaggerating , and that figures are inflated , " Giorgi Gogia of Human Rights Watch told the BBC News website from Tbilisi .
EU meeting France - which currently holds the EU presidency - wants Wednesday 's meeting to endorse its peace initiative before it is submitted to the UN Security Council .
The ministers are to consider sending peacekeepers to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Georgia , and protect humanitarian supplies .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband has said Russian troops in Georgia should withdraw to pre-7 August positions and criticised the country 's " 19th - Century way " of doing politics .
Mr Sarkozy , in his current role as EU president , held talks with President Medvedev in Moscow for most of Tuesday before flying to Tbilisi , where his arrival was greeted by emotional displays .

He held news conferences with both Mr Medvedev and Mr Saakashvili - with all three leaders saying they had agreed in principle to a five - point plan .
A sixth point in the plan , about holding international discussions on the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , had been deleted with the agreement of Mr Medvedev , Mr Sarkozy and Mr Saakashvili said .
" The territorial integrity and belonging of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgia can never be put under doubt , " the Georgian leader said .
On Wednesday , the Russian army said 74 of its soldiers were killed , 171 were wounded and 19 were missing , the AFP news agency reports .
In Abkhazia , Georgia said its troops had withdrawn from the only area of the breakaway province they still occupied following a Russian offensive there , the Kodori Gorge .
The self - styled president of Abkhazia said it was in control of the disputed upper reaches of the gorge and that its forces had pushed Georgian troops out of the area a day earlier .
National mourning
The US has meanwhile said it is cancelling an annual joint naval exercise with Russia , scheduled for the end of this week in the Sea of Japan .
A US official told news agencies there was no way Washington could " proceed with this joint exercise at this time " .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned that Russia was " frankly ... doing great damage " to its prospects for integrating into international organisations .
In a reference to the Soviet Union 's invasion of Czechoslovakia , she said Moscow 's behaviour belonged to " another time " .
" We are not in 1968 and the message has been very clear to Russia that it cannot operate that way , " she told the US channel ABC News .
Making Wednesday a day of national mourning in Russia , President Dmitry Medvedev accused Georgia of mounting a " genocide of the South Ossetian people " .
In his decree on national mourning , Mr Medvedev , who on Tuesday called Georgian troops " thugs " [ Russian : otmorozki ] , did not give figures for civilian casualties in South Ossetia , but said they were " numerous " .

Advertisement Russia moved in forcefully , sending troops into South Ossetia and Abkhazia , another breakaway province .
Georgian towns away from the two regions were also bombed .
Fighting flared last Thursday night when Georgia sent its army to regain control of South Ossetia - a region nominally part of Georgia , but with de facto independence and where a majority of people hold Russian passports .

What are these ?

A video has surfaced of John McCain addressing a town hall meeting in Merrimack , New Hampshire , on December 29 , 2007 .
In the video , McCain declares his hatred of the bloggers .
McCain does not explicitly state why he hates the bloggers , but that should be easy enough to figure out — the blogosphere represents one the last bastions of free speech in the country .
McCain hates that anybody but a stepfordized corporate media is allowed to make political commentary .
He hates the idea of anything but neocon unanimity .
One wonders if John McCain , if given a chance , would physically attack a blogger or two the same way he attacked a Sandinista minion back in 1987 .
“ Notably mild - mannered Republican Sen .
Thad Cochran shocked many earlier this year with comments about John McCain ’s volatile temper , ” reports the Sun Herald .
“ Cochran said he observed McCain engage in a physical confrontation with a Sandinista while participating in a diplomatic mission led by Sen.
Bob Dole and others in the fall of 1987 . ”
Ortega ’s buddy said something McCain did n’t like , so the recently elected Arizona senator reached across the table and grabbed the guy by the lapels .
“ The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine , ” said Cochran .
“ He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . ”
Imagine this guy as president .
He hates bloggers .
He is a firecracker with his fellow senators .
He hates commies so much he reaches across the table during negotiations and physically assaults one .
Imagine “ Miss Congeniality , ” as McCain admits he is not , with access to the tools Bush and the neocons left in place — the Military Commissions Act , the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , and PDD 51 .
Imagine this guy in the situation room , walking around ranting about North Korea or Iran with his hands on the nuclear football .

On to Semi-vacation
Our developer documentation already has a list of the new CSS features in Firefox 3 .
I 'd like to talk in some more detail about some of the more interesting or useful ones .
inline - block and inline - table
We now support the inline - block ( CSS 2.1 ) and inline - table ( CSS 2.0 ) values of the display property .
These values map to formatting objects that are like blocks or tables on the inside , but participate in inline layout .
Here 's a simple example ( see HTML ) that actually demonstrates both values :
This example may not look all that interesting , but I think these properties will end up proving more useful in complicated situations , where having these additional basic tools will help authors get the layout they want .
This was also a value where we'd been lagging behind other browsers and we 've now caught up , so inline - block should actually become usable to authors writing Web pages for multiple browsers in the near future .
Note that the default value of vertical - align is baseline .
Baseline - alignment for inline - blocks refers to the last line of the block , while baseline - alignment for inline - tables refers to the first row of the table .
Many uses of both may need other values for vertical - align .
font - size - adjust
font - size - adjust is a property in CSS 2.0 ( which was dropped from CSS 2.1 due to lack of implementations ) , originally proposed by Todd Fahrner .
There are a few different ways to think about what it does , but the way I like to think about it is that is a way for style sheets to pick font size by the size of the x -height rather than the size of the font .
This is useful for languages like English that have bicameral scripts ( i.e. , have both uppercase and lowercase letters ) ; it 's probably a bad idea to use it for Chinese .
Since there are existing browsers that do n't support font - size - adjust , it has to do this in a backwards - compatible way .
So the way it works is that the author specifies a number that is multiplied by the font size :
font - size : 20 px ; /* 20 px font in old browsers */ font - size - adjust : 0.6 ; /* 12 px lowercase letters in new browsers */
Having it work a multiplier is also useful because it does n't need to be respecified on a child with a smaller font size :
body { font - size : 24 px ; /* 24 px font in old browsers */ font - size - adjust : 0.5 ; /* 12 px lowercase letters in new browsers */ } p.copyright { /* the " small print " */ font - size : 75 % ; /* 18 px font in old browsers */ /* lowercase letters are now 9px new browsers , no need to respecify */ }
Note that I 'm specifying font sizes in pixels ( px ) to make the math easier .
Users who have changed the default font size in their browser preferences probably did so because they want larger or smaller text , and actually using pixel font sizes gets in the way of this .
Anyway , why would you want to use this ?
Largely because , on the Web , you do n't actually know what font is going to be used .
Different machines , especially when running different operating systems , have different fonts on them .
Even the same font might be used slightly differently on different operating systems .
The lowercase letters in different fonts take up a different proportion of the font 's size .
How big text appears and how much width it takes up is often more closely related to the size of the lowercase letters than the uppercase .
More specifically , this can be useful for things like :
specifying a font like Verdana ( which has very large lowercase letters ) as a first - choice font , and not wanting the text to be too small if Verdana is n't available
making different fonts ( for example , a proportional font and a monospace font ) appear to have the same size
I 'll give an example of the latter by looking at the Web page I mentioned at the beginning .
It wants the proportional and monospace text to be the same size .
Currently , it compensates for Firefox 's smaller monospace font size preference ( incidentally , something I 'd like to get rid of in the future using the same infrastructure we use for font - size - adjust ) by specifying :
code { font - size : 1.2em ; }
Depending on what my default monospace font is , I get different results :
The first example is probably roughly what the author intended ; in the second example the monospace text is clearly too small .
If I add font - size - adjust : 0.6 to the body and change to code { font - size : 1em ; } , I end up with the following result :
Here the fonts are consistent , but probably too large , partly since monospace fonts tend to appear bigger because many of the characters are wider .
So let 's try again , this time with code { font - size : 95 % } :
Now the results are roughly the size I think the author intended , and they 're consistent between different fonts .
Unfortunately , I 'm afraid the monospace font size preference is still interfering with things , so this may not be as useful as it could be .
rgba ( ) and hsla ( ) colors
We now support the rgba ( ) ( Red- Green - Blue - Alpha ) and hsla ( ) ( Hue - Saturation - Lightness - Alpha ) color values from css3-color .
( I 'm actually the new editor of this specification , and a new last call working draft should be out within a few weeks . )
These are in addition to the existing opacity property ( which we 've supported since Firefox 0.9 or Mozilla 1.7 ) , which can be used to make an element and all of its descendants partially transparent as a single unit .
These new color values are different because they specify alpha that is used right when the things with that color are drawn .
I 'm sure people who are better at visual design than I am have lots of pretty uses for these , but I 'll give some rather plain - looking examples , just to show the difference between compositing the entire element as a unit and doing each drawing operation separately .
For a start , let 's look at a div containing a header , with the following styles ( see HTML ) :
body { background : url( stripes - 6 ) ; } div { background : lime ; opacity : 0.5 ; } h2 { background : red ; }
In this case , where the header is on top of the div , the header 's red background completely covers the lime green background of the div , so no green shows through there .
But the whole thing ( the unit , in which the red completely covers the lime ) is drawn at 50 % opacity against the body 's blue background , so the blue shows through both .
Instead , suppose we do this : ( see HTML ) :
body { background : url( stripes - 6 ) ; } div { background : rgba( 0 , 255 , 0 , 0.5 ) ; } /* alpha component in color */ h2 { background : rgb ( 255 , 0 , 0 ) ; }
In this case , only the green is partially transparent .
The red background is fully opaque , as is the text .
Finally , let 's look at something a little more complicated ( see HTML ) :
body { background : url( stripes - 6 ) ; } div { background : rgba( 0 , 255 , 0 , 0.5 ) ; } /* alpha component in color */ h2 { background : rgba( 255 , 0 , 0 , 0.5 ) ; } /* alpha component in color */
In this case , both of the backgrounds are partly transparent .
But , unlike the first time , they 're drawn separately rather than one unit , so the green is visible behind the red , making the background of the heading look brown .
The text is still fully opaque .
New values for width , min-width , and max - width
We support four new values for the width , min-width , and max - width properties : - moz - max - content , - moz - min - content , - moz - fit - content , and - moz - available .
These values are planned to be part of the css3 - box specification .
Like the new values of display that I wrote about above , these are likely to be basic tools that authors find particularly useful in complicated situations .
But they do allow a few simple demos as well .
I 'll start with a little bit of background : pieces of content have two intrinsic widths that are used in CSS layout engines .
In a very simple example , a paragraph containing text ( and no line breaks ) , the larger of these intrinsic widths is the length of the text when laid out all on one line , and the smaller of these intrinsic widths is the width of the longest word in the text .
( For more complicated examples , the definitions of these widths are more complicated . )
The values - moz - min - content and - moz - max - content specify those two intrinsic widths .
They 're not particularly useful on the width property , but they may be more useful on the min-width and max - width properties .
The value - moz - available allows specifying the width that normal blocks ( but not floats , tables , or inline - blocks ) already have with width : auto : using the width of their container .
Again , this probably is n't all that useful for the width property , but it 's probably more useful for max - width .
The most useful of these values for the width property is - moz - fit - content , which gives the sizing algorithm used to size tables and floats .
This sizing algorithm is pretty simple , actually : it 's just the larger of ( 1 ) - moz - min - content or ( 2 ) the smaller of - moz - max - content or - moz - available .
This value actually does let authors do some things that previously were n't possible without tables , such as putting a backround on headings that does n't fill the whole width of the container unless the heading does , but is a single rectangle if the heading breaks to multiple lines ( see HTML ) :
white - space : pre-wrap
We now support the pre-wrap value of the white - space property .
( We 'd long supported the - moz - pre - wrap value , but now our implementation has been updated to the CSS 2.1 specification , which introduces pre-wrap , and the value has been renamed . )
This allows displaying preformatted text in a way that wraps when the text does n't fit in the width of its container .
This can be useful for things like source code samples and mailing list archives .
For example , if you look at this historic message in the W3C mailing list archive , it looks like this :
But if you make the window much narrower , the text still does n't require horizontal scrolling :
Many people contributed to the work involved in adding these new features and the many other new CSS features in Firefox 3 .
The work in rewriting our graphics architecture was particularly important , and led to a number of these new features ( and should lead to more new features in the near future ) .
These contributions include a lot more than just writing code .
I 'd like to thank everybody who filed bug reports , analyzed bugs and wrote testcases , fixed them , and documented the new features for their contributions to the features that I described above and the architecture work that they depend on , and to getting all of that work into a state that we can be proud of shipping as Firefox 3 .
I 'd particularly like to thank Uri Bernstein , John Daggett , Daniel Holbert , Bernd Mielke , Simon Montagu , Masayuki Nakano , Robert O'Callahan , Mats Palmgren , Stuart Parmenter , Jesse Ruderman , Eric Shepherd , Karl Tomlinson , Ryan VanderMeulen , Vladimir Vukićević , Martijn Wargers , Boris Zbarsky , and the cairo team .
I 'd also note that we 're already working on new features for the next release , and there are lots of ways to help out , from trying them out and filing useful bug reports , to helping with writing regression tests for new features , to even writing the code to implement them .

The criticism is sometimes leveled against rationalists : " The Inquisition thought they had the truth !
Clearly this ' truth ' business is dangerous . "
There are many obvious responses , such as " If you think that possessing the truth would license you to torture and kill , you 're making a mistake that has nothing to do with epistemology . "
Or , " So that historical statement you just made about the Inquisition — is it true ? "
Reversed stupidity is not intelligence : " If your current computer stops working , you can't conclude that everything about the current system is wrong and that you need a new system without an AMD processor , an ATI video card ... even though your current system has all these things and it does n't work .
Maybe you just need a new power cord . "
To arrive at a poor conclusion requires only one wrong step , not every step wrong .
The Inquisitors believed that 2 + 2 = 4 , but that was n't the source of their madness .
Maybe epistemological realism was n't the problem either ?
It does seem plausible that if the Inquisition had been made up of relativists , professing that nothing was true and nothing mattered , they would have mustered less enthusiasm for their torture .
They would also have had been less enthusiastic if lobotomized .
I think that 's a fair analogy .
And yet ...
I think the Inquisition 's attitude toward truth played a role .
The Inquisition believed that there was such a thing as truth , and that it was important ; well , likewise Richard Feynman .
But the Inquisitors were not Truth - Seekers .
They were Truth - Guardians .
I once read an argument ( can't find source ) that a key component of a zeitgeist is whether it locates its ideals in its future or its past .
Nearly all cultures before the Enlightenment believed in a Fall from Grace — that things had once been perfect in the distant past , but then catastrophe had struck , and everything had slowly run downhill since then :
" In the age when life on Earth was full ...
They loved each other and did not know that this was ' love of neighbor ' .
They deceived no one yet they did not know that they were ' men to be trusted ' .
They were reliable and did not know that this was ' good faith ' .
They lived freely together giving and taking , and did not know that they were generous .
For this reason their deeds have not been narrated .
They made no history . "
— The Way of Chuang Tzu , trans .
Thomas Merton
The perfect age of the past , according to our best anthropological evidence , never existed .
But a culture that sees life running inexorably downward is very different from a culture in which you can reach unprecedented heights .
( I say " culture " , and not " society " , because you can have more than one subculture in a society . )
You could say that the difference between e.g.
Richard Feynman and the Inquisition was that the Inquisition believed they had truth , while Richard Feynman sought truth .
This is n't quite defensible , though , because there were undoubtedly some truths that Richard Feynman thought he had as well .
" The sky is blue , " for example , or " 2 + 2 = 4 " .
Yes , there are effectively certain truths of science .
General Relativity may be overturned by some future physics — albeit not in any way that predicts the Sun will orbit Jupiter ; the new theory must steal the successful predictions of the old theory , not contradict them .
But evolutionary theory takes place on a higher level of organization than atoms , and nothing we discover about quarks is going to throw out Darwinism , or the cell theory of biology , or the atomic theory of chemistry , or a hundred other brilliant innovations whose truth is now established beyond reasonable doubt .
Are these " absolute truths " ?
Not in the sense of possessing a probability of literally 1.0 .
But they are cases where science basically thinks it 's got the truth .
And yet scientists do n't torture people who question the atomic theory of chemistry .
Why not ?
Because they do n't believe that certainty licenses torture ?
Well , yes , that 's the surface difference ; but why do n't scientists believe this ?
Because chemistry asserts no supernatural penalty of eternal torture for disbelieving in the atomic theory of chemistry ?
But again we recurse and ask the question , " Why ? "
Why do n't chemists believe that you go to hell if you disbelieve in the atomic theory ?
Because journals wo n't publish your paper until you get a solid experimental observation of Hell ?
But all too many scientists can suppress their skeptical reflex at will .
Why do n't chemists have a private cult which argues that nonchemists go to hell , given that many are Christians anyway ?
Questions like that do n't have neat single - factor answers .
But I would argue that one of the factors has to do with assuming a defensive posture toward the truth , versus a productive posture toward the truth .
When you are the Guardian of the Truth , you 've got nothing useful to contribute to the Truth but your guardianship of it .
When you 're trying to win the Nobel Prize in chemistry by discovering the next benzene or buckyball , someone who challenges the atomic theory is n't so much a threat to your worldview as a waste of your time .
When you are a Guardian of the Truth , all you can do is try to stave off the inevitable slide into entropy by zapping anything that departs from the Truth .
If there 's some way to pump against entropy , generate new true beliefs along with a little waste heat , that same pump can keep the truth alive without secret police .
In chemistry you can replicate experiments and see for yourself — and that keeps the precious truth alive without need of violence .
And it 's not such a terrible threat if we make one mistake somewhere — end up believing a little untruth for a little while — because tomorrow we can recover the lost ground .
But this whole trick only works because the experimental method is a " criterion of goodness " which is not a mere " criterion of comparison " .
Because experiments can recover the truth without need of authority , they can also override authority and create new true beliefs where none existed before .
Where there are criteria of goodness that are not criteria of comparison , there can exist changes which are improvements , rather than threats .
Where there are only criteria of comparison , where there 's no way to move past authority , there 's also no way to resolve a disagreement between authorities .
Except extermination .
The bigger guns win .
I do n't mean to provide a grand overarching single - factor view of history .
I do mean to point out a deep psychological difference between seeing your grand cause in life as protecting , guarding , preserving , versus discovering , creating , improving .
Does the " up " direction of time point to the past or the future ?
It 's a distinction that shades everything , casts tendrils everywhere .
This is why I 've always insisted , for example , that if you 're going to start talking about " AI ethics " , you had better be talking about how you are going to improve on the current situation using AI , rather than just keeping various things from going wrong .
Once you adopt criteria of mere comparison , you start losing track of your ideals — lose sight of wrong and right , and start seeing simply " different " and " same " .
I would also argue that this basic psychological difference is one of the reasons why an academic field that stops making active progress tends to turn mean .
( At least by the refined standards of science .
Reputational assassination is tame by historical standards ; most defensive - posture belief systems went for the real thing . )
If major shakeups do n't arrive often enough to regularly promote young scientists based on merit rather than conformity , the field stops resisting the standard degeneration into authority .
When there 's not many discoveries being made , there 's nothing left to do all day but witch - hunt the heretics .
To get the best mental health benefits of the discover / create / improve posture , you 've got to actually be making progress , not just hoping for it .
Nigel Hamilton opens his new primer How to Do Biography ( Harvard ) with the bold boast that we are living in " a golden age " of life writing .
Really , he should know better .
To anyone who reads , reviews or writes on the subject , such confidence is baffling .
( Hamilton , a Briton , lives mainly in the States , which may account for his rosy myopia . )
Seen close up , and with an eye to proper detail , biography appears in rather a bad way .
" Crisis " would probably be putting it too strongly , not least because it suggests a certain convulsive energy .
" Sclerosis " might be nearer .
Sales , it 's true , are still good , though showing signs of softening .
According to Nielsen BookScan , literary biography reached an all - time high in 2005 , but has since started to fall .
General arts biographies are also down .
However , to give an idea of how the non-fiction market as a whole has recently been bent out of shape , it 's worth noting the exponential leap in celebrity memoir .
Thus Katie Price has managed to shift 335,649 hardback copies of her life story Being Jordan , despite her jaunty admission that someone else wrote it .
Meanwhile , Hilary Spurling 's Costa - winning Matisse the Master , surely one of the best biographies of the decade , has lifetime hardback sales of just 12,451 .
However , it is when you look at the quality of work produced rather than the number of books sold that you start to fear for the health of a genre that not only predates the novel by centuries ( think of Plutarch 's Lives ) , but holds peculiarly British credentials .
Since becoming a biographer 15 years ago - most recently of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot - I have read widely within the genre and with professional attention .
I also teach on the MA in life writing at UEA , which aims to give would - be biographers a solid grounding in their chosen art .
And I get hundreds of titles sent to me every year for review .
I have to say I am struck by their recent falling - off .
Of course there are always stand - outs , even in a thin year such as 2007 ( Hermione Lee 's Edith Wharton and Rosemary Hill 's Pugin ) , and 2008 is shaping up to be better , with new work from Richard Holmes and Michael Holroyd in the autumn .
But the general standard , the mean , the middling , seems to have sunk to a listless low .
Let me give you a taste of what I am sent each week .
There are endless lives of saucy 18th - century society ladies , even though it is a full 10 years since the surprise hit Georgiana by Amanda Foreman opened up that particular realm .
( The worst moment was receiving a biography of Georgiana 's sister , Harriet . )
There are plenty of royal mistresses , to the extent that one wonders if there is a boudoir somewhere where they sit all day doing their hair , waiting to be called forward for active biographical duty .
Lives on the edge of empire are popular too , probably in response to the academy 's continuing interest in all things postcolonial .
So each week you can be guaranteed stories about people who ran little kingdoms in clammy parts of the globe and / or were worshipped as gods by confused locals .
While there is a respectable rationale for doing these minor lives , grounded in the argument that hidden or forgotten subjects deserve their restorative moment in the sun , the real reason is more pragmatic .
The fact is that anyone really important has already been done , probably several times .
The 19th and 20th centuries have long been harvested for any royal , writer , actor , painter or soldier whose life and work could conceivably yield 350 pages of serviceable prose .
( That 's another problem : the misguided belief that writing a biography requires nothing more than journeyman skill when it comes to putting one word in front of another . )
For a while , the 18th century appeared fertile , with its combination of ebullient consumerism and unbuttoned sexuality seeming to offer an easy parallel to our own .
Now , though , it is all fished out .
Go back any further than 1700 and you run into the problem not just of finding the sources , but of making sense of them .
People in the early modern period had such different ideas about what it meant to be a self , especially in relation to others , that trying to corral them into the kind of unfolding psychodrama expected by the modern biography reader becomes tricky , unless you 're prepared to gloss like crazy .
The least imaginative response to this lack of good new subjects is simply to go back to the big lives and do them over - and over - again .
You can justify this by an appeal to the idea that each decade ( actually , every four years might be nearer ) needs its own Dickens or Eleanor of Aquitaine .
According to this convenient way of thinking , dressing up old subjects in new clothes becomes playful and postmodern , rather than just desperate .
Yet Jerry Brotton of Queen Mary , London University , whose The Sale of the Late King 's Goods : Charles I and His Art Collection reached the Samuel Johnson shortlist two years ago , warns against being taken in by this sleight of hand .
" What often happens is that a perfectly solid biography from 1978 gets rewritten with an eye to the intellectual moment , without the addition of a single bit of new information . "
The result : a George Eliot for the New Labour age ( I plead guilty ) , or a queer Queen Victoria for the noughties , or the six wives of Henry VIII refashioned as the post - feminist heroines from Sex and the City .
Why does n't anyone say or do something about these acts of biographical cannibalism ?
According to literary agent Andrew Lownie , who runs the Biographers ' Club ( a networking organisation for practitioners ) , it 's because the power in publishing companies has decisively passed from the commissioning editors to the sales people .
" Their thinking is , if something was once a hit , then let 's try it again , even though clearly there 's a law of diminishing returns .
Anything new or different is looked on with suspicion . "
Lownie 's theory is confirmed by the recent experience of one writer I spoke to .
Having produced a first biography that punched well above its weight , he has been looking forward to writing his second , this time on a playwright whose work he knows well .
His publishers , though , are having none of it and have suggested instead that he try a life of ... Graham Greene .
That Norman Sherry 's authorised multi-decker Life has sucked every last shred of marrow from Greene 's tired old bones seems scarcely to matter .
What makes it doubly strange is that biography as a genre has a tradition of lively experimentation .
Consider John Aubrey 's Brief Lives , written in the lee of the civil war .
If published today , its zany mix of biography and autobiography , gossip and scholarship would be hailed as wonderfully postmodern .
Lytton Strachey 's Eminent Victorians of 1918 is a fine example of the short , pithy group biographies that are making something of a comeback .
These are the fresh , wayward models that I ask my students to consider when they begin their own biographical projects .
( Anyone who suggests embarking on a cradle - to - grave narrative of a royal mistress goes to the back of the class . )
In the interests of balance , I should report that it is not only Hamilton who remains bullish about the state of biography .
When I asked Claire Tomalin , the biographer of Austen , Pepys and Hardy among others , she could see no reason to worry .
Michael Holroyd agrees that " something has definitely changed " , though stops short of calling it a crisis .
His reading is that popular history and misery memoirs have temporarily knocked biography off its top spot in the non-fiction hierarchy , and that it 's probably a question of waiting out the cycle .
Michael Prodger , literary editor of the Sunday Telegraph , agrees that the golden age of biography , in which the publication of fat lives of important people by leading writers were automatically given the hushed attention due to a major minor cultural event , has probably passed .
But he warns against uncritical nostalgia : " The fact is that there has always been a second division of biography , good enough without being distinguished .
These nearly - books are always with us . "
The responses of publishers were more upbeat .
This could be because they are obliged to sound perky in public , or it may be that being on the receiving end of hundreds of proposals every year gives them a helpfully elevated view .
Thus Jenny Uglow , editorial director of Chatto & Windus , herself a distinguished biographer , reports that " interesting ideas are still coming in , although perhaps we 're having to look harder for them than we used to " .
Arabella Pike , meanwhile , who heads up a distinguished biography list at HarperPress , is justly proud of Linda Colley 's Elizabeth Marsh : A Woman in World History , which came out last year .
An intellectually bold book , Elizabeth Marsh sets itself the task of plotting " the world in the life " of a humble British woman in the 18th century whose own history happened to collide with that of Britain 's emerging empire .
It is a fascinating book , which speaks straight to the current preoccupation with globalisation , written by one of our leading academic historians .
It has not , however , so far made it on to any of the shortlists for the major literary prizes .
The reluctance of prize juries to get to grips with books that do not yield up their charms as easily as a royal mistress in an over - scented boudoir is not something that surprises Holroyd , who believes that scholarly and innovative biographies are increasingly overlooked in favour of texts that , although fluent and timely , are closer to journalism .
" One used to award literary prizes to the ' tortoise ' book , the one that had taken years of archive work but was never going to be a popular hit , " he recalls .
These days , by contrast , juries seem keener to make sure that a crowd - pleasing title wins on their watch .
Stories slipping out from judging rooms over the past couple of years suggest a growing wariness of books that appear too long , complex , or perhaps simply good - mannered to beg for easy love .
Whenever two or three biographers are gathered together , it is n't long before the names " Amanda Foreman " and " Georgiana " come up .
The fact is that much of the devaluing of the biographer 's skill can be dated to 10 years ago when Foreman 's first book , a biography of the 18th - century Duchess of Devonshire , became a publishing phenomenon .
By choosing to be photographed nude behind a pile of books , and by allowing her own life story ( starry father , tricky adolescence ) to become as important as the person she was writing about , Foreman did an accidental disservice to biography in general , and to young women biographers in particular .
Her success with a book written while still in her 20s created unrealistic expectations about the quality of work that young historians are regularly able to produce .
Thirty years ago , no one would seriously think that many writers under 30 , with or without a PhD , could publish books that would do anything other than slip shyly on to the market , acting as calling cards for the better work that was surely still to come .
But since Foreman 's unprecedented hit , photogenic young women are routinely commissioned to produce biographies of equally camera - ready subjects , regardless of whether they are equipped to do so .
The results are often intellectually slight and stylistically poor .
( Although this is n't always so - in which case , some rather good young women biographers are probably missing out on the critical attention they deserve . )
The press releases accompanying these books are always the same , breathlessly referencing what are seen to be the author 's key qualifications for the job : she went to Oxford , has done some part - time modelling and has a hobby such as grape - treading or motor - car racing .
Whether she knows anything at all about her subject ( and , let 's be clear , a PhD is not the same as a decade of immersion in the relevant archives ) is neither here nor there .
If this seems a peculiar way for publishers to pick their authors , not to mention their subjects , then Lownie can explain .
" If a writer is untried , then they are , paradoxically , more attractive than one who already has form .
The moment you publish your first book , you leave a paper trail .
People can look up your sales figures and make a judgment about whether you are worth giving another chance .
A new author , by contrast , is an unknown quantity . "
Even older and not especially winsome biographers routinely feel the effect of this " anyone can do anything " culture .
I have lost count of the number of times a publishing professional has suggested that I might like to try my hand at a subject from the Tudor or Stuart period ( on the unspoken assumption , presumably , that my usual patch , the Victorians , is all used up ) .
If I reply that , while it sounds fascinating , I have absolutely no expertise in the politics or economics ( let alone the handwriting , and theology ) of the 16th and 17th centuries , I am regarded as a spoilsport and , quite possibly , missing the point .
Still , better to seem like a dreary pedant than a rank amateur .
That 's what happened six weeks ago to Veronica Buckley when it emerged that , during her writing of a biography about Mme de Maintenon ( yet another royal mistress ) , she had mistaken a fictional diary of Louis XIV for the real thing .
For Brotton , Buckley 's mistake is the predictable outcome of a systematic deskilling over the past 30 years .
" Today 's biographers simply are n't immersing themselves in the manuscript sources , but are working instead with more accessible printed versions .
As a result , they fail to develop the deep familiarity with their material which would prevent such basic errors . "
This reluctance to consult the primary sources is not because biographers have suddenly become lazy or stupid - in general , they are a hunched and harried crew who have to be prized away from their desks - but because they are increasingly given unrealistic deadlines to complete work .
It is not uncommon these days for a publisher to allow two years for the writing of a major life .
In which case , there is really no time to do anything other than get the relevant books out of the London Library , skim read , and embark on a hectic round of cut and paste ( see Raj Persaud , the time - pressed media - friendly psychiatrist who was last week suspended for three months as a result of his over - enthusiastic adoption of this method of " research " ) .
The kind of professional start that Holroyd enjoyed as a young writer in the early 1960s , working for years on the Strachey archive before publishing his first major biography , would be unthinkable now .
Chances are that his publishers would lose patience , cancel the contract , and find someone else who could promise to deliver in 18 months .
Yet , despite this gloomy picture of careless publishers lashing on inexperienced writers , there are signs that something important is about to happen in biography .
Jonathan Bate of Warwick University , who wrote a prizewinning life of John Clare , declares that " we are on the edge of a paradigm shift " .
In fact , he believes that he has already seen the future , in the shape of books such as Charles Nicholl 's The Lodger : Shakespeare on Silver Street and Frances Wilson 's The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth , which come at familiar subjects from odd angles .
" Instead of old - style literary biography , which tells the story from cradle to grave , these books focus in on just one episode in a life and , in the process , unfold a far richer story . "
Bate is also justly excited about Holroyd 's upcoming A Strange Eventful History , which , rather than concentrating on a single subject , braids together the lives of Ellen Terry , Henry Irving and their families in order to tell a broader story about theatre culture on the eve of the modern age .
Pike is also enthusiastic about the mutation of biography into new , hybrid forms .
She points to the work of Robert Macfarlane , who recently blended ecological reportage with auto / biography so memorably in Mountains of the Mind and The Wild Places .
She also admires Kate Summerscale 's The Suspicions of Mr Whicher , published this year , which cleverly melds family history and crime writing with social and literary history .
To this list I would add , from two years ago , Alexander Masters 's Stuart : A Life Backwards - winner of the Guardian first book award - which , like work by Macfarlane and Summerscale , managed to become both a critical and a popular success .
The book is about Stuart Shorter , an alcoholic , homeless man whose life story seemed to demand that it be written backwards in order to catch a proper sense of chaos .
Masters , a young first - timer now working on his second book , happily admits to being turned off by the idea of writing what most people understand as biography : " It would never cross my mind to do the life of someone dead or great - it would be completely beyond me . "
( If that sounds admirably modest , Masters also added , " Anyway , who on earth needs another biography of George Eliot - it 's so boring ! " )
Instead , he urges biographers to " get out and write about the people under their noses - the people whose stories may seem mundane , but whose daily existences are actually filled with Homeric struggles " .
I 'm guessing that Stuart was written with a small advance .
In order for biographers to make these kinds of breakthroughs in form , it may mean taking less money than they might like .
Certainly Uglow urges writers to stick up for the projects they want to pursue , even if they do n't initially seem like money - spinners .
Her own recent book , Nature 's Engraver : A Life of Thomas Bewick , is a masterclass in how these risks can pay off .
A biographer with a firmer eye on the market might have passed up the opportunity to write about the artist whose visual renderings of country life went so far towards defining the way the early 19th century saw the natural world .
Nonetheless , Bewick ended up as one of the big successes of 2006 , mentioned in " book of the year " slots more than any other title .
None of these aforementioned books on its own represents Bate 's " paradigm shift " , but taken together they do suggest that something significant is astir .
Nor should we be complacent that , when the biographical future does arrive , we will necessarily like or even recognise it .
The first time I heard about Stuart from Masters 's publicist , I thought it sounded glum and dull - a view shared by Masters 's then agent , who refused even to take the manuscript out of the Jiffy bag ( he was soon replaced ) .
All one can hope , really , is that a small but growing band of writers are financially and intellectually brave enough to strip biography back to its first principle - the recording of lived experience - and consider that brief in the widest possible terms .
And even if we do n't at first enjoy their efforts , perhaps finding them tricky or strange , at least it means that we will be spared too many more visits from those royal mistresses with their come - hither smiles .
There ’s something sickeningly fun about flying off the handle .
But the raised blood pressure and wake of problems that can result are clearly not doing you – or anyone around you – any good .
Chronic anger is like psychic pollution .
It ruins everybody ’s mood .
Here ’s how to clean up your act .
When anger strikes , move a mountain .
Run up a hill , swim laps , find a punching bag , do anything physically exerting to help get that tension out of your body .
If you ca n’t escape , breathe .
That ’s it , just breathe .
Now take another breath .
Ok , another one .
Breathe in slowly through your nose , noticing the breath moving into your body , and slowly and fully breathe out .
Feel better ?
( Another trick to quickly relieve tension : when you ’re sitting at your desk , reach your hands up to the ceiling and gently weave back and forth to loosen your spine . )
Attempting to control anger is futile if you are n’t addressing the root problem .
We get feelings for a reason – they need to come out !
If you ’ve been repressing anger , make a private space and then let yourself feel it .
Relive the situation and feel the rage .
Scream , cry , punch your pillow ( but not the wall ! ) and do whatever you need to safely release the emotion so you can then constructively analyze the situation .
It ’s fine to “ save up ” your anger for a time when you can healthily expel it ; you do n’t want to rage in the moment , when you might say or do something you ’ll later regret .
But do n’t squash your anger .
That ’s a recipe for depression .
Be empowered .
Once you ’ve calmed down ( this may take hours , even days ! ) and can express yourself rationally , talk to the person who ticked you off .
You might not get the response you were hoping for ; what ’s important is that you did your part .
Even if you are nervous or doubting yourself , say what you need to say as best you can .
This will also help you learn when to walk away before getting angry again .
If you ’re angry about something in the world or your lifestyle ( like being stuck in traffic for 2 hours a day ) , use your anger as an impetus to change .
This powerful energy can fuel the fire of positive action .
I actually believe anger is healthy , if used appropriately .
When we feel anger it ’s a powerful signal to change something that feels wrong .
Whether the “ wrong ” is the situation or some inaccurate script you ’ve trained your ego to believe and live by , anger means it ’s time to reconsider .
Acknowledge that sometimes you feed yourself with your anger .
Bringing up that old grudge gives you a certain “ I ’m right , you ’re wrong ” ego satisfaction .
But look a little closer : does holding that grudge really make you happy ?
This can actually become a toxic habit where you ’re always looking for the next thing to fume about .
It ’s like a dog licking a wound and making it worse .
You ’re better served by focusing on positive change than listening to runaway mind chatter .
If you feel “ stuck ” on the anger cycle , you may need to consider if low self - esteem is the real problem .
Find positive ways to improve your feelings of worth so that you are less inclined to feel the need to feed your ego with angry thoughts .
Forgive , without necessarily forgetting .
You do n’t have to condone someone ’s actions , but when you forgive them ( acknowledging that we ’re all human beings who have faults and make mistakes ) , you release something inside yourself too .
Holding a grudge takes up your precious energy , while forgiving opens you up to experience bigger and better things .
Often we do n’t like to forgive because it feels like we ’re letting the person get away with what they did wrong .
But holding on to the memory emotionally means you ’re constantly reliving the nonexistent past in your very real present – and if that is n’t letting the offending person win , I do n’t know what is .
Still steamed ?

On Wednesday August 27th , at 9 p.m. ET / PT , Mythbusters will take on one of the biggest myths ever , that the Apollo Moon landings were faked .
Adam and Jamie will tackle the photos and the claim that they were shot in a studio as well as look at claims that the video footage of the astronauts ‘ hopping ’ around the moon were created by simply slowing down footage shot on Earth .
Grant , Tori , and
Kari will take on how the footprint could be so defined and how the flag could flutter in a such dry , vacuum world .
Finally Adam and Jamie will travel to New Mexico to see if they can see catch a reflection off one of the three laser reflectors left on the moon at the Apollo landing sites by the astronauts .
Since 2001 , when FOX aired a television show called , " Conspiracy Theory : Did We Land on the Moon ? " the myth that the Apollo Moon landings were faked has become part of the cultural fabric .
As an indicator of the sagging level of scientific literacy in the United States , it is akin to the efforts to teach creationism alongside evolution .
BadAstronomy.com has a point - by - point rebuttal of the arguments from the Fox program , but since most of the 300 million Americans do n’t read Phil Plait ’s blog , the Mythbusters ’ program is a welcome champion of scientific inquiry .
Many people want to understand the science behind the rebuttals because the hoax believers appeal to people ’s intuition and they know there must be a simple answer .
The good news is there is .
Stars do n’t appear in pictures because the lunar surface is too bright , just like a baseball stadium at a night game .
The flag is waving because the astronaut is moving shaking the pole as he is assembling the apparatus .
The top bar did not extend all the way out on the flag , creating a wrinkle that makes it look like it ’s waving .
The cross hairs " disappear " because a bright white object drowns out the black crosshair on the film .
Etc. etc .
Still , Adam and Jamie have that certain way of coming to an answer that makes science fun .
The team traveled to a few NASA centers to use vacuum chambers and other facilities for the filming of this very special episode .
After waiting for a over a year to see it , we now have just T - minus one week to wait .

But Mr. Rey said that to not deal with prairie dogs could hurt the program .
“ Prairie dogs are spreading off federal land to private land , ” he said .
“ And our goal is to keep the black - footed ferret program with broad public support , and one way to do that is to make sure prairie dogs do n’t spread onto private land . ”
Black - tailed prairie dogs , food for numerous prairie predators , may be threatened themselves .
A few years ago the Fish and Wildlife Service , in response to a petition , decided they were warranted for listing as a protected species , but precluded because of higher priorities .
That designation was later changed and is now being reconsidered .
For now , though , efforts are focused on stopping the disease .
Losing this population to the plague would be a blow for the entire ferret recovery program and personally heartbreaking , said Mr. Livieri , who has worked for 13 years to restore this population south of Badlands National Park .
He started with the National Park Service , then worked for the Forest Service and now cobbles together financing for his own nonprofit organization , Prairie Wildlife Research .
Until now this was the most robust population of ferrets , so healthy it provided wild kits for other recovery efforts in Colorado , Montana , Utah , Mexico and elsewhere .
“ Last year 52 ferrets came out of here to supplement or start new populations , ” Mr. Livieri said .
Most of those populations have struggled with plague and other problems .
One population , near Shirley Basin , Wyo .
 where the 18 surviving ferrets were found  has struggled with plague but now may have close to the number of ferrets here .
There are thought to be about 1,300 ferrets extant , 1,000 or so in the wild and 300 in captivity .
Plague thrives in wet years , and this has been one of the wettest in the region in years .
A combination of insecticide and vaccines can be very effective , said Dr. Dean Biggins , a research biologist with the United States Geological Survey , who has studied plague and ferrets .
He said he had seen a plague outbreak hit a line of dusted burrows and stop cold .
“ There ’s no question they can be protected , ” he said .
“ It ’s not whether we can do it , but are we willing because of cost and labor ?
It might have to be done every year or two . ”
For now , the race is on to protect the heart of the ferret population .
Mr. Livieri , often working by himself , drives from his home in Wellington , Colo. , six hours away , and spends a week or two at a time scouring the prairie all night in hopes of injecting all of the ferrets .

Well , the nice thing about gay marriage is you have TWO people excited about the wedding .
In straight marriages , only one person is excited .
Gay marriage , both persons are excited .
Jay Leno can't stop sticking his foot in it .
In what should have been a nothing - but - positive interview about his admirable pro-same sex marriage position ( even if it 's less about equality than inevitability ; at least it 's public support ) , he 's asked about the " gayest look " controversy and undermines his apology yet again by saying the reaction to his asking Ryan Phillippe to pretend the camera was his gay lover and give it his gayest look was " a little over the top " and helpfully explaining to those of us who complained that " there are bigger issues than that .
That 's a classic case where you 're not talking about morality or lifestyle , you 're just talking about silly stuff . "
He might as well just come right out and say , " My apology was just to shut up the hysterics .
" Meanwhile , never one to pass up a chance to make fun of women , Leno also noted , while ostensibly praising same - sex marriage : A " women want to get married ; men do n't " joke ?
How big a hack is this guy ?
Hey , Jay :
Take my wife … please !
And I know how Mr. Leno hates humorless bitchez deconstructing his awesome humor and all , since it 's just " silly stuff " and shit , but when you make a sexist joke about straight marriage in contradistinction to same sex marriage , it has the inevitable consequence of reinforcing the idea that gay men and women are n't " real " mean and women , that their sexuality stands them outside any common experience of man / womanhood .
If Leno 's generalization about straight men and women did n't do precisely that , his point would n't be that both people in a gay marriage are excited , but that all lesbians want to get married and all gay men do n't .
Instead , he effectively others gays by implying that they 're different , or suggests that gay men are practically women .
Either way , it 's a nasty joke — smearing gays even as he purports to support their equality .
And let 's not forget that was buckshot from the blast he aimed at women .
If he had n't just had to get in that dig at women , he would n't have othered gays .
But he did .

Update July 1 2008 : 23 days in custody without charge for Greenpeace Japan activists
Greenpeace supporters gathered outside the Japanese Embassy in London this lunchtime .
They held a peaceful protest to express solidarity with the two anti-whaling campaigners currently being held without trial in Japan for their role in exposing a large scale embezzlement scandal within the Japanese government - sponsored Southern Ocean whaling program .
Among the ranks was Greenpeace UK Director John Sauven , who handed in a letter to Ambassador Shin Ebihara asking him to make urgent representation to Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda for their immediate release , and to order a further investigation into the scandal exposed by Greenpeace .
Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were arrested ten days ago , after Greenpeace Japan exposed an illicit trade in whale meat from the ' scientific ' whaling programme in the Southern Ocean .
An intercepted package taken by a crew member of the whaling factory ship the Nisshin Maru contained 23kg of choice cuts of whale meat .
The disproportionate response of the Japanese government to the scandal appears to indicate how worried they are by it , and is genuinely surprising given that they and their allies were supposed to be preparing for more constructive engagement on the issue at last week 's International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting in Chile .
Today 's London embassy visit was just one of many that have taken place around the world over the past few days , an indication of how high feelings are running at the outrageous way Juni and Toru are being treated .
From as far a field as Brazil , Indonesia , Sweden and Australia , defenders of whales and democracy around the world have n't been slow to express their outrage at the behaviour of the Japanese government on this issue .
In addition to demonstrations in approximately 30 countries since the duo were arrested last week , nearly 180,000 letters of protest have been emailed to the Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign minister demanding their immediate release ( thanks once again to everyone from the UK who has taken part ) .
What you can do
Please , if you have n't done so already , take a couple of minutes to add your voice to the protest against Juno and Toru 's unjust incarceration .

Hook a rubber band over the trigger arm ( see picture ) .
Let the other end dangle out of the bottom of the gun for now .
Cram the headset into the gun where the magazine used to be .
notice how the microphone portion points down ( so you can talk into the handle ) and it's pressed against the upper portion of the headset .
The headset fits perfectly so you do n't need to secure it , just stuff it in there .
Make sure the rubber band stays on the trigger arm side of the gun .
The pin coming off the trigger arm should be just off the call start / end button so that when you pull the trigger it operates the button .

Gary McKinnon , a computer expert who hacked into dozens of US military computers , lost his appeal to the European court of human rights today and faces extradition to the US in the next fortnight , his solicitor said .
McKinnon has fought a long battle with authorities over his extradition to the US , which has dubbed him the " the world 's most dangerous hacker " .
McKinnon broke into the Pentagon 's system from his north London flat and left a message saying " your security is crap " .
Last month , he lost his battle against extradition in a House of Lords ruling .
McKinnon turned to the European court of human rights , complaining about the conditions he would face if convicted in the US and was granted a temporary delay .
The court did not give reasons for refusing McKinnon 's request today .
Karen Todner , from Kaim Todner solicitors , said her client was " distraught " about the decision .
She appealed to the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , to intervene .
" Mr McKinnon has recently been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger 's syndrome .
As a result , we will be writing to the home secretary again inviting a prosecution in this country , " she said .
" Our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot .
" Our client 's case highlights a worrying trend where UK citizens are at the mercy of the ever - increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country . "
Using the codename Solo , the 42 - year - old hacked into 53 US army computers and 26 US navy computers , including those at the US naval weapons station Earle in New Jersey , which is responsible for replenishing munitions and supplies for the Atlantic fleet .
The US military said he left 300 computers unusable at a US navy weapons station immediately after 9/11 .
He was caught in 2002 as he tried to download a grainy black - and - white photograph he believed was an alien spacecraft from a Nasa computer at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston , Texas .
He was easily traced by the authorities because he used his own email address .
Mark Summers , an official representing the US government , said McKinnon 's hacking was " intentional and calculated to influence and affect the US government by intimidation and coercion " .
American officials claim he caused $ 700,000 ( £ 354,000 ) damage and threatened national security .
If extradited , McKinnon faces up to 70 years in prison and his lawyers have argued he could even be given " enemy combatant " status , the same category applied to terrorist suspects interned at Guantánamo Bay .
McKinnon , an unemployed IT worker from north London , has consistently argued that he was merely a " bumbling computer nerd " who caused no damage but was merely searching for evidence of extraterrestrial life .
" It got a bit silly , " he told the Guardian in 2005 .
" I suppose it means I 'm not a secretive , sophisticated , checking - myself - every - step - of - the - way type of hacker . "
Between 2001 and 2002 he scanned thousands of US government computers from his bedroom , looking for loopholes which would help him get inside their networks in order to prove his contention that the existence of aliens had been covered up by the CIA .
After last month 's House of Lords decision , McKinnon said the case had proved devastating in the six years since he was arrested .
With his bail conditions barring him from using the internet , a return to his previous work in IT had been nearly impossible and potential employers were scared off .
" I 've lost two jobs because of this ; my bosses just did n't want to be associated with the publicity , " he said .
Todner denied McKinnon was a terrorist or a terrorist sympathiser and said his case could have been dealt with by our prosecuting authorities in Britain where the hacking raids were conducted .
" American officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry .
The consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the European court to prevent his removal . "
McKinnon would face a much shorter sentence under Britain 's computer crime laws .
The defence has argued he is being unfairly targeted because his work embarrassed the US security services , and that an attempt by US prosecutors to make a deal with McKinnon - in which he would be offered a six - month sentence for his cooperation - constituted an unfair derailment of British legal procedures .
That contention was rejected by the law lords , who said granting the appeal would " imperil the integrity of the extradition process " .
Lord Brown of Eaton - under - Heywood said in the written judgment : " The difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellant 's argument suggests . "
Computer security experts said it was unlikely US prosecutors would give up their pursuit .
" The US is making a clear stand that anyone making any attempts to compromise its computers and data will face the consequences , " said Graham Cluley of the IT security company Sophos .
McKinnon 's extradition was brought under the controversial Extradition Act 2003 , which was designed to deal with terrorist suspects but has been applied in cases where terrorism has not been the primary concern .
Under the act , America authorities are able to demand a Briton 's extradition without having to provide evidence .
However , Britain has to prove its case in a US court to extradite US citizens to the UK .
The so - called Natwest
Three were extradited under the same legislation in 2006 and this year sentenced to 37 months ' imprisonment .
Among the act 's critics is the former Tory MP Boris Johnson , now the London mayor , who in 2005 called for extradition of British citizens to the US to be suspended .
Bush 's Iraq War Harms US Security Editor ’s Note : Amazingly , just weeks ago , major outlets of the U.S. news media – including the op - ed pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times – were running neoconservative screeds about the glorious success of George W. Bush ’s Iraq War “ surge ” and baiting war opponents for lacking “ realism . ”
Now , with U.S. casualties again spiking and American troops bogged down in Iraq indefinitely , there have been virtually no prominent articles taking the neocons to task for their lack of realism in failing to see the security risk their policies have created , a fact that the Independent Institute ’s Charles V. Peña notes in this guest essay :
More than five years after the decision to invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein and impose democracy , nearly 160,000 U.S. soldiers remain there .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Despite the war ’s growing unpopularity with Americans , President Bush is adamant about not setting an “ artificial deadline ” for withdrawing troops .
Last month ’s anniversary of the fall of Saigon , April 30 , 1975 , and the final U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam , ending the longest war of the last century , prompts some historical reflection — for example , the poignant photograph of people being plucked off that famous Saigon rooftop in April 1975 , juxtaposed against the completion in Baghdad of the largest U.S. embassy ever .
In January 1973 , the Paris agreement on Vietnam was concluded , providing for the withdrawal of American troops , and soon a cease - fire agreement was signed .
Although the war ’s end was imminent — this is not clear today with Iraq — the CIA ’s Air America operation continued , and actually had its greatest losses in the two years following the decision to terminate the company .
So , just how long will the U.S. remain in Iraq ?
The answer appears to be “ indefinitely . ”
The declaration of principles signed by Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki in November commits the U.S. to a “ long - term relationship ” with Iraq , including “ security assurances and commitments . ”
Iraqi officials foresee a continued presence of 50,000 U.S. troops as a security guarantee .
Before the invasion , the president had declared , “ We will remain in Iraq as long as necessary , and not a day more . ”
He also asserted that “ the United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq ’s new government . ”
But the declaration of principles means there is no end in sight on how long the U.S. will stay in Iraq .
Moreover , a primary reason for having U.S. troops in Iraq is essentially to determine its precise form of government , i.e. , supporting the Republic of Iraq in defending its democratic system against internal and external threats .
Given Iraq ’s security forces ’ current capabilities , of course their government would want the U.S. to provide for Iraqi security .
But stability and security in Iraq are not — and never were — prerequisites for U.S. security .
An insecure Iraq may be unpleasant , but is not a threat per se .
Even an unfriendly Iraqi government would not represent a direct military threat ( just as Saddam Hussein never did ) .
While Islamic extremist terrorists might remain in Iraq ( a presence that did not exist under Saddam and was enabled by the U.S. invasion ) , they would be a threat to the Iraqi government , but not to America .
Iraqis — including Sunnis — have no great love for Osama bin Laden or al - Qaida , so Iraq would n’t likely become a sanctuary for al - Qaida as Afghanistan was under the Taliban .
Perhaps more important , U.S. military presence in Iraq actually compromises U.S. security .
We know that 5,000 U.S. troops ’ presence in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War fomented bin Laden ’s hatred of the U.S. , and was a stated reason for attacking America on 9/11 .
Even former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ( considered the architect of the Bush administration ’s Iraq policy ) admitted that U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia were “ a huge recruiting device for al - Qaida . ”
So is keeping 10 times that many U.S. troops in Iraq — a country of great cultural importance to the Arab world .
Indeed , an April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate concluded that “ the war in Iraq has become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent Islamic extremists , motivating a new generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may be increasing faster than the United States and its allies can reduce the threat , ” and that “ the Iraq conflict has become the ‘ cause célèbre ’ for jihadists , breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement . ”
Ultimately , an endless occupation of Iraq will do more to embolden the enemy who did us harm on 9/11 and increase the risk of terrorism on U.S. soil by giving Muslims worldwide more reasons to hate America .
U.S. security demands we do the opposite of staying .
Paradoxically , leaving Iraq is actually a prerequisite , if not to victory , at least to avoiding defeat .

Buying a PC can come along with some unwanted preinstalls .
And now with Microsoft mandating that third party hardware manufacturers bundle Vista ( not XP ) , that unwanted preinstall can include an entire OS .

Malek , Amine and Lamine are all trying to avoid ending up like a vast majority of their friends  selling on the street .
Lamine and Malek try to study .
But they say that is only because if they fail the exams , they can not get into the military  and if they cannot get into the military , they will have no status in Algeria .
They have focused on the science curriculum .
But their hearts do not seem to be in it .
“ They do n’t let you like education here , ” Lamine said .
Malek met Amine when Amine ’s family moved into the walled and guarded compound for military families where Malek already lived .
It is beside the Casbah , the old Arab quarter , where streets wind up and down hills that fall from the mountains to the sea .
That was four years ago , and the young men became friends , going together to the mosque where they practiced the traditional way of reciting the Koran aloud .
But as Amine grew more religious , Malek began to drift away from him , in part out of concern for his father .
“ The military and a beard do n’t go together , ” he said .
Malek shaved his beard and started to spend all his free time with Lamine , a very quiet young man with a shaved head .
One of their favorite spots to relax is the monument to those killed in the war against the French .
The concrete monument soars more than 300 feet into the sky , with three ramps sweeping up to an apex .
The sky was blue , the wind heavy and the clouds white on a May day when Malek dropped to the pavement and began to break dance , his feet in the air , his shoulders pressed to the ground .
Suddenly Algerian rap played from Lamine ’s cellphone as they danced and laughed  until they stopped .
Amine wrapped his arm around Malek ’s shoulder and they recited the Koran , their voices carrying through the wind .
Lamine stood by , silently .
“ I only have 25 days until the test ; I have to go home , ” Amine said .
“ My mother will be mad at me if I do n’t study . ”
After he left , Lamine was asked how he felt about Amine .
He has frequently teased him , suggesting that they go together to the bar for a beer .
Lamine does not go with Malek to pray , talks often about drinking alcohol and said that two years ago he was arrested trying to sneak onto a ship to get to France .
“ He ’s O.K. , ” Lamine said .
“ I ’d like to be like him .
I ’d like to be religious someday , too . ”
Go outside on a dark , moonless night .
Look up .
Is it December or January ?
Check out Betelgeuse , glowing dully red at Orion 's shoulder , and Rigel , a laser blue at his knee .
A month later , yellow Capella rides high in Auriga .
Is it July ?
Find Vega , a sapphire in Lyra , or Antares , the orange - red heart of Scorpius .
There are no green stars !
In fact , any time of the year you can find colors in the sky .
Most stars look white , but the brightest ones show color .
Red , orange , yellow , blue ... almost all the colors of the rainbow .
But hey , wait a sec .
Where are the green stars ?
Should n't we see them ?
Nope .
It 's a very common question , but in fact we do n't see any green stars at all .
Here 's why .
Take a blowtorch ( figuratively ! ) and heat up an iron bar .
After a moment it will glow red , then orange , then bluish - white .
Then it 'll melt .
Better use a pot holder .
Why does it glow ?
Any matter above the temperature of absolute zero ( about - 273 Celsius ) will emit light .
The amount of light it gives off , and more importantly the wavelength of that light , depends on the temperature .
The warmer the object , the shorter the wavelength .
Cold objects emit radio waves .
Extremely hot objects emit ultraviolet light , or X - rays .
At a very narrow of temperatures , hot objects will emit visible light ( wavelengths from roughly 300 nanometers to about 700 nm ) .
Mind you -- and this is critical in a minute -- the objects do n't emit a single wavelength of light .
Instead , they emit photons in a range of wavelengths .
If you were to use some sort of detector that is sensitive to the wavelengths of light emitted by an object , and then plotted the number of them versus wavelength , you get a lopsided plot called a blackbody curve ( the reason behind that name is n't important here , but you can look it up if you care -- just set your SafeSearch Filtering to " on " .
Trust me here ) .
It 's a bit like a bell curve , but it cuts off sharply at shorter wavelengths , and tails off at longer ones .
Here 's an example of several curves , corresponding to various temperatures of objects ( taken from online lecture notes at UW :
Blackbody curves
The x-axis is wavelength ( color , if you like ) color , and the spectrum of visible colors is superposed for reference .
You can see the characteristic shape of the blackbody curve .
As the object gets hotter , the peak shifts to the left , to shorter wavelengths .
An object that is at 4500 Kelvins ( about 4200 Celsius or 7600 F ) peaks in the orange part of the spectrum .
Warm it up to 6000 Kelvin ( about the temperature of the Sun , 5700 C or 10,000 F ) and it peaks in the blue - green .
Heat it up more , and the peaks moves into the blue , or even toward shorter wavelengths .
In fact , the hottest stars put out most of their light in the ultraviolet , at shorter wavelengths than we can see with our eyes .
Now wait a sec ( again ) ... if the Sun peaks in the blue - green , why does n't it look blue - green ?
Ah , this is the key question !
It 's because it might peak in the blue - green , but it still emits light at other colors .
Look at the graph for an object as hot as the Sun .
That curve peaks at blue - green , so it emits most of its photons there .
But it still emits some that are bluer , and some that are redder .
When we look at the Sun , we see all these colors blended together .
Our eyes mix them up to produce one color : white .
Yes , white .
Some people say the Sun is yellow , but if it were really yellow to our eyes , then clouds would look yellow , and snow would too ( all of it , not just some of it in your back yard where your dog hangs out ) .
OK , so the Sun does n't look green .
But can we fiddle with the temperature to get a green star ?
Maybe one that 's slightly warmer or cooler than the Sun ?
It turns out that no , you can't .
A warmer star will put out more blue , and a cooler one more red , but no matter what , our eyes just wo n't see that as green .
The fault lies not in the stars ( well , not entirely ) , but within ourselves .
Our eyes have light - sensitive cells in them called rods and cones .
Rods are basically the brightness detectors , and are blind to color .
Cones see color , and there are three kinds : ones sensitive to red , others to blue , and the third to green .
When light hits them , each gets triggered by a different amount ; red light ( say , from a strawberry ) really gets the red cones juiced , but the blue and green cones are rather blasé about it .
Most objects do n't emit ( or reflect ) one color , so the cones are triggered by varying amounts .
An orange , for example , gets the red cones going about twice as much as the green ones , but leaves the blue ones alone .
When the brain receives the signal from the three cones , it says " This must be an object that is orange . "
If the green cones are seeing just as much light as the red , with the blue ones not seeing anything , we interpret that as yellow .
And so on .
So the only way to see a star as being green is for it to be only emitting green light .
But as you can see from the graph above , that 's pretty much impossible .
Any star emitting mostly green will be putting out lots of red and blue as well , making the star look white .
Changing the star 's temperature will make it look orange , or yellow , or red , or blue , but you just can't get green .
Our eyes simply wo n't see it that way .
That 's why there are no green stars .
The colors emitted by stars together with how our eyes see those colors pretty much guarantees it .
But that does n't bug me .
If you 've ever put your eye to a telescope and seen gleaming Vega or ruddy Antares or the deeply orange Arcturus , you wo n't mind much either .
Stars do n't come in all colors , but they come in enough colors , and they 're fantastically beautiful because of it .
Note : this is not the end of the story .
There are green objects in space , and some stars do appear green ... but that 's for another post , coming soon .
Promise .
Of course the CBI and the Institute of Directors warn us that a " windfall tax " , levied on the leading energy companies , would prejudice the prospects of new investment in the industry .
These are the people who , 10 years ago , prophesied that a statutory minimum wage would result in massive unemployment among the lowest paid .
Indeed , their lineal predecessors predicted that Lloyd George 's Insurance
Act would put every domestic servant on the dole and that Lord Shaftesbury 's proposed prohibition of child labour was a prescription for economic ruin .
The apologists for the excesses of capitalism have always possessed a talent for representing their greed as essential to the national interest .
The government ought to examine the facts of energy pricing with an objectivity of which the providers ' apologists are incapable .
Two facts should dominate ministers ' consideration .
The first is the size of energy company profits .
For Shell , they amounted to £ 13.9bn in 2007 - 08 and £ 4bn in the second quarter of this year , a 4.6 % improvement on 2007 .
Even the less profitable companies have reported the sort of results that make share - holders rub their hands with glee .
Centrica , the owner of British Gas , is expected to make a record profit of £ 1.9 bn this year - a 50 % year - on - year improvement , a month after raising average prices by 15 % .
These results are not the product of either improved efficiency or greater investment , but are largely the results of the idiosyncratic way in which energy tariffs are calculated .
That is why they are legitimately described , by both advocates and opponents , as a " windfall " .
The second fact is that the government needs to face up to what was revealed by the consumer group , Energywatch .
About 4.5 million families already live in fuel poverty , and that figure will increase as a result of this year 's hike in energy prices .
In the present economic climate , only a windfall tax can raise enough revenue to protect those families from a cold winter .
The business secretary , John Hutton , wants energy companies ' accounts to be made more transparent , so that consumers can decide where they get the best bargain .
That idea is attractive to theoretical economists who believe that competition solves all problems .
But it will not keep low - income families warm in winter .
Nor will a revision of the carbon emission targets , which ministers are said to be considering as an alternative to a windfall tax .
It would be foolish to claim that a one - off levy - hypothecated for reducing fuel prices at the bottom of the income scale - had no disadvantages .
But they are nothing like as great as the vested interests claim .
It is absurd to suggest that the result would be an investment famine .
There is money to be made in the British energy market - even if , for one year , profits are reduced - and the energy oligopolies will go on making it .
More important , opponents of the tax need to describe their alternative .
Up to now , the best the energy companies have come up with is a £ 150 m handout available by 2011 - a fraction of their profit in three years ' time .
Let us be clear .
As well as the social argument for an energy windfall tax , there is a political reason why it is essential .
Not party political .
I would be in favour if Labour were 20 % ahead in the opinion polls .
The political argument concerns the equity that ought to be a feature of tax policy .
In hard economic times , it is intolerable for directors of energy companies to draw huge bonuses while their customers go cold because they cannot afford to pay the bills .
It is also inimical to the spirit that sees a nation through its difficulties .
That is a patriotic argument for an energy windfall tax .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Bush administration is proposing to let federal agencies decide for themselves whether highways , dams , mines and other construction projects might harm endangered animals and plants , according to a draft of planned rule changes obtained by The Associated Press .
The proposed regulations , which do not require the approval of Congress , would reduce the mandatory , independent reviews that government scientists have been performing for 35 years .
Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said late Monday that the changes were needed to ensure that the Endangered Species
Act not be used as a “ back door ” to regulate the heat - trapping gases linked to global warming .
The draft rules would bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats .
AMD 's going through some rough times , no doubt about it , but for fanboys of the CPU maker ( wait , do CPU fanboys still exist ? ) here 's your feel - good story of the year .
The always - thorough Tom's Hardware has pit Intel 's 1.6GHz Atom 230 processor against AMD 's Athlon 64 2000 + , and the results just might surprise you .
The 1GHz Athlon ( with a core voltage of 0.90 volts and a power draw of just 8 watts ) managed to best the aforementioned Atom in both energy consumption and processing power tests .
The gurus at Tom 's credited the more modern 790G platform and the highly efficient K8 architecture as big players in the Athlon 's strong showing , finally deeming said chip " more economical , faster and quieter " than the Atom .
We know you 're in disbelief -- good thing there are 14 pages of proof waiting in the read link .

There has been a lot of talk about the decline of Apache ’s dominance as a web server , with competition from IIS and other alternatives like Lighttpd , but Apache is still king of the hill when you look at the top 100 websites in the US .
We here at Pingdom have noted a very wide range of web server software for the websites that we monitor uptime for .
So , out of curiosity ( once again ) we decided to see what kind of web server software is in use by the most popular websites in the US .
We collected this information by looking at the HTTP response headers for the top 100 websites ( according to Alexa.com ) .
The HTTP response header will usually reveal what web server software the website is running on .
Web server software by numbers
Though Apache and IIS dominate ( together they have at least 69 % of the top 100 websites ) , Lighttpd and some of the other smaller web servers have started to carve themselves a niche .
It ’s also interesting to note that only one out of the top 100 websites is running the much - touted IIS 7 , and that is Microsoft.com .
Here is a detailed breakdown of the numbers we collected .
Web server software for the top 100 websites ( USA ) Server Total Apache ( unknown version ) 31 Apache 1.3. * 8 Apache 2.0 . * 5 Apache Coyote 1.1 5 Microsoft IIS 5.0 3 Microsoft IIS 6.0 16 Microsoft IIS 7.0 1 Lighttpd 4 LiteSpeed 2 nginx 2 Sun ONE Web Server 2 Other 10 Unknown 11
Any web server software with less than two websites was placed in the “ other ” category .
Some HTTP response headers did n’t contain any information about the web server software and ended up in “ unknown ” ( 11 out of 100 ) .
A couple of bonus factoids
The HTTP headers often contain a lot of interesting information .
Here are some additional things we found out from the header information .
66 out of the 100 websites reported support for gzip content encoding .
WordPress.com has this line in its response header : “ X - hacker :
If you ’re reading this , you should visit automattic.com / jobs and apply to join the fun , mention this header . ”
Small disclaimer :
It is possible for websites to report incorrect information about the web server software in the header .
This can sometimes be done for security reasons .

In some cases , the U.S. military has been denying wounded soldiers the full amount of their enlistment bonuses , under the rationale that the soldiers are unable to fulfill the full term of their service contract .
The policy came to light after Jordan Fox , who was injured by a roadside bomb in Iraq and sent home three months early , received a letter asking him to repay $ 2,800 of his signing bonus .
Fox had been hospitalized for several months , and still has an injured back and a blind right eye .
" I was just completely shocked , " Fox said .
" I could n't believe I 'd gotten a bill in the mail from the Army .
" Upon signing up for military service , troops may receive up to $ 30,000 in signing bonuses .
These bonuses are contingent upon fulfilling a specified term of service .
But according to CBS affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh , the military has asked " thousands " of injured troops to return part of their bonuses .
In response to the KDKA report , a military spokesperson replied that the bill sent to Fox was a mistake .
"
If you are ill or were injured while on duty , the Army will not ask you to repay any portion of your recruitment bonus , " said Brig .
Gen. Mike Tucker .
But the military has refused to comment on charges that thousands of soldiers have received letters similar to Fox's .
In addition , the military has only specified that wounded soldiers will not be asked to repay any of their bonuses -- it has not promised to pay full bonuses to injured soldiers in cases where the bonus was not paid up front .
" I am disappointed that the policy does not go further by stating that wounded soldiers will also receive the remaining balance of future bonus payments , " said Rep. Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania .
" It is preposterous for our government to have a policy that says that a soldier who has sustained serious injuries in the field of battle has not fulfilled his or her service obligation . "

The militia is weakened after many battles with US and Iraqi forces Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr has announced the creation of a cultural wing of his organisation , known for its Mehdi Army militia .
In a statement read at Friday prayers , he said only a " resistance " group was to remain armed , AP reported .
A spokesman told Western media Mr Sadr 's militias would disarm if the US set and followed a timetable for withdrawing its troops from Iraq .
The US and Iraq are negotiating the terms of a future US troop presence .
Local ceasefires Mr Sadr 's spokesman , Salah al - Obeidi , told Reuters news agency the decision " should not be considered an end to the Mehdi army " but was " a halfway step to dissolving the Mehdi Army " .
The announcement follows comments to the same effect earlier this week .
It comes as Iraq and the US are discussing a status of forces agreement that will govern the US troop presence in the country when a United Nations mandate expires at the end of the year .
" We want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious .
We will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of US forces , " Mr Obeidi told French news agency AFP .
" If so , we will complete the reorganisation of the Mehdi Army which aims to transform it into a social organisation , " he said .
The BBC's Crispin Thorold in Baghdad says the Mehdi Army was once arguably the most powerful Shia military and political movement in Iraq , but it has been seriously weakened after military operations against it .
Local ceasefires were declared in Basra and Baghdad earlier this year after intense fighting , but the militia retained its weapons .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- John McCain 's call for a big push into nuclear power can certainly be met - if the country is willing to pay more for power and tolerate the safety risks .
Earlier this week McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee for president , said he wants to build 45 more nuclear power plants to make the country more energy independent .
That would add significantly to the nation 's current fleet of 104 active plants , which produce about 20 % of the nation 's power .
The advantages to nuclear power are primarily two - fold :
It does n't emit greenhouse gases , and it is a reliable form of electricity produced from uranium - a fairly abundant domestic resource .
McCain and others have been touting nuclear energy as a possible replacement for foreign oil , if and when the country shifted to electric cars .
The utility industry is behind the construction of more nuclear plants .
" We have been saying for years that we have to not only preserve our current fleet [ of nuclear plants ] , but enlarge it significantly , " said Jim Owen , a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute .
Obstacles to nuclear power
But the utility industry has not brought a new nuclear plant online since 1984 .
Regulatory hurdles and public opposition to nuclear plants following the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 are often cited for the freeze in new plants .
Yet what almost everyone cites as the main obstacle now is cost : Nuclear power is just plain expensive .
It costs between $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion to build a new nuclear reactor , according to Steve Kerekes , a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute .
That 's about four times the cost of building a new similar - sized coal plant .
If McCain wants 45 new plants , he 'll have to provide the utility industry with some incentives to take on this huge up front expense .
These could come in the form of low - interest loans , laws restricting greenhouse gases ( which would make coal more expensive ) or the construction of a long - promised facility to handle the waste .
" The cost of building them is immense , " said Peter Tertzakian , chief energy economist at ARC Financial , a Calgary - based private equity firm .
" The commitment has got to be long term . "
While the costs to build a nuclear plant are high , fueling it with uranium is relatively cheap .
Over the long term , nuclear power is thought to be competitive with other forms of power generation .
The total costs to produce nuclear and wind power are expected to run about 7 cents per kilowatt hour in 2015 , according to projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Coal and natural gas are thought to cost just a penny less , mostly due to the rising price of fossil fuels .
And , as the Edison Institute 's Owen points out , in a world facing greenhouse gas restrictions and using ever more power , " the cost of whatever we are going to do is going to be big . "
The safety controversy
If the cost issue is overcome , there is still the safety issue .
" Nuclear is [ not ] all that clean , " the environmental group Greenpeace writes on its Web site .
" You still have to mine the uranium used in the reactors - and mining is a dirty , polluting process .
And you have to store the nuclear waste somewhere - waste that can be around for centuries , sitting in a storage facility somewhere , susceptible to leaks . "
The government has long planned to build a long - term waste storage facility at Nevada 's Yucca Mountain .
But people that live nearby are unsurprisingly opposed to the idea , and construction has been held up for years .
In the meantime , radioactive waste is stored on - site at nuclear plants .
The Nuclear Energy Institute 's Kerekes says the total amount is small - all the waste produced from decades of nuclear power would fill up a football field to the depth of 20 feet .
And Kerekes said the licensing process at Yucca Mountain - which by congressional decree could n't handle much more than the current waste but , Kerekes said , could be expanded to take several times that amount - will take about four years to complete .
He was n't sure if that would lead to construction , but with Nevada Democrat Harry Reid currently running the show in the Senate , chances of that happening do n't look good .
" The proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump is never going to open , " said Reid in a statement on his Web site .
" I have successfully fought against the proposal to store nuclear waste in Nevada for over two decades because it threatened the health and safety of Nevadans and people across our nation . "
Some also question nuclear plants ' vulnerability , especially in an age fraught with terrorist concerns .
To illustrate this point , the Web site of environmental group Greenpeace begins its discussion on nuclear power with a photo of two reactors painted with a red bull 's - eye .
The industry says that nuclear technology has gotten much safer since the days of Three Mile Island and the Chernobyl disaster , and the government says security has greatly improved since Sept. 11 .
Statistics from security tests done in the 1990s were not reassuring .
Of the 81 security tests done between 1991 and August 2001 , nearly half turned up lapses that could lead to core damage and probable radioactive release , according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
Kerekes said those tests were designed to turn up failures , and they are now corrected .
Backing that contention , the Nuclear Regulatory Commmission said security tests done in 2007 showed a much safer system .
While over half of the 199 tests showed some sort of minor problem , only five turned up what the agency called issues of " low to moderate security significance . "
Many people say other countries have run safe nuclear programs for decades .
McCain is also confident nuclear plants pose little danger , telling the New York Times recently they are " safe , efficient , inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil . "
Still , that may not be reassuring to communities where these plants get built .
" Everyone 's OK with it , until they find out one 's going in their backyard , " said Tertzakian .

Check out these tips and a post - mortem of where your computers go to die .
Recently , the world computer population surpassed 1 billion .
It ’s a legion of artificial intelligence that will never die , at least not while humans are around to see it .
The computer species appears to have a high mortality rate ( whether due to the rapid progress of technology or an industry conspiracy to ensure that products must be replaced regularly ) .
They “ crash ” and “ die ” in droves , their human counterparts literally kicking them to the curb .
But there is no heaven , no place in the clouds , for the cold , hard shell once warmed by electrical currents .
Once it has left your desk , your computer does n’t disappear .
In a sense , it lives on .
Each year , ten million computers land in the toxic graves that are landfills .
Nestled among other CPUs and laptops and monitors , their lifeblood oozes out , leaking hazardous materials such as lead into our earth and water sources .
Like many products we discard , defunct computers are dead to us but remain a force with which the earth must reckon .
Despite the eco-warning , we ’re not trying to take away anyone ’s computer .
To paraphrase a line that recently amused us in the 1946 film noir gem The Postman Always Rings Twice , “ Stealing a man ’s wife , that ’s nothing .

Internet Explorer 8 is set to be Microsoft 's most standards compliant browser ever .
After originally stating that IE8 would default to the same noncompliant behavior exhibited by IE7 , Microsoft relented and plumped for standard - by - default .
The first beta of IE8 was released in March and it did indeed default to standards compliance .
Web developers have been clamouring for standards compliance for a long time ; IE is a long way behind the competition , requiring considerable hacks and workarounds to get pages working properly .
IE8 should make things a lot better — but it will still fall far short of the standards set by Firefox , Safari , and Opera .
Some of these problems are technical , but others are cultural .
Where the other browser developers are open and communicative , Microsoft is still leaving web developers in the dark .
Microsoft was initially concerned that defaulting to standards compliance mode would " break the web " — that is , make a significant proportion of web pages render so badly as to be unusable — and experiences with beta 1 have provided some justification for the company 's concerns .
Microsoft is appealing to web developers to fix their web pages , but the unfortunate reality is that the owners of many websites will be unwilling to foot the bill for those fixes to be made .
To mitigate this difficulty , Microsoft is adding a new feature to aid the transition .
Web developers will be able to add a tag to their page ( or their web server ) to force pages to render in the same manner as IE7 .
Pages without the tag will continue to use the " doctype switch " to choose between the old , nonstandard " quirks mode " and the new " standards mode " ; pages with the new tag will still use the doctype switch , but this time to choose between " quirks mode " and " IE 7 mode . "
The tag will be supported in beta 2 of IE8 ( due in August ) , and is also available to IE 8 beta 1 with the latest security update .
With this tag , Microsoft is hoping that developers will have a low - cost way of making their pages work once IE8 ships , while still allowing standards mode to be the default going forward .
The response from developers , however , has been lukewarm .
Many commenters on the Internet Explorer blog have stated that they are happy to do the work to make their page 's standards compliant ; the problem is that Microsoft has not disclosed which parts of which standards it will support , nor which bugs will be fixed .
The ultimate reason for these problems with standards mode is that IE7's standards mode was both buggy and nonstandard .
Developers wrote IE7 - specific workarounds to ensure that pages worked in both reasonably standards - conforming browsers ( such as Opera , Safari , and Firefox ) and IE7 .
Without telling developers what to expect for IE8 , the same problem is liable to occur with that , too ; instead of targeting the standards , pages will contain workarounds and hacks to avoid IE8 - specific problems .
Taking clues from Apple and Mozilla
To really tackle this problem , Microsoft will need to be a lot more open about its plans for the browser and offer updates far more frequently .
Both WebKit ( the rendering engine of Safari ) and Firefox offer nightly builds , and even the commercial Opera browser has weekly builds available .
These regular releases make it much quicker for bug fixes to get into developers ' hands , making it easier for them to update their sites now rather than having to wait months between betas .
Greater transparency about what is and is not supported is also needed ; for example , although Firefox 3 , due for release any day now , will not have complete support for SVG , we can see exactly which bits it does support .
Internet Explorer has no equivalent documentation , with the result that developers are operating in the dark .
Although in the case of SVG , IE is " easy " — it has no support for any of the specification — in areas such as CSS and HTML , IE does offer partial support .
Microsoft has made steps in the right direction ; the IE blog is giving more insight into the browser 's development than it used to , and developments such as the CSS 2.1 test suite are a useful benchmark for all browsers .
But the standard has been set by the open source browsers , and so this is the level of openness and transparency that MS should be striving for , even if it finds that this sits uncomfortably with its commercial nature .
Internet Explorer is hemorrhaging market share , thanks to its virtual abandonment between about 2001 and 2006 and the rapid progress by competing browsers .
To stop losing ground to Firefox and Safari , Internet Explorer needs to stand head and shoulders above both of them .
But with Microsoft 's lack of clear objectives , infrequent releases , and poor communication , IE8 will be struggling to even achieve parity with its competitors .
Hot , Hot , Hot ! ( from Rob Sutherland )
In the mid 80s , a headhunter found me a good lead for a coding position at a ( now - defunct ) auto manufacturer .
When I showed up to the headhunter 's office , a very large and very scary looking woman took me out to the cafeteria so she could smoke during the interview .
Different times , the 80s .
I could tell right away that she was n't impressed with me .
She lit up a cigarette , blew a cloud of smoke across the table , picked up my résumé , looked at it , grunted , flipped the page , grunted again , and tossed the résumé to the middle of the table .
After another grunt , she glared at me and said " get a haircut ! "
I was trying to come up with something to say other than " WTF , " when I noticed my résumé catch fire .
She yelped and started flailing her arms .
I instinctively picked up a glass of water and dumped it on the flaming resume , the ashtray , and her .
I did n't get the job .
The Last Interview ( from Mark )
I went into an interview for a local " high tech " company based on a recruiter saying it was rapidly growing and opening into new markets .
Sounded good in principle .
Waiting for the interview to start , I had a chance to read through their recruiting packet and noted it was hard as hell to find a reference to their product line , and their " benefits " were n't all that different from what you might get working for Safeway .
The first interview was with HR and the questions ranged from " on this list of 30 things , pick the three you 're best at " to " define ' competition . ' "
I quickly figured out that she was more interested in getting back to her coffee than assessing me as a worthy candidate , so I upped my chances to be hired by answering all questions in the shortest time with the " best " answers .
She loved me .
The next interview was with a potential peer .
He was a " shooter , " emphasizing important points like an hour for lunch with a cock of the thumb on his gun hand .
He told me he was there to explain the intricacies of the job and make me more comfortable , but him sitting so far forward on the edge of the chair made me anything but comfortable .
He was clearly scared I might rock the boat , so I again upped my chances for being hired by presenting myself as one who was more than willing to listen to the status quo in the first few weeks and do what I could to integrate into what was clearly becoming a rather boring cubicle existence .
I also decided I was never going to take the job .
The third interview was with the hiring manager .
He was cool .
I liked him immediately and we chatted as humans .
He asked me what I thought of the hiring brochure and I said , " screen doors , chickens , or high tech , I have no idea what you actually do . "
When asked about benefits I said I might get better at Toys R Us .
He was n't offended — he thought it was funny .
I liked him more .
He asked for a single adjective to describe the environment , and offered , " conservative . "
With nothing to lose , I said , " stultifying " .
He laughed again .
Then I launched into my brief soliloquy : " I get the sense that you really want to fix this company , but to do so , you need to be relieved of your day to day responsibilities of managing the group you have .
So you 're out looking for someone that can run circles around the team members you have and get them to rise to the occasion while you spend time on grander improvements .
If the previous interviewer is an example of the standards of this group , I am your guy as I bet a week in I can be many times more productive than they are and get them scared .
If this is true , I am interested in this job . "
" But , " I continued , " if you are n't totally committed to sticking it out and really making changes in this company when you bail I wo n't last 10 minutes as they will eat me alive as soon as you are gone , and I do n't want this job .
So my question to you : are you truly committed to change and do you believe it 's possible in this company or are you just bullsh–tting me and yourself ? "
He said that was the end of the interview and he'd call me the next day for a follow up .
And he did call the following day .
At 6:30 AM .
The message was short .
" Thanks , man .
I 've been up all night and driving into work today , the answer to your last question came to me .
I just quit .
Thanks for the interview . "
A Wrinkle in Time ( from another Mark )
I interviewed with one of these companies that sells wholesale amounts to regular consumers .
You know , the kind of place you 'd go for a 25 lb bag of cornflakes .
On my résumé I have past experience listed in years rather than months .
As it turns out , one of the interviewers had worked at the same company I was coming from .
He 'd never been promoted for the six years he worked there and he was still carrying a grudge .
He asked me how long I 'd been a manager level three , so I answered " one and a half years . "
" Ahh , because on your résumé it says it 's been two years . "
" Right , late 2003 to early 2005 . "
" That 's two years , " he responded defiantly .
It was clear he thought I was a liar .
" Well , yes , 2003 and 2005 would be two years apart if - "
" They are two years apart . "
" But in my case , it was late in 2003 that I was promoted . "
" And the years you worked as a manager level three ? "
" Late 2003 through early 2005 . "
He was testing me .
" And you were in that position how long ? "
I was getting irritated .
" About a year and a half . "
He went on to ask the same question ( phrased differently ) about ten times , until finally I explained it in even more detail .
" Between December 31 and the following day , there is a difference of one day , though the year is different between the two dates . "
I continued the explanation as though I was talking to a first grader .
They requested a second interview , but I never responded .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203 .T plans to install solar panels on its next - generation Prius hybrid cars , becoming the first major automaker to use solar power for a vehicle , the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday .
The paper said Toyota would equip solar panels on the roof of the high - end version of the Prius when it redesigns the gasoline - electric hybrid car early next year , and the power generated by the system would be used for the air conditioning .
Toyota plans to use solar panels made by Kyocera Corp 6971.T , the Nikkei said .
A Toyota spokeswoman could not immediately confirm the report .
The Prius , the world ’s first mass - produced gasoline - electric hybrid car , first went on sale in Japan in late 1997 and in other markets in 2000 , and its cumulative sales have topped 1 million units worldwide .
Toyota remodeled the Prius with an improved hybrid system in 2003 and is expected to launch a third - generation version by next year .

Golf is to be an Olympic sport once again after a 104 year hiatus .
The lobbyists won the battle and we 're going to see the likes of Tiger Woods , Rory McIlroy and all the others duke it out in Rio de Janeiro .
Many professionals are in favour of its inclusion , no doubt keen to grab a gold medal to go with their millions .
I do n't agree with them .
Golf is a massive participation sport , one of the few that has a truly global appeal .
In the modern era it also has figureheads that are not only excellent proponents of the sport , but also genuine world stars .
Tiger Woods is a global icon despite losing his squeaky clean image to sex scandals
Pro vs Amateur
Now in order for the golfing Olympic event to be worthwhile , it simply has to include professional players .
This much is n't up for debate .
A golfing event without Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson would be seriously devalued .
The Olympics is n't supposed to be about big names , granted , it 's supposed to be about the best athletes reaching their peak with the world watching .
However the Olympics were always traditionally about amateur athletes .
I say traditionally because with sports like football ( or soccer if you prefer ) and tennis now rife with stars like Ronaldo and Roger Federer , it 's clear the IOC are thinking more about boosting ratings and popularity rather than retaining integrity .
Golf already has four marquee events - the majors , each with a massive purse and all the rewards that go with it .
Ask any golfer if he'd rather a Claret Jug or a gold medal - I would hope he'd say the former .
Or ask Rafael Nadal would he swap any of his French open titles for the gold medal won in Bejjing 2008 ?
I think not .
Pinnacle
This brings us on to my main beef with golf in the Olympics - it simply is n't representative of the pinnacle of the sport .
Golf , and even tennis , are tour competitions where consistency over the year is rewarded with a higher place in the rankings .
They are characterised by their " majors " , be it at Augusta or Roland Garros .
So trying to encapsulate this into one event does n't truly reflect what the sports have become in the modern era .
Do we really need to see Tiger with a gold medal draped across his chest to prove he 's number one ?
" It would be great to have an Olympic gold medal , but if you asked any player , ' Would you rather have an Olympic gold medal or green jacket or Claret Jug ? ' more players would say the majors . "
- 14 - time Major Winner Tiger Woods
Logistics
The very nature of golf is a long , drawn - out affair .
The likelihood is that an Olympic event would be a full four day tournament .
Is this too long to hold attention outside of the core golfing crowd ?
The event that attracts the most attention lasts a mere 9.69 seconds , golf just does n't get the blood pumping in the same way .
Sure , whilst Tiger is around there will be crowds drawn .
But what about when he inevitably loses his grip on the game ( be it via choice or circumstance ) ?
Will golf be just another event in the roster , a rich pro's playground ?
" I think that golf as an Olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors .
And the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their Olympic foundations and all those revenues would go towards the growth of the game . "
- Four - time Major Winner Phil Mickelson
Summary
The Olympics do n't need a golfing event , just like they do n't need a tennis or football event .
There is a definite resentment towards these players who are already multi-millionaires stealing the show from athletes who often struggle for sponsorship .
Athletes who train for hours a day at sports like rowing , weightlifting , sailing or cycling - they do n't have deals with Nike or Rolex to fall back on .
What do you think ?
We 'd love to hear from you - leave a comment below .
Guy proofs , by burning a cell phone in his microwave , that cell phones are pure evil !
As students of the manipulation of the political and social process by intelligence agencies through false flag terrorism and through other forms of covert operations , we need to be aware that the intelligence agencies are not Johnny one note , but rather change their tactics as the world political and economic situation evolves .
One of the main problems we face today is that , by all indications , the phase of false flag terrorism which began in the late 1990s and which reached its peak between September 11 , 2001 and July 7 , 2005 is ending , and is in the process of being replaced by something quite different .
The old phase was centered on exerting social and political control through mass fear of bin Laden , Al Qaeda , Islamofascism , and Islamic fundamentalism in general .
The new phase involves a completely different set of targets .
Iran and the Arab countries are no longer the main objectives .
They have been replaced by Russia , China , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , and the other countries that gravitate around this new pole of world politics .
Yet , many of those who have dedicated much energy trying to expose the false flag operations of the post - 9/11 period which is now essentially behind us are failing to identify the fact of sweeping change , and are repeating the slogans of the Bush - Cheney - neocon era as if everything were still as it was .
We need to sum up the lessons of the 9/11 - 7/7 era , above all the central idea that these terrorist attacks were covert operations by US and British intelligence , and that they were made to happen on purpose and completely orchestrated from Washington and London .
And then we need to look ahead .
The essence of false flag operations and other covert operations is that the same methods cannot be used for ever , but must be changed .
In the first half of the 19th century , the British used the extreme nationalism of the Mazzini networks to destabilize their enemies .
Around 1850 , the main cover story for terrorism became the international anarchist movement and this was used well into the 1930s , especially for purposes of political assassination .
In the 1950s and 1960s , the standard explanation for terrorism was the deranged loner , such as Lee Harvey Oswald .
In the 1960s and 70s , methods radically changed , with youthful leftists and communist terrorists of college - age taking center stage : here we see the Weathermen in the United States , the Baader - Meinhof group in Germany , and the Red Brigades in Italy ( this is a phase which resembles the one now starting ) .
In the 1970s and 1980s , this was supplemented by the radical Arab and Palestinian political terrorism of Abu Nidal and Black September .
Even during this period , there was also the rise of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism .
In the 1990s , especially in the United States , the focus shifted completely to right wing anarchist militias who wanted to destroy the government : Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City bombing are the leading example .
By the late 90s the scene had changed again to focus on Al Qaeda and bin Laden .
Now the credibility and usefulness of the 9/11 mythology has been exhausted , and we need to ask what will come next .
In order to answer this , we need to see that the historical predicament of US and British imperialism has qualitatively deteriorated even compared to 2001 .
We are living through the death agony of the US dollar , the constant threat of banking panic and systemic breakdown in the London and New York banking systems and capital markets , and the specter of worldwide hyperinflation centering on the dollar .
At the same time , a powerful combination of adversary states has emerged around Russia , China , and the other members of the Shanghai cooperation organization .
The most influential response to this situation is the one articulated by Zbigniew Brzezinski , the dean of the Democratic Party foreign policy establishment going back to the Jimmy Carter regime and even earlier .
Brzezinski's name is associated we have a new strategy which calls for a de-emphasis of the Middle East in favor of a global approach to crushing the power of Russia and China once and for all .
In the short run this new strategy creates for some the illusion that a relaxation of world tensions might be at hand .
But in the medium to longer term , the dangers of the Brzezinski strategy are even greater than those of the neocon approach followed under Bush and Cheney , because Russia and China remain powerful states with intercontinental ballistic missiles and hydrogen bombs , and a determined to defend themselves .
The Obama candidacy for the US presidency is the vehicle chosen by the Rockefeller - Trilateral - Bilderberger international banking faction to carry out this new and more radical approach to securing another century of world domination for the US and the British .
In the course of this , we must remember that although the so - called global war on terror has been one of the main features of US propaganda , we have also witnessed a series of CIA people power coups or color revolutions over recent years in places like Ukraine and Georgia .
It is likely that the US and the British will rely much more unease methods in the near future than they have in the recent past , including an attempt to overthrow or at least we can the government of China , perhaps as early as this year .
Irrationalist mass movements reminiscent of the 1920s and 1930s will be increasingly common in both the US and Europe , and Japan as well .
As far as terrorism specifically is concerned , we can expect the new wave of false flag actions , when it emerges , to involve groups that will allow popular anger and fear to be directed against countries like Russia , China , Pakistan , Sudan , and others of this group .
If we take into account the Virginia Tech student massacre and the similar shootings at Northern Illinois University during the past year , we may be able to guess that there will also be a new round of domestic , homegrown terrorism in the wealthier countries revolving around college students or young people who are concerned about social justice .
We can also expect a new round of ecological terrorism on the Unabomber of Earth First models .
It is therefore necessary that we realize that 2008 has been a year of very rapid change in the world strategic situation , and that we must be ready for new forms of terrorism as well as for new forms of mass political manipulation in general .
There are numerous signs that we may be entering a new fascist era ( or postmodern fascist era ) , and that irrationalist mass movements may be the breeding grounds for new forms of terrorism and new pretexts for top - down police state controls .
Sorry , that page does n't exist !
You may have mistyped the address , or the page may have moved .
The only way to address it is by changing the politics .
Producing islands of decent and consensual government in Baghdad or Kabul or Islamabad would be a much more meaningful and lasting contribution to the war on terrorism than even killing bin Laden in his cave .
But it needs local partners .
The reason the surge helped in Iraq is because Iraqis took the lead in confronting their own extremists  the Shiites in their areas , the Sunnis in theirs .
That is very good news  although it is still not clear that they can come together in a single functioning government .
The main reason we are losing in Afghanistan is not because there are too few American soldiers , but because there are not enough Afghans ready to fight and die for the kind of government we want .
Take 20 minutes and read the stunning article in last Sunday ’s New York Times Magazine by Thomas Schweich , a former top Bush counternarcotics official focused on Afghanistan , and dwell on his paragraph on Afghan President Hamid Karzai :
“ Karzai was playing us like a fiddle : The U.S. would spend billions of dollars on infrastructure improvement ; the U.S. and its allies would fight the Taliban ; Karzai ’s friends could get rich off the drug trade ; he could blame the West for his problems ; and in 2009 , he would be elected to a new term . ”
Then read the Afghan expert Rory Stewart ’s July 17 Time magazine cover story from Kabul : “ A troop increase is likely to inflame Afghan nationalism because Afghans are more anti-foreign than we acknowledge , and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining ...
The more responsibility we take in Afghanistan , the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the Afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly .
Our claims that Afghanistan is the ‘ front line in the war on terror ’ and that ‘ failure is not an option ’ have convinced the Afghan government that we need it more than it needs us .
The worse things become , the more assistance it seems to receive .
This is not an incentive to reform . ”
Before Democrats adopt “ More Troops to Afghanistan ” as their bumper sticker , they need to make sure it ’s a strategy for winning a war  not an election .
DIGG THIS
After my article " Thanks to Mothers against Drunk Driving , I ’m a Dangerous Driver " was published last week , I found out that I am one of the most vile , heartless and dangerous people to ever walk the face of the Earth .
I myself was unaware that I was such a dastardly scoundrel , but many , many readers were gracious enough to send me what amounted to a mountain of emails to clue me in to this important fact .
Why am I such a dastardly scoundrel ?
No , I have never killed or robbed anyone .
Nor have I ever participated in genocide , torture or rape .
Instead , as I found out last week , I am one of the most dastardly scoundrels in the world simply because I think that drunk driving ought to be legalized .
For the benefit of those of you who think that men like me are confirmed scoundrels simply because we believe that drunk driving ought to be legalized , I have compiled a list of fallacies that are often employed to defend the prohibition on drunk driving .
I do this because I hope to be able to show that you need to make better arguments in order to show that drunk - driving laws actually do what they are intended to do , and better arguments to demonstrate that drunk driving is any different than , say , driving without your glasses .
In other words , if you think drunk driving ought to be illegal , then please provide us scoundrels of the world with an actual , non-fallacious argument to that effect .
The Argumentum ad Misericordiam Fallacy
The argumentum ad misericordiam fallacy occurs whenever an argument contains an appeal to an emotion that is irrelevant to the actual argument under discussion .
This is by far the most widely - employed fallacy whenever the topic of drunk driving is discussed .
( Peruse MADD ’s website for two minutes for confirmation of this . )
The fallacy usually surfaces in something like the following forms , ( and which are actual replies to my article ) :
" I sincerely hope that no one you know or love is killed by a drunk driver …
You might then change your mind about whether prevention is better than punishment . "
Or :
" We are talking about the one thing that can not be replaced . "
The reason why these sorts of arguments are instances of the argumentum ad misericordiam fallacy , and are thus improper , is that they appeal to emotions that have absolutely nothing to do with the argument under discussion .
The debate over legalizing drunk driving is not between those who hate human life and those who cherish it , or between those who want people to die and those who want to save lives .
Instead , the debate revolves around whether drunk - driving laws actually do what they ’re claimed to do , and whether they are consistent with the principles upon which law and ethics are based .
Indeed , both of my articles claim precisely that drunk - driving laws do not work as they are claimed to work .
As such , it is totally irrelevant whether or not I might change my mind if someone I know is killed by a drunk driver , or whether human life is irreplaceable .
Either my arguments are sound , or they ’re not — and appeals to irrelevant emotional responses cannot help us determine whether my argument is sound .
For example , if we were having a discussion about whether current drug laws actually do what they ’re claimed to do , it would be totally fallacious for me to shout out " Think of the children ! " and think that I had somehow shown that drug prohibition is efficacious .
On the contrary , I would simply have shown myself to be an ignoramus .
It is important for drunk - driving prohibitionists to recognize , moreover , that these appeals to emotion cut both ways .
That is , we anti-prohibitionists can also appeal to emotions .
We can point out that these ruthless laws have the effect of causing an extreme amount of pain for those who are persecuted by them .
People who are pulled over and charged with drunk driving , without having caused even the slightest injury to anyone else , will have experienced an extreme amount of pain as a result .
( And those who do cause harm can be charged with negligent manslaughter even in the absence of drunk - driving laws . )
They can be fined , jailed , forced to take farcical MADD classes , serve " community service , " be refused employment , and even sent to prison !
As such , we opponents of drunk - driving prohibition are only standing up for this horribly oppressed , robbed and incarcerated group of men and women who never even hurt anyone else .
Whenever a drunk - driving prohibitionist declares " People ’s lives are priceless … , " we opponents of drunk - driving prohibition will reply , " Exactly !
That ’s why we ought not to inflict serious harm on innocent people who have harmed no other people ! "
In sum , if you write to me to call me a scoundrel this time , do n’t think you ’ve proven anything if you drag some irrelevant emotional appeal into the discussion .
Focus on my arguments instead .
The Ad Hominem Fallacy
The ad hominem fallacy occurs whenever an argument contains an irrelevant attack on a person ’s character .
In the context of the debate over drunk driving , this fallacy usually surfaces as an accusation that a proponent of the legalization of drunk driving is a " drunk . "
Here is a classic , if somewhat trite , example :
" Your opinion matches every other drunk I ’ve known , in that you think that you are able to handle yourself behind the wheel . "
The reason why this sort of an attack is fallacious is that my personal character has absolutely nothing to do with my arguments .
I might be a drunk , coke - head , hippie , serial killer , but these character traits have nothing to do with my arguments that drunk - driving laws have the exact opposite effect from what most people believe .
Again , the arguments are either sound or they ’re not — regardless of whether I am a " drunk . "
Hence , if you want to demonstrate that my arguments are not sound , you had better provide something more than an accusation that I am a " drunk . "
( I find it fascinating , moreover , that anyone could determine that I ’m a " drunk " based purely upon my article .
I suggest that these puritans spend a bit of time in the company of South Africans , New Zealanders , Aussies , Brits , Scots , the Irish , etc. before they call me a drunk ! )
So , do n’t think you ’re going to change my mind about my arguments if you can only resort to name - calling .
Grow up , and focus on my arguments instead .
The Circular Argument Fallacy
The circular argument fallacy ( or , “ begging the question ” ) occurs whenever someone assumes the very thing they are attempting to prove in their argument .
In the context of the discussion over drunk - driving legalization , this fallacy usually arises when prohibitionists start talking about the law .
For example , when discussing whether drunk - driving laws actually work , the prohibitionist sometimes argues that :
" We have laws in this country governing driving .
Like stop signs .
If you break the law by driving through a stop sign , you get a ticket .
The same is , and ought to be , true of drunk drivers .
They break the law , and should be punished for it . "
The problem with this sort of argument is that is assumes from the outset that drunk driving ought to be illegal — which is the very thing the prohibitionist is attempting to prove !
That is , the prohibitionist has used his conclusion as a basis for drawing that conclusion ; i.e. , the argument is circular .
If you want to demonstrate that drunk driving ought to be illegal , then you have to provide an argument to that effect .
You cannot simply assume that ought to be illegal throughout your entire argument , because you will be committing a serious logical fallacy .
Similarly , you cannot argue that " because it ’s the law , that means it ’s wrong , " because you need to prove to us anti-prohibitionists that it ought to be the law in the first place !
Quod Nimis Probat , Nihil Probat ( What Proves Too Much , Proves Nothing )
Another common logical error committed by drunk - driving prohibitionists is to present arguments that clearly prove too much .
That is , in their attempt to single out and vilify drunk drivers as absolute scum of the Earth , they draw conclusions that imply absurd consequences if they were taken to their logical conclusion .
For example , prohibitionists often defend prohibition in the following manner :
" Am I to understand that you support WAITING until someone DIES to object to another ’s irresponsibility ?
I find that simplistic , foolish , and unacceptable .
The reason I do is that the life lost is irreplaceable ! "
The problem with this sort of argument is that it proves far , far too much ( in addition to making an irrelevant appeal to emotion ) .
For , this argument could be extended to all aspects of human life , and virtually everything people do would be punished by ruthless laws — regardless of whether people actually hurt anyone .
This argument would apply , for example , to people who drive without their glasses ( and who currently only get a minor ticket if pulled over , instead of a stay in jail ) , people who text on their phones while driving , people who ride their bikes with bad brakes , people who work with flammable liquids around other people , et cetera ad infinitum .
In fact , if the argument were taken to its logical conclusion , every single human action would be punished by draconian laws and jack - booted policemen , since people can , and do , negligently kill other people in virtually every situation where men encounter one another on this planet .
The argument does not give us any reason why we ought to single out drunk drivers to punish so ruthlessly , when we let other negligent people totally off the hook — like people who drive without their glasses .
( In this connection , I ’ve always been rather perplexed that Mothers against Drunk Driving chooses to hunt and crucify only drunk drivers , rather than negligent drivers generally .
These mothers do n’t care about people who are killed through other types of negligent driving ?
Why do n’t they hunt down Grandpa like a wild beast when he kills someone after forgetting to put on his glasses ? )
Conclusion
The argument for legalizing drunk driving is based upon two important insights : 1 ) as I have attempted to demonstrate in my articles , ( again , see here and here ) , drunk - driving laws do not actually do what they are almost universally believed to do ; namely , make people safer drivers , and 2 ) drunk driving is not any different than any other negligent action behind the wheel ( like driving while tired , angry , senile , or without one ’s glasses ) , and thus ought to only be punished when that negligent behavior harms another person ( again , see here and here ) .
Furthermore , the argument against drunk - driving laws is based upon the observation that we already have laws to punish people when they harm other people through negligent or intentional action ; i.e. , negligent manslaughter and murder laws .
The clincher is that drunk driving is not even remotely as great a danger as people almost universally believe that it is .
For proof of this , watch Jeff Brown ’s excellent YouTube video discussing the statistics of drunk driving .
Let the non-fallacious discussion begin !

Uhm ... Bob Barr only presidential candidate on Texas ballot ?
The Democrats and Republicans have missed the filing deadline for getting on the ballot in Texas .
Here 's a Bob Barr press release :
Bob Barr is slated to be the only presidential candidate on the ballot in Texas after Republicans and Democrats missed the Aug. 26 deadline to file in the state .
" Unless the state of Texas violates their own election laws , Congressman Barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot , " says Russell Verney , campaign manager for the Barr Campaign and the former campaign manager for Ross Perot .
" Texas law makes no exceptions for missing deadlines . "
The Texas Secretary of State Web site shows only Bob Barr as the official candidate for president in Texas .
" We know all about deadlines , " says Verney .
" We are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation .
When we miss deadlines , we get no second chances .
This is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy . "
" Republicans and Democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws , no matter how absurd or unreasonable , " says Verney .
" Therefore , Republicans and Democrats should be held to the same standards . "
UPDATE : According to Ballot Access
News :
" Section 192.031 of the Texas election code says that political parties must certify their presidential and vice - presidential candidates for the November ballot no later than 70 days before the general election .
It says , “ A political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice - president placed on the ballot if before 5 p.m. of the 70th day before presidential election day , the party ’s state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the name ’s of the party ’s nominees for president and vice - president . ”
This year , that deadline is August 26 .
UPDATE : At 2:30 pm Texas time , August 27 , Kim Kizer of the Texas Secretary of State ’s elections division says neither major party ’s certification has been received in the Elections Division .
The Executive Office of the Secretary of State refers all questions back to the Elections Division .
This year , neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party obeyed this law . "
...
" This year , the Texas Libertarian Party and Bob Barr are the only ballot - listed presidential candidates on the Texas ballot , so the Texas Libertarian Party could , if it wished , bring a lawsuit .
However , the result of the lawsuit would probably be to get the deadline declared unconstitutional ; no court would order that Obama and McCain be kept off the ballot . "
UPDATE2 : Welcome FARKers .
To read comments on this story on FARK , go here ( but do feel encouraged to double - post your comments both here and at FARK . )
UPDATE3 : PoliTex , the political blog of the Texas - based Star - Telegram , reports :
" Texas Secretary of State spokesperson Ashley Burton said that upon further checking , " Both parties filed before the deadline .
We expect their amended filings after both parties finish their nominating process at the conventions . "
Texas law , changed in 2005 , requires that the parties submit their candidates names 70 days before the election .
Problem is , neither party has gotten through their nominating process .
The Texas Republican Party listed John McCain and " running mate " as their candidates , with an amended certification after the GOP convention in St. Paul .
Obama and Biden will be certified after the Democratic Convention "
UPDATE4 : Bob Barr campaign email about Texas SoS spokesperson 's finding the paperwork " upon further checking " here .

epsi ,
You may have noticed that we 've talked about Bob Barr a couple times at The Shotgun Blog ( OK ... 146 , really : http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awesternstandard.blogs.com+%22bob+barr ) .
He was a prominent conservative Republican Congressman from Georgia and the current Libertarian Party candidate for president .

Yes !
34 Electoral Votes closer to victory in November !!!

Well this is amazing .
Bob Barr should focus much of his efforts in Texas now !
He 's sure to receive 8 % national vote as a result of this !
God bless .

Sweetness .
This imcreases the chances of Barr carrying a huge state come November .
Posted by : Jim | 2008-08-27 5:47:02 PM
I really wish this was actually going to stand .
It wo n't however , the judge will overrule it for reasons of public interest .
They will then also pass a law at the state level to make sure Republicans and Democrats never have to deal with the hardship of such deadlines , and then likely make it harder for third parties to make the ballot .
Posted by : SeanT | 2008-08-27 5:55:19 PM
Probably has to do with the fact that they have n't been officially nominated at their conventions ...

See : Texas Election Code Section 181.005

Although my first choice is Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr is my second .
I wish as well that it will stand .... but anon is probably right that the communist and nazi parties * ahem * democrats and republicans will see to it that nobody messes with their " poker game " ( Aaron Russos - freedom to fascism on google video ) .

Appreciate the info .

I suggest , that in order to save face , you should remove this P.M.
You should have done the research first .
Posted by : Ike | 2008-08-27 6:38:49 PM
I do n't think 181 applies .
It seems to set out rules for nominating candidates for county and statewide offices it has no provisions which it seems to require for national conventions needed for nominating presidential candidates .
Where as Chapter 11 is specifically about Presidential Elections
Texas election code

You misunderstand the post , Ike .
For one , I include a question mark in the title , indicating my surprise .
And surprise at what ?
That 's point two : the press release by the Bob Barr camp that claimed he was the only Presidential candidate to file on time .
The point was to get clarification on this press release .
And the post has , it appears , succeeded .
( To be clearer , I did not report that Barr was the only presidential candidate on the ballot in Texas , I reported on the Barr campaign 's claim that he was .
That 's a big difference . )

This seems to indicate that 181 is only 1 of 3 requirements .
so the Democrats and Republicans have met the first and the third but not the second requirement .
Posted by : Jeff | 2008-08-27 7:22:59 PM
Jeff ,
Are you refereing to the three conditions within 192.031 ?
181 is a different section .
Posted by : Jeff | 2008-08-27 7:54:05 PM
Normally , this would n't be a problem in Texas except in 2005 Texas changed the law from 60 days to file before the general election to 70 days .
Someone forgot to check the manual - oh and um they could use place holders in the event a change at the convention , the only problem is those dingbats did n't file place holders either .
Would n't matter for Obama as he would lose Texas anyway , but big for McCain .
More than likely SOS will put them on , but Texas is ultra tough on election laws and if I was Barr I would take them to court to force them to follow the law .

Oh and by the way , as of today the Barr camp is correct he is the ONLY Presidential candidate on the ballot .
There are several write - in candidates like Nader , but Barr is the only one that would actually be printed on the ballot .

Hey , do n't be so tough on the Rep and Dem parties , after George W. Bush , they 're purposely pretending that Texas does n't belong to the United States .
No more Texas , no more Bush , and the nightmare is over .
Posted by : GeorgeMcCain | 2008-08-27 9:22:39 PM
As awesome as it would be if Barr were the only nominee on the ballot , I think the law is written in such a way to basically give the two main parties a free ride .
Check out section b and see if I 'm right here :
( b) A political party is entitled to have the names of its
nominees placed on the ballot , without qualifying under Subsection
( a ) , in each subsequent general election following a general
election in which the party had a nominee for a statewide office who
received a number of votes equal to at least five percent of the
total number of votes received by all candidates for that office .

" Are you refereing to the three conditions within 192.031 ?
181 is a different section . "
Yes I am .
The condition stipulated in Chapter 181.005 has been met by both major parties , but that condition is only one of three conditions stipulated in 192.031 .
Posted by : Jeff | 2008-08-27 9:29:00 PM
George ,
Informed sources has it that given the stresses on the military and the constrained budget that Bush 's next Imperial military war will be to Invade New Mexico and make it part of the US .
He will need Texas as a staging point for our troops .
McInsane is already calling for a surge .
Osama is opposing all such military action even as he votes for complete funding of the war .
Posted by : Steve | 2008-08-27 9:30:12 PM
Joe Lawson , do you have any information on the " place holder " laws ?
Chapter 192.031 seems very clear that they need the names and addresses .
Here is the critical condition ( 2 )
--
before 5 p.m. of the 70th day before presidential
election day , the party 's state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of :
( A ) the names of the party 's nominees for president and vice - president ; and
( B ) the names and residence addresses of presidential elector candidates nominated by the party , in a number equal to the number of presidential electors that federal law allocates to this state ;
---
Somehow I do n't think place holder would meet those conditions .

Who gives a shit .
Posted by : The Stig | 2008-08-27 9:39:49 PM
Jeff ,
You have me confussed ?
Which of the three conditions of 192.031 does 181.005 meet ?
My reading os section 181 is that it lays out conditions for candidates to get onto the Texas ballot by means of party convention .
I understand you are from Australia so please do n't take a short review of the US political structure as an insult .
The US consists of 50 states , each state has a lot of leway in determining how they organize their governments .
Not complete freedom though .
Much like the English system has the Magna carta which establishes certain levels of freedom or protection from Government we have the constituition which includes a number of amendements .
The first 10 being called the bill of rights .
So a state can set its own laws with limitations on how it runs its elections but for certain federal positions the federal government also has restrictions .
The problem I see with 181 is that it seems to be ment for elected postions for the state of texas from the county level ( a division of a state ) to the state wide level such as Governor , treasurer , secretary of state .
Section 181 seems to be about the concept of an established political party and how that party has certain methods such as a primary or other method such as as small regiional to statewide conventions for selecting candidates to these offices .
Section 181 defines when where and how such conventions shall be held .
The office of President of the US is different from all other offices in that it is conducted in all states .
And the candidates are selected usually by some means of a National Convention that no one state has the authority to set the regulations for .
So 181 which sets specific regulations for state wide elections seems to preety much ignore the Presidential Election which has its own specific chapter in Texas election code .
Chapter 11 in which section 192 is found .
So what I am contesting is that I think that 181 is irelevent for the office of President of the United States .
I believe that 192.031 sets the rules for the candidate for the President of the United States being on the ballott and I also believe that Section 192,062 set the terms of how a party can remove a candidate for the President of the .... from the texas Ballott and replace him / her with another individual .
In both cases this action must be completed 70 Days before the Presidential Election .
The only real question is did the Republican Party of Texas State Chairmen file for Mccain and did the Democratic Party Chairman of Texas file in time for Obama ?
Let us suppose they both did then this is pretty much a mute issue .
Let us suppose both of them missed the deadline .
Then the Texas state legislatures can quickly call a special session and rewrite the law which the Governor of Texas would sign and poof both parties are on .
Let us suppose that one or the other did n't then you will have som rangling between the two main parties .
Is a special session called ?
Who is on ?
Who is off ?
Will the party left off have a lawsuite to get on .
All I can say is stay tuned .
This could get to be more fun .

Steve ,
Thanks for the summary , but we get enough ( some would say too much ) US news to be able to follow your elections .
:D
My reference to Section 181 is that in part ( 3 ) of Section 192.031 .
Ike said that 181 was enough , but obviously it is n't .
The 181 is just there to make it easier for the larger parties and near impossible for the smaller ones .
You referred him to Chapter 11 and I just wrote to give you a more specific reference to 192.031 .
I 'm sure you are right and the state government will quickly re-write the laws .
It would be a gross injustice in my opinion , and it would also be interesting to try to back date it .
Posted by : Jeff | 2008-08-27 10:13:42 PM
Of course the Repubs and Dems do n't have candidates listed .
The Dems did not determine their candidate until today , and the Repubs wo n't determine theirs until next week .
I find it impossible to believe they wo n't get their candidates on the ballot .
If necessary , they will simply change the law .
Posted by : Alan | 2008-08-27 10:55:05 PM
Jeff and Andy ,
Ofcourse they will simply change the law but in doing so it will get us national if not international expossure .
Hopefully it will expose the other ballott access isues in Oklahoma , Maine , West Virgina etc
Hopefully it will make them include Barr and Nedar in the telivised debates .

@ Jeff Re : changing the law .. unfortunately , Texas legislature only meets in odd numbered years unless called into a special session by the Governor .
Chaos would likely ensue if that occurred .

I found a site that listed all the people running and read through all the things these people believe and would n't you know , Bob Barr was the only one worth voting for .
He even had a political career that proved him to be a good candidate .
Schweitzer calls Bob Bar someone single issue folk would vote for except I agree with Bob Barr on every issue .
Dems and Republicans can all take a flying leap with their bigger gov schemes .
Bobs all about smaller govt , and bigger guns . :)
Posted by : mogwai | 2008-08-28 7:06:48 AM
Section 181 has no relevance to presidential nominees .
No state 's presidential primary determines that national party 's nominee .
After all , Hillary Clinton won the Texas Democratic presidential primary by a vote of 1,459,814 to 1,358,785 ( although Obama won the Texas caucus ) .
The Republican National Committee worked hard lobbying various states to ease these certification deadlines , in 2003 , and again in 2007 , when the party realized its very late conventions in 2004 and even later in 2008 bumped up against certain state laws .
The Republican National Committee would not have done all this work if these deadlines do n't matter .
But the Texas legislature slipped up and did the reverse !

I love the latest update , about how the secretary of state ' found ' the missing applications for the Dems and the Reps .
Even if there had been an iron - clad law to keep them off the ballot , they would have just brushed it aside anyway .
The one good thing that is coming from all this though is the answer to the question ' Who the hell is Bob ? ' .
I think I will make that into a bumpersticker . :)

The Ballot Access News piece came out prior to the PoliTex piece .

For those offering the Chapter 181 as the savior argument for this fiasco ( which is incorrect , but lets play along ) ...
The Republicans would have a difficult time demonstrating they had 43,992 ( at least one percent of the total number of votes received by all candidates for governor in the most recent gubernatorial general election ) people participate in their precinct conventions ...
For Tarrant County ( Fort Worth ) to have done its part , it would have had to of had 3,263 participate ... it had less than 2,100 .
oops .

I am a Libertarian and I detest uneven electoral playing fields and major party manipulation of the process to keep third parties off the ballot .
That having been said , I live in Maine , and frankly , our ballot requirements are getting a bad rap .
4,000 signatures is NOT tough to get in this state - people here are generally of the " everyone deserves to have their shot " mindset - and our ballot deadline is not , in my opinion , ridiculously early .
If you are halfway organized and have any type of grass roots support , you should n't have any trouble getting on the ballot in this state .
The problem the Libertarian Party has is this ridiculous fantasy we have that we 're established enough that we should be able to nominate our candidate in " real time " ( i.e. , less than six months before the general election )
The fact is that we enter every election with serious handicaps , financial and organizational .
We need to go back to nominating our general election candidate in the fallof the year preceding the general election .
This gives us more time to organize ballot drives , gives big donors TWO calender years to make maximum donations and allows us more time to get our candidate known in a media paradigm that is geared to ignoring them .

" Given that neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party nominated a candidate before Aug. 26 , it would be impossible for either party to file under Texas law . "
Except for the fact that it was n't technically " impossible " .
Both the DNC and the GOP have intelligent people working for them , people that are aware of individual state 's filing requirements .
Both the DNC and the GOP CHOSE when they would hold their conventions - they could have chosen to have nominated their respective candidates before the Texas cutoff date .
They both made decisions that exclude them from Texas , BY LAW .
As such , they should be legally forced to live with that decision and accept the consequences of it .

McCain sparks water rights blowup
Arizona Sen .
John McCain ’s call for renegotiating how much water some Western states can pull from the Colorado River has a set off quite a stir in Colorado , an up - for - grabs swing state that next week plays host to the Democratic National Convention .
“ Over my cold , dead , political carcass , ” said Republican Bob Schaffer , who is running against Democratic Rep. Mark Udall to replace retiring Republican Sen .
Wayne Allard , offering a sentiment widely shared in Colorado and across ideological lines .
Advertisement
In the arid West , water is an explosive issue .
Political fortunes have been lost because of it , and ranchers occasionally shot and killed .
As a local saying has it , “ Whiskey is for drinking .
Water is for fighting . ”
McCain , a proud Westerner , triggered the latest round of fighting when he told The Pueblo ( Colo . )
Chieftain last Friday that “ the compact that is in effect , obviously , needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties ” — which was widely understood in Colorado as a process that would end up redistributing more of the river ’s “ liquid gold ” downstream .
The Republican was forced to backtrack Wednesday , writing a letter to Allard saying , “ Let me be clear that I do not advocate renegotiation of the compact . ”
But the issue is not likely to go away soon .
Democrats Udall , Gov. Bill Ritter and Sen. Ken Salazar are expected to blast McCain in a press conference today .
In an interview Wednesday , Salazar said McCain ’s remarks showed that he did n’t understand the issue ’s importance .
“ There ’s nothing more fundamental to the West than water . ”
That line of attack could be particularly effective against the Arizona senator because Coloradans are sensitive to attempts by their downstream neighbors — Arizona , Nevada and California — to take more water .
The 86 - year - old water compact says that Arizona , Nevada and California can take 7.5 million acre feet of water from the river annually .
The rest is split among Colorado , Utah , New Mexico and Wyoming .
The four up - river states worry that the more populous southerly trio would use a renegotiation to quench its ever - increasing thirst at their expense .
“ You kind of scratch your head and think , ‘ Is n’t this guy from the West ?
Should n’t he know about this [ stuff ] , ” said Colorado State University political science professor John Straayer .
The misstep demonstrates how difficult navigating the West can be , even for a native son .
As McCain was reminded , the West can be just as territorial as the East is provincial .
“ He ’s been educated by the lower - basin states .
He ’s not been educated by upper - basin states .
And once he gets that education , he will no longer make those remarks .
I guarantee it , ” said former Colorado Republican state Sen.
Norma Anderson , who recalled her then - husband being threatened with a shotgun during a water dispute years ago .
Though Colorado Democrats are seeking to exploit McCain ’s comments locally , Anderson predicted the remark may help the Republican in the population - booming and water - parched swing state of Nevada .
Even if Colorado Democrats do take the comments for a ride , state Republicans do n’t seem too worried that it ’ll leave any permanent scars .
“ My first response was ouch , ” said GOP political consultant Katy Atkinson .
“ I do n’t think it ’s enough of an issue to swing the state against him . ”
McCain will have plenty of time between now and November to explain his position to rural Coloradans , who are a friendly audience , said Sean Duffy , who served in the administrations of then - Govs.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Bill Owens of Colorado .
Besides , Duffy questioned whether Democratic Sen. Barack Obama even understands the issue of rural water rights .
“ This is a group of people that did n’t get rural Pennsylvania .
I do n’t think they ’re going to get rural Colorado , ” he said .
Former Gov. Dick Lamm , an Obama supporter , said that while water generally is “ a get - your - gun issue , ” he does n’t think average Coloradoans know about the agreement McCain suggested renegotiating .
“ I do n’t think , in the scheme of things , it ’s going to hurt him . ”
If anything , it should be a lesson to McCain not to stray off message , Lamm said .
It may have been fine to ad lib while campaigning in Arizona — in fact , his remarks would be unlikely to raise eyebrows there — but a presidential candidate has to be more disciplined .
Eric Sondermann , an unaffiliated Colorado political analyst , predicted that local issues like water , oil shale and gun rights will have more impact on statewide races than on the presidential contest .
“ I do n’t think serious - minded people are saying this would be reflective of water policy in a McCain administration , ” he said .
Still , the Colorado Democratic Party said it will likely pound the Republican with ads portraying him as a water thief in the hopes of making the Republican seem , well , all wet .
Exclusive to STR
August 12 , 2008
For every action ( force ) in nature , there is an equal and opposite reaction ; this is Newton 's Third Law of Motion .
We have let the feedback loop in society get seriously out of whack .
As humans , each of us is an individual actor .
The actions we take cause reactions .
We must deal with them .
It 's the nature of reality .
One learns early in life that poking a hornet 's nest with a stick is not a good idea .
This is not a difficult concept , it would seem .
But then , what seems is often far from what is .
Take , for instance , the idea that it is perfectly legal for you to be shot for not buying a tag for your dog .
Sounds extreme , does n't it ?
But it is the standard practice almost anywhere in the United States where dog licensure is mandated .
( What kind of word is that : " mandated " ?
What kind of people would create and use and accept such a word ? )
Here is how it works .
Some people got together and decided that they wanted you to have a license on your dog .
They were probably afraid something bad might happen and thought they could control their world against such possibility .
They may have asked your opinion about this idea but they probably did not .
Most likely they just decided what they wanted to do , wrote it down , and called it a law .
They probably published it somewhere and this made them think that their idea was now somehow or other applicable to you , regardless of what you and your dog thought about the whole matter .
( " Stroke of the pen , law of the land .
Pretty cool ! " ' President Clinton 's aide , Paul Begala )
As Marc Stevens has so aptly described it , ' law ' is nothing more than opinion backed by force .
If you are any kind of self - respecting individual , you probably would say to yourself , " What utter foolishness these pompous asses have written .
I am certainly not going to pay any attention to the insane ramblings of such lunatics , " and would go on about the business of your life .
But let us suppose that your small - minded neighbor gets it in her mind that you are not subservient enough to the ideas of tyranny and she calls the petty bureaucrat in charge of doggy ( and owner ) subjugation .
The cops come out and tell you that there are some opinions that someone somewhere wrote down on a piece of paper that say that you are supposed to number your doggie friend .
If you , as I hope you would , tell these fools - in - costume that you have no intention whatsoever of putting a number on your dog and furthermore would they please get - the - hell - out - of - your - yard - and - face before you get pissed off . . . well , it might get ugly .
And when you continue to assert your choice to be left alone to peaceably life your life with your un-numbered canine companion , who is also peaceably minding his or her own business , the cops are going to get unruly and pull their guns on you demanding that you hand over the dog , at the very least .
If you then pull out your Glock in an attempt to prevent the kidnapping of said peaceful canine companion , all hell will break loose and you and your dog will be riddled with more bullets than would be needed to take over some small countries .
You could avoid this , of course , by doing what they say in the first place .
But keep in mind what the reality is .
These people , and probably most of your neighbors as well ( otherwise it never could have gotten this far ) , believe that it is acceptable to shoot you if you refuse to follow their stupid idea that your dog should have a number mechanically attached to his body at all times ( or whatever other silly things someone decided to write down on paper somewhere ) .
It 's not like you or the dog have threatened anyone and there is cause for their actions .
No .
It 's just an idea they had that they thought would be nice for you to obey .
( Need I point out that you are similarly numbered and catalogued ?
And that the reality is that this is about you , and not about your dog ? )
They can and will kill you over this .
" You will be numbered ! "
Know why ?
Because they can .
Know why ?
Because somehow or other the great ideasphere has gotten this idea that there are some people who are not responsible for their actions .
Think about it .
If your nosy neighbor had come over demanding that you attach a device to your pet , and you told her exactly where she could shove her idea and device , and then she shot you -- she would go away for a long , long time .
It would be in the daily fishwrappers and on the viewscreen and everyone would be talking about it .
On the other hand , if you defend yourself against such an unwarranted intrusion into your life by armed thugs in costumes ( or not ! ) , demanding exactly the same thing , you will be shot -- and everyone will comment what a dangerous person you were , and how good it is that you are no longer alive to endanger the neighborhood .
Your killers will get a few days paid vacation and then will have to go back to work being thugs for hire .
With no responsibility for their actions .
( Lon Horiuchi , who shot and killed Vicki Weaver and her baby in cold blood , got a medal !
He then went on to be a part of the team at Waco , Texas who burned to death 80 " Branch Davidian " men , women and children .
Yay team !
Hip Hip Hooray !
This was for the failure to pay some fees on fully voluntary and legal gun sales .
I 'm unaware if any dog tags were involved . )
Oh , but they 're not thugs , some may say .
Well think about this :
If a warrant for your arrest is made , and you attempt to resist -- you attempt to prevent the intrusion into your life by armed thugs -- you can and very likely will be shot , regardless of the underlying cause .
It could be something as simple as an unpaid parking ticket , or the failure to license your dog .
The cops do n't care .
It 's not their job .
They are not responsible .
They are only hired thugs whose job is enforcement of the petty dictates of others .
They will kill you over a parking ticket .
They are currently called law enforcement officers , after all ; we no longer appear to have peace officers .
They are not responsible for assuring that their actions are appropriate to the level of crime alleged .
Nope , failure to bow to their commands is punishable by death .
That is the bottom line .
It is not about justice , it is about control .
In any rational reality there would be some kind of reciprocity between the actions of humans in relations with each other .
Somewhere along the line there arose the idea of ' sovereign immunity . '
And even though we realized a couple of centuries ago that the idea of " sovereigns " having power over others is really , really stupid , we still think it is all right for hired thugs to be completely devoid of any responsibility for their actions .
Amazing .
" Lord " Acton said , many moons ago , " Power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
Think about the surly " public servant " that you frequently encounter at the DMV or the TSA , or any of a myriad of other " public " offices .
Do you know why they act as they do ?
Because they know that they have your life literally in their hands .
That is absolute power .
Oh , but I exaggerate , you may exclaim .
Nope .
Think about it .
These people know that it is within their power to create a living hell for you if you do n't acquiesce to their little dictates .
They know that they will bear no repercussions for their actions .
They KNOW that others with guns will enforce their will upon you if you do not kowtow .
People have died in holding pens because they did n't kowtow to the TSA and similar dynasties .
And you know what ?
No one was put in jail for these murders .
The clerk at the DMV knows that if you do n't play his or her game , you will end up on the side of the road looking down the barrel of a " service " weapon .
You do n't see clerks at Nordstrom 's or Wal - Mart providing this level of service , do you ?
If you drove a taxi , and your potential customer refused to allow you to strip search and fondle him or her prior to your accepting them as a fare , and you locked them up in a room and they died , you would go to jail for that .
Deservedly .
And for a long time .
TSA agents ?
Not so much .
( as Jon Stewart is wont to say . )
The idea that anyone is not responsible for his actions is a license to kill .
A civilized society cannot exist with such an idea .
Actions have consequences .
It may appear that they do n't .
It may appear that individuals parading as cops are above the law .
They 're not .
They , too , are just people .
What is happening is that the scale is becoming severely out of balance .
Just as it has taken almost 100 years since the creation of fraudulent " money " by the Federal Reserve Banks for the united States economy to collapse , so too it will be with petty tyrants .
Remember Rome ?
Or the Soviet Union ?
For every action , an equal and opposite reaction .
We need to take this seriously before the scale is so far out of balance that only the total destruction of society can right it .
At least , if you want to live in a civilized society where you get as good as you give , and you need not fear those who believe they can do anything for they are " above " the law .
Each of us creates this reality by believing it .
If you believe that others are superior to you and that they have the right to control you , then you make that real .
These tyrants only exist because you and I allow them to .
Think about this .
Is this the kind of world you want to pass on to your children ?
It really is up to each one of us .
We each must understand that it is not acceptable civilized behavior for some people to tell others how to run their , our , lives .
We have no one to blame but ourselves .
Do not go gently into tyranny .
This is our world .
These are our lives .
Let 's remember that and start to act as though our lives matter .
They do .
There is no " authority . "
It is your life , not someone else's .
I bid you peace and love .

The St. Louis Post Dispatch is writing Bankruptcy filings expected to soar as economy slides
The law that drastically changed the Bankruptcy Code in October 2005 was supposed make it tougher to escape debts and reduce the number of filings .
It worked , for a time .
Although the law made filing for bankruptcy more complex and expensive , the number of cases locally and nationally is rising again .
Experts predict a big hike later this year , triggered by the nation 's wobbling economy and heavy levels of consumer debt .
My Comment
National statistics indicate the trend is well under way , with bankruptcy filings by individuals up 27 percent nationwide in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the year - ago period , according to new figures from the American Bankruptcy Institute , a research and education group .
Individuals ' bankruptcies nationwide rose 40 percent in the 2007 calendar year compared to 2006 .
The ABI , which bases its figures on data from the National Bankruptcy Research Center , said the increase is due to rising household debt and growing mortgage problems .
My Comment
The full impact of the nation 's sliding economy is not reflected in the most - recent figures — that may take a few more months — and many lawyers believe there will be a lot of bankruptcy - related business up for grabs this year .
" Nationally , people think that the No. 1 area of growth this year will be bankruptcy , " said Carrie Titus , division director of Robert Half Legal , which provides legal staffing to law firms and corporate legal departments .
The reason the increase is expected later this year is because the impact of bad economic developments does n't translate immediately into a sharp hike in bankruptcy filings , said Jack Williams , scholar - in - residence for the Alexandria , Va. - based Bankruptcy Institute .
He 's also a bankruptcy professor at Georgia State University College of Law in Atlanta .
" That spike generally lags about six to nine months behind the economy , " Williams said .
" Bankruptcy is a lagging economic indicator . "
Because of this , Williams predicted that the number of filings across the country , including business and individual cases , will rise to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million by the end of 2008 .
Most cases are filed by individuals .
" This is a huge number … " ….
This is fast approaching previous levels , " he said , referring to the period before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 took effect .
" It 's the very thing that Congress sought to fix .
It will turn out to be a legislative failure . "
My Comment
Changes to the Bankruptcy Code have drawn widespread criticism from debtors ' lawyers , who describe the law as ill - conceived and badly written .
Some provisions refer to sections that do n't exist , some amendments contradict others and some sentences do n't make sense , they said .
My Comment
But even if lawyers and the courts are learning to work with the new bankruptcy law , some of the changes have taken their toll on consumers — and even may have contributed to the mortgage loan crisis , said T.J. Mullin , a bankruptcy lawyer in Clayton .
Before the law 's enactment , Mullin had helped to save thousands of clients ' houses by having them reorganize their finances through Chapter 13 filings .
These filings are geared toward individuals with regular income who temporarily are unable to pay their debts , but can do so over time .
In the past , many Chapter 13 debtors have been able to keep their homes through the use of repayment plans that stopped foreclosures or repossessions .
However , the 2005 bankruptcy law changes imposed so many additional requirements and restrictions that Chapter 13 no longer is a practical way for many wage earners to save their houses from foreclosure , Mullin said .
Also , the extra work required by the new law has caused the typical attorney 's fee to double , putting it beyond the reach of most people .
" The passage of the bankruptcy amendments in 2005 will without a doubt lead to many more foreclosures , distressed sales of real estate , neighborhoods going into decay and families shattered , " Mullin said .
" We are seeing only the tip of the iceberg at this time unless some changes in the bankruptcy law are passed to allow this valuable remedy to one again be efficiently offered . "
My Comment
Bankruptcy filings jump 30 %
More than 90,000 bankruptcy filings were made in March , the highest since insolvency laws became more restrictive in October 2005 , according to statistics compiled from court records by Jupiter ESources .
Filings in March were 30 % above the pace in 2007 .
California led the nation with a 42 % increase in bankruptcy filings at an annual pace in the first quarter , according to Jupiter ESources .
" We 're seeing fairly high readings in these measures of distress like bankruptcies , foreclosures and mortgage defaults , " said Chris Low , chief U.S. economist at FTN Financial in New York .
The most affected states are " also where the most housing - related business growth was , " Low said .
The states most affected by the housing recession , including California , Nevada and Florida , were among those with the largest increases in bankruptcies .
They also are among states where unemployment rates exceed the national average .
The jobless rate in California was 5.7 % and Nevada 's was 5.5 % in February .
Nationally , 5.1 % of workers were unemployed in March , the highest level since September 2005 , the Labor Department reported Friday .
Tailing California 's 42 % rate , Florida had a 35 % increase in bankruptcy filings at an annual pace in the first quarter and Nevada saw a 32 % rise , according to Oklahoma City - based Jupiter 's Automated Access to Court Electronic Records service .

ATA Airlines Goes Under
Low - fare carrier ATA Airlines Inc. said Thursday it has filed for bankruptcy court protection , grounding all flights and stranding thousands of passengers .
" We deeply regret the disruption and hardship caused by the sudden shutdown of ATA , an outcome we and our employees had worked very hard and made many sacrifices to avoid , " Doug Yakola , the airline 's chief operating officer , said in a statement .
ATA said it was forced to ground operations because it lost a key military charter contract .
In addition to scheduled airline service , ATA also provided charter service for the Pentagon .
Skybus Is Bust
Saturday , Apr. 5 , 2008
The celebrated discount airline is ceasing all operations today and plans to file for bankruptcy protection next week , becoming the latest of the nation 's airlines to fall because of rising fuel costs and a slowing economy .
The shutdown deals a major blow to the Pease Development Authority as it strives to tap the potential of Portsmouth International Airport .
" Skybus struggled to overcome the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment , " the Ohio - based company said in a statement on its Web site .
" These two issues proved to be insurmountable for a new carrier .
Bye Bye Miss American Pie
Vicorp Restaurants Inc. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure its debts and closed 56 Bakers Square restaurants , including nine in Illinois .
The Denver - based company closed Bakers Square restaurants in Lake in the Hills , St. Charles and Oswego on Wednesday .
The company ’s location in Crystal Lake remains open .
Vicorp spokeswoman Amy Moynihan said 1,700 of the restaurants ’ 13,000 employees would be laid off as part of the cost - savings effort .
In a prepared statement Thursday , company officials said that lenders agreed to provide a $ 60 million financing arrangement to keep the remaining restaurants at normal operations during the restructuring .
Vicorp Chief Executive Officer Ken Keymer blamed the slowing economy and increasing operations costs for the bankruptcy filing and restaurant closings .
“ Certainly , we regret the necessity of filing Chapter 11 and the closure of 56 restaurants in various communities across the country , ” Keymer said .
“ The company concluded that today ’s court filings were both prudent and necessary . ”
Vicorp owns 193 Bakers Square restaurants in six states , including Illinois .
Nursing Home Company Files Bankruptcy
April 4 , 2008
Marathon Healthcare Inc , an East Hartford - based nursing home company that operates six facilities in Connecticut , including in Waterbury , Torrington and Prospect , filed for bankruptcy protection late Thursday .
The filing comes about three months after the state Department of Social Services launched an investigation of the company over concerns that it was struggling to meet its financial obligations , and about a month after a state audit said Marathon 's finances should be closely monitored .
Aloha Grounded
March 31 , 2008
Aloha Airlines said Sunday it will halt all passenger service after Monday , signaling the end of an airline that has served Hawaii for more than 60 years .
Aloha , which filed for bankruptcy for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 20 , was a casualty of fierce competition and rising fuel prices .
The airline said it will stop taking reservations for flights after Monday .
" We simply ran out of time to find a qualified buyer or secure continued financing for our passenger business , " said Aloha President David Banmiller in a statement .
" We had no choice but to take this action . "

Europe 's manufacturing base is suffering from the strong euro
The investment at the Spartanburg plant , South Carolina , is aimed at increasing capacity from 160,000 to 240,000 units by 2012 .
The move is set to create 500 new jobs and comes after the firm recently said it would cut 7.5 % of its German workforce in 2008 .
The firm is facing both rising costs in Europe as well as slowing US demand .
Since last September , the dollar has tumbled against the euro , hurting firms that pay their costs in euros but receive payment in dollars .
The euro touched an all - time high of $ 1.546 last week after punching through the $ 1.50 level at the end of February .
BMW is not the only European firm affected by the swings in exchange rates .
In December last year , the head of the European aerospace and defence company EADS , Louis Gallois , gave a strong indication that if the situation persisted , some of the manufacturing of the Airbus passenger jet would have to be moved outside Europe .
Changing gear
" The boost in production capacity will positively impact the logistics , suppliers , and distribution networks that support the manufacturing process , " said Josef Kerscher , president of BMW Manufacturing .
The firm said the plant would produce the BMW X3 , X5 and X6 models for international markets .
Analysts say that by building more vehicles in its South Carolina plants , Munich - based BMW can pay less wages in euros and will also save money by sourcing locally for parts used by its US factories .
This shift in production has resulted in planned cuts of 8,100 positions in Germany .
" This is completely driven by the plunge in the dollar , " said Oliver Wyman , publisher of the Harbour Report on automotive manufacturing activity .
" Conceivably , as the volume increases and the manufacturing system at the Spartanburg , South Carolina , plant improves , costs may come down enough to cut prices of their cars . "

On many occasions on this site I ’ve stated that just slightly decreasing the amount of gasoline you use will add up over time and really make a difference , for both your finances and the environment .
While it certainly is pretty cliche , it ’s nothing but the truth .
While the idea behind this post is fairly obvious , the actual benefits implementing the idea might not be .
For example , if Americans were to decrease gasoline consumption by just 10 % – which can be done any number of ways : by being a better driver , keeping up on car maintenance , trading in a gas guzzler for a fuel sipper – we could save billions of dollars per year and keep massive amounts of greenhouse gases out of the environment .
Let me explain a little further :
On average , Americans consume about 386 million gallons of gasoline each day .
Over the course of a year , that adds up to just under 141 billion gallons of gas .
That ’s a lot of gas , and is by far the highest number of any country in the world .
If people were able to reduce their fuel consumption by just 10 % – which , again , is very easy to do – we would save 14.1 billion gallons of gas each year .
With the current national average price for a gallon of gas sitting at $ 3.78 , this reduction in gasoline usage would equal a total dollar savings of over $ 53 billion .
To put that in perspective , this total is about 1/3rd of the Government stimulus package that was supposed to help jump start the economy .
In addition to the massive amounts of money we would save , there would also be a significant reduction in the amount of damage we do to the environment .
Each gallon of gasoline that we burn releases roughly 20 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Carbon dioxide , as I ’m sure you ’re well aware , is widely believed to be one of the main contributors to global warming and the “ greenhouse effect . ”
By reducing fuel consumption by just 10 % , we would keep 2.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .
While I have no idea whether or not this would make a significant dent in global warming , it certainly ca n’t hurt .
( I ’m sure someone will be kind enough to leave a comment telling everyone what effects a reduction of this magnitude would have on the environment .
Hint , hint . )
So , back to the original premise , if Americans were able to reduce their gasoline usage by only 10 % , we would save billions of dollars and help save the environment .
Sounds like a pretty good deal to me !
Thanks to higher gas prices , Americans have already begun to drastically reduce the amount of miles they drive , and have started to trade in their gas guzzlers for more cars with better fuel economy .
Hopefully , that means we ’re well on our way to getting to this 10 % reduction – if not more .
Tokyo conservationists are using honeybees to fend off crows attacking vulnerable seabirds nesting near the international airport .
The nonprofit Little Tern Project has installed hives of honeybees on the roof of the watertower where several thousand of the seabirds nest during migration .
The bees came from the Ginza Bee Project , another nonprofit that teaches people about agriculture and beekeeping .
From National Geographic :
" We spoke to an expert and learned that honeybees in the wild have the natural response of attacking a black object that comes near to their hive , " ( Ginza Bee Project chair Kazuo ) Takayasu said .
" There have been tests with black and white balloons , and the bees always attack the black balloon . "
It is believed that the bees ' reaction is linked to the color of bears ' fur .
The insects apparently attack dark - colored creatures to protect their hives from plunder .
" We noticed that the bees swarmed around crows that were taking offerings from white plates left on the outdoor altar of a shrine in Ginza , " Takayasu added .
Since the game is being played with " up " " down " and " aggression " buttons , I 'm worried it 'll get stale in a hurry .
The trailers have both looked nice , though .

Recently I ’ve been bumping into more and more people who ’ve either left Google to come to Microsoft or got offers from both companies and picked Microsoft over Google .
I believe this is part of a larger trend especially since I ’ve seen lots of people who left the company for “ greener pastures ” return in the past year ( at least 8 people I know personally have rejoined ) .
However in this blog post I ’ll stick to talking about people who ’ve chosen Microsoft over Google .
First of all there ’s the post by Sergey Solyanik entitled Back to Microsoft where he primarily gripes about the culture and lack of career development at Google , some key excerpts are
Last week I left Google to go back to Microsoft , where I started this Monday ( and so not surprisingly , I was too busy to blog about it )
…
So why did I leave ?
There are many things about Google that are not great , and merit improvement .
There are plenty of silly politics , underperformance , inefficiencies and ineffectiveness , and things that are plain stupid .
I will not write about these things here because they are immaterial .
I did not leave because of them .
No company has achieved the status of the perfect workplace , and no one ever will .
I left because Microsoft turned out to be the right place for me .
…
Google software business is divided between producing the " eye candy " - web properties that are designed to amuse and attract people - and the infrastructure required to support them .
Some of the web properties are useful ( some extremely useful - search ) , but most of them primarily help people waste time online ( blogger , youtube , orkut , etc )
…
This orientation towards cool , but not necessarilly useful or essential software really affects the way the software engineering is done .
Everything is pretty much run by the engineering - PMs and testers are conspicuously absent from the process .
While they do exist in theory , there are too few of them to matter .
On one hand , there are beneficial effects - it is easy to ship software quickly …
On the other hand , I was using Google software - a lot of it - in the last year , and slick as it is , there 's just too much of it that is regularly broken .
It seems like every week 10 % of all the features are broken in one or the other browser .
And it 's a different 10 % every week - the old bugs are getting fixed , the new ones introduced .
This across Blogger , Gmail , Google Docs , Maps , and more
…
The culture part is very important here - you can spend more time fixing bugs , you can introduce processes to improve things , but it is very , very hard to change the culture .
And the culture at Google values " coolness " tremendously , and the quality of service not as much .
At least in the places where I worked .
…
The second reason I left Google was because I realized that I am not excited by the individual contributor role any more , and I do n't want to become a manager at Google .
The Google Manager is a very interesting phenomenon .
On one hand , they usually have a LOT of people from different businesses reporting to them , and are perennially very busy .
On the other hand , in my year at Google , I could not figure out what was it they were doing .
The better manager that I had collected feedback from my peers and gave it to me .
There was no other ( observable by me ) impact on Google .
The worse manager that I had did not do even that , so for me as a manager he was a complete no -op .
I asked quite a few other engineers from senior to senior staff levels that had spent far more time at Google than I , and they did n't know either .
I am not making this up !
Sergey is n’t the only senior engineer I know who has contributed significantly to Google projects and then decided Microsoft was a better fit for him .
Danny
Thorpe who worked on Google Gears is back at Microsoft for his second stint working on developer technologies related to Windows Live .
These are n’t the only folks I ’ve seen who ’ve decided to make the switch from the big G to the b0rg , these are just the ones who have blogs that I can point at .
Unsurprisingly , the fact that Google is n’t a good place for senior developers is also becoming clearly evident in their interview processes .
Take this post from Svetlin Nakov entitled Rejected a Program Manager Position at Microsoft Dublin - My Successful Interview at Microsoft where he concludes
My Experience at Interviews with Microsoft and Google Few months ago I was interviewed for a software engineer in Google Zurich .
If I need to compare Microsoft and Google , I should tell it in short : Google sux !
Here are my reasons for this :
1 ) Google interview were not professional .
It was like Olympiad in Informatics .
Google asked me only about algorithms and data structures , nothing about software technologies and software engineering .
It was obvious that they do not care that I had 12 years software engineering experience .
They just ignored this .
The only think Google wants to know about their candidates are their algorithms and analytical thinking skills .
Nothing about technology , nothing about engineering .
2 ) Google employ everybody as junior developer , ignoring the existing experience .
It is nice to work in Google if it is your first job , really nice , but if you have 12 years of experience with lots of languages , technologies and platforms , at lots of senior positions , you should expect higher position in Google , right ?
3 ) Microsoft have really good interview process .
People working in Microsoft are relly very smart and skillful .
Their process is far ahead of Google .
Their quality of development is far ahead of Google .
Their management is ahead of Google and their recruitment is ahead of Google .
Microsoft is Better Place to Work than Google
At my interviews I was asking my interviewers in both Microsoft and Google a lot about the development process , engineering and technologies .
I was asking also my colleagues working in these companies .
I found for myself that Microsoft is better organized , managed and structured .
Microsoft do software development in more professional way than Google .
Their engineers are better .
Their development process is better .
Their products are better .
Their technologies are better .
Their interviews are better .
Google was like a kindergarden - young and not experienced enough people , an office full of fun and entertainment , interviews typical for junior people and lack of traditions in development of high quality software products .
Based on my observations , I have theory that Google ’s big problem is that the company has n’t realized that it is n’t a startup anymore .
This disconnect between the company ’s status and it ’s perception of itself manifests in a number of ways
Startups do n’t have a career path for their employees .
Does anyone at Facebook know what they want to be in five years besides rich ?
However once riches are no longer guaranteed and the stock is n’t firing on all cylinders ( GOOG is underperforming both the NASDAQ and DOW Jones industrial average this year ) then you need to have a better career plan for your employees that goes beyond “ free lunches and all the foosball you can handle " .
There is no legacy code at a startup .
When your code base is young , it is n’t a big deal to have developers checking in new features after an overnight coding fit powered by caffeine and pizza .
For the most part , the code base should n’t be large enough or interdependent enough for one change to cause issues .
However it is practically a law of software development that the older your code gets the more lines of code it accumulates and the more closely coupled your modules become .
This means changing things in one part of the code can have adverse effects in another .
As all organizations mature they tend to add PROCESS .
These processes exist to insulate the companies from the mistakes that occur after a company gets to a certain size and can no longer trust its employees to always do the right thing .
Requiring code reviews , design specifications , black box & whitebox & unit testing , usability studies , threat models , etc are all the kinds of overhead that differentiate a mature software development shop from a “ fly by the seat of your pants ” startup .
However once you ’ve been through enough fire drills , some of those processes do n’t sound as bad as they once did .
This is why senior developers value them while junior developers do n’t since the latter have n’t been around the block enough .
There is less politics at a startup .
In any activity where humans have to come together collaboratively to achieve a goal , there will always be people with different agendas .
The more people you add to the mix , the more agendas you have to contend with .
Doing things by consensus is OK when you have to get consensus from two or three people who sit in the same hallway as you .
It ’s a totally different ball game when you need to gain it from lots of people from across a diverse company working on different projects in different regions of the world who have different perspectives on how to solve your problems .
At Google , even hiring an undergraduate candidate has to go through several layers of committees which means hiring managers need to possess some political savvy if they want to get their candidates approved .
The founders of Dodgeball quit the Google after their startup was acquired after they realized that they did n’t have the political savvy to get resources allocated to their project .
The fact that Google is having problems retaining employees is n't news , Fortune wrote an article about it just a few months ago .
The technology press makes it seem like people are ditching Google for hot startups like FriendFeed and Facebook .
However the truth is more nuanced than that .
Now that Google is just another big software company , lots of people are comparing it to other big software companies like Microsoft and finding it lacking .
Now Playing : Queen - Under Pressure ( feat .

In a submission to the UN in May , the Pentagon said that no more than eight youths , aged 13 to 17 at time of capture , were held at Guantánamo Bay .
But a prisoner list released in 2006 in response to US freedom of information act litigation names 21 inmates under 18 when they arrived .
A separate defence department admission brings the total to 22 .
Testimonies collected by the charity Reprieve , which represents 30 inmates at Guantánamo , indicate the actual number is much higher .
Guantánamo's child prisoners came from all over the world : they were Afghan , Yemeni , Saudi , Russian , Uighuri , and Canadian .
Five of them are still there .
They are : Mohammed el Gharani , aged 14 - 15 when he was seized while praying in a Karachi mosque ; Hassan bin Attash , aged 16 - 17 when seized in Pakistan , and rendered to Jordan where he endured 16 months of torture before being transferred ; Faris Muslim Al Ansari , an Afghan - Yemeni who was 17 when captured ; Mohamed Jawad , an Afghan who was 17 when seized and faces trial by military commission ; and Omar Khadr .
Saudi citizen Yasser Talal Al Zahrani , 17 when captured , joined a prison - wide hunger strike in 2005 .
He was found dead in his cell in June 2006 after apparently killing himself .
Hoping to further burnish his commander - in - chief credentials while his rival is on vacation and the president is abroad , John McCain appeared before cameras this morning to offer a lengthy primer on the crisis in the Caucasus , explain why it matters to America and outline steps that he thinks the U.S. and West should take to halt the violence .
McCain , speaking in Erie , Pennsylvania , before a bus trip of the state , also used the opportunity to send a warning shot to the Russians .
" Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe , long - term negative consequences that their government ’s actions will have for Russia ’s relationship with the U.S. and Europe , " McCain said .
And , describing the Russian assaults that have gone beyond the disputed territory and into sovereign Georgia as " Moscow 's path of violent aggression , " the GOP nominee suggested that Putin 's aim may be to overthrow the pro-U.S. government in Georgia .
" This should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world , and should draw us together in universal condemnation of Russian aggression , " McCain said .
The harder line toward the Kremlin comes as President Bush and , even more , Vice - President Cheney similarly ratchet up their criticism and as key neoconservative thinkers and McCain allies Robert Kagan and Bill Kristol take to the op - ed pages to urge action .
Full McCain statement , including his suggested responses , after the jump .
" Americans wishing to spend August vacationing with their families or watching the Olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of Georgia .
Concerns about what occurs there might seem distant and unrelated to the many other interests America has around the world .
And yet Russian aggression against Georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the United States of America .
" Georgia is an ancient country , at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia , and one of the world ’s first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion .
After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution , the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922 .
As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War , Georgia regained its independence in 1991 , but its early years were marked by instability , corruption , and economic crises .
" Following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 , a peaceful , democratic revolution took place , led by the U.S. - educated lawyer Mikheil Saakashvili .
The Rose Revolution changed things dramatically and , following his election , President Saakashvili embarked on a series of wide - ranging and successful reforms .
I ’ve met with President Saakashvili many times , including during several trips to Georgia .
" What the people of Georgia have accomplished – in terms of democratic governance , a Western orientation , and domestic reform – is nothing short of remarkable .
That makes Russia ’s recent actions against the Georgians all the more alarming .
In the face of Russian aggression , the very existence of independent Georgia – and the survival of its democratically - elected government – are at stake .
" In recent days Moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the Georgian region of South Ossetia .
Statements by Moscow that it was merely aiding the Ossetians are belied by reports of Russian troops in the region of Abkhazia , repeated Russian bombing raids across Georgia , and reports of a de facto Russian naval blockade of the Georgian coast .
Whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between Georgians and Ossetians , they in no way justify Moscow ’s path of violent aggression .
Russian actions , in clear violation of international law , have no place in 21st century Europe .
" The implications of Russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic Georgia .
Russia is using violence against Georgia , in part , to intimidate other neighbors – such as Ukraine – for choosing to associate with the West and adhering to Western political and economic values .
As such , the fate of Georgia should be of grave concern to Americans and all people who welcomed the end of a divided of Europe , and the independence of former Soviet republics .
The international response to this crisis will determine how Russia manages its relationships with other neighbors .
We have other important strategic interests at stake in Georgia , especially the continued flow of oil through the Baku - Tblisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which Russia attempted to bomb in recent days ; the operation of a critical communication and trade route from Georgia through Azerbaijan and Central Asia ; and the integrity and influence of NATO , whose members reaffirmed last April the territorial integrity , independence , and sovereignty of Georgia .
" Yesterday Georgia withdrew its troops from South Ossetia and offered a ceasefire .
The Russians responded by bombing the civilian airport in Georgia ’s capital , Tblisi , and by stepping up its offensive in Abkhazia .
This pattern of attack appears aimed not at restoring any status quo ante in South Ossetia , but rather at toppling the democratically elected government of Georgia .
This should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world , and should draw us together in universal condemnation of Russian aggression .
" Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe , long - term negative consequences that their government ’s actions will have for Russia ’s relationship with the U.S. and Europe .
It is time we moved forward with a number of steps .
" The United States and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the UN Security Council condemning Russian aggression , noting the withdrawal of Georgian troops from South Ossetia , and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgian territory .
We should move ahead with the resolution despite Russian veto threats , and submit Russia to the court of world public opinion .
" NATO ’s North Atlantic Council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to South Ossetia and the implications for NATO ’s future relationship with Russia , a Partnership for Peace nation .
NATO ’s decision to withhold a Membership Action Plan for Georgia might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia , and I urge the NATO allies to revisit the decision .
" The Secretary of State should begin high - level diplomacy , including visiting Europe , to establish a common Euro - Atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of Georgia .
With the same aim , the U.S. should coordinate with our partners in Germany , France , and Britain , to seek an emergency meeting of the G - 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis .
The visit of French President Sarkozy to Moscow this week is a welcome expression of transatlantic activism .
" Working with allied partners , the U.S. should immediately consult with the Ukrainian government and other concerned countries on steps to secure their continued independence .
This is particularly important as a number of Russian Black Sea fleet vessels currently in Georgian territorial waters are stationed at Russia ’s base in the Ukrainian Crimea .
" The U.S. should work with Azerbaijan and Turkey , and other interested friends , to develop plans to strengthen the security of the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan oil pipeline .
" The U.S. should send immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of Georgia .
Our united purpose should be to persuade the Russian government to cease its attacks , withdraw its troops , and enter into negotiations with Georgia .
We must remind Russia ’s leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values , stability and peace of that world .
World history is often made in remote , obscure countries .
It is being made in Georgia today .
It is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanity ’s progress toward respecting the values and security of free people .
" Thank you . "

" If a book about failures does n't sell , is it a success ? "
Perhaps not , but Microsoft hopes that a new $ 300 million ad campaign about the flailing Windows Vista will somehow turn it into a success with the help of comedian Jerry Seinfeld .
The campaign will be one of the largest in Microsoft 's history , and is expected to begin on September 4 .
In fact , Seinfeld may not be the only celebrity involved in the new Windows Vista campaign .
The ever - popular " people close to the situation " have informed the Wall Street Journal that Seinfeld is simply " one of the key celebrity pitchmen " that will appear alongside Bill Gates to discuss Vista 's merits .
According to the WSJ 's sources , the company has also considered Will Ferrell and Chris Rock among a multitude of other personalities , although there was no indication as to whether they had also been hired as part of the campaign .
The new ads will be spearheaded by a new agency for Microsoft and one famed for a number of Burger King ads , Crispin Porter +
Bogusky ( boy , would I hate to be at that agency right now — talk about pressure ! ) , and are expected to center around the slogan " Windows , Not Walls . "
Clearly , the idea here is to emphasize that Vista can help users connect with others and complete their tasks instead of providing obstacles .
And of course , employing well - loved celebrities that are known for their widespread appeal can't hurt either ...
Microsoft hopes , anyway .
The move comes almost two years after the operating system was first launched to the public .
Since then , there has been an unending stream reports about users and businesses downgrading from Vista back to Windows XP , spurred by any number of issues from sluggishness to numerous driver issues .
Manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo have even offered to downgrade customers to XP for free thanks to user demand .
Vista 's reputation has certainly taken a beating since its launch , and Microsoft said last month that it was finally going to do something about it .
Microsoft's VP of Windows Vista consumer marketing Brad Brooks mentioned Apple by name as being a " noisy competitor " after having taken a number of pot-shots at Vista in its own Get a Mac campaign , and vowed to strike back with its own ad campaign .
" You thought the sleeping giant was still sleeping ?
Well , we 've woken up , and it 's time to take our message forward , " Brooks said during the company 's Worldwide Partner Conference .
The new ad campaign will be part of Microsoft 's general " Vista really is better than you think ! " push that began earlier this year .
Microsoft first started advertising the " real Vista story , " and then soon followed up with the now somewhat - infamous Mojave Experiment , the Pepsi Challenge of the Windows world , where users learned that Vista is n't so bad after all .
The question remains , whether the new advertising push will end up being too little , too late .
Had a similar campaign been launched soon after Vista 's release ( and of course , if Vista 's launch was a little more smooth for some users ) , perhaps the company would n't be scrambling right now to fight back against the little guy in order to resurrect sales .
In the meantime , Apple will continue to pummel Vista with its own somewhat - annoying , but apparently effective " Get a Mac " campaign .
Will Seinfeld be able to out - funny John Hodgman and Justin Long ?
We await the results of this new front on the platform war with bated breath .
Previously undisclosed Halliburton documents obtained by The Public Record confirm that controlling the world 's second largest oil reserves was a top priority for the Bush administration .
Additionally , the deal between the Department of Defense and Halliburton unit Kellogg , Brown & Root to operate Iraq 's oil industry saved Halliburton from imminent bankruptcy .
A March 6 , 2003 internal Pentagon e-mail sent by an Army Corps of Engineers official says " action " on a multibillion - dollar Halliburton contract was " coordinated " within Cheney 's office .
The e-mail says Douglas Feith , the former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy , received authorization from then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to “ execute ” the Restore Iraqi Oil contract to Halliburton in 2002 .
Feith was one of the architects of the Iraq war who operated the Pentagon ’s Office of Special Plans that exaggerated the Iraqi threat and provided the White House with bogus information about links between Iraq and al Qaeda .
Some people -- anti-Semites , mostly -- deny that oil theft motivated the decision to invade Iraq .
All such " alternative " theories face one problem :
The oil was , in fact , stolen -- and Cheney planned the theft well in advance .
The bankruptcy threat came from lawsuits over asbestos poisoning , which led to a form of cancer called mesothelioma .
Those ultra-lucrative big money suits are the reason why lawyers have littered the landscape with so many ads trolling for mesothelioma sufferers .
At one time , certain law firms would pay as much as ten dollars whenever someone clicked on a Google ad dealing with mesothelioma .
( Most Google ads bring in pennies per click . )
For a while , some bloggers went out of their way to mention the word " mesothelioma " in their posts , since Google 's software automatically matches ads to certain key words .
Words like " mesothelioma . "
Mesothelioma , mesothelioma , mesothelioma .
( Kidding .
I do n't even get the Google checks anymore , which were always quite miniscule , and I could n't care less if they canceled the Adsense program on me .
Let 's get back to our story . )
Right there , you have sufficient grounds for immediate impeachment of Dick Cheney .
Not just impeachment : A RICO suit .
According to Japanese news site IT Media , Metal Gear Solid 4 has been knocked down to number two by PSP game Super Robot Taisen A Portable .
During its first week , MGS4 sold 476,334 copies — so says Enterbrain sales data .
In its second week ( June 16th to June 22nd ) , IT Media states the game 's sales dropped to 68,000 copies .
Still , an impressive number , but not impressive enough to overtake Super Robot Taisen A Portable , which went on sale June 19th .
Good news : MGS4's sales have now topped 500,000 copies in Japan .
That 's way better than a punch in the nards .

Rising North Sea oil production was a significant factor in keeping oil prices under control in the 1970s , 80s and 90s .
Production peaked at 6.4 million barrels per day in 2000 and since then , declining North Sea Oil production is one significant reason that oil prices are now rising exponentially .
The UK
Crude oil , condensate and natural gas liquids ( C+C+NGL ) production .
Source BP statistical review of world energy published 2007 with data up to 2006 .
UK oil production has two peaks and it is vitally important to understand that the reason for peak 1 in 1986 and peak 2 in 1999 are quite different , since many observers seem to think that production may begin to rise again as it did in the early 90 s ..
Rising North Sea Oil production contributed to the oil price crash of 1986 .
Deferred investment resulting from this is the principal reason for decline in 1987 .
This was made worse by the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion of 1988 .
These are above ground factors .
The all time high of 2.9 million bpd was reached in 1999 .
Decline that began in 2000 is caused by resource depletion and exhaustion of reservoir energy .
It is no longer possible to bring on new small fields fast enough to compensate for natural decline and the trend that has now existed for 8 years will likely continue down as indicated .
From riches to rags
The UK was an oil exporting country from 1980 to 2005 .
This had significant positive impact upon the trade balance .
In 2006 production dropped below consumption levels and the UK once again became an oil importing country and will be an oil importer from now on .
High prices will cause consumption to fall through conservation and pricing poor people out of the energy market .
Thus it is difficult to forecast what the future consumption , production and price curves will look like .
But by way of example , importing 200,000 bpd at $ 138 per barrel will add $ 10 billion per annum to the trade deficit .
Throughout this article referring to the North Sea is a simplification .
Whilst most UK oil production does come from the North Sea , there are significant fields off south England , in the Irish Sea and on the Atlantic margin , west of Shetland .
Norway also has significant production from the Atlantic margin off mid and north Norway .
The data from these regions are all lumped together .
Norway
Crude oil , condensate and natural gas liquids ( C+C+NGL ) production .
Source BP statistical review of world energy published 2007 with data up to 2006 .
Norwegian oil production is shaping up to have a classic Hubbert bell shape curve .
Production peaked in 2001 at 3.4 million bpd .
As in the UK , the majority of Norway 's giant world class fields have been developed and are in decline .
The oil is gone .
Smaller fields being developed now are not large enough to compensate for decline which will likely continue as indicated .
Norway with a population of only 4.6 million , exports most of its oil .
These exports are falling
With a vast continental shelf that extends along the Atlantic margin and into the Barents Sea , the prospect of new discoveries are much better in Norway than in the UK .
The North Sea
Crude oil , condensate and natural gas liquids ( C+C+NGL ) production .
Source BP statistical review of world energy published 2007 with data up to 2006 .
Adding the small amount of production from Denmark to that for Norway and the UK provides this integrated picture for North Sea Oil production .
Production peaked at 6.4 million bpd in 2000 and decline will likely continue as indicated .
With falling North Sea oil production Europe will have to import more oil each year in competition with other regions ( the USA and China ) from a decreasing number of countries that actually have oil for export .
This is one of the main reasons that the oil price is rising exponentially .
A note on reserves figures
The remaining reserves figures reported above are for the discovered and developed resource .
There may be some incremental growth in these numbers with new discoveries and deployment of Enhanced Oil Recovery ( EOR ) technologies .
These are unlikely to make a huge difference , even if an additional 10 billion barrels are produced between 2030 and 2050 .
What matters are declining flow rates now that will likely persist for the foreseeable future .
Technology
Horizontal drilling , 3D seismic and dynamically positioned production ships have been deployed for over a decade .
The incremental oil these technologies produce are embedded in the production data .
Simply continuing to do what you are already doing will not change the decline trends .
The one technology that is not widely deployed that would add some incremental oil is CO2 miscible gas flooding of reservoirs .
This would not change the picture very much but would reduce the decline rate and extend field life .
The North Sea desperately needs this technology deployed .
The UK government failed to support the flagship BP Boddam - Miller scheme and the Miller Field is now shut down .
Indifference and ignorance on the part of the British and other OECD governments is another reason the oil price is rising exponentially .
Economists
Steadily rising oil price since 1999 has had little discernible impact upon declining UK oil production .
Where economists want to see a positive correlation between production and price the reality in a post peak oil world is the exact opposite - a negative correlation .
Annual oil price and production data from the BP statistical review of world energy
There are many economists involved in running UK and European government agencies .
Classical economics thinking is that high price will stimulate production and reduce consumption providing an amiable equilibrium between supply and demand .
In natural resource exploitation this rule works during the exploration and production build up where high price may stimulate fruitful exploration effort and new field development projects .
However , once past peak , these rules break down and do not apply .
It seems there are no economists around that understand this simple point .
Once a resource is gone , used up , no amount of money in the world will bring it back .
Economists who advise that production will somehow do a U - turn as prices rise are doing untold harm .
This false hope , optimistic message grasped by politicians , is blocking the action required to mitigate for peak oil .
This is another reason oil now costs over $ 130 per barrel .
Vigorous expansion of all viable alternative energy sources may reduce demand for oil and that will bring down the oil price .
High price may slow the decline of the North Sea a bit but it cannot invent fields to be discovered or alter the rules of reservoir physics that dictate decline .
Since high price will not stimulate much new production in mature provinces like the North Sea the only route available is demand destruction .
The oil price will stop rising when gasoline gets too expensive and we stop using it .
31 Billion barrels per year
With production running at 86 million barrels per day , that means we are consuming 31 billion barrels of oil every year .
It is a sobering thought that by the time the Sun sets upon the whole of the North Sea , it will have produced enough oil to fuel planet Earth for just 2 years .
To keep the oil party going we need to discover a " new North Sea " every two years and the last time we managed that rate of discovery was in the late 1980s , 20 years ago .
We have been living off savings since then , and the bank balance is running down .
It is not possible to get an oil overdraft or to create an energy instrument to magic oil and energy out of nothing .
There is no choice other than to reduce our oil consumption and it is much better that we do this in a controlled way than to let high energy prices and inflation rip through our economies - which is exactly what is happening now .

Investment in U.S. commercial real estate fell 70 % in the first quarter from a year earlier as banks curtailed credit , the National Assn. of Realtors said Wednesday .
Investors spent $ 48.2 billion on commercial properties in the period , down from $ 157.8 billion in the year - earlier period , the trade group said .
“ Slow economic growth is lowering demand for commercial space , mostly in the office and industrial sectors , ” said Lawrence Yun , the Chicago - based association ’s chief economist .
“ Despite the slowdown , the commercial real estate market is in much better shape compared to conditions during the 2001 recession . ”

About a dozen members of the Minutemen , a group that patrols the U.S. - Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out , stood on the San Francisco City Hall steps Wednesday to decry the city 's sanctuary policy and demand that Mayor Gavin Newsom resign .
They waved signs calling Newsom , District Attorney Kamala Harris and William Siffermann , head of the city 's Juvenile Probation Department , " accessories to murder " for the city 's now - reversed policy of not turning over illegal immigrant youths arrested for felonies to federal authorities for possible deportation .
One Salvadoran immigrant who benefited from that policy , Edwin Ramos , has been charged with three counts of murder for the June 22 shootings of 48 - year - old Tony Bologna and his sons Michael , 20 , and Matthew , 16 .
Ramos , now 21 , was convicted for an assault and an attempted robbery when he was 17 , but city officials did not turn him over to federal immigration authorities .
" We are asking for the resignation of Mayor Gavin Newsom for his endorsement and support of sanctuary city status that led to the horrific slayings of the Bologna family , " said Minutemen founder Jim Gilchrist .
Newsom has since reversed the policy , and the city is turning illegal youths arrested for felonies over to the federal government .
City officials have said the policy was never intended to harbor felons .
Instead , the policy is intended as a pragmatic measure to encourage crime victims and witnesses who happen to be illegal immigrants to come forward .
It also allows them to access city services , such as going to public health clinics or enrolling their children in school , without being questioned about their immigration status .
" It 's not the first time I 've been asked to resign - it's not the 20th or 30th time since I 've been mayor , " Newsom said Wednesday .
" Minutemen are not the kind of people I look to for advice or counsel in terms of my performance . "
During the protest , hundreds of immigrants ' rights advocates stood on the sidewalk yelling back at the Minutemen : " Smash the border , smash the Minutemen ! "
Ricardo Avila , a 30 - year - old who lives in the Excelsior neighborhood , pointed out that scores of people are killed in San Francisco every year , and said the Minutemen were unfairly using the Bologna killings to make their point .
" People are killed by people , undocumented or not , " Avila said .
" But they choose a specific case to exploit a family for a cause . "
Police Lt. Michael
Slade said two people - both on the pro-immigrant side - had been arrested , one for allegedly spitting on a sheriff 's deputy and one for throwing an unknown liquid at the City Hall steps .
The former was cited and released , while the latter was booked into county jail .
Also on Wednesday , San Francisco Superior Court Judge Lucy Kelly McCabe refused to impose a gag order in the Ramos case .
His lawyer had argued that media coverage of the case - specifically , a story in The Chronicle revealing Ramos ' previous crimes as a juvenile - had violated his client 's fair trial rights .

Conclusion
On August 22 , Dmitry Jemerov , development lead at JetBrains , provided answers to InfoQ 's questions regarding the latest release of IntelliJ IDEA .
The stand out changes that can be found in IntelliJ IDEA 8 are listed on the JetBrains site , such as : The list contains other items and additional information not included above .
Next , the answers to some of InfoQ 's questions are provided .
What are the stand out changes made for IntelliJ IDEA 8 , besides the release notes page ?
Internally , the biggest change was a refactoring to extract a common foundation out of IntelliJ IDEA , which allows us to build other products on the same code base .
The IntelliJ IDEA platform is already used by MPS , and we have a number of not yet announced products in the pipeline which are also built on the same platform .
What level of Flex integration is provided ?
Is it comparable to Java ?
For Flex , we are focusing only on code editing support ( a visual designer for MXML is completely out of scope for us for the time being ) .
Of course , the Java support has been in development much longer and is currently far more advanced , but the Flex support is following along the same lines .
Some of the recently introduced features for Flex are auto - import and optimize imports , generation of constructors and accessors , and so on .
A debugger for Flex has also been added in version 8 , and we 're also working on seamless compilation support ( so that you no longer have to use
Ant tasks for compiling your project , as you did with IDEA 7 ) .
What level of Python and Scala support are available ?
First of all , I 'd like to note that neither Python nor Scala will be bundled with the final release of IntelliJ IDEA 8 .
The plugins are in development , but by the time the final version of IDEA 8 is released , they 'll be available in beta quality as separate downloads from the plugin manager .
( The Scala plugin is actually already available : http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?id=1347
Once again , we 're following the same basic sequence of steps as for other languages we support .
For Scala , the main challenge is to provide a full implementation of the type system , which is necessary for full code completion .
That 's where we 're focusing our efforts at the moment .
Other than that , most of the common language support features are already in : syntax and error highlighting , formatter , structure view , auto - import , implement / override and so on .
Python is a dynamic language , which brings a significantly different set of challenges , but the feature set will end up quite similar .
A debugger is also planned for Python .
Any plans on making the IntelliJFX plugin a first class citzen within the IDE ( such as Java , Groovy , etc ) ?
We 're taking a " wait and see " approach for the moment .
From our point of view , Flex is a much stronger contender on the RIA platform market compared to JavaFX for now , and , given that our resources are limited , that 's where we 're focusing our efforts .
But it 's definitely possible that JavaFX will be supported in IDEA 9 provided that it sees sufficient adoption .
IntelliJ IDEA 8 brings integraton with Microsoft's Team Foundation Server , are there plans to assist in the development of the Atlassian plugin and provide first class integration with their products ?
Actually Atlassian has allocated much more resources for the development of the IntelliJ IDEA plugin than we could ever hope to , so I do n't think that any additional investment is required from our side .
We do keep in touch with the developers of the plugin and provide advice and help regarding the usage of the IntelliJ IDEA APIs .
Will IntelliJ provide plugins or support for project management techniques ( i.e. agile , rup , xp , etc ) ?
Some plugins for Eclipse ( as an example ) provide tracking sprints , creating stories , displaying progress charts , etc .
We do not think that an IDE plugin should be a primary interface for such a tool .
An IDE is primarily a tool for working with the source code of the project , and the sprints and stories have a very loose relationship to the code .
Even if we do start working on a project management tool at some later time , most likely it will be primarily a Web - based tool rather than a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA .
When can users expect IntelliJ IDEA 8 to be out of testing and final ?
The final release of IntelliJ IDEA 8 is planned for end of fall 2008 .
Will existing users be able to download the IntelliJ IDEA 8 installer and simply upgrade ?
IntelliJ IDEA 8 will not be a free upgrade ( the users will need to pay the usual upgrade fee or evaluate the new version for 30 days ) , but the installation procedure for the new version will be as easy as ever .
What can users expect in the future for IntelliJ IDEA ?
We can't announce any definite plans for versions beyond IDEA 8 yet .
One thing that can definitely be expected is full support for Java EE 6 .
Of course , the new language features of Java SE 7 will also be supported , as soon as it's clear enough which of the JSRs being discussed are going into the release and which are left out .
Other than that , you can be sure that the usual stuff will be there - more languages supported , more frameworks , new refactorings and inspections , and so on .
JetBrains continues to focus on providing an IDE that ranks at the top of the list for developers who not only work with Java but Groovy , Python , JavaScript , Flex , Scala and others .
Some things to keep an eye out for include better support for JavaFX , and possibly a web based tool for project management related tasks .

Drilling in ANWR
2008-07-04
Are people still talking about ANWR ?
Because this is the thing to remember :
With respect to the world oil price impact , projected ANWR oil production constitutes between 0.4 and 1.2 percent of total world oil consumption in 2030 , based on the low and high resource cases , respectively .
Consequently , ANWR oil production is not projected to have a large impact on world oil prices .
Relative to the AEO2008 reference case , ANWR oil production is projected to have its largest oil price reduction impacts as follows : a reduction in low - sulfur , light ( LSL ) crude oil prices of $ 0.41 per barrel ( 2006 dollars ) in 2026 in the low oil resource case , $ 0.75 per barrel in 2025 in the mean oil resource case , and $ 1.44 per barrel in 2027 in the high oil resource case .
Assuming that world oil markets continue to work as they do today , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) could neutralize any potential price impact of ANWR oil production by reducing its oil exports by an equal amount .
Source : EIA Analysis of Crude Oil Production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Translation : drilling in ANWR will provide only 1.2 percent of the world 's oil in the best case scenario , an increase in supply that OPEC can compete with by reducing its exports .
And that 's in 10 years .
But what , you say , if we set aside all that oil just for use in the United States ?
More info :
In all three ANWR resource cases , ANWR crude oil production begins in 2018 and grows during most of the projection period before production begins to decline .
In the mean oil resource case , ANWR oil production peaks at 780,000 barrels per day in 2027 .
The low - resource - case production peaks at 510,000 barrels per day in 2028 , while the high - resource - case production peaks at 1,450,000 barrels per day in 2028 .
To put this into perspective : total US consumption is 20,687,000 barrels a day .
( Source : EIA Oil Facts ) ANWR drilling would therefore represent only 2.5 to 7 % of total oil production in the United States , and that is its peak in 2028 .
And the name of the game is gas prices , yes ?
So if they had been allowed to drill in ANWR , that might 've lowered the prices , what , 20 or 30 cents ?
And that 's assuming it was all put into direct US use by the federal government , Venezuela - style .
This is all not to mention that oil producers in the US have 68 million acres that is already set aside for drilling but is not being used .
So if we 're in such a rush to start drilling everything in sight , why are n't these people being asked ?
So why is ( was ? ) this a big deal for Republicans ?
I would suppose that simple politics is the answer : they can frame the issue as if Democrats are trying to protect the stupid environment like little girly liberals instead of saving America from financial crisis .
The other , more cynical view , is that the Republicans are stumping for oil companies to add more onto their bottom line .
I 'm actually not that cynical , I think it 's the former reason : the other day , I heard Sean Hannity screaming that we ought to let the federal government drill in ANWR and sell the oil directly to the people .
Big government controlling oil ?
That does n't sound like the Sean Hannity I know .
In conclusion , the media has absolutely failed the public in this regard .
I hope that people figure out how stupid the whole debate was , because this issue seems like it 's disappearing fast .
This entry may already be old news .
Four - dollar gasoline has the pushed the price of energy to the top of the American mind .
But the price would go a lot higher if someone applied pressure to one of the key chokepoints in the global energy pipeline .
That 's the message from New Scientist , which this week examines vulnerabilities in the worldwide oil supply chain .
The magazine 's message is dire : A lot depends on oil , and oil depends on a few key transport and processing locations .
" Most industrialised countries keep an emergency reserve as a first line of defence , but in the face of worldwide panic buying this may not be enough , " writes Ian Sample in the New Scientist article ( behind a paywall ) .
" Countries in which the oil runs out face transport meltdown , wreaking havoc with international trade and domestic necessities such as food distribution , emergency services and daily commerce .
Without oil everything stops . "
The global energy supply chain is incredibly complex , but much of it is channeled through a few key points ( see below ) .
Disrupt traffic or processing in those points , and terrorists or other adversaries could cause oil to rise as high as $ 250 a barrel , up from today 's crude record - setting level of $ 143 a barrel .
The New Scientist report is based on scenarios from U.S. national security role - playing games .
Those simulations suggest that even the perception of a supply chain disruption could drive a run on oil that would have disastrous consequences .
The latest version of the simulation , which is called " Oil Shockwave , " was run last November with former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin leading the exercise .
According to New Scientist , that exercise ( .pdf ) found that " a simulated 1.2 percent disruption in global oil supplies caused prices to rise by 75 percent ( from $ 95 to $ 165 ) in just four months . "
Given that the price of oil is now $ 143 , that tiny decrease in liquid fuel availability could drive oil past $ 250 .
Below , we detail the five nodes in the energy distribution network that , if seriously disturbed by accident or design , would make a mess of a once - orderly global system .
Are there others ?
Let us know in the comments .
__1. Enbridge pipelines __( map ) :
This array of crude pipelines pump 2.2 million barrels of oil into the United States per day , which represents about one - fifth of the country 's daily imports .
Back in November , an accidental explosion in Minnesota shut down the pipeline , effectively halting one - fifth of U.S. oil imports for days .
( A tiny piece of the pipeline is pictured above . )
__2 . Abqaiq processing facility ( pictured above , map ) : __The
Abqaiq processing facility , located near a Saudi megafield of the same name , desulphurizes two - thirds of the country 's oil .
That 's already made it the target of one thwarted attack in 2006 .
Over the past six months , Saudi police have rounded up 700 people accused of plotting oil - related attacks , according to an AFP article this week .
A variety of other processing facilities and refineries could be major targets , like Venezuelan and South Korean refineries , but Abqaiq would be a mighty large wrench to throw into the global machine .
3. Ras Tanura offshore oil terminal ( Google Earth map ) __ : __An incredible 10 percent of the world 's oil goes through the oil terminal at this huge Saudi ARAMCO facility in the Persian Gulf , according to the New Scientist article .
4. The Strait of Hormuz and 5 .
The Strait of Malacca : Almost 20
percent of total daily oil production , 16 million barrels , goes through the Straight of Hormuz , which links the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea .
At its narrowest point , near Dubai , it 's only about 20 miles wide .
The
Straight of Malacca , between Sumatra and Singapore , is even narrower at less than two miles , yet 15 million barrels of oil ( 18 percent of global oil ) pass through it .
The New Scientist describes a chilling scenario to jam these key points in the global infrastructure .
" One scenario being suggested is that hijackers might commandeer a liquid natural gas tanker plying one of the shipping routes , load it with explosives and use it to ram an oil tanker .
If this floating bomb produced a burning oil slick , it could render the passage impassable for months , tipping the global economy into crisis as alternative routes would fail to make up the lost supplies . "
Those are just five spots in the world 's energy infrastructure that could be vulnerable to attack or disruption .
There are plenty of other important pieces of the energy economy we could be looking at like :
__What other energy nodes , in the US or abroad , should we be worried about ?

It changed the way divorce cases of the very rich were dealt with , and he said it would have led to Mrs Williams getting half of her 67 - year - old husband 's assets , much more than the £ 1.4 m she actually received .
Economic conservatives cringe at Mike Huckabee .
Conservative evangelicals like Huckabee but wince at Mitt Romney .
Gay rights activists are trying to rule out Sam Nunn .
The women ’s movement is wary of several prominent Democrats who support abortion restrictions .
That ’s the minefield Barack Obama and John McCain are tiptoeing across as they choose their vice presidential nominees .
The goal of each : to find a running mate who adds appeal to the ticket -- while steering around the candidates who would leave key groups angry and ready to abandon the party .
The tension is most pronounced among Republicans , a reflection of long - standing fault lines between the party ’s social conservatives and the faction that focuses more on economic issues .
Conservative evangelicals , in particular , have a history of animosity toward McCain , the presumed GOP presidential nominee .
Looking for a sign of commitment to their causes , many of them have urged McCain to choose Huckabee , a longtime pastor and former Arkansas governor with solid antiabortion credentials .
Some are actively campaigning against Romney , who as Massachusetts governor had a mixed record on abortion and gay rights .

At issue for McCain is how much muscle social conservatives will put into helping his campaign .
“ The question is not whether social conservatives will hold their noses and vote for McCain ; it ’s will they knock on doors and plant yard signs , ” said Gary Glenn , president of the American Family Assn. of Michigan .
For Obama , the presumed Democratic presidential nominee , one key question is whether he will pick a running mate who might make up for his lack of foreign policy experience .
That has led some to point to former Georgia Sen .
Nunn , a military expert .
But Nunn is suspect among gay rights activists , because in Congress he opposed measures to expand gay rights .
Another consideration for Obama is whether to reach out to frustrated supporters of his former rival , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , by putting a woman or even Clinton herself on the ticket .
Further complicating his decision , Obama has heard complaints from women ’s advocates about possible No. 2 contenders -- such as Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware -- whom they do not see as strong supporters of abortion rights .
“ That is causing a lot of heartburn ” for abortion rights supporters , said Kim Gandy , president of the National Organization for Women .

The decisions by Obama and McCain will be determined by a wide range of considerations , including personal chemistry and regional appeal .
But while the candidates are looking at what qualities might help the ticket , they are hearing from various factions about potential disqualifying factors .
Many evangelical conservatives have bridled at reports indicating that Romney is a strong contender for the No. 2 Republican slot .
Those reports have arisen frequently , because Romney ’s business background is seen as complementing McCain ’s resume , which is light on economics .
“ We do n’t have any faith that he will be consistent on the moral issues we really care about , ” said Mike Fracassa , a vice president of Ohio Christian University , about Romney .
Last month , dozens of evangelical leaders met in Denver to talk politics .
The group drafted a letter , which was hand - delivered to McCain , urging him to name Huckabee .

“ Putting Gov . Huckabee on your ticket will immediately excite , mobilize and activate a key grass - roots constituency that is essential to your success , ” the letter said .
Janet Folger , who heads a conservative group called Faith 2 Action , was more blunt .
“ Mitt Romney would be a disaster , ” she said in an interview .
“ Mike Huckabee would be a home run . ”
Economic conservatives and tax - cut advocates see things differently .
Pat Toomey , president of the anti-tax Club for Growth , has criticized Huckabee for raising taxes as governor of Arkansas .
“ Huckabee would be a disaster , ” said Toomey .
“ It would thoroughly alienate economic conservatives . ”

Many of the GOP ’s business allies have no litmus test for McCain ’s running mate and take a more pragmatic view of the decision .
“ I care more about winning than anything else , ” said one business lobbyist , who asked not to be named because his organization is neutral in the campaign .
He said that former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge would be a big asset in an election in which his home state is crucial , but acknowledged that his support for abortion rights would make his nomination problematic .
“ The right wing would go crazy , ” the lobbyist said .
One of the riskiest choices McCain could make would be to tap Sen.
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , an independent who in Congress is aligned with Democrats , but who is supporting McCain and has been hawkish on the Iraq war .
Advertisement
Grover Norquist , head of Americans for Tax Reform , called Lieberman “ completely unacceptable , ” because he is liberal on most other issues .
For Obama , the choice of a running mate has the potential to help or hurt his effort to win over women who supported Clinton .
When he met last week with female political activists in Washington , one participant drew applause when she suggested that Obama tap Clinton as his running mate .
Some Clinton backers , however , seem resigned to her not being chosen .
Vote Both , a group established earlier this year to pressure Obama to put Clinton on his ticket , shut down its effort last week .
Gandy , of the National Organization for Women , said that Obama will take a great political risk if he does not name a woman , such as Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona or Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas , to energize female voters .
Furthermore , Gandy has told Obama advisors of her dismay that his short list reportedly includes so many men with mixed records on abortion .

Although they support the constitutional right to abortion , Biden , Bayh and Kaine all supported a ban on “ partial - birth ” abortions .
“ My fear is that there would be a lot of women , and any number is too many , who would say , ‘ I think I will stay home ’ ” on election day , said Gandy .
Gay rights advocates worry about reports that Obama was considering asking former senator Nunn to be his running mate .
As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Nunn resisted efforts to allow gays to serve in the military , and he voted against a bill to ban job discrimination against gay men and lesbians .
“ It would be . . . a real problem if he were to pick Sam Nunn , ” said Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , a gay rights advocacy group .
“ The choice of a running mate for anyone running for president says a great deal about their decision - making and about their values . ”

Latino high school students use drugs and attempt suicide at higher rates than their black and white classmates , according to a new federal survey that shows the continuation of a disturbing trend .
The study is the latest in a series of surveys of high school students every two years .
The new report found that black and white students are reporting less sexual activity than in years past , but there was no decline among Latinos .
In addition , Latino students were more likely than either blacks or whites to attempt suicide , ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol , or use cocaine , heroin or ecstasy .
Latinos also most often drank alcohol on school property , were offered or sold illegal drugs , and occasionally skipped school because they feared for their safety , according to the 2007 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Experts were unable to come up with an explanation for why Latino behavior trends differed .
However , they speculated that school environments many Latinos face may differ considerably from what adolescents of other races encounter .
Earlier research found that Latino and black students more commonly attend highly segregated schools than white or Asian students .
" There 's tremendous segregation in our schools , " said Howell Wechsler , director of adolescent and school health for the CDC .
He said he was very troubled that Latino teens had not improved in certain risk areas at the same rate as blacks and whites .
The finding comes from a survey of about 14,000 high school students that has been conducted every other year since 1991 .
Questionnaires go to students in grades 9 - 12 in public and private high schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
Researchers got parental permission for each student who participated .
The survey did not collect information on parent income or education .
Some experts say those factors also can be a strong indicator of a youth 's health behavior and academic achievement .
Adolescents cannot always be counted on to tell the truth about their sexual exploits , drug use or other risky behaviors .
But CDC officials say they take many steps to secure accurate responses : Participation is confidential , kids are spaced apart when answering the questions and teachers do not hover .
The survey asks about a wide variety of behaviors , including sunscreen use , seat - belt avoidance , drug use and suicide attempts .
Among other findings , the study noted that the proportion of students who said they recently smoked a cigarette was the same as the proportion who recently used marijuana - 20 percent .
Like the 2005 survey , the 2007 data showed higher rates of risk - taking by Latinos in several areas .
One example : About 10 to 11 percent of Latino students said they attempted suicide , compared with around 7 percent of whites and 8 percent of blacks .
However , whites reported the highest rates of smoking and heavy drinking , while blacks reported the highest rates of obesity , violence and sexual activity .
One striking behavior in which black students fared the worst was television watching .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours of daily TV viewing a day for kids .
Physical activity is needed to develop mental and social skills and help prevent obesity , and TV violence has been associated with more aggressive behavior in children who watch a lot of it .
Overall , TV watching by high school students has been generally steady , with about 35 percent watching three or more hours a day .
But the new report shows that about 63 percent of black students watched three or more hours a day .
In contrast , 43 percent of Latino students and 27 percent of whites watched too much TV , the report concluded .
" We do n't see that kind of gap " in almost any other measurement of risky health behaviors , Wechsler said .
Well , this certainly wo n’t lead to any insufferable late - night smugness :
“ The results of the new Pew Survey on News Consumption ( taken every two years and released this afternoon ) suggest that viewers of the ‘ fake news ’ programs ‘ The Daily Show ‘ and ‘ The Colbert Report ’ are more knowledgeable about current events ( as judged by three test questions ) than watchers of ‘ real ’ cable news shows hosted by Lou Dobbs , Bill O’Reilly and Larry King , among others — as well as average consumers of NBC , ABC , Fox News , CNN , C - SPAN and daily newspapers , ” reports Greg Mitchell at Editor and Publisher .
“ The national average for answering the three questions was only 18 percent , ” Mitchell writes .
“ But 34 percent of The Colbert Report fans got them right , with 30 percent of The Daily Show viewers doing so — even though the two Comedy Central shows draw younger audiences which generally scored less well on the ‘ test ’ than older viewers / readers . ”
The whole Pew report is pretty fascinating , but one wonders if the 3 - question “ test ” is an accurate barometer of current - event knowledge .
Here is an excerpt from the full report :
About half of Americans ( 53 percent ) can correctly identify the Democrats as the party that has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives .
In February 2007 , shortly after the Democrats gained control of the House after a dozen years of G.O.P. rule , many more people ( 76 percent ) knew the Democrats held the majority .
The public is less familiar with the secretary of state ( Condoleezza Rice ) and the prime minister of Great Britain ( Gordon Brown ) .
About four - in - ten ( 42 percent ) can name Rice as the current secretary of state .
The public ’s ability to identify Rice has not changed much over recent years :
In April 2006 and December 2004 , shortly before she was sworn in , 43 percent could correctly identify her .
The prime minister of Great Britain is not well known among the public .
Just more than a quarter ( 28 percent ) can correctly identify Gordon Brown as the leader of Great Britain .
Overall , 18 percent of the public is able to correctly answer all three political knowledge questions , while a third ( 33 percent ) do not know the answer to any of the questions .
“ I ’ll admit , I ’m torn about how humiliating this is to the nation overall , ” adds Carpetbagger Report ’s Steve Benen .
“ For the typical American not to know Gordon Brown strikes me as only mildly distressing — Brown has only been Prime Minister for about a year , and most of the public was probably more familiar with Tony Blair .
But one - in - three Americans got all of the questions wrong .
For all the talk about the Democratic Congress , barely half the country knows there ’s a Democratic majority . ”

There are a lot of would be entrepreneurs out there with a great idea , but are afflicted with Business Plan Paralysis .
Instead of shipping product , they 're " working " on their plan , doing more " research " , or " thinking about it " .
I think the current literature on entrepreneurship overcomplicates things .
Read the guides at Entrepreneur.com or bplans.com , and you run into 50 page documents with charts , spreadsheets , and financial projections accounting for every dime .
And if these sources are to be believed , your business plan must also have serious sounding sections like Executive Summary , Competitive Analysis , and Financial Projections .
No wonder would be entrepreneurs stall at this step .
The good news is that you do n't need that kind of plan right now .
Right now , all you need is an internal working plan to get you going .
And to get that working plan , all you need to do is answer these four simple questions .
What is your product or service ?
Who are your customers ?
When will things get done ?
When are bills due and when do you get paid ?
1 . What is your product or service ?
What are customers going to give you money for ?
Every company exists to create new value .
That 's what customers are paying for .
What do you do to earn your income ?
A few examples :
The service provider ( barber , accountant , dry cleaner ) creates value by providing a service you 're willing to pay for .
A retailer ( hardware store , car dealership , eBay seller , etc ) creates value by connecting consumers and product manufacturers .
Retailers buy inventory in bulk , split it up , showcase it , market it , teach customers how to use it , deal with returns , etc .
For that work , they charge a markup on the product .
A blogger ( or other website publisher ) creates value by providing information and a forum for people to discuss stuff .
If the content and community is great , there 's a lot of value ( lots of readers and page views ) .
The more readers , the more the publisher can charge for advertising .
So back to the fundamental question .
What do you do ?
What 's the value your business is creating ?
Equivalent sections in a fancy plan : Executive Summary , About Our Product / Service , Company Description
2 . Who are your customers ?
2a .
Who 's going to give you money ?
Who are you marketing to ?
Write down all the potential customer profiles you think you will have .
Your customers may come from multiple sources or have different needs .
For example , if you 're opening a local brick & mortar store , you might have walk - in customers , regulars , and online customers .
For content publishers , you 're serving your readers ( every page view or feed subscription is a " sale " ) , but you 're also serving advertisers or affiliated vendors ( the people who actually give you money ) .
If you want to flesh this out even further , you can create customer profiles and even customer personas with names and personalities .
Marketing and selling to each type / group will require different strategies and tactics .
The first step though , is to identify these groups .
2b . How many potential customers are there ?
There 's no point selling a product if there are only a handful of people interested .
How big is the group of people who might potentially buy from you ?
You can look at your competitors to get an idea of the market size .
e Bay sellers can look at the number of feedback received in the last 1 , 3 , and 6 months .
Bloggers ( content publishers ) can look at the number of page views and / or feed subscribers of other sites in their niche .
To determine a website 's reach and traffic , you can also use third party trackers like Alexa , Compete , HitWise , Quantcast , or comScore .
If you need more extensive data , you can find a lot of information via Google .
There are a lot of surveys and research papers available for free .
You can also find teaser releases from research companies looking to sell you more in - depth analysis .
For analysis of public companies , check out Hoover 's , LexisNexis , and S&P 's industry surveys .
2 c . Who are your competitors ?
Imagine you 're one of the customer types you described in answer 2b .
Other than your new business , where else could these customers go to get the product / service ?
Equivalent sections in a fancy plan : Market Analysis , Target Market , Primary ( and Secondary ) Markets , Marketing Strategy , Marketing Plan , Competitive Analysis / Advantage , Market Size
3 . When will things get done ?
Given the specific customers you describe above , how do you plan on reaching them ?
Will you buy ads , encourage referrals from existing customers , create a website ?
This is when we get to the nitty - gritty .
Write down concrete action steps and scheduled milestones .
3a .
What does your company look like in 1 , 3 , and 5 years ?
Answer this quickly .
It 's okay to " dream " a bit here .
Three to five years is a long time away , and the point of this article is to get you past planning mode and into execution mode .
So dream a little bit .
Once you 're actually executing , you 'll have a better ( more realistic ) idea of what to aim for in 3 to 5 years .
3b . In the next 3 , 6 , 12 months , what are specific milestones you want to accomplish ?
Be as specific as possible , without getting bogged down in too much detail .
Otherwise , you 'll be stuck in the dreaming mode for another 6 months instead of being in startup mode .
For milestones farther out , just jot down general goals .
A common sticking point for new entrepreneurs is trying to plan for every possible scenario 12 or 24 months out .
That 's impossible unless you can see the future .
( If you can , drop me an email .
I 've got work for you . )
3 c . What are specific next steps you need accomplish to reach the first milestone ?
What can you do today ?
For the first milestone ( within 3 months ) , what are tasks that need to be done ?
For each task , what is the next action step ?
Who 's responsibile for doing it ?
When will it be done ?
The more specific and actionable your answers , the more likely you 'll move this project along .
Write down some actionable tasks you can knock out today , this week , and this month .
Equivalent sections in a fancy plan : Implementation Strategy , Milestones and Timeline , Exit Strategy
4 . When are bills due and when do you get paid ?
4a .
How much money will it cost to make your product or provide your service ?
Write down all the things you might have to pay for while launching or running your business .
Your expenses will fall into three categories : fixed expenses , variable expenses , and capital expenses .
Fixed expenses are the things you have to pay for every month , whether you make one sale or 10,000 sales .
Hosting , rent , employees are examples of fixed costs .
Add up your fixed expenses , and you have the baseline cost of running your business .
Variable expenses are tied to your sales volume .
If you 're moving product , what is your cost per item ?
These are the expenses tied to sales .
Performance bonuses , sales commissions , pay - per- click advertising are examples .
Captial expenses are one time purchases you need to make .
Web design , books , a computer are examples .
Some of these expenses will come before you even open your doors .
That is your startup costs .
Using this spreadsheet ( XLS ) , plan your startup 's first year expenses and income .
What month will you break even ?
That is , when will you make back all the time and money you 'll put into the company ?
It 's okay to guess .
No one knows the future , and educated guesses based on the best available information is all we can do .
4b . How much do you have to charge to earn a profit ?
For bloggers , how much does it cost you monthly to run your blog ?
In addition to the hard costs ( hosting ) , do n't forget to count the time involved .
How much would you like to earn each month ?
That number plus your expenses is your target sales volume .
( Now that you have a hard dollar amount as a target , you might need to go back to your answers in question 3 to tweak your implementation strategy . )

Go execute !
Now that you 've brainstormed these answers , you probably have a jumbled mess of notes , references , and mini-speeches written down .
That 's certainly not a business plan you can hand to investors , but it is a business plan that you can start executing today .
If you do n't know the answers to some of the questions , post in the comments or forums , and let the super smart Wise Bread community point you in the right direction .

( NewsTarget ) Researchers at Tufts University have discovered that vitamin B6 deficiency is much more common than previously thought .
The National Institute of Health has long held that vitamin B6 deficiency is rare in the U.S. and in 1998 the Recommended Daily Allowance was set in a range , depending on age and gender from 1.3 mg to 2 mg daily .
For about 10 years now the RDA for Vitamin B6 has largely been assumed to be adequate to maintain plasma levels of B6 at 20 nmol / L in most people .
The Tufts study has shown that instead , the RDA may be too low for at least four specific , large population groups .
Authors of the study note that this is the first of its kind to assess , on a large scale , the B6 ( PLP ) status of Americans .
Their findings illustrate that one - size - fits - all nutrient recommendations are , in reality , inappropriate for millions of people .
In the Tufts study , published in the May 2008 issue of the , researchers evaluated plasma levels of the most active form of B6 , known as PLP ( pyridoxal 5 ' phosphate ) in 7822 males and females , age one and older .
Vitamin B6 occurs in six known forms but it is PLP that is the most biologically active form for human metabolism .
PLP functions as a vital coenzyme in over 100 metabolic reactions , especially the metabolism of amino acids ( proteins ) .
According to Martha Savaria Morris , PhD epidemiologist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Research Center on Aging at Tufts University , " Across the study population , we noticed participants with inadequate vitamin B6 status even though they reported consuming more than the Recommended Daily Allowance of B6 , which is less than 2 milligrams per day " .
Researchers defined Vitamin B6 deficiency as plasma PLP concentration less than 20 nmol / L. Four groups were found to have the highest prevalence of B6 deficiency including .
Although not singled out in this study , alcoholics are also at higher risk for vitamin B6 deficiency .
Researchers found that about 75 % of women using oral contraceptives who did not take nutritional supplements were found to be deficient in PLP and that females age 13 - 54 had a much higher incidence of deficiency than males of the same age .
Of the entire study population , 25 % of those that did not take nutritional supplements and surprisingly 11 % of those who take supplements were found to have PLP deficiency .
In its role as a vital coenzyme , B6 is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters including serotonin .
B6 is required to form serotonin from the amino acid tryptophan .
It is also required to synthesize dopamine , norepinephrine and GABA ( gamma amino butyric acid ) .
" Early symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency include depression and confusion " according to Eleanor Noss Whitney and Sharon Rady Rolfes , authors of the textBased on the findings of the Tufts study , that B6 deficiency is indeed widespread in the U.S. , as is depression , should n't plasma B6 ( PLP ) be assessed in cases of depression and cognitive dysfunctionto resorting to misused , prescription anti depressant drugs ?
Is B6 deficiency , along with other nutrient deficiencies like essential fatty acid omega 3 , one more link to understanding the underlying causes of depression ?
PLP is required as a coenzyme in the synthesis of heme , a part of hemoglobin used to transport oxygen in blood .
Without sufficient heme production hypochromic , microcytic anemia can develop with symptoms similar to iron deficiency anemia .
A vitamin B6 deficiency is known to impair calcium and magnesium metabolism as well as the synthesis of niacin ( B3 ) from tryptophan .
Along with folic and B12 it works to regulate the metabolism of homocysteine .
Elevated homocysteine levels are a known risk factor for heart disease .
Vitamin B6 is also required to convert glycogen ( the storage form of glucose ) back into glucose , a function that the brain is very dependent on .
PLP is an important hormone moderator on testosterone and estrogen cells because it binds to lysine on cell receptors and regulates the action of these hormones .
Steroid hormone imbalance is linked to certain cancers including breast and prostate cancer .
A vitamin B6 deficiency decreases the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells responsible for antibody production .
Decreased lymphocytes diminish our ability to fight the multitude of foreign invaders ( antigens ) that we are daily exposed to .
Fatigue , a frequent symptom of many disorders , is a symptom of B6 deficiency .
Other signs include cheilosis ( sores or cracks at the corners of the mouth ) , glossitis ( swollen red tongue ) and stomatitis ( inflammation of the mouth , oral ulcers ) .
As mentioned earlier , the presence of depression , cognitive dysfunction and small cell type anemia ( hypochromic , microcytic ) are also suspect in a vitamin B6 deficiency .
Bananas , potatoes , acorn squash , watermelon , avocados and prune juice are all good plant sources of vitamin B6 .
For example , one medium banana contains about .75 mg of B6 .
Light meat poultry including chicken breast and turkey are good animal sources .
One 3 ounce serving of roasted chicken breast contains about .5 mg of B6 .
Animal sources of B6 are higher in the most biologically active form of B6 , PLP .
Plant sources are higher in pyridoxine , which requires conversion to PLP for biological activity .
Cooking , milling , sterilization , and freezing all damage vitamin B6 .
That makes bananas , avocado and watermelon look like good dietary options for increasing daily intake of this very important nutrient .
More often than not nutritional formulations include vitamin B6 in the form of pyridoxine hydrochloric acid .
Pyridoxine requires adequate riboflavin ( B2 ) for enzymatic conversion in the liver to the biologically active PLP form of B6 .
This illustrates the important synergistic effect that nutrients have on one another !
If you are trying to improve your vitamin B6 status , along with eating more foods high in vitamin B6 , look for a nutritional supplement that contains vitamin B6 as pyridoxal 5 ' phosphate , or PLP .
In general , it is better to take the B family of vitamins as a complex , due to their synergistic affect on one another .
The current safe upper limit dose , or UL is set at 100 mg / day .
Sensory and peripheral neuropathies can develop at megadose levels .
The Tufts study dislodges the long held thinking that vitamin B6 deficiency is a rare condition .
Dr. Morris and her team of researchers concluded that " Vitamin B - 6 intakes of 3 to 4.9 mg/d appear consistent with the definition of a Recommended Dietary Allowance for most Americans .
However , at that intake level , substantial proportions of some population subgroups may not meet accepted criteria for adequate vitamin B - 6 status " .
Considering that vitamin B6 is involved in over 100 biochemical reactions , from neurotransmitter synthesis to glucose metabolism , there are at least 100 good reasons to prevent deficiency when possible and recognize and treat deficiencies that occur .

For all the self congratulation last February , when Congress and President Bush quickly agreed to a $ 168 billion stimulus plan , the effort has not sparked the economic turnaround that policy makers wanted .
It has kept the economy from falling into even worse shape than it is in , but real improvement has proved elusive .
The $ 100 billion in rebate checks  which were delivered to just about everybody from April through mid-July  will be eaten up largely by higher gasoline prices .
Once the rebates are all spent , probably by October , consumers are likely to recoil in the face of rising unemployment , stagnating wages and tighter credit .
Business tax breaks in the stimulus package have given a modest , near - term boost to investment .
But bolstered investment this year means less investment in 2009 , when , by all indications , the economy will still be ailing .
So it is not surprising that lawmakers are now considering a second round of stimulus .
One is needed , but tempting as it is to send out checks in an election year , lawmakers will do a disservice to those who elected them if they simply serve up more of the same .
The initial stimulus plan has fallen short of expectations because the plan was flawed , not just because the economy ’s problems are more severe than policy makers thought .
The plan , for example , did not contain additional spending for food stamps or direct aid to states and local governments .
The second one must include both .
Mr Sarkozy is to travel to Ireland next week to hear people 's concerns French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said " something is n't right " with the European Union , as France took over the rotating presidency of the bloc .
Speaking on national French TV , Mr Sarkozy warned that Europe 's citizens were losing faith in the project .
Correspondents say France 's grandiose EU presidency plans are in doubt after the Irish Lisbon treaty No vote .
Poland 's president reportedly said it would be pointless for him to sign the treaty , given Ireland 's rejection .
Lech Kaczynski told Polish daily newspaper Dziennik he would not approve the document , even though it has been ratified by Poland 's parliament , reported AFP news agency .
' Step backward '
France has set out ambitious plans on immigration , the environment , agriculture and defence for its six months at the helm of the EU .
But as he took over the presidency from Slovenia , Mr Sarkozy said his priority would be to get all the other EU states to approve the treaty and then see what could be done .
The treaty cannot come into effect until it has been approved by all 27 member states .
France is not facing the positive outlook it had hoped for at the start of its EU presidency
Can French flair beat EU blues ?
France set for lively EU presidency Q&A : The Lisbon Treaty In Germany , ratification is also being delayed , with the President , Horst Koehler , saying he would wait to sign the treaty until after the country 's highest court had delivered a ruling on legal challenges .
The document is meant to streamline EU decision - making following enlargement of the bloc .
It is also meant to create a new EU president and foreign affairs chief , appointments which France is supposed to oversee at the end of its tenure .
But the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says last month 's Irish rejection of the treaty means once again it is the EU 's institutional shape - rather than anything it can actually do - that is in the spotlight .
Speaking on France 3 , Mr Sarkozy said : " Something is n't right .
Something is n't right at all . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " Europe worries people and , worse than that , I find , little by little our fellow citizens are asking themselves if after all the national level is n't better equipped to protect them than the European level , " he added , calling such thinking a " step backward " .
Mr Sarkozy said : " The first priority is to pinpoint the problem with the Irish voters and to continue to allow other countries to be ratified , especially our Czech friends . "
Asked if Ireland should vote again , he said : " I do n't want to say it like that because it would give the impression of forcing their hand . "
Mr Sarkozy will travel to Dublin on 11 July to hear Irish voters ' concerns first - hand , a day after he presents the priorities of the French EU presidency in an address to the EU parliament in Strasbourg .
EU leaders are due to meet in October to hear from Ireland 's prime minister on how to move forward after the " No " vote .
Ireland 's prime minister is deciding his next move after the " No " vote Mr Sarkozy also said that during France 's EU presidency he would work for a Europe - wide cut in value - added tax on restaurant bills and oil to help consumers cope with soaring crude prices .
But his call for the EU to cut VAT on fuel has received little support from other member states .
Mr Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon are to kick off France 's stint at the EU helm by meeting European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Tuesday afternoon .
A ceremony will be held afterwards at the Arc de Triomphe in the French capital .

What are these ?
Islam to become Russia ’s predominant religion by 2050 ?
Islam is likely to become the primary religion in the Russian Federation by 2050 due to the high birth rate in Muslim republics .
Islam to become Russia ’s predominant religion by 2050 ?
The current Chinese - led conquest of Russia ’s Far East already seems to be a matter of immediate concern for the Kremlin .
The ethnic birth rate disproportion in different regions of the country is another problem .
The Muslim community may become the largest community by the middle of the current century .
Therefore , Islam has all chances to become the predominant religion in Russia .
Ukrainian scientists of politics , Valery Chaliy and Mikhail Pashkov , believe that this is not the only challenge , which Russia has to face nowadays .
“ The Russian macroeconomic stability is being shattered with the high inflation rate and growing food prices .
Considerable funds are being invested in state - run corporations and are being spent on social needs .
Corruption restrains the growth of the national economy .
Russia dropped from the 120th to the 14th place among 160 countries on Transparency International ’s corruption list .
Russian found itself in the company of Gambia , Indonesia and Togo at this point .
Russia takes the humble 58th place on the list of 131 countries on the integral rating of the competitive ability of the economy for 2007 .
Islam is currently the second most widely professed religion in the Russian Federation .
It is impossible to provide official statistics of " practicing " adherents of Islam or any other religion in Russia because there is no country - wide census or statistics done on this matter by any governmental organization .
Roman Silantyev , a Russian Islamologist has estimated that there are only between 7 and 9 million people who practise Islam in Russia , and that the rest are only Muslims by ethnicity .
Muslim communities are concentrated among minority nationalities residing between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea : Adyghe , Balkars , Chechens , Circassians , Ingush , Kabardin , Karachay , and numerous Dagestani peoples .
Also , in the middle of the Volga Basin reside populations of Tatars and Bashkirs , many of whom are Muslims .
There was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s .
The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to Mecca increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1990 .
In 1995 the newly established Union of Muslims of Russia , led by Imam Khatyb Mukaddas of Tatarstan , began organizing a movement aimed at improving inter-ethnic understanding and ending Russians ' lingering misconception of Islam .
The Union of Muslims of Russia is the direct successor to the pre-World War I Union of Muslims , which had its own faction in the Russian Duma .
The post -Communist union has formed a political party , the Nur All - Russia Muslim Public Movement , which acts in close coordination with Muslim imams to defend the political , economic , and cultural rights of Muslims and other minorities .
The Islamic Cultural Center of Russia , which includes a madrassa ( religious school ) , opened in Moscow in 1991 .
The majority of Muslims in Russia adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam .
About 2 % are Shi'a Muslims .
In a few areas , notably Chechnya , there is a tradition of Sunni Sufism .
The Azeris have also historically and still currently been nominally followers of Shi'a Islam , as their republic split off from the Soviet Union , significant number of Azeris immigrated to Russia in search of work .
Many Muslim citizens , in particular Muslim clerics , often cite instances of arrest and harassment by authorities , as well as ocassional confiscation of Islamic educational sources .
The problems have been exacerbated by terrorist attacks linked with Islamic extremism and Chechen independence .
Many ordinary Muslims in Russia fear that they have become the victims of a violent backlash .
The rise in the Russian Muslim population , terrorist attacks and the steep decline of the ethnic Russian population have given rise to a greater degree of Xenophobia and Islamophobia in Russia .
Violent racist attacks by ethnic Russians , particularly Neo -Nazi skinheads , which used to be mainly conducted against Jews , are becoming increasingly frequent towards Muslims .
As such , Muslims bear the brunt of the escalating racist violence in Russia .
Racist attacks struck 539 people in 2006 , a 17 percent rise over 2005 , the Sova analytical center said in a report .
Nearly half of the 56 people killed in the attacks were from the overwhelmingly North Caucasus and Central Asia .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Ben Stein says he knows how Sen. John McCain can win in November : Karl Rove .
Ben Stein tells CNN's Mark Preston that John McCain is running the " most pathetic campaign " he 's ever seen .
That 's right , that Karl Rove .
At a time when McCain is seeking to distance himself from President Bush , Stein argues McCain needs to enlist Bush 's chief political guru in order to defeat Sen. Barack Obama .
" I do n't discount the possibility that some really smart person at the McCain campaign might go over to Karl Rove , and say ' We will offer you all the kingdoms of the world if you will come and guide our campaign , ' " a hopeful - sounding Stein said in a recent interview , during which he also discussed Al Franken 's Senate bid and his thoughts on a sequel to the 1986 box office smash " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off , " which launched Stein 's film career .
Stein is not unlike many Hollywood types in that he speaks his mind when it comes to politics .
But what separates him from the pack is his professional background and party affiliation .
Stein is an actor and an author , but he is also an economist , columnist and , yes , a lawyer .
And he is a Republican , making him a minority in Tinseltown political circles .
Watch Ben Stein 's take on politics »
Did I mention that Stein also worked as a speech writer for President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford ?
Yes , that 's right , that Richard Nixon .
McCain on ' King '
Is he ready to tell us his running mate ?
John McCain is on ' Larry King Live . '
Today , 9 pm ET see full schedule »
So when he talks about politics , it is fair to say that Stein has an informed view -- whether you choose to agree with his analysis is another issue .
From Stein 's perspective , McCain has been running an uninspiring campaign -- one that lacks a coherent message .
" Mr. McCain is running the absolute most pathetic campaign I have ever seen in my whole life , " Stein said in his unmistakable monotone delivery .
" His campaign is just heartbreakingly pathetic .
He is a very impressive guy .
He is a brave guy , but he is running the most lackluster campaign I have ever seen in my entire life .
I would have thought Bob Dole 's campaign would have set a record for poor campaigns , but this one is even worse .
I mean it is shocking . "
Thus Stein 's answer to turn it around is Rove -- architect of Bush 's back - to - back presidential victories -- who he describes as " about the smartest in the country in terms of politics . "
A McCain campaign spokesman politely sidestepped Stein 's criticism by saying the campaign is well - equipped to defeat Obama in November .
" Our campaign is competing for every vote , " said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
" We will have the resources and organization that John McCain needs to win this race because there is excitement for an independent leader who will fight wasteful government spending , grow the economy and keep taxes low .
Presumably , that is why Ben Stein is a supporter of ours -- which is an endorsement we are very proud to have . "
While Stein identifies himself as a Republican , he certainly does not always march in lockstep with GOP leadership .
For example , Stein is backing Al Franken 's bid for the Senate .
That 's right , that Al Franken , the liberal Democratic comedian who is seeking to oust incumbent Republican Sen. Norm Coleman in Minnesota .
" He is my pal , and he is a really , really capable smart guy , " Stein said of Franken .
" I do n't agree with all of his positions , but he is a very impressive guy , and I think he should be in the Senate . "
Here 's more of what Stein thinks about :
• The economy : " We are in a psychological recession .
People think times are really , really bad , but it is an amazing thing if you are out there among them : the hotels are full , the airlines are full , the high - end shops are full , the Wal - Mart is really , really , really full , the highways are full , the trains are full .
But on the other hand , clearly some portions of the economy are suffering terribly . "
Watch Stein 's take on politcs , the economy and other topics
• Karl Rove : " He is one of the nicest , straightest - shooting , most heads - up , kindest guys I have ever met .
He is a close friend , and I love him .
And the idea that they ( media ) treat him as some kind of a sinister figure is just ridiculous .
He is basically just a big nerd who has an incredible amount of data stuck in his head about what each congressional district is like in terms of its voters . "
• Liberal Hollywood cocktail parties : " I used to go there , and people would make cruel fun of me and bait me and want to start arguing with me , and who needs that crap ? "
" In fact , there are actually Republican groups now that have parties in Hollywood , and I do n't go to their parties , either , because , frankly , I work so incredibly hard , and I am on the road so much that when I am home I want to be in bed with my dogs and not -- and my wife too -- and not out talking to some people at a party . "
• Whether Ferris Bueller deserves another day off -- a sequel ?
( Stein played the economics teacher ) : " I would love for there to be a sequel , and I would like it to be a sequel about a 63 - year - old man who takes a day off and has an incredibly good time and gets away with it .
That 's what I would like . "
• What film historians will say about " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off : " " I think that is the most life - affirming movie possibly of the entire post - war period . "
All About Ben Stein • Karl Rove
Behind Military Analysts , the Pentagon ’s Hidden Hand
By DAVID BARSTOW
April 20 , 2008 Copyright 2008
The New York Times Company
In the summer of 2005 , the Bush administration confronted a fresh wave of criticism over Bill O’Reilly that the United States was “ not on a good glide path right now ”  in Iraq , the repercussions were swift .
Mr. Cowan said he was “ precipitously fired from the analysts group ”  for this appearance .
The Pentagon , he wrote in an e-mail message , “ simply did n’t like the fact that I was n’t carrying their water . ” 
The next day James T. Conway , then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs , presided over another conference call with analysts .
He urged them , a transcript shows , not to let the marines ’ deaths further erode support for the war .
“ The strategic target remains our population , ”  General Conway said .
“ We can lose people day in and day out , but they ’re never going to beat our military .
What they can and will do if they can is strip away our support .
And you guys can help us not let that happen . ” 
“ General , I just made that point on the air , ”  an analyst replied .
“ Let ’s work it together , guys , ”  General Conway urged .
The Generals ’ Revolt
The full dimensions of this mutual embrace were perhaps never clearer than in April 2006 , after several of Mr. Rumsfeld ’s former generals – none of them network military analysts – went public with devastating critiques of his wartime performance .
Some called for his resignation .
On Friday , April 14 , with what came to be called the “ Generals ’ Revolt ”  dominating headlines , Mr. Rumsfeld instructed aides to summon military analysts to a meeting with him early the next week , records show .
When an aide urged a short delay to “ give our big guys on the West Coast a little more time to buy a ticket and get here , ”  Mr. Rumsfeld ’s office insisted that “ the boss ”  wanted the meeting fast “ for impact on the current story . ” 
That same day , Pentagon officials helped two Fox analysts , General McInerney and General Vallely , write an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal defending Mr. Rumsfeld .
“ Starting to write it now , ”  General Vallely wrote to the Pentagon that afternoon .
“ Any input for the article , ”  he added a little later , “ will be much appreciated . ” 
Mr. Rumsfeld ’s office quickly forwarded talking points and statistics to rebut the notion of a spreading revolt .
“ Vallely is going to use the numbers , ”  a Pentagon official reported that afternoon .
The standard secrecy notwithstanding , plans for this session leaked , producing a front - page story in The Times that Sunday .
In damage - control mode , Pentagon officials scrambled to present the meeting as routine and directed that communications with analysts be kept “ very formal , ”  records show .
“ This is very , very sensitive now , ”  a Pentagon official warned subordinates .
On Tuesday , April 18 , some 17 analysts assembled at the Pentagon with Mr. Rumsfeld and General Pace , then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs .
A transcript of that session , never before disclosed , shows a shared determination to marginalize war critics and revive public support for the war .
“ I ’m an old intel guy , ”  said one analyst .
( The transcript omits speakers ’ names . )
“ And I can sum all of this up , unfortunately , with one word .
That is Psyops .
Now most people may hear that and they think , “ ˜ Oh my God , they ’re trying to brainwash . ’ “ 
“ What are you , some kind of a nut ? ” 
Mr. Rumsfeld cut in , drawing laughter .
“ You do n’t believe in the Constitution ? ” 
There was little discussion about the actual criticism pouring forth from Mr. Rumsfeld ’s former generals .
Analysts argued that opposition to the war was rooted in perceptions fed by the news media , not reality .
The administration ’s overall war strategy , they counseled , was “ brilliant ”  and “ very successful . ” 
“ Frankly , ”  one participant said , “ from a military point of view , the penalty , 2,400 brave Americans whom we lost , 3,000 in an hour and 15 minutes , is relative . ” 
An analyst said at another point : “ This is a wider war .
And whether we have democracy in Iraq or not , it does n’t mean a tinker ’s damn if we end up with the result we want , which is a regime over there that ’s not a threat to us . ” 
“ Yeah , ”  Mr. Rumsfeld said , taking notes .
But winning or not , they bluntly warned , the administration was in grave political danger so long as most Americans viewed Iraq as a lost cause .
“ America hates a loser , ”  one analyst said .
Much of the session was devoted to ways that Mr. Rumsfeld could reverse the “ political tide . ” 
One analyst urged Mr. Rumsfeld to “ just crush these people , ”  and assured him that “ most of the gentlemen at the table ”  would enthusiastically support him if he did .
“ You are the leader , ”  the analyst told Mr. Rumsfeld .
“ You are our guy . ” 
At another point , an analyst made a suggestion : “ In one of your speeches you ought to say , “ ˜Everybody stop for a minute and imagine an Iraq ruled by Zarqawi . ’
And then you just go down the list and say , “ ˜All right , we ’ve got oil , money , sovereignty , access to the geographic center of gravity of the Middle East , blah , blah , blah . ’
If you can just paint a mental picture for Joe America to say , “ ˜ Oh my God , I ca n’t imagine a world like that . ’ “
Even as they assured Mr. Rumsfeld that they stood ready to help in this public relations offensive , the analysts sought guidance on what they should cite as the next “ milestone ”  that would , as one analyst put it , “ keep the American people focused on the idea that we ’re moving forward to a positive end . ” 
They placed particular emphasis on the growing confrontation with Iran .
“ When you said “ ˜long war , ’ you changed the psyche of the American people to expect this to be a generational event , ”  an analyst said .
“ And again , I ’m not trying to tell you how to do your job … ” 
“ Get in line , ”  Mr. Rumsfeld interjected .
The meeting ended and Mr. Rumsfeld , appearing pleased and relaxed , took the entire group into a small study and showed off treasured keepsakes from his life , several analysts recalled .
Soon after , analysts hit the airwaves .
The Omnitec monitoring reports , circulated to more than 80 officials , confirmed that analysts repeated many of the Pentagon ’s talking points : that Mr. Rumsfeld consulted “ frequently and sufficiently ”  with his generals ; that he was not “ overly concerned ”  with the criticisms ; that the meeting focused “ on more important topics at hand , ”  including the next milestone in Iraq , the formation of a new government .
Days later , Mr. Rumsfeld wrote a memorandum distilling their collective guidance into bullet points .
Two were underlined :
“ Focus on the Global War on Terror – not simply Iraq .
The wider war – the long war . ” 
“ Link Iraq to Iran .
Iran is the concern .
If we fail in Iraq or Afghanistan , it will help Iran . ” 
But if Mr. Rumsfeld found the session instructive , at least one participant , General Nash , the ABC analyst , was repulsed .
“ I walked away from that session having total disrespect for my fellow commentators , with perhaps one or two exceptions , ”  he said .
View From the Networks
Two weeks ago General Petraeus took time out from testifying before Congress about Iraq for a conference call with military analysts .
Mr. Garrett , the Fox analyst and Patton Boggs lobbyist , said he told General Petraeus during the call to “ keep up the great work . ” 
“ Hey , ”  Mr. Garrett said in an interview , “ anything we can do to help . ” 
For the moment , though , because of heavy election coverage and general war fatigue , military analysts are not getting nearly as much TV time , and the networks have trimmed their rosters of analysts .
The conference call with General Petraeus , for example , produced little in the way of immediate coverage .
Still , almost weekly the Pentagon continues to conduct briefings with selected military analysts .
Many analysts said network officials were only dimly aware of these interactions .
The networks , they said , have little grasp of how often they meet with senior officials , or what is discussed .
“ I do n’t think NBC was even aware we were participating , ”  said Rick Francona , a longtime military analyst for the network .
Some networks publish biographies on their Web sites that describe their analysts ’ military backgrounds and , in some cases , give at least limited information about their business ties .
But many analysts also said the networks asked few questions about their outside business interests , the nature of their work or the potential for that work to create conflicts of interest .
“ None of that ever happened , ”  said Mr. Allard , an NBC analyst until 2006 .
“ The worst conflict of interest was no interest . ” 
Mr. Allard and other analysts said their network handlers also raised no objections when the Defense Department began paying their commercial airfare for Pentagon - sponsored trips to Iraq – a clear ethical violation for most news organizations .
CBS
News declined to comment on what it knew about its military analysts ’ business affiliations or what steps it took to guard against potential conflicts .
NBC News also declined to discuss its procedures for hiring and monitoring military analysts .
The network issued a short statement : “ We have clear policies in place to assure that the people who appear on our air have been appropriately vetted and that nothing in their profile would lead to even a perception of a conflict of interest . ” 
Jeffrey W. Schneider , a spokesman for ABC , said that while the network ’s military consultants were not held to the same ethical rules as its full - time journalists , they were expected to keep the network informed about any outside business entanglements .
“ We make it clear to them we expect them to keep us closely apprised , ”  he said .
A spokeswoman for Fox News said executives “ refused to participate ”  in this article .
CNN requires its military analysts to disclose in writing all outside sources of income .
But like the other networks , it does not provide its military analysts with the kind of written , specific ethical guidelines it gives its full - time employees for avoiding real or apparent conflicts of interest .
Yet even where controls exist , they have sometimes proven porous .
CNN , for example , said it was unaware for nearly three years that one of its main military analysts , General Marks , was deeply involved in the business of seeking government contracts , including contracts related to Iraq .
General Marks was hired by CNN in 2004 , about the time he took a management position at McNeil Technologies , where his job was to pursue military and intelligence contracts .
As required , General Marks disclosed that he received income from McNeil Technologies .
But the disclosure form did not require him to describe what his job entailed , and CNN acknowledges it failed to do additional vetting .
“ We did not ask Mr. Marks the follow - up questions we should have , ”  CNN said in a written statement .
In an interview , General Marks said it was no secret at CNN that his job at McNeil Technologies was about winning contracts .
“ I mean , that ’s what McNeil does , ”  he said .
CNN , however , said it did not know the nature of McNeil ’s military business or what General Marks did for the company .
If he was bidding on Pentagon contracts , CNN said , that should have disqualified him from being a military analyst for the network .
But in the summer and fall of 2006 , even as he was regularly asked to comment on conditions in Iraq , General Marks was working intensively on bidding for a $ 4.6 billion contract to provide thousands of translators to United States forces in Iraq .
In fact , General Marks was made president of the McNeil spin - off that won the huge contract in December 2006 .
General Marks said his work on the contract did not affect his commentary on CNN .
“ I ’ve got zero challenge separating myself from a business interest , ”  he said .
But CNN said it had no idea about his role in the contract until July 2007 , when it reviewed his most recent disclosure form , submitted months earlier , and finally made inquiries about his new job .
“ We saw the extent of his dealings and determined at that time we should end our relationship with him , ”  CNN said .

Over the years , I 've written plenty about the economics of infinite vs. scarce goods .
Too often ( and I do this on occasion as well ) people default into thinking of " tangible " goods as being the scarce ones , and digital goods or information goods as being the infinite ones .
But the definitions can certainly expand beyond that -- and there 's also the possibility that material , tangible goods could one day lose much of their scarcity .
Economist Arnold Kling , riffing on a post by Will Wilkinson about why energy is n't really scarce points out that , if energy is n't scarce , matter is n't scarce either
In theory , as you solve " the energy problem " and figure out how to create energy cheaply , then you can make any material you want as it's needed cheaply as well .
Then you 're in a bit of thereplicator universe where even tangible products become much more abundant .
We 're still a ways off from that point , but it 's worth thinking about as a thought experiment ( especially as 3D printer technology improves rapidly ) .
Indeed , Chris Anderson is also thinking along these lines , noting that technology is likely to solve both of the big " shortage " problems we 're facing these days : energy and food -- if only government regulations would let them .
For those who think that copyright holders should try to artificially maintain scarcity , this may be a scary situation .
After all , then the same " problem " facing copyright holders , will also face makers of tangible goods .
But the truth is even if you switch tangible goods from scarce to abundant , it does n't mean that you run out of scarcities to sell .
Music is more abundant thanks to digital technologies , and there are still plenty of scarcities to sell for the music industry .
There are always scarcities -- it 's just that they 're no longergoods .
Instead , business models will start to revolve around those non-tangible scarcities as well , such as time , attention and reputation .
But these changes could create a rather radical shift in how economies function .
So , even if it 's pretty far out , it 's worth considering the possibilities already .

Woodhead compensated for the 1200 fps ' paltry 336x96 frame size by stitching four different Mentos tests together , and the results are awesome .
Globs , ribbons and rings of Coke that are impossible to track in real time come to life when seen in slow - motion .

Optimize ubuntu boot sequence by profiling it
While you are in grub menu highlight your preferred kernel version and press " e " .
.
Highlight the line beginning with kernel and press " e " again .
Press
End key in order to goto end of that line .
again .
Press in order to goto end of that line .
Add a word " profile " without quotes to that line and press Enter .
without quotes to that line and press .
Now press " b " to continue booting .
This one time special boot may take more time than ordinary boot .
But during this boot ubuntu monitors file usage and preloads those files during subsequent boots .
prelink
Any executable that makes heavy use of shared libraries can benefit from prelinking .
Prelinking resolves addresses of shared libraries in advance this reduces number of relocations .
Prelink is also useful in the context of security since we can tell prelink to make libraries load at random addresses until next run of prelink .
This is useful since libraries wo n't load at fixed addresses on every system .
You can install prelink by issuing following command .
sudo apt - get -y install prelink
Change a line inside the configuration file / etc / default / prelink from
PRELINKING=unknown
PRELINKING=yes
sudo /etc/cron.daily / prelink
toWe will do our first prelinking by executing following command
Thats it you do n't have to do anything else .
Prelink daemon will run periodically to optimize your newly installed executables .
preload
Preload is a little application that monitors files of frequently used applications and and loads them in to the memory when system is idle .
This usually results in lesser startup times for those applications .
Install preload by executing following command .
sudo apt - get -y install preload
deborphan : Find orphan packages
After doing several installs and removes apt leaves lot of packages that are not needed anymore .
You can find these packages using deborphan .
Install deborphan by issuing following command .
sudo apt - get -y install deborphan
Now to see the list of packages which are not needed anymore just run following command .
deborphan
To remove these packages give following command .
sudo apt - get remove `deborphan`
To get full list of packages that are not essential for functioning of the system execute the following command .
deborphan -- guess-all
This command will list data , dev and many other types packages that are not essential for system functioning .
Please see man page of deborphan to find out more options .
localepurge
Remove locale information ( language tables ) of the applications that are not needed for you .
localepurge maintains specified locales and removes the remaining .
To install localepurge issue following command .
sudo apt - get -y install localepurge
During installation localepurge will ask you to select locales that you want to preserve .
At this step select what you need and press OK .
From now on localepurge will maintain only those locales which you selected during configuration step .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A New York man who says he was denied a seat on a five - hour jetBlue flight and was instead told to “ hang out ” in the plane ’s bathroom has sued the airline for $ 2 million , saying he suffered “ extreme humiliation . ”
When Gokhan Mutlu arrived to check in for a jetBlue flight from San Diego to New York in February he was told the flight was full , according to the lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court .
But Mutlu was allowed to board after a jetBlue flight attendant agreed to give up her seat and travel in an airline employee “ jump seat . ”
It was not clear in the lawsuit whether the flight attendant was working .
However 90 minutes into the flight , the pilot told Mutlu the flight attendant was uncomfortable and he would have to give up his seat and “ hang out ” in the bathroom for the remainder of the flight , the lawsuit said .
The pilot “ became angry at ( Mutlu ’s ) reluctance ” and said Mutlu “ should be grateful for being onboard , ” the lawsuit said .
When Mutlu volunteered to sit in the “ jump seat , ” he was told it was reserved for airline personnel .
At one point , the airplane experienced turbulence and Mutlu sat on the toilet seat without a seat belt , causing him “ tremendous fear , ” the lawsuit said .
JetBlue was not immediately available for comment .
The finding may open a new window into how the brain operates .
“ One of the biggest questions in neuroscience is to answer what are the design principles by which the human brain is constructed , and this is one of those principles , ” Dr. Grant said .
If the synapses are thought of as the chips in a computer , then brainpower is shaped by the sophistication of each chip , as well as by their numbers .
“ From the evolutionary perspective , the big brains of vertebrates not only have more synapses and neurons , but each of these synapses is more powerful  vertebrates have big Internets with big computers and invertebrates have small Internets with small computers , ” Dr. Grant said .
He included yeast cells in his cross-species survey and found that they contain many proteins equivalent to those in human synapses , even though yeast is a single - celled microbe with no nervous system .
The yeast proteins , used for sensing changes in the environment , suggest that the origin of the nervous system , or at least of synapses , began in this way .
The computing capabilities of the human brain may lie not so much in its neuronal network as in the complex calculations that its synapses perform , Dr. Grant said .
Vertebrate synapses have about 1,000 different proteins , assembled into 13 molecular machines , one of which is built from 183 different proteins .
These synapses are not standard throughout the brain , Dr. Grant ’s group has found ; each region uses different combinations of the 1,000 proteins to fashion its own custom - made synapses .
Your laptop is lying to you
Publication date : 28 July 2008

Last modified 03 - Dec - 2011 .
Your mobile phone is lying to you .
So is your laptop .
And not just when they whisper to you in the night .
Mobile phones , and most modern laptops , have signal strength and battery life displays .
One or both of these displays has probably been the focus of all of your attention at one time or another .
Neither display is actually telling you what you think it 's telling you .
The signal strength bars on a mobile phone or laptop do , at least , say something about how strong the local signal is .
But they do n't tell you the ratio between that signal and the inevitable , and often very considerable , noise that accompanies it .
A high - signal strength is like your friend shouting at you .
A high noise level at the same time is like your friend shouting at you while you both stand in the front row at a rock concert .
( Actually , for phones and Wi-Fi , it 's often more like your friend shouting at you while you 're both attending a rock concert in an echo chamber . )
So if you 've ever wondered why your phone can work fine with one rather unsteady bar of " signal " , or be noisy and cut out when it 's got five bars , that 's why .
The ratio of signal to noise can vary wildly from second to second , in many ordinary mobile - phone situations .
It 's within the bounds of possibility that there 's some phone out there whose " signal bars " actually do give a realistic estimate of the actual signal quality ( rather than mere quantity ) , but you should n't count on that display telling you anything really useful if you 're not actually on a call at the time .
And the exact same applies to Wi -Fi signal strength displays , though it 's easier to see signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) figures on a computer - just run a utility like NetStumbler .
Signal bars also do n't tell you anything about how well a cellular phone , or wireless network , base station can hear your phone or laptop .
They only tell you how well your device can hear the base station .
( Some phones may give more realistic signal figures when they 're actually connected to a base station because you 're making a call .
Then , they of course actually know how good the connection is , because they 're sending and receiving data .
If you 've actually successfully made a call , though , you ( a ) already know that there 's an adequate amount of signal and ( b ) probably have the signal - strength display pressed firmly to your ear . )
This explains many of those times when you seem to have a " bar " or two of Wi -Fi signal , but ca n't actually connect .
If your laptop has too poky an antenna , it can't make itself heard to the access point .
Battery meters are even more fun .
It 's possible to monitor the charge in a battery - any kind of battery - with considerable accuracy .
There 's a certain amount of guessing involved , because the " fullness " of different battery chemistries does n't necessarily map well to terminal voltage even if the battery 's powering an unchanging load .
But modern " smart " batteries with little chips on them that keep track of how long they 've been lasting lately really do work pretty well .
You may have noticed , however , that your mobile phone seems to spend an awful lot of time with its battery gauge saying it 's full , or at least almost full .
Then , once you get to the half - full mark , the battery seems to go flat surprisingly quickly .
This phenomenon is n't as obvious with today 's low - power - consumption phones than it was back in the days of 20 - hour standby times , but it 's still pretty hard to find a phone that does n't do it .
There are two reasons for this .
They are both bad .
Reason one : A battery that stays ( apparently ) full for a long time makes a phone look good .
Even if it does n't actually deserve to .
Reason two :
When your phone still ( apparently ) has lots of charge left , you 're more likely to use it .
People who think their phone 's going flat will make fewer , and shorter , calls .
And that makes phone companies sad .
That 's right - this is yet another example of the Curse of the Marketing Department .
Both phone makers and cellular service providers want you to think that your phone is still pretty much full of charge even if it 's almost half empty .
For this reason , many of them tweak the charge meters to overestimate the remaining charge .
This is a particular problem in the US market , where most mobile phones are not just usually locked to one provider , but also customised for that provider , with specific firmware that can very easily include a battery meter that has an even larger Lie Factor than usual .
( This is n't the most spectacular achievement of the US cellphone companies .
They also somehow managed to talk people into buying SMS message plans that charge you not only when you send a message , but also when you receive one .
But it could be worse ; if you 're a Russian with a cheapo prepaid phone , you 'd better be ready to be switched to half - duplex " walkie - talkie " mode , or dropped altogether , if someone who 's paying more per minute needs your network bandwidth . )
Most modern cellphones have processing power to spare , and could easily have very clever battery - monitoring .
They could tell you remaining capacity as a percentage , maximum capacity in watt - hours , minutes of battery remaining at current drain level , and so on .
What do you usually actually get , though ?
A phone which , whenever you plug a charger in for a few minutes , will upon unplugging proudly display a completely fraudulent full set of battery - capacity bars .
( Digital cameras are often not much better .
It might be possible to dig through menus on your consumer - market camera to find a fine - granularity no-bulldust battery display , but it 's not at all likely .
Note , however , the CHDK firmware for Canon point - and - shoots , which adds tons of features , of which an honest battery display is the very least . )
The custom - rolled firmware from the US cellphone companies is also , of course , likely to tell fibs about signal strength .
The telephony companies quickly realised that it 's much cheaper to sell phones that show lots of signal all the time than to actually bother putting up more of those expensive cell towers .
And , once again , the signal strength is not the same as the call quality .
Lots of signal plus lots of noise is not as good as a little bit of signal plus almost no noise at all .
There 's one other commonplace situation in which a " fullness " display lies to you - car fuel gauges .
This time it 's a safeguard , not a scam ; the determination of some drivers to fill up as seldom as possible has led to a cultural convention in which " E " on the fuel gauge almost never actually means the fuel tank is empty .
Once an industry has made this sort of decision - for cars or for mobile phones - it 's hard to change .
If Car Manufacturer X boldly decided to make E really mean E for their cars , people would still expect that it did n't .
Result : A lot of unhappy Manufacturer X car owners trudging down the road with jerrycans .
Not to mention diesel cars with air in the fuel lines .
And if Phone Manufacturer
X locked down their firmware so that the battery and signal displays actually gave an accurate idea of the remaining power and expected call quality , many customers would think those phones went flat faster and could n't get as good a signal .
If laptops had as much battery life as phones , I bet we 'd see " bar inflation " happening to their battery gauges , too .
Manufacturers can't really get away with this scam when total run time is only a few hours , though - and modern laptops all have " smart " batteries that let the operating system quite accurately estimate how long the battery will last at the present drain level .
So this is , at least , one piece of nonsense that laptop users have not yet had to suffer .
It 's still worth noting , though , that there 's no standard for what " two bars of signal " is supposed to mean , for a mobile phone or for a laptop .
It varies from device to device , and from firmware version to firmware version .
On a laptop , signal displays can even vary depending on the monitoring software you use .
And remember : Measuring signal without measuring noise is like only counting the goals your team scores .

In our many years of criminal practice , we ’ve seen far too many people take a plea in hopes that their troubles will go away before anyone notices .
This is the wrong approach , often resulting in collateral damage that lasts years or decades .
At Giancola - Durkin , P.A. , we focus on achieving the best possible outcome in every case we take .
Sometimes that means reaching a plea deal with the prosecution and sometimes it involves taking a case to trial .
However , it always means being prepared to go to trial .
The prosecution knows we will go the distance on behalf of our clients , and that allows us to negotiate outcomes from a position of strength .
Styrofoam dome houses at Aso Farm Land ( Photo by : Erika Snyder )
While styrofoam may be most commonly associated with disposable coffee cups , meat trays and packaging , prefab home manufacturer Japan Dome House Co. , Ltd. uses it to construct easy - to - assemble modular kit homes .
Dubbed the " habitat for the 21st century , " the Dome House is an igloo - shaped structure built from snap - together wall sections made of 100 % expanded polystyrene foam ( styrofoam ) .
It might seem like an odd choice of material for a house , but the company lists a number of advantages that styrofoam has over traditional materials .
Unlike wood and metal structures , for example , the styrofoam Dome House does not rust , rot or attract termites .
It is also highly resistant to earthquakes and typhoons .
In addition , the walls , which are treated with a flame retardant , emit no toxic fumes in a fire .
Dome House interior
The styrofoam used in the Dome House 's 175 - millimeter ( 7 in ) thick walls is significantly denser and stronger than ordinary packing foam .
The material has excellent thermal insulation properties , resulting in higher energy efficiency and lower heating and cooling costs .
Construction of the Dome House shell is quick and easy .
The prefabricated pieces , which each weigh about 80 kilograms ( 175 lbs ) , can be carried by 2 or 3 people and assembled in a few hours .
Once the shell is put together , coats of mortar and paint are applied for further protection from the elements .
( Watch a short video of the assembly process . )
Measuring 7.7 meters ( 25 ft ) wide and 3.85 meters ( 13 ft ) tall , the basic Dome House has a floor space of 44.2 square meters ( 475 sq ft ) .
It is possible to construct larger , elongated domes by adding more pieces , and joint units allow multiple domes to be connected into a single structure .
Dome Houses , which are approved by Japan 's Land and Transport Ministry , can be erected anywhere in Japan with the proper permit .
According to the manufacturer , the versatile structures are suitable for use as hotel rooms , restaurants , freezer rooms , or even as hog farms .
The Aso Farm Land resort village in Kyushu uses about 480 styrofoam domes as lodging , recreational facilities and retail shops .
Aso Farm Land
The Dome House can also be used as a bar , karaoke room , steam room , and more .

House karaoke room at Suijin - no - mori hot spring ( Oita prefecture )
Styrofoam dome steam room
Whether or not this type of home is truly " perfect for the modern age " as the company suggests , the price is right .
Dome House kits start at around 3 million yen ( under $ 30,000 ) , which does not include the cost of transport , assembly , interior construction , etc .

There was once a time when I had no fear .
I was 11 years old and I entered a story telling competition .
I was confidently telling the story and captured everyone ’s attention until suddenly I heard a voice from just in front of the stage commenting about my nose .
It ’s totally disastrous from that moment on .
I lost focus and forgot the script altogether .
That ’s the exact time that I began to have a certain fear of public speaking .
Over the years , I finally overcome my fear of public speaking .
I can now speak at any function unprepared and even though the nervousness is still there , I am able to control it .
It was not easy but I made it with some help from books and a few techniques I develop myself .
Hopefully these tricks will be able to help you as they had helped me in overcoming fear of public speaking .
Advertising
1 ) Admit nervousness
All you have to do is admit that you are a bit nervous speaking to your audience .
When you do this , the audience will be more forgiving if your nervousness shows up later on .
More importantly you will feel more relaxed now that they are not expecting a world - class presentation .
Imagine their surprise when you gave them the best presentation ever despite your nervousness .
The best way to do this is by joking about it .
Here ’s an example of a good one .
“ On the way here , only God and I knew what I will be presenting .
( looking a bit nervous ) Now , only God knows . ”
2 ) Redefine your audience
Redefine your audience generally means changing how you see your audience .
Instead of seeing them as lecturers who are evaluating you , maybe you can convince yourself that they are all fellow students who are in queue to present after you .
They are all equally nervous so there is no reason why you should be too .
Or perceive them as long lost friends that you have n’t seen for 10 years .
This way you can maintain eye contact trying to figure out where you have seen him before .
To the audiences , they will see a very friendly and personal presentation .
Advertising
Do not try to convince yourself that they are babies in diapers or that nobody is around as suggested by some books .
It is very hard to convince yourself that no one is around when you are actually speaking to them .
3 ) Invest in visual aids
Imagine a presentation with beautiful PowerPoint slides and even more impressive notes given to each of your audience members .
Half of the time , their eyes will not be on you .
They will read through the notes and your fancy slides .
This will help a lot as you can then speak to the people who are not looking at you .
When they look at you , you just change your focus to other people who are not looking .
Giving a speech to people who are not looking at you is always easier .
4 ) Make mistakes intentionally
This is another trick I encourage you to try .
Once I “ accidentally ” dropped my notes on the floor , and while picking them up , I warned the audiences that the presentation will be more confusing after this .
I heard some laughter from the floor .
The idea is to gain control of your audience .
If you can make them laugh and be more interactive with you , your presentation will have that casual feel to it which will make it more memorable than others .
Ultimately you will find it easier to do .
Advertising
5 ) Speak to one person at a time
One of the most terrifying things about public speaking is the crowd .
Just by looking at the crowd , all in silence just to hear you speak , will send shivers down your spine .
To overcome this , you just need to speak to one person at a time .
Choose one member of your audience and dedicate your whole presentation to him or her .
Just assume that everyone else is not paying attention .
When someone asks you a question , change your focus to that person and answer the question as if the two of you are in a coffee shop chatting away .
Is n’t that the most relaxing way to handle a crowd ?
6 ) Be impressive with personal opinion
Just like blogging , everyone can copy an article and paste it onto their blog .
However , people read blogs not only to know about things happening but to know what that particular blogger ’s opinion is on the matter .
When you speak or give a presentation , try to squeeze in a few of your personal thoughts on the matter .
Of course these should be prepared early on .
However , you should make it as if the ideas are “ just in ” while you are presenting .
That will differentiate your presentation from the rest , and when you see the interested look on the faces of your audience , it will elevate your presentation to another new level , a level where you start having fun .
Advertising
7 ) Have fun experimenting
This is the most important tips of all .
Have fun with the crowd .
Try new ways to give the best presentation to your audience .
Maybe experiment with a new funny approach , or walk around the hall instead of being static on the stage .
Have fun with experimenting on human behavior and you will see that public speaking is not that bad after all .
Remember that there are no failures , only different results .
Have fun !

From Hurricane Michael , the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the lower 48 since 1992 , to the Camp Fire , the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history , natural disasters are n’t getting any less intense .
What ’s more , both of these disasters show just how quickly another day in paradise can turn into a living nightmare .
Emergencies can and do happen all the time .
So , you must stay well - prepared , come what may .
That includes keeping a well - stocked home survival kit on hand .
But what to put in an emergency kit ?
Read on for a breakdown of 12 emergency kit items .
1. Solar Generator
When it comes to home emergency kits , a solar generator will help your household prepare for a wide variety of contingencies , whether an intense wind storm that blows down power lines or a blackout .
But if you ’ve ever searched for a unit online or in the store , you probably already know that options abound .
In fact , it can feel confusing to choose just one .
Factors to consider as you look for the best solar generator for your family include how portable the unit is , its battery capacity , its charge speed , and its RV connectivity .
Check out https://PoweredPortableSolar.com now for a full breakdown of how to find the right solar generator for your family .
2. NOAA Radio and Charging Device
During a natural disaster , it ’s essential to keep in contact with the outside world .
That way , you know what ’s going on and why .
Of course , if the power ’s down along with the internet , then you need other ways to get news .
That ’s where a solar hand crank radio comes into play .
You can use this multi-purpose device as a flashlight , an SOS alarm , or to tune into radio stations so that you know what ’s going on .
Better still , a decent model retails for less than $ 30 .
3. Weather - Resistant Thermal Blankets
For less than $ 15 , you can purchase a pack of four Mylar thermal blankets .
They ’re specifically designed to retain up to 90 percent of an individual ’s body heat .
What ’s more , they ’re moisture - proof , windproof , and waterproof .
In a pinch , you can also convert the emergency blankets into a shelter tent .
And because they prove so lightweight and portable , you wo n’t hesitate to bring them wherever you go .
4. Battery - Free Flashlight
When you ’re in the midst of a survival situation , batteries can prove a hard commodity to come by .
Fortunately , a unit such as the Thorfire three - LED bulb flashlight features hand - crank technology and solar energy , which means no more worrying about batteries .
One hour in the sun provides you with 120 minutes of light .
Or , you can use the hand crank for one minute to enjoy 80 minutes of light .
What ’s more , the flashlight is waterproof and can even be submerged in water at depths of up to 45 feet .
5. First Aid Kit
When it comes to first aid kits , you ’ve got plenty of options .
Look for one with a small first aid guide and a compact carrying case .
It should contain supplies such as :
Tapes
Sponges
Bandages
Pads
Sterilization wipes
Gloves
Medical tools
Antibacterial salve
As you shop the best first aid kit for your family , make sure it contains supplies to deal with everything from minor cuts or fevers to burns and puncture wounds .
Also , keep in mind the quantity of supplies based on the number of individuals in your household .
6. Portable Water Filter
While our bodies can manage without food for up to three weeks , lack of clean drinking water proves another story .
Do n’t plan on getting much past three days without it .
That ’s why you need a portable water filter such as the LifeStraw .
Its compact size makes it easy to keep on hand , whether you go for a simple hike or a week in the back country .
And its microfiltration membrane removes 99.9 percent of waterborne microplastics , parasites , and bacteria .
7. A Paracord Bracelet
Paracord bracelets prove cheap and have a relaxed , outdoorsy look .
But do n’t let these little guys fool you .
They offer more than a rugged fashion statement .
Each bracelet comes with a small compass , a fire starter , and an emergency whistle .
That way , if you find yourself unexpectedly lost , this accessory will help you stay alive and get noticed by rescue workers .
Best of all ?
A two - pack from Atomic Bear costs just under $ 10 .
8. Heavy - Duty Duct Tape
Heavy - duty duct tape has so many uses , we do n’t even know where to start .
Brands such as Gorilla
Tape prove weather - resistant and come in double - thick adhesive to stick uneven and rough surfaces together .
The tape also proves impervious to extreme temperatures , UV rays , and moisture , which means you ’ve got a go - to item for any sudden repairs or outdoor “ construction ” projects that come up .
9. Waterproof Matches
Waterproof matches come in handy when you need to make a fire in a damp area .
They ’re inexpensive and highly portable .
So , keep plenty on hand , because you ’ll find endless reasons to use them , whether it ’s a fire to stay warm or a light to guide rescue workers .
10 . A Swiss Army Knife
A good quality Swiss Army knife is n’t cheap .
But it ’ll be well worth every cent , not only when a disaster strikes but in day - to - day life as well .
That ’s because you ’ll find plenty of practical uses for each of the tools on the knife .
What should you look for in an army knife ?
Some come with up to 33 different tools .
These include everything from pliers to screwdrivers , all in one compact device .
Whether you stash it in your backpack or back pocket , it ’s easy to take with you and will ensure you always have the tools you need when you need them most .
11 . Two - Way Radio
Whether you prefer to call them two - way radios or walkie - talkies , a long - range set comes in handy if your group needs to split up for any reason .
Radioddity makes a decent pair that come with 16 pre-programmed frequencies .
The units can communicate over a range of up to three miles .
And the batteries last on standby for up to 96 hours .
What ’s more , you can recharge them using a USB - compatible device .
12 . Emergency Food Kit

Fitzgerald says
Rove was trying to fire him during CIA leak probe Marcy Wheeler
Published : Thursday July 17 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a supplement to his responses to the House Judiciary Committee , Patrick Fitzgerald confirms what we 've always suspected : Karl Rove was trying to have Patrick Fitzgerald fired while Fitzgerald was still investigating Rove for his role in leaking Valerie Wilson 's identity -- and the timing lines up perfectly with the Administration 's efforts to fire a bunch of US Attorneys .
Remember back in June , when Fitzgerald publicly suggested he had more details to share with Congress about Rove 's efforts to get him fired ?
" If I owe a response [ about the putsch to remove him from his job ] , I owe it to Congress , first , " Fitzgerald said when asked about all this after the verdict .
Well , it turns out Fitzgerald did share those details with Congress .
And those details make it clear that Fitzgerald learned Rove was trying to fire him while Fitzgerald was still actively investigating Rove 's role in the leak of Valerie Wilson 's identity .
In my answers submitted on May 2,2008 , I noted in my response to Question Eleven that I omitted discussion of when I first learned that I might be asked to resign as United States Attorney .
I declined to answer more fully due to the then pending trial of United States v. Antoin Rezko in the Northern District of Illinois .
With that trial concluded , I can briefly elaborate further : I learned some time in or about early 2005 from agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( " FBI " ) that a cooperating witness ( who later testified at the Rezko trial , but not about this topic ) had advised the FBI agents that he had earlier been told by one of Mr. Rezko 's co-schemers that it was the responsibility of a third person in Illinois to have me replaced as United States Attorney .
I should be clear that I did not understand that any putative effort to replace me as United States Attorney was related to my conduct as Special Counsel but understood instead that it was related to the investigative activities of federal agents and prosecutors conducting a corruption investigation in Illinois .
[ my emphasis ]
As a reminder , here 's the allegation with all the names handily added in ( though I think Fitzgerald is referring to someone besides Ata , because Ata was not yet cooperating with the Rezko prosecutors ) :
In a hearing before court began , prosecutors said they hoped to call Ali Ata , the former Blagojevich administration official who pleaded guilty to corruption yesterday , to the stand .
Assistant U.S. Atty .
Carrie Hamilton said she believed Ata would testify to conversations Ata had with his political patron , Rezko , about working to pull strings to kill the criminal investigation into Rezko and others when it was in its early stages in 2004 .
" [ Ata ] had conversations with Mr. Rezko about the fact that Mr. Kjellander was working with Karl Rove to have Mr. Fitzgerald removed , " Hamilton told U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve. Note , Fitzgerald emphasizes that Rove was trying to fire him to protect Republican donor Bob Kjellander , not to protect Rove and Libby and Cheney .
But that does n't change the fact that Rove was in discussions about firing Fitzgerald while he -- Rove - - was under active investigation .
Also note the timing : while the discussions between this cooperating witness and ( presumably ) Kjellander happened earlier , the timing lines up with the effort to fire all the US Attorneys -- and then , when Kyle Sampson suggested his name , Fitzgerald specifically -- at the beginning of 2005 .
The iconic Chrysler Building dominates the New York skyline
The majority stake in one of New York 's most famous landmarks , the Chrysler Building , has been sold to a business arm of Abu Dhabi 's government .
Prudential Financial confirmed it had sold its 75 % stake in the Manhattan art deco skyscraper to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council ( ADIC ) .
The council , which has not commented on the deal , was reported to have paid about $ 800 m ( £ 400 m ) for the stake .
The remaining 25 % of the building is owned by property firm Tishman Speyer .
Tishman Speyer will continue to manage the building .
Prudential spokeswoman Theresa Miller confirmed that ADIC had bought its share of the skyscraper , according to the Associated Press .
Sovereign investments
In recent months , a number of iconic buildings on Manhattan 's skyline have been the target of Middle Eastern investors .
The investment has often come from sovereign wealth funds , which are established by governments who have large surpluses of money - typically earned from oil and gas revenues - which they wish to invest abroad .
In June , a Dubai fund , Boston Properties and Goldman Sachs paid $ 2.8 bn for the General Motors Building .
Last November , another investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) , made a $ 7.5 bn investment in US banking giant Citigroup .
The ADIA is one of the world 's richest sovereign funds , with an estimated $ 800 bn of assets under management .
But governments in France , Germany , and the US have raised concerns that these funds could use their wealth to buy up key strategic assets or exert political leverage on Western companies and governments .
The International Monetary Fund 's working group on sovereign wealth funds met in Singapore on Wednesday to try and address those concerns and to draw up a voluntary code of conduct for the industry .
Analysts say energy - rich governments in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and other Gulf countries are taking advantage of falling prices to invest in property and financial firms around the world .
Middle Eastern investors have spent $ 1.8 bn this year on commercial US property , according to research firm Real Capital Analytics .
The Chrysler Building at 405 Lexington Avenue was designed by William Van Alen and completed in 1930 for car maker Chrysler .
At 319 m ( 1,046ft ) high , the building was the world 's tallest skyscraper before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building a year later .

What are these ?
Psychologists at Washington University in St. Louis , led by Richard A. Abrams , Ph.D. , professor of psychology in Arts & Sciences , have shown that to see objects better , you should take the matter into your own hands .
They have demonstrated that humans more thoroughly inspect objects when their hands are near the object rather than farther away from it .
They posit that this processing exists because humans need to be able to analyze objects near their hands , to figure out how to handle them or to provide protection against them .
Recognizing that the location of your hands influences what you see is a new insight into the wiring of the brain , one that could lead to rethinking current rehabilitative therapy techniques and prosthetic design .
For a stroke victim trying to regain use of a paralyzed arm , just placing the good arm next to the desired object could help the injured arm grasp it .
Likewise , prosthetics could be redesigned to account for additional information flow from the hand to the brain , rather than just the brain controlling the spatial location of the prosthetic , as in today 's prosthetics .
" This is the first experiment to investigate the effect of hand position on response time for a visual search task , " said Abrams .
" In all previous visual search experiments , subjects viewed stimuli on a display and responded by manipulating buttons on a table , where their hands were far from the stimuli .
In our experiment , the subjects responded using buttons attached to the display so that their hands were next to the stimuli . "
These response times were compared with those from a typical experiment where the subjects responded by pushing buttons that were far from the display , he added .
Results were published in the June issue of Cognition .
' Mind 's eye '
Using an experiment called visual search , the researchers had subjects look through four or eight letters on a computer monitor , searching for either an S or an H .
When they found the letter , the subjects responded by pressing one of two buttons , located either on the sides of the monitor or on their laps .
The subjects ' search rate was slower when their hands were on the side of the monitor than on their laps , meaning that they were slower to turn their attention from one item to the next .
Abrams interprets the results to mean that there is an inherent mechanism in the human brain that forces us to move our attention , or " mind 's eye , " more slowly from one object to the next when the objects are near our hands .
We are required to evaluate these objects more carefully because they are the only candidates for manipulation or possible harm .
Not only do we see items differently when our hands are near them , we also process the meaning of language differently , Abrams said .
Other experiments showed that when reading nonsensible sentences , subjects were less likely to realize that the sentences were illogical when their hands were near the display .
This means that humans are less likely to recognize errors when we are holding the something we are reading .
" If you are reading for enjoyment , put your hands near the display , " he said .
" You are going to be less likely to notice , and be distracted by , typographical errors or anomalous sentences .
If you are proofreading , put your hands in your lap because you 're more likely to detect those incorrect sentences . "
Abrams compares this new mode of information processing to the robotic arm on a space shuttle .
The camera on the end of the arm sends an image to the operator about its surroundings , allowing the operator to guide the arm into position . "
The engineers who designed the arm knew that positioning it would be easier if they had the camera right in hand , " he said .
" What we did n't know until now was that humans have a mechanism for doing this , too . "

Like many others I decided to quit waiting for a decent electric road bike at a reasonable price , so I built one out of a spare bike I bought off eBay for about $ 700 .
I based mine on a ' 82 Yamaha turbo because 1 ) I have the ICE version ( hence the spare ) , 2 ) I like that it is fully faired so it looks ' normal ' and 3 ) it 's a shaft drive and one of my main goal was to make it as maintenance free as possible .
Shaft drives weigh a lot more and are not as efficient as chain drives , but they are maintenance free .
Here is a picture of the finished product .
Like Stryker ( who built the 72 volt version ) I live close to work so distance was not an issue , but speed and performance were , as I have over 3 miles of a rather steep curvy road to go home on .
One big thing to consider when doing this is the finished product .
Like Stryker I am using AGM sealed lead - acid batteries because of convenience .
But since I like the final product so much my goal has always been to upgrade it to some Li-Ion or Ni-MHyd batteries as soon as the become commercially available .
It would shave 100 lbs off and give me twice the range , so it 's an investment worth making .
Do you remember the scene in Casablanca when , to drown out the obnoxious Germans , Paul Henreid ’s character leads the regulars of Rick ’s in singing “ La Marseillaise ” ?
If not , it ’s on YouTube .
Sure , it ’s overdone , and we live in a time when many find displays of nationalism very suspicious , myself included .
But we must remember that several of the actors , including those playing the jovial waiter Carl and the vulpine Major Strasser , were refugees who fled Europe when the Nazis became randy for lebensraum .
The tears the young Frenchwoman sheds on camera were apparently very real .
So when Victor Laszlo cues up the band and the whole bar sings the French anthem , I ca n’t help but think that , in this melodrama of melodramas , for a moment the emotion becomes completely transparent .
“ La Marseillaise ” becomes not a symbol of France , but of Europe ’s defiance in the face of tyranny .
It is not the world of Bogie , but that of Paul Henreid ’s resistance leader that Alan Furst has made his own in 10 prewar espionage novels .
Everyone who writes about Furst says so , but it ’s unavoidably true : he is a master of atmosphere .
In reading three of his previous novels — Kingdom of Shadows , Blood of Victory , and The Foreign Correspondent — I was continually struck by how a constellation of perfectly chosen details make an authentic 1930s Europe .
Furst ’s latest , The Spies of Warsaw , has convinced me that the mystique of his world can be summed up in one word : valise .
“ Suitcase ” is a real clunker of a word , and unfortunately ours is a world of suitcases .
“ Valise , ” though , instantly conjures leather and cigarettes , cold train stations and opulent hotels , restlessness and the ability to disappear at a moment ’s notice .
The Irish novelist John Banville calls this “ the fraudulence of fiction ” : the ability of the perfect word or description to make a fictional world seem true , even if the author and reader have no firsthand experience of that world .
It ’s this pleasing fraudulence that keeps me reading Alan Furst .
That , and the really great sex scenes .
We meet our hero , Colonel Mercier , the French military attaché recently arrived in Poland , warming up for one such engagement .
He is the weekend guest of the prince and princess — minor nobility , but who cares — whose country house “ had three tennis courts , for the noble Brosowicz couple … did n’t have one of anything . ”
Tennis overtaxes his knee , injured in the First World War , so Mercier takes a warm shower , only to be surprised when the princess pulls back the curtain .
Furst makes what could have been a clichéd interlude plausibly erotic through descriptive understatement and a bit of detached humor : as she steps into the shower , she hands Mercier “ the lavender soap .
Only a princess , he thought , would join a man in the shower but disdain the use of the guest soap . ”
If you think this too rich , relax .
Furst does not dally too long in Barbara Cartland territory , nor does he let The Spies of Warsaw fall into the familiar intercept / intercourse pattern of Bond movies .
One of the great pleasures of this novel , and of espionage fiction in general , is the spy ’s removal from everyday responsibilities and moral codes .
Mercier ’s affair leads nowhere and is never spoken of again , so the tennis is really the important thing .
It is part of Mercier ’s establishment in Warsaw society , and in this and other social gatherings
Furst displays his descriptive gift by getting the dynamics of a high - powered cocktail party exactly right in short , supple paragraphs .
Such parties are an important venue for Mercier — a name , a phrase , or a suggestion could lead to information , or even a defection .
Mercier ’s job as military attaché would probably make Bond fidget .
He is a spymaster for informants placed within German industry ; his goal to piece together Nazi plans for a tank assault on Western Europe .
The getting of the information , whether at cocktail parties or in rundown cafes on the bad side of town , is enough to keep the intrigue simmering , but in these sections the atmosphere can get a bit fuggy .
The parade of names and places from the First World War ( Petain , Pilsudski , Silesia , the Maginot Line ) comes fast and thick at times .
I love reading books that require keeping a reference book ( or Wikipedia ) open nearby , but it ’s not for everyone .
At one point a character refers in conversation to “ Salazar , the Portuguese dictator . ”
It ’s slightly awkward as dialogue , but appreciated for its clarification .
One of Mercier ’s informants is Edvard Uhl , a dumpy Prussian engineer who has fallen in love with the prostitute Mercier has led him to believe is a countess .
When Uhl is found out by the SD ( the intelligence division of the SS ) , their attempt at killing him explodes Mercier ’s web of information .
The ensuing fight between Mercier and SD agents is described with taut minimalism and a slight remove from the action that is reminiscent of Raymond Chandler .
Mercier is left slightly battered and without a key source , but the hints
Uhl provided lead him deep into Germany , where he spies on a secret tank training exercise that his superiors in the French military refuse to believe is happening .
The conventional wisdom is that , if the Nazis start were to assault France , they would not come in tanks through the forests of Belgium .
Surely , Petain and his followers believe , Hitler would not be so foolish as to repeat the mistakes of la dernière , the last time , the First World War .
But anyone who knows the history knows this is exactly what happens .
In the middle of the novel , one of Mercier ’s fellow agents laments every spy ’s predicament : “ We spend our lives waiting . ”
The dread mounts as you read the novel because you know , soon now , there will be no more waiting .
Mercier senses it , too , with characteristic elegant melancholy :
Mercier drank some champagne , then , suddenly , and for no reason he could think of , he was very conscious of the life around him , the Parisian chatter and laughter that filled the smoky air of the restaurant .
A strange awareness ; not enjoyment , more apprehension .
Like the dogs , he thought .
Sometimes , at rest , they would raise their heads , alert to something distant , then , after a moment , lie back down , always with a kind of sigh .
What would happen to these people , he wondered , if war came here ?
The First World War was the violent birth of the 20th century , but it took the Second to really destroy the old European world .
The Spies of Warsaw is an elegy for the known world ending , and Furst keeps the novel from becoming sentimental by investing his world with so much life .
The central plot as described above is only one element : there is the hapless SD officers ’ plan to kill Mercier , the defection of a charming pair of elderly Soviet agents , and , of course , the far more meaningful affair with the League of Nations lawyer ( and the promised really good sex scene ) .
The Spies of Warsaw ends with the bright energy of a drawing room scene in a classic film : all crisp suiting , clinking glasses and animated dialogue , and the sense that the story is n’t really ending .
And yet , somehow , I was disappointed on finishing the novel .
I can never put my finger on it at the time , but it ’s the same disappointment I feel whenever I finish a good genre novel — the disappointment that it has to end .
This is why there are so many series of detective or espionage fiction , I suppose .
Though his books are not a series , on occasion a secondary character or brasserie recurs .
This gives them a dim sense of connectedness , of people with convictions and choucroute in common .
After you have read a few , you can sit back and think of all his characters working simultaneously across Europe , grudging idealists with ideas worth fighting for .
Of his novels that I ’ve read , The Spies of Warsaw is Furst ’s most sweeping and visceral , tied for my favorite with Kingdom of Shadows .
One is good , but you have to read a few for that sense of authenticity , of consummate fiction , to really seep in .
That is Furst ’s most successful operation of all .
The Spies of Warsaw is published by Random House .
His website is http://www.alanfurst.net.
If you ’d like to immerse yourself in Furst ’s literary heritage , check out the anthology he edited for Modern Library Classics , The Book of Spies , which includes excerpts from Maxim Gorky , Graham Greene , and the underappreciated Charles McCarry .

Savvy consumers are familiar with the classic scam of the “ bait and switch ” – in practice if not the term itself .
My wife and I ran across it when we were shopping for our first car .
We needed a bargain and so we were attracted to the ads that promised a new Colt for only $ 9,000 ( that ’s the bait ) .
Of course when we got to the dealership they were all out of Colts with the configuration advertised , but they had plenty of others that had different options that cost several thousand dollars more ( that ’s the switch ) .
It ’s a basic and very successful form of deception , and so even though there are laws against such practices it is impossible to eliminate in all its various and more subtle forms .
It even permeates scientific , political , and other intellectual endeavors – anytime a more palatable idea or claim is put forward to represent the less acceptable truth .
Science , however , requires transparent honesty to function properly , and therefore scientific practitioners must vigilantly guard against the cognitive bait and switch .
Generic intellectual virtues incorporate this vigilance – they include the need to unambiguously define terms , to make claims as specific and operational as possible , and the use of valid logic .
Beware of any claims that subtly violate these rules because they are probably setting you up for a bait and switch .
The purveyors of unscientific medical claims have become as expert at this classic deception as the slickest used - car salesman – in fact they have left the hawkers of dubious transportation in the dust .
Practitioners of health fraud , unscientific and sectarian medical practices have learned how to apply the bait and switch at multiple levels – with respect to specific modalities and at higher categorical levels .
First I will address some of the more common sectarian practices and show how they apply this deception , whether consciously or out of intellectual sloppiness .
Chiropractic
Chiropractic is perhaps the most common and egregious example of the bait and switch in medicine .
The deception begins with the name itself – “ chiropractic ” fails the basic test of transparency because it is not unambiguously defined .
There are in fact numerous professions doing very different things and employing mutually exclusive philosophies under the banner of “ chiropractic . ”
Therefore someone may go to see a chiropractor and think they will be seeing a medical professional who will treat their musculoskeletal symptoms , but in reality they will see the practitioner of a cult philosophy of energy healing .
So - called “ straight ” chiropractors ( who make up an estimated 30 % of all chiropractors ) still adhere to the original philosophy of chiropractic invented by “ magnetic healer ” D.D. Palmer , which is based upon the claim that an undetected life energy called “ innate intelligence ” flows through the spinal cord and nerves and is responsible for health .
Such chiropractors will treat any disease or ailment with spinal manipulation .
Most other so called “ mixer ” chiropractors reject the notion of innate intelligence either partially or entirely , but still incorporate other pseudosciences into their practice .
Chiropractors are the primary practitioners of homeopathy , applied kinesiology , and iridology in the US .
The bait – claims that chiropractors are medical practitioners with expertise in the musculoskeletal system .
The switch – practitioners of discredited pseudosciences that have nothing to do with the musculoskeletal system .
A more subtle form of the bait and switch among chiropractors is the treatment of musculoskeletal symptoms with standard physical therapy or sports medicine practices under the name of chiropractic manipulation .
Ironically , the more honest and scientific practitioners among chiropractors are most likely to commit this subtle deception .
The problem comes not from the treatment itself but the claim that such treatments are “ chiropractic . ”
Using techniques like massage , range of motion exercises , strength - building exercises , and mobilization of joints are all legitimate science - based techniques used by physical therapists and physicians with specialties in physiatry , orthopedics , and sports medicine .
Some chiropractors also use similar techniques - and with good results .
But by doing so and calling it “ chiropractic ” it legitimizes the pseudoscientific practices that are very common within the profession – like treating non-existent “ subluxations ” in order to free up the flow of innate intelligence .
Acupuncture
Many studies of acupuncture employ this latter form of bait and switch – studying something that is not really acupuncture but calling it acupuncture and thereby legitimizing pure pseudoscience .
Acupuncture refers to a Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) pre-scientific philosophy of health and illness that is based ( very similarly to straight chiropractic ) on the flow of life energy called “ chi ” .
Fine needles are inserted into special locations on the body called meridians for the purpose of improving , freeing , and balancing the flow chi .
No study has demonstrated that chi exists , or that acupuncture of the meridians has any specific effect .
A look at the entirety of the acupuncture literature , in fact , clearly demonstrates that it does not matter where the needles are placed ( or how deeply , or if they are manipulated in ways that are designed to manipulate chi ) .
This means that any effects of sticking acupuncture needles into a patient are non-specific – they are not related to the flow of chi .
There may be some small non-specific physiological effects – such as counter - irritation reducing pain or inhibiting nausea – but even these claims remain elusive and controversial .
But some studies of “ acupuncture ” show a larger and more reliable effect , usually on pain .
What these studies have in common is that they employ “ electrical acupuncture ” ( for example ) .
Electrical acupuncture , however , is not acupuncture – it ’s transdermal electrical stimulation , which is a scientific practice that has proven efficacy in the treatment of pain .
Giving transdermal electrical stimulation through acupuncture needles , calling that “ electrical acupuncture ” and then using positive results to conclude that acupuncture works – is an elaborate bait and switch .
Homeopathy and Herbal Medicine
Homeopathy is another dubious practice based upon pre-scientific notions long discredited .
A truly homeopathic remedy is diluted to the point that no active ingredients remain – so a homeopathic remedy is pure solvent , either water or alcohol , sometimes placed on a sugar pill ( making a homeopathic pill a literal placebo ) .
But much of the public believes that “ homeopathic ” simply means “ natural ” or “ herbal ” .
Few realize that it means that the so - called medicine contains nothing .
But some homeopathic products are not even truly homeopathic – meaning they are not based upon homeopathic principles but rather contain measurable amounts of real drugs .
This is now not uncommon for over - the - counters lotions and cold remedies .
For example , this pimple cream contains many active ingredients at a “ 1 x ” dilution – that ’s only 1:10 , meaning there is still actual molecules of drugs in the cream .
That ’s not homeopathic .
A similar and more subtle deception is used in the marketing of herbs .
They are sold and regulated as “ natural supplements ” when in fact they are drugs .
Herbs contain chemicals that have pharmacological activity and they are usually taken in doses that are insignificant in terms of their nutritional content , but are significant in terms of their pharmacological activity .
The bait is that they are nutritional supplements , the switch is that they are unpurified drugs .
CAM – the Biggest Bait and Switch
All of these modalities fall under an artificial category – so called “ complementary and alternative ” medicine ( CAM ) or “ integrative ” medicine that was created as the ultimate bait and switch .
The deception is largely two - fold .
The first is to include modalities within this false category that are legitimate , like nutrition , exercise , physical therapy , relaxation , etc. , – and then claim that these legitimize the entire category of CAM , even the far - out stuff like homeopathy .
This is just a higher - order version of including physical therapy modalities within the umbrella of chiropractic , for example .
Essentially , at every level terms are used that are vague and poorly defined , and in practice are designed to be all - inclusive so that the purely pseudoscientific can ride on the coattails of the barely plausible or even the legitimate .
This is the opposite of what happens within scientific disciplines – where terminology evolves over time to become more discriminating , unambiguous , and specific .
To take an example from my specialty , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) has been divided into sub-diagnoses : relapsing remitting and chronic progressive .
Divisions multiplied and now there are seven subtypes – for example , primary progressive , and progressive remitting .
This increased “ splitting ” as it is called is not just a pedantic dedication to precision , but a recognition that such divisions may reflect differences in underlying mechanism of the disease .
Also , different subtypes of MS respond differently to different treatments .
Some drugs work in relapsing remitting but not in primary progressive .
Part of the motivation for finer categories is to more accurately predict which MS patients are likely to respond to which treatments .
Contrast this to the maximally broad and imprecise but common marketing slogan “ chiropractic works . ”
The second kind of deception created by the category of CAM is in the language used itself – “ complementary ” and “ integrative . ”
What , exactly , are CAM modalities integrating ?
On close examination it is quite clear – the movement is an effort to mix unscientific , disproved , and dubious modalities into scientific medicine .
The bait is that CAM offers legitimate alternatives , the switch is that it primarily promotes treatments that do n’t work or are at best untested and highly implausible .
If there were truth in marketing then we would have the Office of Implausible Medicine , the Journal of Bad Medical Science , the Center for Rejected Therapies , and the Institute of Dubious Medical Claims – all under the umbrella of unscientific medicine .
It used to be called , even more simply , “ health fraud . ”
Conclusion
The public would be best served if they were given a reasonable expectation of honesty and clarity in the health marketplace .
Instead , increasingly they are being given the old bait and switch , and increasingly the governments and institutions of medicine that should know better are instruments of this deception .
Science and intellectual honesty require that terms mean something specific and definable .
Unscientific health modalities have become very savvy at using terminology to confuse rather than inform , to deceive rather than to illuminate .
It is the simplest form of the bait and switch – just call a product or service something that it is n’t .

Firstly , my thanks to Million Dollar Journey and their entry Confessions of a Car Salesman which discusses negotiating techniques used by used car salesman .
Reading that blog got me thinking on the topic of negotiation .
Through my travels , I have often been fascinated by cultural attitudes towards negotiation .
In a number of places in the world , prices are flexible .
They can be negotiated , bartered or otherwise influenced .
Some individuals are raised in a culture of negotiation .
They always try to talk their way to a different price .
Many of us in North America have been raised in a culture of price tags .
What we see is what it costs .
We look for sales and can try to maximize our value through those , but ultimately , we pay the listed price .
Now , is this bad ?
Not necessarily .
It means that in day - to - day life , you do n’t have to worry about negotiating .
However , in a few remaining areas of North American life , negotiating is common and almost required .
These areas include buying cars , arranging salaries and asking for raises , and buying houses .
Also , in a not so coincidental way , areas such as these are ones in which many of us feel uncomfortable .
Why do we have issues with negotiating ?
There are a multitude of reasons .
First and foremost , for many of us it comes down to issues of appearances .
If we negotiate , we can feel poor or vulnerable .
I have had the privilege of witnessing master negotiators at work , and they let no sense of shame interfere in their bargaining process .
They will claim poverty , starvation , the need to support a family and many other items as they push the price in the direction they want .
Frankly , a good negotiation between two skilled parties is a fascinating spectacle .
Not all negotiations are showy and loud though , everyone has a different style of negotiating that can work for them .
We need to look past the “ price tag culture ” in which many of us have been raised in order to see the benefits that lie in negotiating .
A fraction of a percentage point lower interest rates for a mortgage can lead to savings of thousands of dollars over time .
A few well placed words can cut hundreds or even thousands of dollars off of a car .
Price tags make simple things like shopping trips to the grocery store faster and more convenient .
However , by accepting prices on the larger ticket items , we often might be throwing our hard - earned money away .
So , look past any insecurities you might have on the topic , and examine the benefits you might receive from negotiating .
Rather than sacrificing any self - esteem , you might end up thousands of dollars ahead for putting in a little time .
As a good starting point , take a look at the entry on Million Dollar Journey , it can help you see just how easily we get sold up on prices , and how we can turn those tricks to our own use .
Remember , sometimes you CAN look beyond the price tag .

Print This Email This ' Operation Sentinel , ' a project of the New York Police Department which would have every vehicle in Manhattan tracked by a series of license plate scanners , is cause for fury among some New York City residents .
Details of the program were reported by RAW STORY on August 12 .
A similar security grid is being developed for Washington , D.C .
In an August 19 report , BBC's Wendy Urquhart found that while some are accepting of the plan 's invasive measures , others are not taking the news so lightly .
" It is a comprehensive security program to protect the lower Manhattan area -- indeed , all of Manhattan -- from vehicle - born explosive devices , " said Ray Kelly , New York City 's police commissioner .
He added that data gathered by the system will be expunged within 30 days unless police have use for it .
" This is more like being under communist reign , instead of being in a free country and being able to choose where you want to go , when you want to go , and not be monitored at all times , " said a NYC man interviewed by the BBC .
" I do n't think it 's right . "
" I mean , if you do n't have anything to worry about , you wo n't worry , " argued another interviewee .
" Now , if you 're trying to hide something and they scan your license plate , you have a problem then , there 's good reason . "
Despite assurances from police and city officials that the thousands of cameras are for the benefit of residents , convincing New Yorkers to accept the plan ' wo n't be easy , ' says Urquhart .

It 's common knowledge that the planet is warming , ice caps are melting , and water levels are rising .
The international scientific community predicts that a temperature elevation of 1 °C will lead to a water rise of 1 meter , resulting in massive land loss and the displacement of millions of people world wide .
Vincent Callebaut , a visionary Belgian architect , is responding to this inevitability with his proposal LILYPAD , A Floating Ecopolis for Ecological Refugees .

LILYPAD is touted by Callebaut as a prototypical auto - sufficient amphibious city ... a tenable solution to the rising water levels .
In addition to providing housing for those displaced by the transforming land / water relationships , LILYPAD also produces sustainable energy for developed regions .
Aerial views over the Maldivian Atolls
Entirely autosufficient , Lilypad takes up the four main challenges launched by the OECD in March 2008 : climate , biodiversity , water and health .
LILYPAD is a true amphibian - half aquatic and half terrestrial city - able to accommodate 50,000 inhabitants and inviting the biodiversity to develop its fauna and flora around a central lagoon of soft water collecting and purifying the rain waters .
This artificial lagoon is entirely immersed , ballasting the city .
It enables inhabitants to live in the heart of the sub aquatic depths .
The multi functional program is based on three marinas and three mountains dedicated to work , shopping and entertainment .
The whole set is covered by a stratum of planted housing in suspended gardens and crossed by a network of streets and alleyways with organic outline .
The goal is to create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature , exploring new modes of cross-cultural aquatic living .
The floating structure is " branches " of the Ecopolis inspired of the highly ribbed leave of the giant lilypad of the Amazonia Victoria Regia

The floating structure of the Ecopolis is directly inspired of the highly ribbed leave of the great lilypad of Amazonia Victoria Regia .
The double skin is made of polyester fibers covered by a layer of titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) like an anatase which by reacting to the ultraviolet rays enable to absorb the atmospheric pollution by photocatalytic effect .
The three mountains are ecological niches , aquaculture fields and biologic corridors
The main deck with the three marinas , the submarine performing arts center and the gardens of phytopurification .
LILYPAD reaches a positive energetic balance with zero carbon emission by the integration of all the renewable energies ( solar , thermal and photovoltaic energies , wind energy , hydraulic , tidal power station , osmotic energies , phytopurification , biomass ) , producing more energy than it consumes .
To adapt to the changing ocean flows resulting from the hydro climatic factors , LILYPAD makes direct reference to Jules Verne 's literature , the alternative possibility of a multicultural floating Ecopolis whose metabolism would be in perfect symbiosis with the cycles of nature .
Vincent Callebaut
In 2000 , Vincent Callebaut , 23 years old , graduated with the Great Architecture Prize René Serrure awarding the best diploma project at the Institute Victor Horta in Brussels for its Parisian project Metamuseum of Arts and Civilisations Quay Branly .
Then , thanks to the bursary Leonardo da Vinci attributed by the European Community , he decided to live in Paris to extend its critical thinking and its spatial inventiveness during two years of internship in agencies that fascinate him ( Odile Decq Benoit Cornette Architectes Urbanistes , Massimiliano Fuksas ) .
In 2001 , he competed in box and won the Grand Architecture Prize Napoléon Godecharle of the Académie Royale des Beaux - Arts of Brussels awarding the best hope of the Belgian architecture with its ecological project Elasticity , an aquatic city of 50 000 inhabitants entirely autonomous .
The jury appreciated at the same time his dynamism , his expression force and the coherence of his concept , and recognised a personality endowed with a remarkable aptitude giving well - founded expectations of great success and able thus to contribute to the fact that reputation of Belgium becomes a truth .
In 2005 , he was the finalist of the RE - New Architecture Pleasures awarding the 12 best figures of the Architecture in the French Community of Belgium .
During the same year , the Edition Company Damdi of Seoul dedicated him at the age of 28 its first architecture monograph detailing the story of its awarded and exhibited projects during worldwide spontaneous proposals and international competitions .
Since then , in the framework of his agency and great collaborations ( Jakob + MacFarlane , Claude Vasconi , Jacques Rougerie ) , he militates continuously for the long lasting development of the new Ecopolis via parasitical strategies for an investigation architecture mixing biology to information and communication technologies
From New York to Hong Kong crossing Brussels and Paris , Vincent Callebaut proposes with determination and conviction prospective and ecological projects by insufflating locally dialogs and meetings that try to raise our questionings on the society in which we live as citizen of a global world !

Protesters disrupt Bush 's July 4th address at Monticello RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 4 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush delivered a July 4th address before a naturalization ceremony for new citizens at Thomas Jefferson 's home of Monticello that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who called out " war criminal " and " impeach Bush . "
According to news accounts , " shouts from protesters were heard during Bush 's remarks , " while a transcript notes repeated occurrences all through the speech of " Audience disturbance , " " Audience interruption , " and " Audience interruption continues . "
" Protesters made it hard to hear President Bush Friday , " Fox News reported .
According to Virginia 's News Leader , " Lee Catlin , community relations director for the Albemarle County , said six protesters were asked to leave the ceremony , " but none were arrested .
The paper reported , " A Monticello spokesperson said that protesters were allowed to express their views unless they blocked views or passageways .
He said that Monticello has no plans at this time to press charges against the six who were removed from the museum grounds . "
At his AfterDowningStreet.org website , activist David Swanson explains why he and others " interrupted Bush at Monticello . "
" When Bush opened his mouth to speak I shouted ' Defend the Constitution , Impeach Bush ! ' "
Swanson writes .
" I repeated that several times , as people nearby knocked me over , cops handcuffed me , people gave me smiles and thumbs up signs .
They threw me out and a couple of more defenders of our Constitution behind me , and then a few more , and then a few more .
The handcuffed citizens who'd done their duty kept coming down the hill .
They did not arrest us but did give us a ride down the mountain where we joined a crowd of protesters in the road who greeted Bush 's limo coming and going . "
Swanson links to a page devoted to Ohio Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's 35 Articles of Impeachment against President Bush to explain " why . "
Kucinich released a July 4th message asking for help in restoring the " rule of law in America . "
RAW STORY has more at this link .
The following video , uploaded to YouTube by Swanson , was credited to S. Johnson and shows " footage of Gael Murphy , Desiree Fairooz , and Linda Lisanti , who were at Monticello :
So Sue Me! So Sue Me !
The great minds at the Republican National Committee are once again demonstrating their transcendent grasp of marketing , finance , and public relations .
In an action so preposterously witless as to scramble the common cranium , the GOP has sent a “ cease and desist ” letter to CafePress citing trademark infringement on the part of sellers using the term “ GOP ” or the elephant logo .
Attorney Paul Alan Levy of Public Citizen is representing CafePress and wrote this on the CLP Blog :
“ [ W ]e might ask why the RNC has chosen an election year to try to suppress speech about the Republican Party , especially since many of the images are highly favorable to their cause .
Many of the CafePress users appear to be Republican grassroots activists .
Is this the right year for RNC staff members to start going after their own supporters ? ”
Asking the RNC why they are trying to suppress speech is like asking why tobacco companies add nicotine to cigarettes – the only way you can get people to consume either one is to artificially manipulate their behavior .
Tobacco companies do it with addictive chemicals .
Republicans do it with message control and censorship .
Ironically , this harebrained scheme can only work to the disadvantage of Republican allies .
The First Amendment guarantee of free speech , along with “ fair use ” and the legal protection for parody , insure that any critical use of the trademarked properties is permitted .
Only those who are using the properties favorably would be subject to litigation because it would be more likely to result in confusion with the RNC ’s own favorable use .
So the GOP ’s action punishes their friends while having no impact whatsoever on opponents .
This is the same pack of idiots that got us mired in a war in Iraq ; that ran our economy into the ground ; and that want to persuade us that John McCain ought to be our next president .

McCain is trying to make energy the centerpiece of his campaign , but his efforts seem to be a little clumsy .
First he did a complete about - face on offshore oil drilling and decided to support it , despite voting against it in the past .
Then he tried to blame Obama for high gas prices , running an ad that was universally panned as being full of lies .
Now he is turning the McCain magic onto nuclear power .
But as usual he can’t keep his story straight :
McCain calls for the construction of 45 new nuclear power plants , but without a plan for how to deal with the nuclear waste .
Nevada is a swing state that McCain must win , but the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain is a touchy issue for Nevada voters .
So McCain tells the people of Nevada that he is against the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain , even though you were previously an enthusiastic supporter of storing waste at Yucca Mountain , and ignoring the fact that some kind of storage will be needed , especially if you are going to build lots more nuclear plants .
As the Las Vegas Sun put it “ If a man told you for years that he did n’t love you , essentially had no regard for you at all , and then suddenly , when he needed you , told you he adored you , would you fall for it ? ”
When that did n’t work , McCain did yet another about face , and said at a campaign stop in Nevada that he was for storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain .
Now , what makes this all ironic is that McCain made his big speech about building new nuclear power plants at the Enrico Fermi nuclear power generating station in Monroe , Michigan .
This is the power plant that partially melted down in 1966 , leading to the coining of the now - infamous term “ China Syndrome ” , and was memorialized in a book and a song both titled “ We Almost Lost Detroit ” .
McCain might claim that nuclear power is now much safer than it was back in 1966 , except that the newer Fermi II reactor at the plant experienced a radiation leak in 2005 , and the older ( now decomissioned but still radioactive ) Fermi I reactor caught fire just this past May .
And to add a dash of hypocrisy , McCain opposes the transportation of nuclear waste through Arizona — his home state — on its way to Yucca Mountain .
Those are great questions ...
For an expert to ask ( him|her ) self .
But what do they mean for someone that is just learning the language ?
Here is my attempt to answer you questions from the POV of a novice : 1 . Does it work correctly ?
Um , I guess so .
It seems to work ?
I can not think of anything wrong with it ; can you ?
2 . Do you understand it ?
Somewhat .
I think I understand it , maybe ...
Is there something I am missing ?
3 . Would anyone else understand it ?
FIIK , a ) I am not someone else , so how should I know what someone else thinks .
b)
I just learned this myself , and this is the way I learned it .
4 . Will you understand it in a month 's time ?
I hope so .
5 . Does it strike a good balance between terseness and verbosity ?
FIIK !
This is like asking a 5 year old whether War and Peace strikes a good balance between terseness and verbosity .
One must have sufficient mastery over the material to be able to judge .
6 . Could you make changes to it without it being likely to break in unforeseen ways ?
Good Question , how would I go about finding this out ?
What are the unforeseen ways ?
7 . Is it fast enough ?
Is there a faster way to do it ?
I think the novice has to own the problem domain .
He knows what problem he 's trying to solve and the context in which it will be run .
Given this , I 'd respond as follows ( if it were me who asked the original questions ) : 1 . Does it work correctly ?
Um , I guess so .
It seems to work ?
I cannot think of anything wrong with it ; can you ?
I really think , here that you have to understand what you want the program to do .
You need to understand the straight - down - the - center as well as the corner cases and , if you do n't grok the code , at least have some tests you can run .
2 . Do you understand it ?
Somewhat .
I think I understand it , maybe ...
Is there something I am missing ?
This is , of course , subjective .
If you do n't get the basic principles , RTFM a bit and get some understanding -- you may have already done this , I do n't know .
Trace through the code by hand with some data and see if you think it does what you think it 's supposed to .
Add some ' print ' statements to verify .
You may , depending on the original advice , come to a better understanding of side - effects and such at a later time .
That 's okay .
3 . Would anyone else understand it ?
FIIK , a ) I am not someone else , so how should I know what someone else thinks .
b)
I just learned this myself , and this is the way I learned it .
4 . Will you understand it in a month 's time ?
I hope so .
To address 3 . and 4 . , together , I think these are really meant to ask : is the code readable ?
Are the variable names clear ?
Is the style easily read ?
Did you comment it well ?
I find that , when I 'm learning something , I comment the holy snot out of it , explaining every detail as I think I understand it .
If I learned something when I wrote the code , I make darned sure that someone else with the same level of experience I had when I started would understand the code .
5 . Does it strike a good balance between terseness and verbosity ?
FIIK !
This is like asking a 5 year old whether War and Peace strikes a good balance between terseness and verbosity .
One must have sufficient mastery over the material to be able to judge .
No , I think this is more like asking a 12 year old whether the New York Times strikes a good balance between terseness and verbosity .
It 's a stretch but it 's a good thing to consider .
The answer may stray away for what an experienced programmer would say but that 's okay .
6 . Could you make changes to it without it being likely to break in unforeseen ways ?
Good Question , how would I go about finding this out ?
What are the unforeseen ways ?
Again with the RTFMing and the tracing of the code .
This requires deeper understanding than do the other points .
Give it a go , though .
Look at side - effects .
Try funkified data as an input .
Always check the corner cases .
To figure out what the corner cases are , look at the expectation of the data .
If the code is expecting numbers , try characters .
How does the code respond to a gigantic amount of input or none at all ?
7 . Is it fast enough ?
Is there a faster way to do it ?
The answer is ' probably ' but that 's not the question you should be asking .
Does the program run fast enough to fulfill your needs .
Writing something faster than that often requires sacrificing readability and that would be a bad thing .
Update : fixed a typo
Wade --
This was in the context of a novice asking an expert , ' is this correct ' .
The point I was trying to make is that the novice may not be able to answer the questions with certainty but an expert can .
Have you ever met a student who walked out of an exam thinking s/he made an ' A ' on an exam , only to find out that the actual grade was an ' F ' ?
Sometimes everything can look correct and act correct ( to the best of the knowledge of the novice ) , but is obviously incorrect when viewed at through the eyes of an expert .
And , at least from my point of view , for the novice it is much more helpful to know hat something is done correctly rather than spending many hours trying to make sure it is correct -- and still not being convinced .
Self - study is infinitely harder when you do not have the answers to the problems to verify your understanding .
Novice has to own the problem domain .
Thank you , this is the smartest thing I heard on this site , for what , last several months , on this site .
wade has given an excellent reply already , but there are a couple of things I 'd like to elaborate on .
2 . Do you understand it ? is in large part addressing cargo cult programming .
Copying code is often a good way to get a job done and to learn along the way .
It can also be a excellent way to pick up bad habits , lay nasty traps and generate incomprehensible code .
5 . Does it strike a good balance between terseness and verbosity ?
I would expect to change over time in two ways :
As a project evolves cruft can generally be removed through refactoring .
That most often reduces verbosity .
As programmers become more experienced they tend to learn programming styles that reduce verbosity .
The key element in this question however is the balance .
Both extremes are bad .
The balance may shift over time , but the question should prompt you to find a balance you are comfortable with .
Perl is environmentally friendly - it saves trees
A reply falls below the community 's threshold of quality .
You may see it by logging in .
I have to agree with tantarbobus on this .
Some of the points raised are very difficult for a novice to evaluate .
I think that ' does the code not do something it is n't meant to do ' question is important as part of the ' does it work ' question .
( This is effectively asking the question , is the code within spec . )
At a very simple level , most of us novices are monumentally relieved when we get a regexp to match at all .
At last it works !
However , how many perl novices then check whether that regexp matches what it ought n't to ?
I guess this is where testing comes in and being able to effecitively test something is part general programming experience and part specific language experience .
I have n't yet used the Test module yet because I feel I have n't written anything needing it yet .
I also feel there is definitely a particular mindset to be adopted to be able to write terse but informative perl code .
My code is verbose and I would love to be able to improve its terseness but I do n't yet know how .
Giving a novice along a few breadcrumbs along the trail is no bad thing .
It is up to that individual to commit the time to learning but having guides along the way does help tremendously .
My first reaction was similar to yours and tantarbobus's .
I was n't thinking along the lines of " a novice would have trouble grading themselves on this scale " but rather " a novice would have no motivation to do so . "
It 's not that I do n't think the list is good - in fact , I think it is great - It 's that one has to be burned by many of these things before they care about them .
Does it work ?
I 'm trying to think honestly how vigorously I tested for and checked edge / corner cases for correctness before my programs blew up in my face a few times .
The answer : Not very much .
Will I be able to read it later ?
Again , not something I cared about before I had to maintain my old code months and months later .
Maybe I am on the stubborn side of the scale , but I think most novices , especially in programming , are more task driven than quality driven .
Maybe the shift towards thinking about these things , writing quality code today to save yourself tomorrow , is one of the big gulfs between novice and expert :) .
And if you contribute to a module : 8 . Is it tested ?
9 . Is it documented ?
If you can answer all of these questions with a definitive " yes " then you are either a grand - poobah Perl master or you are a liar of the double - nth degree ( that assuming the coding problem is n't a trivial one ) .
I think all of these questions have an answer on a sliding scale .
However , as a novice I have to say that it's not all that important if all of these questions can be answered toward the " yes " direction right away .
Except perhaps 3 ) and 4 ) , which I regard in the same way - you should always write code as if you will forget everything you 've done in a month .
Because I usually do - darn that lack of experience !
But I think verbosity should be encouraged in the beginning , and only after you 're comfortable doing something should you try to strike the balance you mention .
And not completely understanding code or knowing if it will work in all situations can lead to interesting lessons ( unless you have to care about security of course ) and revelations later on .
I think most would agree , especially if they are doing funny things with dependencies that they do n't know the intricate details of .
The most important thing though from your post is that you should always be asking yourself these questions , usually implicitly , for every piece of code you write .
That 's the advice I would give to fellow novices .
I personally believe , dear GrandFather , that for once you got it wrong : wrt the title , that is .
We bash newbies all the time for chosing uninformative ones .
Now , I understand perfectly well that 's not the same case , yours being a witty attempt at being ... witty : and do not misunderstand me - you succeeded !
Nevertheless , it turns out to be just as uninformative ( and search unfriendly ) as those other ones .
Thus I suggest you rename - at the expense of some verbosity - it to something like " How to answer to ' is it correct ? ' kinda questions ? " --
If you can't understand the incipit , then please check the IPB Campaign .
What about considering best practices and privacy and security concerns , etc . ?
I think your list falls a bit short .
Not such list would ever be " complete " .
It 's largely a matter of finding a balance between terseness and verbosity influenced by considering what seem to be key elements . ;)
Please , add your own item to the list .
Perl is environmentally friendly - it saves trees
Hmm .
Well , as a start I will throw out the SAGE Code of Ethics .
It 's for SysAdmins , but it 's general enough that others on here can make use if it and I think it helps stess the importance of considering security and privacy concerns .
My general approach in any software context is to give maintainability at least as much importance as functional accuracy .
In some cases , I 'd go so far as to say that maintainability is more important than correctness !
It 's easier to fix a maintainable but bugged program than it is to do anything with an accidently obfuscated program that happens to to work for last week 's requirements , but not this week's .
All common sense caveats apply .
which is why items 2 - 6 address that issue . ;)
Perl reduces
Perl reduces RSI - it saves typing
I 'd read the numbered points as an ordered list , implying that point one is the number one priority .
Maybe I 'm thinking too hard today , but read that way it 's perfectly comprehensible , and ceratinly useful for reminding people that there 's more to consider than whether anyone has complained about the results ( yet ) .
And I 'd agree with each point in the list .
However , I thought I 'd contribute the slightly contentious view that sometimes accuracy is not the number one priority .
Of course , if everyone agrees with that , then it 's not so contentious .
Bah - do n't tell me I 'm back in the mainstream again .
One of the things that I hear frequently is that educating people , particularly strangers , about veganism , is difficult .
On the contrary , our everyday interactions with people provide us with many opportunities to discuss veganism .
This essay will discuss a couple of examples .
I will discuss more examples in future essays .
For example , in January of this year , I had to take Robert , one of our dogs , to see a specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School .
There was a woman — I will refer to her as “ Jane ” for purposes of this essay but that was not her real name — sitting with me in the waiting area .
Jane had a greyhound with her .
And , as always happens when two humans are in such a place with their nonhuman companions , we got to talking about what health problems had brought us to Penn .
And that led to how Jane had adopted her dog from a rescue group and how our dog was found living under an abandoned car .
After a minute or two of discussing how horrible the greyhound racing industry is , I told Jane that I used to teach at the University of Pennsylvania many years ago , and that Penn was notorious for the horrible experiments , testing , and “ educational ” procedures that it performed on dogs and other nonhumans .
She said that she had heard about Penn ’s animal experiments and I mentioned how strange it was that one part of the building was devoted to the application of veterinary medicine to help the animals who were loved by humans and another part of the building was devoted to torturing nonhumans who were not members of anyone ’s family .
Jane made the point that it really made no sense that we treat some dogs or cats as family members and we treat some dogs and cats as “ research tools . ”
“ How true , ” I said .
“ But in many ways , we ’re all just like these Penn vets .
We treat some animals as family members and we harm others . ”
She look bewildered .
“ What do you mean ?
I would never hurt a dog or cat . ”
I moved the conversation away from dogs and cats and starting talking about cows , pigs , and chickens , and how they are really no different from dogs and cats .
There is something very strange about the fact that we regard some nonhumans as family members , as beings whom we love and whose personhood we recognize , while , at the same time , we stick forks into other animals who are no different — morally or empirically — from those whom we love .
Jane was silent for a moment and then asked , “ are you a vegetarian ? ”
“ I ’m a vegan , ” I replied .
“ You mean you do n’t even drink milk ? ” she asked .
“ That ’s right .
I do n’t eat eggs , or any dairy products . ”
“ I can understand not eating meat .
But what ’s wrong with dairy and eggs ? ”
“ Everything .
The animals used in the dairy or egg industry are kept alive longer than most of their ‘ meat ’ counterparts , are treated worse , and end up in the same horrible slaughterhouse . ”
Jane looked troubled .
“ But is n’t it really hard to be a vegan ? ” she asked .
“ Absolutely not , ” I replied .
“ It ’s unbelievably easy and it ’s better for you and for the planet , in addition to being the right thing to do if you regard nonhumans as members of the moral community . ”
I spent a few minutes talking about the health benefits of a vegan diet and the ecological disaster of an animal - based agriculture .
Our conversation stopped for about 30 seconds and then Jane asked , “ could you get me some information about how to go vegan ? ”
“ Sure .
Give me your email address . ”
She did .
We talked for a few more minutes about the wide range of vegan foods that are now available , and Robert and I were then called in to see the vet .
Jane was gone when we came out .
That afternoon , I sent Jane a number of things to read about veganism — both about the moral , health , and environmental issues concerning veganism , and some practical information on nutrition and making quick and easy vegan food .
That evening , I got a short reply , “ Thanks .
I will read these with interest . ”
Two weeks ago , I got an email from Jane — the first I have heard from her since sending her the materials .
It read , in part : “ I am about 60 % vegan already and am working toward 100 % .
I already feel better both as a matter of my spirit and my body .
I am using the vegan dog food that you recommended and she loves it !
Thanks for taking the time . ”
Veterinary hospitals and offices are always great places to start up conversations about veganism .
People are focused on their nonhuman companion and are emotionally very open to thinking more abstractly about nonhuman animals as a general matter .
I cannot recall ever being in a veterinarian ’s office ( and we have had up to seven rescued dogs at one time , so we ’ve had plenty of experience at the vet ’s office ) where I did not start up a conversation with someone that drifted to veganism .
Another great place to talk about veganism is on an airplane .
When you order any sort of special meal on a flight , those meals are usually served first .
The air host comes over and asks whether you ordered a “ special meal . ”
I always respond , “ yes , I ordered a vegan meal with no animal products whatsoever . ”
Most of the time , the person sitting next to me , or the two people sitting on either side ( if I am in a middle seat ) ask me whether I have allergies or why I have requested such a meal .
This , of course , opens the door to a discussion about why it is that I am a vegan .
Depending on the delay between getting my meal and the distribution of everyone else ’s , I have had about 20 % of the people I talk to ask the air host whether there is another vegan meal when the cart comes around .
( Actually , I never start eating my meal until the cart comes around in the event that this happens and there is no extra vegan meal as I will happily give mine to my neighbor and have done so on a number of occasions . )
Some of the best discussions I have had on animal rights and veganism have occurred on airplanes , particularly transatlantic flights .
You are stuck next to someone for about 7 hours and people are often very happy to spend at least some of that time talking with the person sitting next to them .
One of my favorite stories occurred several years ago .
I was on my way to Paris and was seated next to a woman who had a fur coat .
She was not wearing the coat , but had it against her seat .
I was reading a copy of my Introduction to Animal Rights , which , at the time , I was thinking of doing a second edition and I was considering changes that I might make .
The flight was delayed leaving Newark Airport , so we had some small talk about connecting flights that we had in Paris .
She saw my book and asked , “ is that a good book ? ” I smiled and said it was an “ excellent ” book !
She asked me if I was an “ animal rights type . ”
I replied that I was , and she spent the next 30 minutes ( during which we were still at the gate ) talking about her 2 dogs and how much she was going to miss them while on the business trip to France , etc .
And then she raised the issue of her fur coat .
She said , “ my coat must offend you .
I ’m sorry . ”
She started explaining to me that it was a “ ranch raised ” fox coat and that the animals were not caught in traps .
I explained how “ ranched ” animals are tortured as much as trapped ones , but I made the point that I found her fur coat — whether “ ranch raised ” or trapped — no more offensive than a coat made of leather or wool .
She seemed astounded by this .
“ You do n’t wear wool or leather ? ” “ No , ” I replied , “ I am a vegan . ”
I spent the next 15 minutes ( still at the gate ) explaining what veganism is and assuring her that veganism provides a wide variety of exciting and healthful food choices , and is the logical choice for anyone who cares about nonhuman animals .
I then suggested to her that the foxes that were killed to make her coat were no different from the dogs that she was very sad to be leaving behind in New York for two weeks .
We then started talking about our “ moral schizophrenia ” that affects and infects our thinking about nonhumans .
The plane took off , the meal service started , I was given my vegan meal and my neighbor asked the air host immediately whether there was an extra vegan meal on board .
There was an extra meal and she requested it .
We spent the next several hours talking about animal rights and veganism and I confessed to being the author of the book that she had asked about !
About two months after that flight , I got an email from this person .
She had given her fox coat to an animal group that would use it in anti-fur demonstrations and she had ordered Introduction to Animal Rights from Amazon.com and had read it .
She was working toward veganism , using a technique that I had suggested to her where she gave up all animal products for one meal , then for 2 meals , then 3 , and then for all snacking .
Another 2 or 3 months went by and she wrote to say that she was completely vegan .
Vegan education is challenging .
We live in a culture in which most people assume without thinking that consuming animal products is “ normal ” or “ natural . ”
Vegan education is time - intensive work ; it often means working one - on - one and spending a good deal of time .
But every day life presents us with all sorts of opportunities to educate others and the most effective opportunities are calm , friendly exchanges between two thinking human beings .
And every person who goes vegan is a vital contribution to the nonviolent revolution that will eventually shift the paradigm away from animals as property and toward animals as persons .

Maliki endorses Obama ’s Iraq strategy — by name
Americans have a clear choice in the election .
On the one hand , we have a candidate who wants a flexible , 16 - month withdrawal policy from Iraq , shaped by conditions on the ground and in consultation with commanders on the ground .
On the other hand , we have a candidate who wants the status quo to continue indefinitely , waiting for a yet - to - be - defined “ victory , ” followed by an indefinite military presence in Iraq .
And while Americans consider their options , it seems Iraqi officials have already reached their own conclusion .
Reuters has this stunning story .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki told a German magazine he supported prospective U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ’s proposal that U.S. troops should leave Iraq within 16 months .
In an interview with Der Spiegel released on Saturday , Maliki said he wanted U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible .
“ U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes . ”
It is the first time he has backed the withdrawal timetable put forward by Obama , who is visiting Afghanistan and us set to go to Iraq as part of a tour of Europe and the Middle East .
By any reasonable measure , this is pretty extraordinary .
The Bush - backed Iraqi prime minister has endorsed Obama ’s withdrawal policy , both in general and by name .
In fact , it gets better .
Maliki , hailed by Republicans , has given up on Republican talking points altogether .
Asked if he supported Obama ’s ideas more than those of John McCain , Republican presidential hopeful , Maliki said he did not want to recommend who people should vote for .
“ Whoever is thinking about the shorter term is closer to reality .
Artificially extending the stay of U.S. troops would cause problems . ”
Maliki added , “ The Americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them .
But it is n’t . ”
It ’s extraordinary .
Assuming the report is accurate , and that there was n’t some kind of translation problem , the prime minister of Iraq believes John McCain is wrong about everything — the utility of withdrawal , the notion of “ defeat , ” the extended stay , everything .
About a week ago , Maliki was publicly moving in this direction , but now he ’s dropped the pretense .
Obama , the prime minister believes , has the right policy , and McCain has the wrong one .
I ca n’t wait for a ) McCain to explain why Maliki ’s opinion about events in his own country do n’t matter ; and b ) the media to explain to me why this is good news for McCain .

TIP 1 : Is NTP Working ?
STEP 1 ( Test the current server ) :
Try issuing the following command : $ ntpq - pn remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter =================================================== tock.usno.navy 0.0.0.0 16 u - 64 0 0.000 0.000 4000.00
The above is an example of a problem .
Compare it to a working configuration .
$ ntpq - pn remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter ========================================================
+128.4.40.12 128.4.40.10 2 u 107 128 377 25.642 3.350 1.012 127.127.1.0 127.127.1.0 10 l 40 64 377 0.000 0.000 0.008 +128.91.2.13 128.4.40.12 3 u 34 128 377 21.138 6.118 0.398 * 192.5.41.41 .USNO .
1 u 110 128 377 33.69 9.533 3.534 STEP 2 ( Configure the /etc/ntp.conf ) : $ cat /etc/ntp.conf #
My simple client - only ntp configuration .
server timeserver1.upenn.edu # ping -a timeserver1.upenn.edu shows the IP address 128.91.2.13 # which is used in the restrict below restrict 128.91.2.13 server tock.usno.navy.mil restrict 192.5.41.41 server 128.4.40.12 restrict 128.4.40.12 server 127.127.1.0 # local clock fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10 driftfile / etc / ntp / drift restrict default ignore restrict 127.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 authenticate no STEP 3 ( Configure /etc/ntp/step- tickers ) :
The values for server above are placed in the " /etc/ntp/step- tickers " file $ cat /etc/ntp/step-tickers timeserver1.upenn.edu tock.usno.navy.mil 128.4.40.12
The startup script
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ntpd will grab the servers in this file and execute the ntpdate command as follows : /usr / sbin/ntpdate -s - b -p 8 timeserver1.upenn.edu
Why ?
Because if the time is off ntpd will not start .
The command above set the clock .
If System Time deviates from true time by more than 1000 seconds , then , the ntpd daemon will enter panic mode and exit .
STEP 4 ( Restart the service and check ) :
Issue the restart command / etc / init.d / ntpd restart check the values for " ntpq - pn " , which should match step 1 . ntpq -pn SPECIAL NOTE :
Time is always stored in the kernel as the number of seconds since midnight of the 1st of January 1970 UTC , regardless of whether the hardware clock is stored as UTC or not .
Conversions to local time are done at run-time .
So , it 's easy to get the time in different timezones for only the current session as follows : $ export TZ=EST $ date Mon Aug 2 10:34:04 EST 2004 $ export TZ=NET $ date Mon Aug 2 15:34:18 NET 2004
The following are possible values for TZ : Hours From Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) Value Description 0 GMT Greenwich Mean Time +1 ECT European Central Time +2 EET European Eastern Time +2 ART +3 EAT Saudi Arabia +3.5 MET
Iran +4 NET +5 PLT West Asia +5.5 IST India +6 BST Central Asia +7 VST Bangkok +8 CTT China +9 JST Japan +9.5 ACT Central Australia +10 AET
Eastern Australia +11 SST Central Pacific +12 NST New Zealand - 11 MIT Samoa - 10 HST Hawaii -9 AST Alaska -8 PST Pacific Standard Time - 7 PNT Arizona - 7 MST Mountain Standard Time -6 CST Central Standard Time - 5 EST Eastern Standard Time - 5 IET Indiana East - 4 PRT Atlantic Standard Time - 3.5 CNT Newfoundland - 3 AGT Eastern South America - 3 BET Eastern South America - 1 CAT
Azores DST timezone 0 BST for British Summer .
+400 ADT for Atlantic Daylight .
+500 EDT for Eastern Daylight .
+600 CDT for Central Daylight .
+700 MDT for Mountain Daylight .
+800 PDT for Pacific Daylight .
+900 YDT for Yukon Daylight .
+1000 HDT for Hawaii Daylight .
- 100 MEST for Middle European Summer , MESZ for Middle European Summer , SST for Swedish Summer and FST for French Summer .
- 700 WADT for West Australian Daylight .
- 1000 EADT for Eastern Australian Daylight .
- 1200 NZDT for New Zealand Daylight .
The following is an example of setting the TZ environment variable for the timezone , only when timezone changes go into effect .
$ export TZ=EST+5EDT , M4.1.0/2,M10.5.0/2
Take a look at the last line " M10.5.0/2 " .
What does it mean ?
Here is the documentation Mm.w.d
This specifies day d ( 0 < = d <= 6 ) of week w ( 1 < = w <= 5 ) of month m ( 1 <= m <= 12 ) .
Week 1 is the first week in which day d occurs and week 5 is the last week in which day d occurs .
Day 0 is a Sunday .
The time fields specify when , in the local time currently in effect , the change to the other time occurs .
If omitted , the default is 02:00:00 .
So this is what it means .
M10 stands for October , the 5 is the fifth week that includes a Sunday ( note 0 in M 10.5.0/2 is Sunday ) .
To see that it is the fifth week see the calendar below .
The time change occurs a 2 am in the morning .
( Special Note : In 2007 , DST was extended .
See TIP 230 ) .
October Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
Prove it .
Take the following program sunrise , which can calcuates sunrise and sunset for an latitude and longitude .
This program can be downloaded from the following location : http://sourceforge.net/direct-dl/mchirico/souptonuts/working_with_time.tar.gz
Below is a bash script that will run the program for the next 100 days .
#!/bin/bash # program : next100days Mike Chirico # download : # http://sourceforge.net/direct-dl/mchirico/souptonuts/working_with_time.tar.gz
# #
This will calculate the sunrise and sunset for # latitude 39.95
Note must convert to degrees # longitude 75.15
Note must convert to degrees lat=39.95 long =75.15 for ( ( i=0 ; i <= 100 ; i++ ) ) do sunrise `date -d " +$i day " " +%Y %m % d " ` $ lat $ long done Take a look at the following sample output .
$ export TZ=EST+5EDT , M4.1.0/2,M10.5.0/2 $ ./next100days Sunrise 08-24-2004 06:21:12 Sunset 08-24-2004 19:43:42 Sunrise
08-25-2004 06:22:09 Sunset 08-25-2004 19:42:12 Sunrise 08-26-2004 06:23:06 Sunset 08-26-2004 19:40:41 Sunrise 08-27-2004 06:24:03 Sunset 08-27-2004 19:39:09 Sunrise
08-28-2004 06:25:00 Sunset 08-28-2004 19:37:37 Sunrise 08-29-2004 06:25:56 Sunset 08-29-2004 19:36:04 Sunrise 08-30-2004 06:26:53 Sunset 08-30-2004 19:34:31 Sunrise 08-31-2004 06:27:50 Sunset 08-31-2004 19:32:57 Sunrise 09-01-2004 06:28:46 Sunset 09-01-2004 19:31:22 Sunrise 09-02-2004 06:29:43 Sunset 09-02-2004 19:29:47 ..[ values omitted ]
Sunrise 10-28-2004 07:25:31 Sunset 10-28-2004 18:02:34 Sunrise 10-29-2004 07:26:38 Sunset 10-29-2004 18:01:19 Sunrise
10-30-2004 07:27:46 Sunset 10-30-2004 18:00:06 Sunrise 10-31-2004 06:28:53 Sunset 10-31-2004 16:58:54 Sunrise 11-01-2004 06:30:01 Sunset 11-01-2004 16:57:44 Sunrise 11-02-2004 06:31:10 Sunset 11-02-2004 16:56:35 Compare 10-30-2004 with 10-31-2004 .
Sunrise is an hour earlier because daylight saving time has ended , just as predicted .
There is an easier way to switch between timezones .
Take a look at the directory zoneinfo as follows : $ ls /usr / share / zoneinfo Africa Chile Factory Iceland Mexico posix UCT America CST6CDT GB Indian Mideast posixrules Universal Antarctica Cuba GB - Eire Iran MST PRC US Arctic EET GMT iso3166.tab MST7MDT PST8PDT UTC Asia Egypt GMT0 Israel Navajo right WET Atlantic Eire GMT - 0 Jamaica NZ ROC W-SU Australia EST GMT+0 Japan NZ - CHAT ROK zone.tab Brazil EST5EDT
Greenwich Kwajalein Pacific Singapore Zulu Canada Etc Hongkong Libya Poland SystemV CET Europe HST MET Portugal Turkey TZ can be set to any one of these files .
Some of these are directories and contain subdirectories , such as ./posix / America .
This way you don not have to enter the timezone , offset , and range for dst , since it has already been calculated .
$ export TZ=:/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/America/Aruba $ export TZ=:/usr/share/zoneinfo/Egypt

Also see ( TIP 27 ) .
Also see ( TIP 103 ) using chrony which is very similiar to ntpd .
Note time settings can usually be found in /etc / sysconfig / clock TIP 2 : cpio works like tar , only better .
STEP 1 ( Create two directories with data ../ dir1 an ../dir2 ) mkdir -p ../dir1 mkdir -p ../dir2 cp /etc/*.conf ../dir1 /. cp
/etc/*.cnf ../dir2 / .
Which will backup all your cnf and conf files .
STEP 2 ( Piping the files to tar ) cpio works like tar but can take input from the " find " command .
$ find ../ dir1 / | cpio -o -- format=tar > test.tar or $ find ../ dir1 / | cpio -o - H tar > test2.tar
Same command without the " > " $ find ../ dir1 / | cpio -o -- format=tar -F test.tar or $ find ../ dir1 / | cpio -o - H tar -F test2.tar Using append $ find ../ dir1 / | cpio -o -- format=tar -F test.tar or $ find ../ dir2 / | cpio -o -- format=tar -- append -F test. tar STEP 3 ( List contents of the tar file ) $ cpio - it < test .
tar or $ cpio - it -F test .
tar STEP 4 ( Extract the contents ) $ cpio - i -F test .
tar TIP 3 : Working with tar .
The basics with encryption .
STEP 1 ( Using the tar command on the directory / stuff ) Suppose you have a directory / stuff
To tar everything in stuff to create a " .tar " file .
$ tar - cvf stuff .
tar stuff
Which will create " stuff.tar " .
STEP 2 ( Using the tar command to create a " .tar.gz " of / stuff ) $ tar - czf stuff.
tar.gz stuff STEP 3 ( List the files in the archive ) $ tar - tzf stuff .
tar.gz or $ tar - tf stuff .
tar STEP 4 ( A way to list specific files )
Note , pipe the results to a file and edit $ tar - tzf stuff .
tar.gz > mout
Then , edit mout to only include the files you want $ tar - T mout - xzf stuff.tar.gz
The above command will only get the files in mout .
Of couse , if you want them all $ tar - xzf stuff .
tar.gz STEP 5 ( ENCRYPTION ) $ tar - zcvf - stuff|openssl des3 - salt -k secretpassword | dd of=stuff.des3
This will create stuff.des3 ... do n't forget the password you put in place of secretpassword .
This can be done interactively as well .
$ dd if=stuff.des3 |openssl des3 -d -k secretpassword|tar zxf - NOTE : above there is a " - " at the end ... this will extract everything .
TIP 4 : Creating a Virtual File System and Mounting it with a Loopback Device .
STEP 1 ( Construct a 10 MB file ) $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/disk-image count=20480
By default dd uses block of 512 so the size will be 20480 * 512 STEP 2 ( Make an ext2 or ext3 file system ) -- ext2 shown here .
$ mke2fs -q or if you want ext3 $ mkfs -t ext3 -q / tmp / disk - image yes , you can even use reiser , but you 'll need to create a bigger disk image .
Something like " dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/disk-image count=50480 " .
$ mkfs -t reiserfs -q /tmp/disk-image
Hit yes for confirmation .
It only asks this because it's a file STEP 3 ( Create a directory " virtual - fs " and mount .
This has to be done as root ) $ mkdir / virtual - fs $ mount -o loop= / dev/loop0 /tmp/disk-image /virtual -fs SPECIAL NOTE : if you mount a second device you will have to increase the loop count : loop=/ dev/loop1 , loop=/ dev/loop2 , ... loop=/dev/loopn
Now it operates just like a disk .
This virtual filesystem can be mounted when the system boots by adding the following to the " / etc/ fstab " file .
Then , to mount , just type " mount / virtual - fs " .
/tmp/disk-image /virtual - fs ext2 rw , loop=/dev/loop0 0 0 STEP 4 ( When done , umount it ) $ umount / virtual - fs SPECIAL NOTE :
If you are using Fedora core 2 , in the /etc / fstab you can take advantage of acl properties for this mount .
Note the acl next to the rw entry .
This is shown here with ext3 .
/tmp/disk-image /virtual - fs ext3 rw , acl, loop=/dev/loop1 0 0 Also , if you are using Fedora core 2 and above , you can mount the file on a cryptoloop .
$ dd if=/ dev/urandom of=disk - aes count=20480 $ modprobe loop $ modprobe cryptoloop $ modprobe aes $ losetup -e aes / dev/ loop0 disk - aes $ mkfs -t ext2 / dev/ loop0 $ mount -o loop , encryption=aes disk - aes < mount point >
If you do not have Fedora core 2 , then , you can build the kernel from source with some of the following options ( not complete , yet ) reference : http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cpearls/cpearls/src/posted_on_sf/acl/ehd.pdf?rev=1.1&view=log
Cryptographic API Support ( CONFIG_CRYPTO ) generic loop cryptographic ( CONFIG_CRYPTOLOOP )
Cryptographic ciphers ( CONFIG_CIPHERS )
Enable one or more ciphers ( CONFIG CIPHER .*) such as AES .
HELPFUL INFORMATION :
It is possible to bind mount partitions , or associate the mounted partition to a directory name .
# mount -- bind / virtual - fs /home / mchirico / vfs
Also , if you want to see what filesystems are currently mounted , " cat " the file " / etc / mtab " $ cat /etc / mtab Also see TIP 91 .
TIP 5 : Setting up 2 IP address on " One " NIC .
This example is on ethernet .
STEP 1 ( The settings for the initial IP address ) $ cat /etc/sysconfig/network -scripts/ifcfg-eth0 DEVICE=eth0 BOOTPROTO=static BROADCAST=192.168.99.255 IPADDR=192.168.1.155 NETMASK=255.255.252.0 NETWORK=192.168.1.0 ONBOOT=yes STEP 2 ( 2nd IP address : ) $ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0:1 DEVICE=eth0:1 BOOTPROTO=static BROADCAST=192.168.99.255 IPADDR=192.168.1.182 NETMASK=255.255.252.0 NETWORK=192.168.1.0 ONBOOT=yes
SUMMARY
Note , in STEP 1 the filename is " ifcfg-eth0 " , whereas in STEP 2 it's " ifcfg-eth0: 1 " and also not the matching entries for " DEVICE = ... " .
Also , obviously , the " IPADDR " is different as well .
TIP 6 : Sharing Directories Among Several Users .
Several people are working on a project in " / home / share " and they need to create documents and programs so that others in the group can edit and execute these documents as needed .
Also see ( TIP 186 ) for adding existing users to groups .
$ /usr / sbin / groupadd share $ chown - R root .
share / home / share $ /usr / bin / gpasswd - a < username > share $ chmod 2775 / home / share $ ls -ld / home / share drwxrwsr-x 2 root share 4096 Nov 8 16:19 / home / share ^----------
Note the s bit , which was set with the chmod 2775 $ cat /etc / group ... share : x:502 : chirico , donkey , zoe ... ^------- users are added to this group .
The user may need to login again to get access .
Or , if the user is currently logged in , they can run the following command : $ su - < username >
Note , the above step is recommended over " newgrp - share " since currently newgrp in FC2 , FC3 , and FC4 gets access to the group but the umask is not correctly formed .
As root you can test their account .
$ su - < username >
" You need to ' -' to pickup thier environment '$ su - chirico ' " Note : SUID , SGID , Sticky bit .
Only the left most octet is examined , and " chmod 755 " is used as an example of the full command .
But , anything else could be used as well .
Normally you 'd want executable permissions .
Octal digit Binary value Meaning Example usage 0 000 all cleared $ chmod 0755 or chmod 755 1 001 sticky $ chmod 1755 2 010 setgid $ chmod 2755 3 011 setgid , sticky $ chmod 3755 4 100 setuid $ chmod 4755 5 101 setuid , sticky $ chmod 5755 6 110 setuid , setgid $ chmod 6755 7 111 setuid , setgid , sticky $ chmod 7755 A few examples applied to a directory below .
In the first example all users in the group can add files to directory " dirA " and they can delete their own files .
Users cannot delete other user 's files .
Sticky bit : $ chmod 1770 dirA Below files created within the directory have the group ID of the directory , rather than that of the default group setting for the user who created the file .
Set group ID bit : $ chmod 2755 dirB TIP 7 : Getting Infomation on Commands
The " info " is a great utility for getting information about the system .
Here 's a quick key on using " info " from the terminal prompt . ' q ' exits .
'u ' moves up to the table of contents of the current section .
' n ' moves to the next chapter .
' p ' moves to the previous chapter .
' space ' goes into the selected section .
The following is a good starting point : $ info coreutils Need to find out what a certain program does ?
$ whatis open open ( 2 ) - open and possibly create a file or device open ( 3 ) - perl pragma to set default PerlIO layers for input and output open ( 3 pm ) - perl pragma to set default PerlIO layers for input and output open ( n ) - Open a file - based or command pipeline channel
To get specific information about the open commmand $ man 2 open also try ' keyword ' search , which is the same as the apropos command .
For example , to find all the man pages on selinux , type the following : $ man -k selinux or the man full word search .
Same as whatis command .
$ man -f < some string >
This is a hint once you are inside man .
space moves forward one page b moves backward y scrolls up one line " yikes , I missed it ! " g goes to the beginning q quits /< string > search , repeat seach n m mark , enter a letter like " a " , then , ' to go back ' enter a letter that is marked .
To get section numbers $ man 8 ping Note the numbers are used as follows ( This is OpenBSD ) 1 General Commands 2 System Calls and Error Numbers 3 C Libraries 3 p perl 4 Devices and device drivers 5 File Formats and config files 6 Game instructions 7 Miscellaneous information 8 System maintenance 9 Kernel internals
To find the man page directly , " ls " command : $ whereis -m ls ls : /usr / share/man/man1/ls.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1
/usr/share/man/man1p/ls.1p
To read this file directly , do the following : $ man /usr / share / man/man1/ls.1.gz
If you want to know the manpath , execute manpath .
$ manpath /usr / share / man:/usr/X11R6/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/local/pgsql/man:/usr/man:/usr/local/man
TIP 8 : How to Put a " Running Job " in the Background .
You 're running a job at the terminal prompt , and it 's taking a very long time .
You want to put the job in the backgroud .
" CTL - z " Temporarily suspends the job $ jobs
This will list all the jobs $ bg % jobnumber ( bg %1 )
To run in the background $ fg % jobnumber
To bring back in the foreground Need to kill all jobs -- say you 're using several suspended emacs sessions and you just want everything to exit .
$ kill - 9 `jobs - p` The " jobs - p " gives the process number of each job , and the kill - 9 kills everything .
Yes , sometimes " kill - 9 " is excessive and you should issue a " kill - 15 " that allows jobs to clean - up .
However , for exacs session , I prefer " kill - 9 " and have n't had a problem .
Sometimes you need to list the process id along with job information .
For instance , here 's process id with the listing .
$ jobs -l
Note you can also renice a job , or give it lower priority .
$ nice -n +15 find .
- ctime 2 - type f - exec ls {} \ ; > last48hours ^z $ bg
So above that was a ctl-z to suppend .
Then , bg to run it in the background .
Now , if you want to change the priority lower you just renice it , once you know the process id .
$ jobs - pl [ 1 ] +
29388 Running nice -n +15 find .
- ctime 2 - exec ls -l {} \ ; > mout & $ renice +30 - p 29388 29388 : old priority 15 , new priority 19 19 was the lowest priority for this job .
You cannot increase the priority unless you are root .
TIP 9 : Need to Delete a File for Good -- not even GOD can recover .
You have a file " secret " .
The following makes it so no one can read it .
If the file was 12 bytes , it 's now 4096 after it has been over written 100 times .
There 's no way to recover this .
$ shred -n 100 - z secret Want to remove the file ?
Use the " u " option .
$ shred -n 100 - z -u test2
It can be applied to a device $ shred -n 100 - z -u / dev/fd0 CAUTION :
Note that shred relies on a very important assumption : that the file system overwrites data in place .
This is the traditional way to do things , but many modern file system designs do not sat - isfy this assumption .
The following are examples of file systems on which shred is not effective , or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file system modes : * log-structured or journaled file systems , such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris ( and JFS , ReiserFS , XFS , Ext3 , etc. )
Also see ( TIP 52 ) .
TIP 10 : Who and What is doing What on Your System - finding open sockets , files etc. $ lsof or as root $ watch lsof -i
To list all open Internet files , use : $ lsof - i - U
You can also get very specific about ports .
Do this as root for low ports .
$ lsof -i TCP:3306
Or , look at UDP ports as follows : $ lsof -i UDP : 1812 ( See TIP 118 ) Also try fuser .
Suppose you have a mounted file - system , and you need to umount it .
To list the users on the file - system / work $ fuser -u / work
To kill all processes accessing the file system / work in any way .
$ fuser - km / work
Or better yet , maybe you want to eject a cdrom on / mnt / cdrom $ fuser - km / mnt / cdrom
If you need IO load information about your system , you can execute iostat .
But note , the very first iostat gives a snapshot since the last boot .
You typically want the following command , which gives you 3 outputs every 5 seconds .
$ iostat - xtc 5 3 Linux 2.6.12-1.1376_FC3smp ( squeezel.squeezel.com )

See tip 241 for vmstat for I /O subsystem total statistics .
$ vmstat $ ifconfig $ cat / proc/sys / vm / .. ( entries under here ) * NOTE : ( TIP 77 ) shows sample usage of " ifconfig " .
Also ( TIP 84 ) shows sample output of " $ cat / proc / cpuinfo " .
You can download iostat and other packages from ( http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/download_en.html).
You also may want to look at iozone ( TIP 178 ) .
Also $ cat / proc / meminfo $ cat / proc / stat $ cat / proc / uptime 1078623.55 1048008.34
First number is the number of seconds since boot .
The second number is the number of idle seconds .
$ cat / proc/ loadavg 0.25 0.14 0.10 1/166 7778
This shows load at 1,5 , and 15 minutes , a total of 1 current running process out from a total of 166 .
The 7778 is the last process id used .
Ref : http://www.teamquest.com/resources/gunther/ldavg1.shtml

The following watches donkey .
$ watch lsof -u donkey
Or , to see what in going on in directory " / work / junk " $ watch lsof +D / work / junk TIP 11 : How to make a File " immutable " or " unalterable " -- it can not be changed or deleted even by root .
Note this works on ( ext2/ext3 ) filesystems .
And , yes , root can delete after it 's changed back .
As root : $ chattr +i filename
And to change it back : $ chattr - i filename List attributes $ lsattr filename TIP 12 : SSH - How to Generate the Key Pair .
On the local server $ ssh - keygen -t dsa -b 2048
This will create the two files : .ssh/id_dsa ( Private key ) .ssh/id_dsa.pub
( Public key you can share ) Next insert " .ssh/id_dsa.pub " on the remote server in the file " .ssh/authorized_keys " and " .ssh/authorized_keys2 " and change the permission of each file to ( chmod 600 ) .
Plus , make sure the directory " .ssh " exists on the remote computer with 700 rights .
Ok , assuming 192.168.1.155 is the remote server and " donkey " is the account on that remote server .
$ ssh donkey@192.168.1.155 " mkdir - p .ssh " $ ssh donkey@192.168.1.155 " chmod 700 .ssh " $ scp ./.ssh/id_dsa.pub donkey@192.168.1.155 :.ssh/newkey.pub
Now connect to that remote server " 192.168.1.155 " and add .ssh/newkey.pub to both " authorized_keys " and " authorized_keys2 " .
When done , the permission on ( This is on the remote server ) $ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_key *
Next , go back to the local server and issue the following : $ ssh- agent $ SHELL $ ssh- add The " ssh-add " will allow you to enter the passphrase and it will save it for the current login session .
You do n't have to enter a password when running " ssh- keygen " above .
But , remember anyone with root access can " su - < username > " and then connect to your computers .
It 's harder , however , not impossible , for root to do this if you have a password .
( Reference TIP 151 ) Below is a quick shell command to distribute ssh keys .
I find this command to be very useful .
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub|ssh remoteserver " cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys "
TIP 13 : Securing the System : Do n't allow root to login remotely .
Instead , the admin could login as another account , then , " su - " .
However , root can still login " from the local terminal " .
In the " /etc/ssh/sshd_config " file change the following lines : Protocol 2 PermitRootLogin no PermitEmptyPasswords no Then , restart ssh / etc / init.d / sshd restart
Why would you want to do this ?
It 's not possible for anyone to guess or keep trying the root account .
This is especially good for computers on the Internet .
So , even if the " root " passwords is known , they can't get access to the system remotely .
Only from the terminal , which is locked in your computer room .
However , if anyone has a account on the server , then , they can login under their account then " su - " .
Suppose you only want a limited number of users : " mchirico " and " donkey " .
Add the following line to " /etc/ssh/sshd_config " .
Note , this allows access for chirico and donkey , but everyone else is denied .
#
Once you add AllowUsers - everyone else is denied .
AllowUsers mchirico donkey TIP 14 : Keep Logs Longer with Less Space .
Normally logs rotate monthly , over writing all the old data .
Here 's a sample " /etc/logrotate.conf " that will keep 12 months of backup compressing the logfiles $ cat /etc/logrotate .conf # see " man logrotate " for details # rotate log files weekly #chirico changes to monthly monthly # keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs # keep 12 months of backup rotate 12 # create new ( empty ) log files after rotating old ones create # uncomment this if you want your log files compressed compress # RPM packages drop log rotation information into this directory include / etc/ logrotate.d # no packages own wtmp -- we 'll rotate them here / var / log / wtmp { monthly create 0664 root utmp rotate 1 } # system - specific logs may be also be configured here .
Note : see tip 1 .
The clock should always be correctly set .
TIP 15 : What Network Services are Running ?
$ netstat - tanup or if you just want tcp services $ netstat - tanp or $ netstat - ap|grep LISTEN|less
This can be helpful to determine the services running .
Need stats on dropped UDP packets ?
$ netstat -s -u or TCP $ netstat -s -t or summary of everything $ netstat -s or looking for error rates on the interface ?
$ netstat -i Listening interfaces ?
$ netstat -l ( Tip above provided by Amos Shapira ) Also see TIP 77 .
TIP 16 : Apache : Creating and Using an " .htaccess " File Below is a sample " .htaccess " file which goes in " /usr/local/apache/htdocs/chirico/alpha/.htaccess " for this example AuthUserFile /usr / local / apache / htdocs/chirico/alpha/.htpasswd AuthGroupFile / dev/null AuthName " Your Name and regular password required " AuthType Basic < Limit GET POST > require valid- user </ Limit >
In order for this to work / usr / local / apache / conf / httpd.conf must have the following line in it : # < Directory /usr/ local / apache/htdocs/chirico/alpha> AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec < Limit GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND >
Order allow , deny Allow from all </ Limit > < LimitExcept GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND >
Order deny , allow Deny from all </ LimitExcept > </ Directory >
Also , a password file must be created $ /usr/local / apache/bin/htpasswd -c .htpasswd chirico
And enter the user names and passwords .
Next Reload Apache : $ /etc/init.d/ httpd reload ( Reference TIP 213 limit access to certain directories based on IP address ) .
TIP 17 : Working with " mt " Commands : reading and writing to tape .
The following assumes the tape device is " / dev/st0 " STEP 1 ( rewind the tape ) # mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind STEP 2 ( check to see if you are at block 0 ) # mt -f / dev/nst0 tell
At block 0 . STEP 3 ( Backup " tar compress " directories " one " and " two " ) # tar - czf / dev/nst0 one two STEP 4 ( Check to see what block you are at ) # mt -f / dev/nst0 tell
You should get something like block 2 at this point .
STEP 5 ( Rewind the tape ) # mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind STEP 6 ( List the files ) # tar - tzf / dev/nst0 one / one / test two / STEP 7 ( Restore directory " one " into directory " junk " ) .
Note , you have to first rewind the tape , since the last operation moved ahead 2 blocks .
Check this with " mt -f / dev/nst0 " .
# cd junk # mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind # mt -f / dev/nst0 tell
At block 0 . # tar - xzf / dev/nst0 one STEP 8 ( Next , take a look to see what block the tape is at ) # mt -f / dev/nst0 tell At block 2 . STEP 9 ( Now backup directories three and four ) # tar - czf / dev/nst0 three four After backing up the files , the tape should be past block 2 .
Check this .
# mt -f / dev/nst0 tell
At block 4 . Currently the following exist :
At block 1 : one / one / test two /
At block 2 : three / three / samplehere four /
At block 4 : (* This is empty *) A few notes .
You can set the blocking factor and a label with tar .
For example : $ tar -- label = " temp label " -- create -- blocking - factor=128 --file=/dev/nst0
Notes
But note if you try to read it with the default , incorrect blocking factor , then , you will get the following error : $ tar -t -- file=/dev/nst0 tar : / dev/nst0 : Cannot read : Cannot allocate memory tar :
At beginning of tape , quitting now tar : Error is not recoverable : exiting now However this is easily fixed with the correct blocking factor $ mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind $ tar -t -- blocking - factor=128 -- file= /dev/nst0 temp label Notes Take advantage of the label command .
$ MYCOMMENTS=" Big_important_tape " $ tar -- label= " $ ( date + %F ) " + " $ { MYCOMMENTS} " Writing to tape on a remote 192.168.1.155 computer $ tar cvzf - ./tmp | ssh -l chirico 192.168.1.155 '( mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind ; dd of=/ dev/st0 ) '
Restoring the contents from tape on a remote computer $ ssh -l chirico 192.168.1.155 '( mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind ; dd if= / dev/st0 ) ' |tar xzf - Getting data off of tape with dd command with odd blocking factor .
Just set ibs very high $ mt -f / dev/nst0 rewind $ tar -- label= " Contenets of Notes " -- create --blocking - factor=128 --file=/dev/nst0 Notes $ mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind $ dd ibs=1048576 if=/dev/st0 of=notes.tar
The above will probably work with ibs=64 k as well ( Also see TIP 136 ) TIP 18 : Encrypting Data to Tape using " tar " and " openssl " .
The following shows an example of writing the contents of " tapetest " to tape : $ tar zcvf - tapetest|openssl des3 - salt -k secretpassword | dd of= / dev/st0 Reading the data back : $ dd if=/dev/st0|openssl des3 -d -k secretpassword|tar xzf - TIP 19 : Mounting an ISO Image as a Filesystem -- this is great if you do n't have the DVD hardware , but , need to get at the data .
The following show an example of mounting the Fedora core 2 as a file .
$ mkdir /iso0 $ mount -o loop -t iso9660 / FC2-i386-DVD.iso /iso0
Or to mount automatically at boot , add the following to " /etc/fstab " /FC2-i386-DVD.iso /iso0 iso9660 rw, loop 0 0 Reference : http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/souptonuts/README_fedora.txt

If you want to use the emacs editor for editing cron jobs , then , set the following in your " /home/user/.bash_profile " EDITOR=emacs
Then , to edit cron jobs $ crontab -e
You may want to put in the following header # MINUTE ( 0 - 59 ) HOUR ( 0 - 23 ) DAYOFMONTH ( 1- 31 ) MONTHOFYEAR ( 1 - 12 ) DAYOFWEEK ( 0 - 6 ) Note 0 =Sun and 7 = Sun # # 14,15 10 * * 0 /usr/bin/somecommmand >/dev/null 2>&1
The sample " commented out command " will run at 10:14 and 10:15 every Sunday .
There will be no " mail " sent to the user because of the " >/ dev/null 2 > &1 " entry .
$ crontab -l
The above will list all cron jobs .
Or if you 're root $ crontab - l - u < username > $ crontab -e -u < username >
Reference " man 5 crontab " :
The time and date fields are : field allowed values -----
-------------- minute 0 -59 hour 0 - 23 day of month 1 - 31 month 1 - 12 ( or names , see below ) day of week 0 - 7 ( 0 or 7 is Sun , or use names ) A field may be an asterisk ( * ) , which always stands for ``first - last ' ' .
Ranges of numbers are allowed .
Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen .
The specified range is inclusive .
For example , 8 - 11 for an ``hours '' entry specifies execution at hours 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 .
Lists are allowed .
A list is a set of numbers ( or ranges ) separated by commas .
Examples : `` 1,2,5,9 '' , ``0 - 4,8-12 ''.
Ranges can include " steps " , so " 1 - 9/2 " is the same as " 1,3,5,7,9 " .
Note , you can run just every 5 minutes as follows : */5 * * * * /etc/mrtg/domrtg >/dev/null 2>&1
To run jobs hourly , daily , weekly or monthly you can add shell scripts into the appropriate directory :
/etc/cron.hourly /
/etc/cron.daily /
/etc/cron.weekly /
/etc/cron.monthly /
Note that the above are pre-configured schedules set in " / etc/ crontab " , so if you want , you can change the schedule .
Below is my /etc/ crontab : $ cat /etc/ crontab SHELL=/bin/bash PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin MAILTO=root HOME =/ # run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts
/etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts
/etc/cron.daily 22 4 * * 0 root run-parts
/etc/cron.weekly 42 4 1 * * root run-parts
/etc/cron.monthly TIP 22 : Keeping Files in Sync Between Servers .
The remote computer is " 192.168.1.171 " and has the account " donkey " .
You want to " keep in sync " the files under " / home/cu2000 / Logs " on the remote computer with files on " /home/chirico/dev/ MEDIA_Server " on the local computer .
$ rsync - Lae ssh donkey@192.168.1.171 :/home/cu2000/Logs /home/chirico/dev/MEDIA_Server " rsync " is a convient command for keeping files in sync , and as shown here will work through ssh .
The - L option tells rsync to treat symbolic links like ordinary files .

It helps to have a large " linuxwords " dictionary .
You can download a much bigger dictionary from the following : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/linuxwords.1.tar.gz?download
Note : vim users can setup the .vimrc file with the following .
Now when you type CTL -X CTL - T in insert mode , you 'll get a thesaurus lookup .
set dictionary+=/usr/share/dict/words set thesaurus+=/usr/share/dict/words
Or , you can call aspell with the F6 command after putting the folling entry in your .vimrc file : nmap < F6 > :w< CR >:! aspell -e -c %< CR>:e< CR >
Now , hit F6 when you 're in vim , and you 'll get a spell checker .
There is also an X Windows dictionary that runs with the following command .
$ gnome - dictionary TIP 24 : Find out if a Command is Aliased .
$ type - all < command >
Example : $ type - all ls ls is aliased to `ls -- color=tty ' ls is / bin/ls TIP 25 : Create a Terminal Calculator
Put the following in your . bashrc file function calc { echo " $ { 1} " |bc - l ; } Or , run it at the shell prompt .
Now " calc " from the shell will work as follows : $ calc 3+45 48
All functions with a " ( " or " ) " must be enclosed in quotes .
For instance , to get the sin of .4 $ calc " s( . 4 ) " .38941834230865049166

This program also demonstrates reading a bash variable # into an awk script .
# # Usage : kill9user < user > # kill - 9 `ps aux|awk - v var = $ 1 ' $ 1 ==var { print $ 2 }'` or if you want want to create the above script the command below will kill the user " donkey " and all of his processes .
$ kill - 9 `ps aux|awk - v var = " donkey " ' $ 1 ==var { print $ 2 }'` Check their cron jobs and " at " jobs , if you have a security issue .
$ crontab -u < user > -e

Do an inventory $ find / - user < user > > list_of_user_files
NOTE : Also see ( TIP 10 ) .
To see all users , except the current user .
Do not use the dash " ps - aux " is wrong but the following is correct : $ ps aux| awk '!/'$ { USER} '/{printf ( " %s
" , $ 0 ) } ' or ( ww = wide , wide output ) $ ps auwwx| awk '!/'$ { USER} '/{printf ( " %s
" , $ 0 ) } '
The following codes may be useful : D Uninterruptible sleep ( usually IO ) R Running or runnable ( on run queue ) S Interruptible sleep ( waiting for an event to complete ) T Stopped , either by a job control signal or because it is being traced .
W paging ( not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel ) X dead ( should never be seen ) Z Defunct ( " zombie " ) process , terminated but not reaped by its parent .
For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used , additional characters may be displayed : < high - priority ( not nice to other users ) N low - priority ( nice to other users ) L has pages locked into memory ( for real - time and custom IO ) s is a session leader l is multi- threaded ( using CLONE_THREAD , like NPTL pthreads do ) + is in the foreground process group Also see TIP 28 .

Easy to read See TIP 28 below .
See TIP 87 when working with large delta time changes - 40 years , or - 200 years ago , or even 1,000,000 days into the future .

TIP 28 : Need Ascii Codes ?
For instance , for printing quotes : awk ' BEGIN { msg = " Don\047t Panic ! " ; printf " %s
" , msg } ' or awk ' BEGIN { msg = " Don\x027t Panic ! " ; printf " %s
" , msg } '
It 's better to use \047 , because certain characters that follow \x027 may cause problems .
For example , take a look at the following two lines .
The first line prints a " } " caused by the extra D in \x027D .
The the line immediately below does not work as expected .
awk ' BEGIN {printf ( " The D causes problems \x027D
" ) } '
However , the line below works fine : awk ' BEGIN {printf ( " The D does not cause problems \047D
" ) } '
Or if you wanted to use the date command in " awk " to print date.time.nanosecond.timezone for each line of a file " test " .
The following date can be used in awk because the single quotes are enclosed within the double quotes .

%H%M%S. %N%z' $ awk ' BEGIN { " date '+ % m%d %Y .
%H%M%S. %N%z ' " | getline MyDate } { print MyDate , $0 } ' < data
But it 's also possible to replace " + " with \x 2B , " % " with \x25 , and " d " with \x64 as follows : $ awk ' BEGIN { " date \x27\x2B\x25m\x25\x64\x25Y.\x25H\x25M\x25S.\x25N\x25z\x27 " | getline MyDate } { print MyDate , $0 } ' < test 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 bob 71 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 tom 43 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 sal 34 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 bob 89 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 tom 66 07062004.113820.346033000-0400 sal 99
For this example it's not needed because single quotes are used inside of double quotes ; however , there may be times when hex replacement is easier .

Try lynx or elinks .
$ lynx
Or to read all these tips , with the latest updates $ lynx http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/souptonuts/How_to_Linux_and_Open_Source.txt
Or , better yet elinks .
$ elinks http://somepage .
You can get elinks at the following site : http://elinks.or.cz/
TIP 30 : screen - screen manager with VT100 / ANSI terminal emulation
This is an excellent utility .
But if you work a lot in Emacs , then , you should place the following in your ~/. bashrc alias s=' screen -e ^Pa - D - R '
After loging in again ( or source . bashrc ) , type the following to load " screen " : $ s If you 're using the not using the alias command above , substitute CTL - a for CTL - p below .
: CTL-p CTL -C
To get a new session CTL-p " To list sessions , and arrow keys to move CTL-p SHFT - A
To name sessions CTL-p S To split screens CLT-p Q
To unsplit screens CLT-p TAB
To switch between screens CLT - p : resize n
To resize screen to n rows , on split screen Screen is very powerful .
Should you become disconneced , you can still resume work after loggin in .
$ man screen
The above command will give you more information .
TIP 31 : Need to Find the Factors of a Number ?
$ factor 2345678992 2345678992 : 2 2 2 2 6581 22277
It 's a quick way to find out if a number is prime $ factor 7867 7867 : 7867 TIP 32 : Less is More -- piping to less to scroll backword and forward For large " ls " listings try the followin , then , use the arrow key to move up and down the list .
$ ls / some_large_dir/ | less or $ cat some_large_file | less or $ less some_large_file TIP 33 : C " indent " Settings for Kernel Development $ indent - kr - i8 program .c
TIP 34 : FTP auto - login. " ftp " to a site and have the password stored .
For instance , here 's a sample " .net " file in a user 's home directory for uploading to sourceforge .
Note , sourceforge will take any password , so m@temp.com is used here for login " anonymous " .
$ cat ~/.netrc machine upload.sourceforge.net login anonymous password m@temp.com default login anonymous password user@site
It might be a good idea to change the rights on this file $ chmod 0400 ~/.netrc #!/bin/bash # # Sample ftp automated script to download # file to $ {dwnld} # dwnld= " /work/faq/unix-faq " cd $ {dwnld} ftp << FTPSTRING prompt off open rtfm.mit.edu cd /pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers /unix-faq /faq mget contents mget diff mget part * bye FTPSTRING
Sourceforge uses an anonymous login with an email address as a password .
Below is the automated script I use for uploading binary files .
#!/ bin/bash # ftp sourceforge auto upload ftpup.sh # Usage : ./ftpup.sh < filename > # # machine upload.sourceforge.net user anonymous m@aol.com ftp -n -u << FTPSTRING open upload.sourceforge.net user anonymous m@aol.com binary cd incoming put $ {1 } bye FTPSTRING
( Also see TIP 114 for ncftpget , which is a very powerful restarting ftp program ) TIP 35 : Bash Brace Expansion $ echo f{ee , ie , oe , um} fee fie foe fum
This works with almost any command $ mkdir - p / work / junk / {one , two , three , four} TIP 36 : Getting a List of User Accounts on the System $ cut -d : - f1 /etc / passwd | sort Note ( Thanks to Philip Vanmontfort ) you can also do the following : $ getent passwd|cut -d : - f1 |sort TIP 37 : Editing a Bash Command
Try typing a long command say , then , type " fc " for an easy way to edit the command .
$ find /etc - iname '*. cnf ' - exec grep - H ' log ' {} \ ; $ fc " fc " will bring the last command typed into an editor , " emacs " if that 's the default editor .
Type " fc - l " to list last few commands .
To seach for a command , try typing " CTL-r " at the shell prompt for searching .
" CTL - t " to transpose , say " sl " was typed by you want " ls " .
Hints when using " fc : in emacs : ESC - b move one word backward ESC -f move one word forward ESC - DEL kill one word backward CTL-k kill point to end CTL-y un-yank killed region at point TIP 38 : Moving around Directories .
Change to the home directory : $ cd ~ or $ cd To go back to the last directory $ cd - Instead of " cd " to a directory try " pushd " and look at the heading ... you can see a list of directories .
$ pushd /etc $ pushd /usr / local
Then , to get back " popd " or " popd 1 " To list all the directories pushed on the stack use the " dirs - v " command .
$ dirs -v 0 /usr / local 1 /etc 2 /work/souptonuts/documentation/theBook
Now , if you " pushd + 1 " you will be moved to " /etc " , since is number " 1 " on the stack , and this directory will become " 0 " .
$ pwd /usr / local $ pushd +1 $ pwd /etc $ dirs -v 0 /etc 1 /work/souptonuts/documentation/theBook 2 /usr /local TIP 39 : Need an Underscore after a Variable ?
Enclose the variable in " {} " .
$ echo $ {UID}_ Compare to $ echo $ UID_
Also try the following : $ m= " my stuff here " $ echo -e $ {m // /'
'} my stuff here TIP 40 : Bash Variable Offset and String Operators $ r=" this is stuff " $ echo $ {r:3} $ echo $ {r : 5:2} Note , $ {varname:offset: length} $ {varname :?
message}
If varname exist and is n't null return value , else , print var and message .
$ r=" new stuff " $ echo $ {r : ?
" that 's r for you "} new stuff $ unset r $ echo ${r : ?
" that 's r for you "} bash : r : that 's r for you ${varname : + word}
If varname exist and not null return word .
Else , return null .
$ {varname : - word}
If varname exist and not null return value .
Else , return word .
Working with arrays in bash - bash arrays .
$ unset p $ p=( one two three ) $ echo -e " $ {p[ @ ] } " one two three or $ echo -e " $ {p [ * ] } " one two three $ echo -e " $ { # p[@ ] } " 3 $ echo -e " $ { p [ 0 ] } " one $ echo -e " $ { p [ 1 ] } " two Also see ( TIP 95 ) TIP 41 : Loops in Bash
The command below loops through directories listed in $ PATH .
$ path=$ PATH : $ while [ $ path ] ; do echo " $ {path % %:*} " ; path=$ {path # *:} ; done
The command below will also loop through directories in your path .
$ IFS= : $ for dir in $ PATH > do > ls -ld $ dir > done drwxr - xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 10 20:16 /usr/local / bin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 13 23:12 / bin drwxr -xr-x 3 root root 40960 Jun 12 08:00 /usr / bin drwxr -xr-x 2 root root 4096 Feb 14 03:12 /usr/X11R6 / bin drwxrwxr-x 2 chirico chirico 4096 Jun 6 13:06 /home/ chirico / bin
Other ways of doing loops : for ( ( i=1 ; i <= 20 ; i++ ) ) do echo -n " $i " done Note , to do it all on one line , do the following : $ for ( ( i=1 ; i <= 20 ; i++ ) ) ; do echo -n " $i " ; done Below , is an example of declaring i an integer so that you do not have to preface with let .
$ declare - i i $ i=5 ; $ while (( $ i > 1 ) ) ; do > i=i-1 > echo $ i > done 4 3 2 You can also use " while [ $ i - gt 1 ] ; do " in place of " while ( ( $ i > 1 ) ) ; do "
To get a listing of all declared values $ declare -i
Try putting a few words in the file " test " $ while read filename ; do echo " - $ filename " ; done < test |nl - w1 Or , using an array declare - a Array Array [ 0 ] =" zero " Array [ 1 ] =" one " Array [ 2 ] =" two " for i in `seq $ { # Array [ @ ] }` do echo $ Array [ $ i - 1 ] done Also see ( TIP 95 and TIP 133 ) .
TIP 42 : " diff " and " patch " .
You have created a program " prog.c " , saved as this name and also copied to " prog.c.old " .
You post " prog.c " to users .
Next , you make changes to prog.c $ diff - c prog.c.old prog.c > prog.patch
Now , users can get the latest updates by running .
$ patch < prog.patch
By the way , you can make backups of your data easily .
$ cp /etc/fstab{ , .bak}
Now , you do your edits to " / etc/ fstab " and if you need to go back to the original , you can find it at " /etc/fstab.bak " .
Also consider sdiff with the -s option , to ignore spaces to compare differences side - by - side between two files .
An example is listed below .
$ sdiff -s file1 file2 TIP 43 : " cat " the Contents of Files Listed in a File , in That Order .
SETUP ( Assume you have the following ) $ cat file_of_files file1 file2 $ cat file1
This is the data in file1 $ cat file 2
This is the data in file2
So there are 3 files here " file_of_files " which contains the name of other files .
In this case " file1 " and " file2 " .
And the contents of " file1 " and " file2 " is shown above .
$ cat file_of_files|xargs cat
This is the data in file1
This is the data in file2
Also see ( TIP 44 , TIP 62 and TIP 235 ) .
TIP 44 : Columns and Rows -- getting anything you want .
Assume you have the following file .
$ cat data 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
How to you get everything in 2 columns ?
$ cat data|tr ' ' '
' |xargs -l2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
Three columns ?
$ cat data|tr ' ' '
' |xargs -l3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
What 's the row sum of the " three columns ? " $ cat data|tr ' ' '
' |xargs - l3|tr ' ' '+' |bc 6 15 24 33 27 or $ tr ' ' '
' < data |xargs - l3|tr ' ' '+ ' |bc NOTE " Steven Heiner 's rule " : cat one_file | program can always be rewritten as program < one_file Note : thanks to Steven Heiner ( http://www.shelldorado.com/)
the above can be shortened as follows : $ tr ' ' '
' < data|xargs - l3|tr ' ' '+ ' |bc Need to " tr " from the stdin ?
$ tr " xy " " yx " | ... | ...
But there is a the " Stephane CHAZELAS " condition here " Note that tr , sed , and awk mail fail on files containing ' \0 ' sed and awk have unspecified behaviors if the input does n't end in a '
' ( or to sum up , cat works for binary and text files , text utilities such as sed or awk work only for text files ) .
TIP 45 : Auto Directory Spelling Corrections .
To turn this on : $ shopt -s cdspell Now mispell a directory in the cd command .
$ cd /usk / local ^-------- still gets you to -- | /usr / local
What other options can you set ?
The following will list all the options : $ shopt -p TIP 46 : Record Eveything Printed on Your Terminal Screen .
$ script - a < filename >
Now start doing stuff and " everything " is appended to < filename > .
For example $ script installation $ ( command ) $ ( result ) $ ... $ ... $ ( command ) $ ( result ) $ exit
The whole session log is in the installation file that you can later read and / or cleanup and add to a documentation .
This command can also be used to redirect the contents to another user , but you must be root to do this .
Step 1 - find out what pts they are using .
$ w Step 2 - Run script on that pts .
After running this command below everything you type will appear on their screen .
$ script / dev/pts /4

TIP 47 : Monitor all Network Traffic Except Your Current ssh Connection .
$ tcpdump - i eth0 - nN - vvv - xX -s 1500 port not 22
Or to filter out port 123 as well getting the full length of the packet ( - s 0 ) , use the following : $ tcpdump - i eth0 - nN - vvv - xX -s 0 port not 22 and port not 123 Or to filter only a certain host say 81.169.158.205 $ tcpdump - i eth0 - nN -vvv -xX port not 22 and host 81.169.158.205
Just want ip addresses and a little bit of data , then , use this .
The " - c 20 " is to stop after 20 packets .
$ tcpdump - i eth0 - nN -s 1500 port not 22 -c 20

TIP 49 : Setting or Changing the Library Path .
The following contains the settings to be added or deleted /etc/ld.so.conf
After this file is edited , you must run the following : $ ldconfig See " man ldconfig " for more information .
TIP 50 : Working with Libraries in C Assume the following 3 programs : $ cat ./src/test.c int test ( int t ) { printf ( "
%d
" ,t ) ; return t ; } $ cat ./src/prog1.c /* program : prog1.c dependences : test .c compiling this program : gcc -o prog test .c prog1.c
Note the libpersonal include should be remove if NOT using the library */ #include < libpersonal.h > # include < stdio.h > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { test ( 45 ) ; } $ cat ./include/libpersonal.h extern int test ( int ) ; Prog1. c needs the test function in test .c
To compile , so that both programs work together , do the following : $ cd src $ gcc -o prog test . c prog1.c - I../ include However , if you want to create your own static library , then , run the following : $ mkdir - p ../ lib $ gcc -c test .c -o ../lib/test.o $ cd ../ lib $ ar r libpersonal .a test.o $ ranlib libpersonal .a or , the ar and ranlib command can be combined as follows : $ ar rs libpersonal . a test .o
To compile the program with the static library : $ cd ../src $ gcc - I../ include - L../lib - o prog1 prog1.c - lpersonal
The - I ../ include tells gcc to look in the ../ include directory for libpersonal .h. and - L../ lib , tells gcc to look for the " libpersonal . a " library .
$ cd .. $ tree src lib include src |-- prog |-- prog1 |-- prog1.c `-- test.c lib |-- libpersonal .a `-- test .o include `-- libpersonal .h
This was a STATIC library .
Often times you will want to use a SHARED or dynamic library .
SHARED LIBRARY : You must recompile test.c with - fpic option .
$ cd ../ lib $ gcc -c - fpic ../src/test.c -o test .o
Next create the libpersonal .
so file .
$ gcc - shared -o libpersonal .
so test .o
Now , compile the source prog1.c as follows : $ cd ../src $ gcc - Wl , - R../lib - L../lib - I../ include -o prog2 prog1.c - lpersonal
This should work fine .
But , take a look at prog2 using the ldd command .
$ ldd prog2 libpersonal .
so => ../lib/libpersonal.so ( 0x40017000 ) libc.so.6 =>
/lib/tls/libc.so.6 ( 0x42000000 ) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0x40000000 )
If you move the program prog2 to a different location , it will not run .
Instead you will get the following error : prog2 : error while loading shared libraries : libpersonal.so : cannot open shared object file :
No such file or directory
To fix this , you should specify the direct path to the library .
And in my case it is rather long $ gcc - Wl , -R/work/souptonuts/documentation/theBook/lib - L../lib - I../ include -o prog2 prog1.c - lpersonal SPECIAL NOTE :
The -R must always follow the - Wl . (- Wl , - R<directory > )
They always go together TIP 51 : Actively Monitor a File and Send Email when Expression Occurs .
This is a way to monitor " / var/log/ messages " or any file for certain changes .
The example below actively monitors " stuff " for the work " now " and as soon as " now " is added to the file , the contents of msg are sent to the user mikechirico@hotmail.com $ tail -f stuff | \ awk ' / now / { system ( " mail -s \ " This is working \ " mikechirico@hotmail.com < msg " ) }'
Or , you can run a program , say get headings on slashdot from the program " getslash.php " which runs on " 192.168.1.155 " with account " chirico " .
Assuming you have ssh keys setup , then , the following will send mail from the output : $ ssh chirico@192.168.1.155 "./bin/getslash.php " |mail -s " Slash cron Headlines " mchirico@comcast.net
See ( TIP 80 ) for scraping the headings on slash dot and how to get a copy of " getslash.php " .
If you still want to use awk : $ ssh chirico@192.168.1.155 "./bin/getslash.php " | \ awk '{ print $ 0 | " mail -s \x27 Slash Topics \x27 mchirico@comcast.net " } '
Note the " \x27 " is a quote .
Maybe you only want articles dealing with " Linux " : $ ssh chirico@192.168.1.155 "./bin/getslash.php " | \ awk ' / Linux / { print $ 0 | " mail -s \x27 Slash Topics \x27 mchirico@comcast.net " } '
For $ 60 , you can get a numeric display from " delcom engineering " that you can send messages and data to .

( Reference TIP 151 for ssh tips ) TIP 52 : Need to Keep Secrets ?
Encrypt it .
To Encrypt : $ openssl des3 - salt - in file .
txt - out file.des3
The above will prompt for a password , or you can put it in with a - k option , assuming you 're on a trusted server .
To Decrypt $ openssl des3 -d - salt - in file .
des3 - out file .
txt -k mypassword
Need to encrypt what you type ?
Enter the following , then start typing and ^D to end .
$ openssl des3 - salt - out stuff .
txt TIP 53 : Check that a File has Not Been Tampered With : Use Cryptographic Hashing Function .
The md5sum is popular but dated $ md5 sum file Instead , use one of the following ; $ openssl dgst - sha1 -c file $ openssl dgst - ripemd160 -c file
All calls give a fixed length string or " message digest " .
TIP 54 : Need to View Information About a Secure Web Server ?
A SSL / TLS test .
$ openssl s_client - connect www.sourceforge.net:443
Above will give a long listing of certificates .
Note , it is also possible to get certificate information about a mail server $ openssl s_client - connect mail.comcast.net:995 - showcerts
When you do the above command you get two certificates .
If you copy past both certificates by taking the following contents include the begin and end show below : -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ....
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
Then create files " comcast0.pem " and " comcast1.pem " out of these certificaties and put them in a directory " /home/donkey /.certs " , then , with the openssl src package , in the " ./tools /c_rehash " run $ c_rehash .certs Doing .certs comcast0.pem => 72f90dc0.0 comcast1.pem => f73e89fd.0
Now it 's possible to have fetchmail work with these certs .
# # # Sample . fetchmailrc file for Comcast # #
Check mail every 90 seconds set daemon 90 set syslog set postmaster donkey # set bouncemail # # Comcast email is zdonkey but computer account is just donkey # poll mail .comcast.net with proto POP3 and options no dns user ' zdonkey ' with pass " somethin35 " is ' donkey ' here options ssl sslcertck sslcertpath ' /home/donkey/.certs ' smtphost comcast .

TIP 55 : cp -- parents .
What does this option do ?
Assume you have the following directory structure .
|-- a | `-- b | |-- c | | `-- d | | |-- file1 | | `-- file2 | `-- x | `-- y | `-- file3 `-- newdir Issue the following command : $ cp -- parents ./a/b/c/d/* ./newdir/
Now you have the following : . |-- a | `-- b | |-- c | | `-- d | | |-- file1 | | `-- file2 | `-- x | `-- y | `-- file3 `-- newdir `-- a `-- b `-- c `-- d |-- file1 `-- file2
Note that you can't do this with " cp - r " because you 'd pickup the x directory and its contents .
You probably want to use the " cp -- parents " command for directory surgery , which you need to be very specific on what you cut and copy .
TIP 56 : Quickly Locating files .
The " locate " command quickly searches the indexed database for files .
It just gives the name of the files ; but , if you need more information use it as follows $ locate document|xargs ls -l
The " locate " database may only get updated every 24 hours .
For more recent finds , use the " find " command .
TIP 57 : Using the " find " Command .
List only directories , max 2 nodes down that have " net " in the name $ find / proc - type d - maxdepth 2 - iname '* net * '
Find all *.c and *.h files starting from the current " . " position .
$ find . \( - iname '*.c ' -o - iname '*.h' \) - print Find all , but skip what 's in " / CVS " and " / junk " .
Start from " / work " $ find / work \( - iregex '.*/ CVS ' -o - iregex '.*/ junk ' \) - prune -o - print Note - regex and - iregex work on the directory as well , which means you must consider the " ./ " that comes before all listings .
Here is another example .
Find all files except what is under the CVS , including CVS listings .
Also exclude " # " and " ~ " .
$ find .
- regex '.*' ! \( - regex '.* CVS .*' -o - regex '.*[ # |~ ] .*' \)
Find a *.c file , then run grep on it looking for " stdio.h " $ find .
- iname '*.c ' - exec grep - H ' stdio.h ' {} \ ; sample output --> ./prog1.c:#include < stdio.h > ./test.c:#include < stdio.h >
Looking for the disk - hog on the whole system ?
$ find / - size +10000 k 2>/ dev/null
Looking for files changed in the last 24 hours ?
Make sure you add the minus sign " - 1 " , otherwise , you will only find files changed exactly 24 hours from now .
With the " - 1 " you get files changed from now to 24 hours .
$ find .
- ctime - 1 - printf " %a %f
" Wed Oct 6 12:51:56 2004 .
Wed Oct 6 12:35:16 2004 How_to_Linux_and_Open_Source.txt
Or if you just want files .
$ find .
- type f -ctime - 1 - printf " %a %f
" Details on file status change in the last 48 hours , current directory .
Also note " - atime - 2 " ) .
$ find .
- ctime - 2 - type f - exec ls -l {} \ ; NOTE : if you do n't use - type f , you make get " . " returned , which when run through ls " ls . " may list more than what you want .
Also you may only want the current directory $ find .
- ctime - 2 - type f - maxdepth 1 - exec ls -l {} \;
To find files modified within the last 5 to 10 minutes $ find .
- mmin +5 - mmin - 10
For more example " find " commands , reference the following looking for the latest version of " bashscripts.x.x.x.tar.gz " : http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79320&package_id=80711
See " TIP 71 " for examples of find using the inode feature . " $ find .
- inum < inode > - exec rm -- ' {} ' \ ; " If you do n't want error messages , or need to redirect error messages " > / dev/null 2>&1 " , or see " TIP 81 " .
TIP 58 : Using the " rm " command .
How do you remove a file that has the name " - " .
For instance , if you run the command " $ cat > - " and type some text followed by ^d , how does the " - " file get deleted ?
$ rm -- -
The " - - " nullifies any rm options .
How do you delete the directory " one " , all it 's sub - directories , and any data ?
$ rm - rf ./ one Note , to selectively delete stuff on a directory , use the find command " TIP 57 " .
To delete by inode , see " TIP 71 " .
TIP 59 : Giving ownership .
How do you give the user " donkey " ownership to all directories and files under " ./ fordonkey " ?
$ chown - R donkey ./ fordonkey TIP 60 : Only Permit root login -- give others a message when they try to login .
Create the file " / etc/ nologin " with " nologin " containing the contents of the message .
TIP 61 : Limits : file size , open files , pipe size , stack size , max memory size cpu time , plus others .
To get a listing of current limits : $ ulimit - a core file size ( blocks , - c ) 0 data seg size ( kbytes , - d ) unlimited file size ( blocks , - f ) unlimited max locked memory ( kbytes , - l ) unlimited max memory size ( kbytes , - m ) unlimited open files ( - n ) 1024 pipe size ( 512 bytes , - p ) 8 stack size ( kbytes , - s ) 8192 cpu time ( seconds , - t ) unlimited max user processes ( - u ) 8179 virtual memory ( kbytes , - v ) unlimited Note as a user you can decrease your limits in the current shell session ; but , you cannot increase .
This can be ideal for testing programs .
But , first you may want to create another shell " sh " so that you can " go back to where started " .
$ ulimit -f 10 Now try $ yes >> out File size limit exceeded
To set limits on users , make changes to " /etc/security/limits.conf " bozo - maxlogins 1
Will keep bozo from loging in more than once .
To list hard limits : $ ulimit - Ha To list soft limits : $ ulimit - Sa To restrict user access by time , day make changes to " /etc/security/time.conf "
Also take a look at " / etc / profile " to see what other changes can be made , plus take a look under " /etc/security /*.conf " for other configuration files .
TIP 62 : Stupid " cat " Tricks .
Also see ( TIP 43 and TIP 235 ) .
If you have multiple blank lines that you want to squeeze down to one line , then , try the following : $ cat -s < file >
Want to number the lines ?
$ cat -n < file >
Want to show tabs ?
$ cat -t < file >
Need to mark end of lines by " $ " ?
The following was suggested by ( Amos Shapira ) $ cat -e < file >
Want to see all the ctl characters ?
/* ctlgen.c Program to generate ctl characters .
Compile : gcc -o ctlgen ctlgen.c Run : ./ ctlgen > mout
Now see the characters : cat -v mout Here 's a sample output : $ cat - v mout|tail test M - v test M - w test M-x test M-y test M - z test M -{ test M -| test M-} test M -~ test M-^? */ #include < stdlib.h > # include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { int i ; for ( i=0 ; i < 256 ; ++i ) printf ( " test %c
" , i ) ; return 0 ; } TIP 63 : Guard against SYN attacks and " ping " .
As root do the following : echo 1 > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
Want to disable " ping " ?
echo 1 > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
Disable broadcast / multicast " ping " ?
echo 1 > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
And to enable again : echo 0 > / proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
TIP 64 : Make changes to .
bash_profile and need to update the current session ?
$ source .bash_profile
With the above command , the user does not have to logout .
TIP 65 : What are the Special Shell Variables ? $#
The number of arguments .
$ @
All arguments , as separate words . $*
All arguments , as one word .
$ $ ID of the current process . $?
Exit status of the last command .
$ 0 , $ 1 , ..$ 9 , $ {10} , $ {11} ...$ {N} Positional parameters .
After " 9 " you must use the $ {k} syntax .
Note that 0 is true .
For example if you execute the following , which is true you get zero . $ [ [ -f /etc / passwd ] ] $ echo $ ?
0
And the following is false , which returns a 1 . $ [ [ - f /etc/passwdjabberwisnohere ] ] $ echo $ ?
1 So true=0 and false=1 .
Sample program " mdo " to show the difference between " $ @ " and " $ * " #!/ bin/bash function myarg { echo " $# in myarg function " } echo -e " $# parameters on the cmd line
" echo -e " calling : myarg \ " \$@\ " and myarg \ " \$ * \ "

$ cata data x y y x $ tr " xy " " yx " < data y x x y TIP 67 : On a Linux 2.6.x Kernel , how do you directly measure disk activity , and where is this information documented ?
o
The information is documented in the kernel source ./ Documentation/iostats.txt o
The new way of getting this info in 2.6.x is $ cat /sys / block / hda / stat 151121 5694 1932358 796675 37867 76770 916994 8353762 0 800672 9150437 Field 1 -- # of reads issued
This is the total number of reads completed successfully .
Field 2 -- # of reads merged , field 6 -- # of writes merged Reads and writes which are adjacent to each other may be merged for efficiency .
Thus two 4 K reads may become one 8 K read before it is ultimately handed to the disk , and so it will be counted ( and queued ) as only one I/O .
This field lets you know how often this was done .
Field 3 -- # of sectors read
This is the total number of sectors read successfully .
Field 4 -- # of milliseconds spent reading
This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all reads ( as measured from __make_request ( ) to end_that_request_last ( ) ) .
Field 5 -- # of writes completed
This is the total number of writes completed successfully .
Field 7 -- # of sectors written
This is the total number of sectors written successfully .
Field 8 -- # of milliseconds spent writing
This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all writes ( as measured from __make_request ( ) to end_that_request_last ( ) ) .
Field 9 -- # of I / Os currently in progress
The only field that should go to zero .
Incremented as requests are given to appropriate request_queue_t and decremented as they finish .
Field 10 -- # of milliseconds spent doing I / Os
This field is increases so long as field 9 is nonzero .
Field 11 -- weighted # of milliseconds spent doing I /Os
This field is incremented at each I / O start , I/ O completion , I / O merge , or read of these stats by the number of I / Os in progress ( field 9 ) times the number of milliseconds spent doing I /O since the last update of this field .
This can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time and the backlog that may be accumulating .
Note , this is device specific .
TIP 68 : Passing Outbound Mail , plus Masquerading User and Hostname .
Here 's a specific example :
How does one send and receive Comcast email from a home Linux box , which uses Comcast as the ISP , if the local account on the Linux box is different from the Comcast email .
For instance , the account on the Linux box is " chirico@third - fl - 71 " and the Comcast email account is " mchirico@comcast.net " .
Note both the hostname and username are different .
So , the user " chirico " using " mutt " , " elm " or any email program would like to send out email to say " donkey@comcast.net " ; yet , donkey would see the email from " mchirico@comcast.net " and not " chirico@third - fl - 71 " but chirico@third - fl - 71 would get the replies .
For a full description of how to solve this problem , including related " sendmail.mc " , " site.config.m4 " , " genericstable " , " genericsdomain " , " .procmailrc " , and " .forward " files , reference the following : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/README_COMCAST_EMAIL.txt?download
Included in the above link are instructions for building sendmail with " SASL " and " STARTTLS " .
TIP 69 : How do you remove just the last 2 lines from a file and save the result ?
$ sed ' $ d ' file | sed ' $ d ' > savefile
Or , as Amos Shapira pointed out , it 's much easier with the head command .
$ head - 2 file And , of course , removing just the last line $ sed ' $ d ' file > savefile ( See REFERENCES ( 13 ) )
How do you remove extra spaces at the end of a line ?
$ sed 's / [ ]
*$//g'
How do you remove blank lines , or lines with just spaces and tabs , saving the origional file as file .
backup ?
$ perl - pi.backup -e " s / ^( \s ) *
// " file
Or , you may want to remove empty spaces and tabs at the end of a line $ perl - pi.backup -e " s / ( \s ) *
/
/ " file Or , you may want to converts dates of the format 01/23/2007 to the format 2007 - 01 - 23 .
This is MySQL 's common date format .
$ perl - pi.backup -e " s|( \d+ ) /( \d+ ) /( \d+ ) |\$ 3-\$ 2-\$ 1| " file Note , you need a backslash \ $ 3 , \$ 2 , \$ 1 so as to not get bash shell substitution .
TIP 70 : Generating Random Numbers . $ od - vAn - N4 - tu4 < /dev/urandom 3905158199 TIP

Yes , you could even compile a program " $ g++ -o test test.c " , then , " $ gpg -- output test.asc -r Mike -- encrypt -- armor test " .
However , when decrypting make sure to pipe the results .
$ gpg -- decrypt test.asc > test Export " public " key : $ gpg -- armor -- export Mike > m 1.asc
Signing the file " message.txt " : $ gpg -- clearsign message.

TIP 87 : Working with Dates : Steffen Beyer has developed a Perl and C module for working with dates
This softare can be downloaded from the following location : http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/pkg/Date-Calc-5.3.tar.gz $ wget http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/pkg/Date-Calc-5.3.tar.gz $ tar - xzvf Date - Calc-5.3.tar.gz $ cd Date - Calc - 5.3 $ cp ./examples/cal.c . $ gcc cal.c DateCalc.c -o mcal
The file cal .c contains sample function calls from DateCalc.c .
Note , " DateCalc.c " is just a list of functions and includes for " DateCalc.h " and " ToolBox.h " .
Or , and this may be easier , just download the following : http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpearls/date_calc.tar.gz?download

TIP 91 : Creating a sandbox for reiserfstune , debugreiserfs and ACL .
Also see TIP 4 .
Assume you have a reisers files system created from a disk file , which means you have done something like the following : # dd if=/dev/zero of=disk-rfs count=102400 # losetup / dev/loop4 ./ disk -rfs # mkfs -t reiserfs / dev/ loop4 # mkdir / fs2 # mount -o loop , acl ./disk-rfs /fs2
Now , you can run reiserfstune .
But , first you will need to umount fs2 # umount / fs2 # reiserfstune ./disk-rfs
Or you can run the debug command # debugreiserfs - J ./ disk-rfs Now , suppose you run through a lot of the debug options on http://www.namesys.com/ and you destroy this file .
You can recreate the file and delete the loop device .
# dd if=/dev/zero of=disk-rfs count=102400 # losetup -d / dev/loop4 # mount -o loop , acl ./disk-rfs /fs2
Now , try working with some of the ACL options - you can only do this with the latest kernel and tools -- Fedora Core 2 will work .
Assume you have 3 users , donkey , chirico and bozo2 .
You can give everyone rights to this file system as follows : # setfacl - R -m d:u:donkey:rwx , d:u:chirico:rwx , d:u:bozo2:rwx /fs2 TIP 92 : SpamAssassin - Setup .

Washington , D.C. , January 13 , 2000 – The National Security Agency ( NSA ) is one of the most secret ( and secretive ) members of the U.S. intelligence community .
The predecessor of NSA , the Armed Forces Security Agency ( AFSA ) , was established within the Department of Defense , under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , on May 20 , 1949 .
In theory , the AFSA was to direct the communications intelligence and electronic intelligence activities of the military service signals intelligence units ( at the time consisting of the Army Security Agency , Naval Security Group , and Air Force Security Service ) .
In practice , the AFSA had little power , its functions being defined in terms of activities not performed by the service units .
1
The creation of NSA resulted from a December 10 , 1951 , memo sent by Walter Bedell Smith to James B. Lay , Executive Secretary of the National Security Council .
The memo observed that " control over , and coordination of , the collection and processing of Communications Intelligence had proved ineffective " and recommended a survey of communications intelligence activities .
The proposal was approved on December 13 , 1951 , and the study authorized on December 28 , 1951 .
The report was completed by June 13 , 1952 .
Generally known as the " Brownell Committee Report , " after committee chairman Herbert Brownell , it surveyed the history of U.S. communications intelligence activities and suggested the need for a much greater degree of coordination and direction at the national level .
As the change in the security agency 's name indicated , the role of the NSA was to extend beyond the armed forces .
2
In the last several decades some of the secrecy surrounding NSA has been stripped away by Congressional hearings and investigative research .
Most recently NSA has been the subject of criticism for failing to adjust to the post - Cold War technological environment as well as for operating a " global surveillance network " alleged to intrude on the privacy of individuals across the world .
The following documents provide insight into the creation , evolution , management and operations of NSA , including the controversial ECHELON program .
Also included are newly released documents ( 7a - 7f ) that focus on the restrictions NSA places on reporting the identities of U.S. persons  including former president Jimmy Carter and first lady Hillary Clinton , and NSA Director Michael Hayden 's unusual public statement ( Document 16 ) before the House Intelligence Committee .
Several of these documents also appear in either of two National Security Archive collections on U.S. intelligence .
The U.S. Intelligence Community : Organization , Operations and Management : 1947 -1989 ( 1990 ) and U.S. Espionage and Intelligence : Organization , Operations , and Management , 1947 - 1996 ( 1997 ) publish together for the first time recently declassified documents pertaining to the organizational structure , operations and management of the U.S. Intelligence Community over the last fifty years , cross-indexed for maximum accessibility .
Together , these two sets reproduce on microfiche over 2,000 organizational histories , memoranda , manuals , regulations , directives , reports , and studies , totalling more than 50,000 pages of documents from the Office of the Director of Central Intelligence , the Central Intelligence Agency , National Reconnaissance Office , National Security Agency , Defense Intelligence Agency , military service intelligence organizations , National Security Council , and other official government agencies and organizations .
THE DOCUMENTS
Document 1 . NSCID 9 , " Communications Intelligence , " March 10 , 1950 .
National Security Council Intelligence Directives have provided the highest - level policy guidance for intelligence activities since they were first issued in 1947 .
This document establishes and defines the responsibilities of the United States Communications Intelligence Board .
The Board , according to the directive , is to provide " authoritative coordination of [ the ] Communications Intelligence activities of the Government and to advise the Director of Central Intelligence in those matters in the field of Communications Intelligence for which he is responsible . "
The particularly sensitive nature of communications intelligence ( COMINT ) activities was highlighted by paragraph 6 , which noted that such activities should be treated " in all respects as being outside the framework of other or general intelligence activities . "
Thus , regulations or directives pertaining to other intelligence activities were not applicable to COMINT activities .
Document 2a . Memorandum from President Harry S. Truman to the Secretary of State , the Secretary of Defense , Subject : Communications Intelligence Activities , October 24 , 1952 .
Document 2b . National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 9 , Communications Intelligence , December 29 , 1952 .
President Truman 's memorandum revokes the provisions of NSCID 9 with regard to the composition , responsibilities , and procedures of the U.S. Communications Intelligence Board .
It establishes the USCIB as an entity " acting for and under " a newly created Special Committee of the National Security Council for COMINT , consisting of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense .
More significantly , Truman 's memo , along with a Department of Defense directive , established NSA , and transformed communications intelligence from a military activity divided among the three services to a unified national activity .
3
Thus , the first sentence states that " The communications intelligence ( COMINT ) activities of the United States are a national responsibility . "
The memorandum instructs the Special Committee to issue a directive to the Secretary of Defense which defines the COMINT mission of NSA as being to " provide an effective , unified organization and control of the communications intelligence activities of the United States conducted against foreign governments . "
Thus , " all COMINT collection and production resources of the United States are placed under his operational and technical control . "
The directive provided the NSA director with no authority regarding the collection of electronic intelligence ( ELINT ) such as intelligence obtained from the interception of the emanations of radarsor of missile telemetry .
Responsibility for ELINT remained with the military services .
NSCID 9 of December 1952 replaces its 1950 predecessor as mandated by Truman 's directive .
Often using identical language to that in the Truman directive , it revises the responsibilities of the United States Communications Intelligence Board as well as defining the role of the newly created National Security Agency and enumerating the responsibilities of its director .
Document 3 . Memo to President Johnson , September 6 , 1968 .
This memo , from national security adviser Walt Rostow to President Johnson , provides information concerning North Vietnamese / Viet Cong military and political strategy during the last months of Johnson 's presidency .
The last item in the memo notes that its conclusions were partly a function of the author 's access to relevant intercepted communications .
The memo specifically notes unusual , high - priority message traffic between Hanoi and subordinate units directing forces in South Vietnam as well as urgent messages from the Military Affairs Committee of COSVN ( Central Office for South Vietnam ) to subordinates .
It does not reveal how extensively the U.S. was able to decrypt the messages .
Document 4 . Department of Defense Directive S-5100.20 , " The National Security Agency and the Central Security Service , " December 23 , 1971 .
Originally classified Secret , this directive remains in effect today , with minor changes .
Key portions of the directive specify the NSA 's role in managing the signals intelligence effort for the entire U.S. government , the role of the Secretary of Defense in appointing and supervising the work of the NSA 's director , the authorities assigned to the director of NSA , and the relationships that NSA is expected to maintain with other components of the government .
Among the specific responsibilities assigned to the director are preparation of a consolidated SIGINT program and budget for Defense Department SIGINT activities , the " exercise of SIGINT operational control over SIGINT activities of the United States , " and the production and dissemination of SIGINT " in accordance with the objectives , requirements , and priorities established by the Director of Central Intelligence . "
The directive reflects the 1958 addition of electronic intelligence to NSA 's responsibilities , making it the national authority for both components of signals intelligence .
Document 5 a .
NSCID 6 , " Signals Intelligence , " February 17 , 1972 .
Document 5 b .
Department of Justice , " Report of the Inquiry into CIA - Related Electronic Surveillance Activities , " 1976 , pp. 77-9 .
NSCID 6 is the most recently available NSCID concerning SIGINT .
It was still in effect at least as late as 1987 .
An earlier version of the directive was issued in 1958 , when NSA was first assigned responsibility for electronics intelligence .
The version released by the NSC in 1976 contains little more than the definitions for COMINT and ELINT .
However , a Justice Department report obtained by author James Bamford while researching his book , The Puzzle Palace , quoted additional portions of the directive .
The directive specifies that the Director of NSA is to produce SIGINT in response to the objectives , requirements and priorities of the Director of Central Intelligence .
It also empowers the director to issue direct instructions to any organizations engaged in SIGINT operations , with the exception of certain CIA and FBI activities , and states that the instructions are mandatory .
Document 6 a .
NSA COMINT Report , " Capital Projects Planned in India , " August 31 , 1972 .
Document 6 b . NSA , " Indias Heavy Water Shortages , " October 1982 .
These two documents provide examples of NSA reporting , as well as demonstrating that NSAs collection targets have included Indian atomic energy programs .
Portions of each document that discuss or reveal the contents of the intercepts have been redacted .
However , the classification of the documents indicates that high - level communications intelligence was used in preparing the report .
UMBRA is the highest - level compartment of the three compartments of Special Intelligence the euphemism for COMINT .
The lower level compartments are MORAY and SPOKE .
The classification ( either TSU [ TOP SECRET UMBRA ] or MORAY ) of the 25 reports which Document 6 b was derived from indicate that the report relied extensively on COMINT .
The report also demonstrates how NSA , often to the annoyance of the CIA , has gone far beyond its formal collection and processing responsibilities and into the analysis of the data it has collected .

Document 7 . United States Signals Intelligence Directive [ USSID ] 18 , " Legal Compliance and Minimization Procedures , " July 27 , 1993 .
While NSCIDs and DoD Directives offer general guidance on the activities of NSA and the United States SIGINT System ( USSS ) , far more detailed guidance is provided by the director of NSA in the form of United States Signals Intelligence Directives ( USSIDs ) .
The directives fall into at least nine different categories : policy , collection , processing , analysis and reporting , standards , administration , training , data processing , and tasking .
In the aftermath of revelations in the 1970s about NSA interception of the communications of anti-war and other political activists new procedures were established governing the interception of communications involving Americans .
5
The version of USSID 18 currently in force was issued in July 1993 and " prescribes policies and procedures and assigns responsibilities to ensure that the missions and functions of the United States SIGINT System ( USSS ) are conducted in a manner that safeguards the constitutional rights of U.S. persons . "
Section 4 ( " Collection , " pp.2 -6 ) specifies the circumstances under which U.S. SIGINT activities may intercept communications of or about U.S. persons , as well as the authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the Attorney General , and the Director of NSA to approve the collection of such information .
Section 5 ( " Processing , " pp.6 - 7 ) focuses on the restrictions on processing intercepted communications involving U.S. persons -- including domestic communications collected during foreign communications collection operations .
Section 6 ( " Retention , " p.8 ) deals with the retention of intercepted communications about U.S. persons .
Section 7 ( " Dissemination , " pp.8-10 ) concerns restrictions on dissemination .
It requires that all SIGINT reports be written " so as to focus solely on the activities of foreign entities and persons and their agents . "
It also specifies some of the conditions under which U.S. persons can be identified in SIGINT reports -- for example , when the communications indicate the person is an agent of a foreign power .
Document 7a .
NSA , " USSID 18 : Dissemination of U.S. Government Organizations and Officials ( U) --INFORMATION MEMORANDUM , " February 5 , 1993 .
This NSA memo indicates that the conditions for identification of U.S. officials by title in NSA reporting varies depending on whether or not the individual is a member of the executive branch .
Senior officials of the executive branch may be identified by title , without prior approval from higher authority , when the official 's title is necessary to understand or assess foreign intelligence .
In contrast , officials from the legislative and judicial branches cannot be identified by title , even if that information is necessary to understand foreign intelligence , unless approval is obtained from higher authority .
The memo implies that , under the assumed conditions , the use of names is not permitted .
Document 7b .
NSA , " USSID 18 : Reporting Guidance on References to the First Lady , " July 8 , 1993 .
This memo followed a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that Hillary Clinton was a full - time government official .
It notes that she could be identified in reports by title ( Chairperson of the President 's Task Force on National Health Care Reform ) without prior approval when that title was necessary to understand or assess foreign intelligence and when the information related to her official duties .
The memo also contains guidance on reports containing information about information concerning Mrs. Clinton that is not clearly foreign intelligence .
Document 7 c . National Security Agency / Central Security Service , " U.S. Identities in SIGINT , " March 1994 .
This 48 - page document is intended to provide detailed guidance concerning on the use of U.S. identities in SIGINT reports as well as the dissemination of U.S. identities to consumers outside the United States SIGINT System .
It consists of 12 sections ( including ones on requests for U.S. identities , accountability , dissemination , and collection and processing ) , and five appendices ( including those on approved generic references and USSID 18 criteria for dissemination ) .
Document No. 7d . NSA , USSID 18 : Reporting Guidance on Former President Carter 's Involvement in the Bosnian Peace Process ( U ) -- Information Guidance , December 15 , 1994 .
The issue of when the identity or even title of a U.S. citizen can be included in reporting based on communications intercepts is a major focus of USSID 18 .
This NSA memo was prepared in response to the invitation to former President Carter to travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in efforts to end the war .
It specifies that as long as Carter is acting as a private citizen he may be referred to only as a " U.S. person " in any reports .
Document 7e . NSA , " Understanding USSID 18 and Contextual Identifications , " September 30 , 1997 .
The issue of identification by context is the subject of this memo .
It notes that , in describing U.S. entities , analysts are required , in general , to substitute sufficiently generic terms for the entities -- terms that do not " directly lead to the identification of a U.S. entity even though the identity has been obscured in the report . "
Violation of the " contextual identification rule " requires that the report " must be cancelled , reworded and reissued to eliminate the identifying information . "
The guidance clearly does not apply to those cases where inclusion of more specific information is necessary to evaluate foreign intelligence .
Document No. 7f , NSA , " USSID 18 Guide , " February 1998 .
The introduction to this document notes that it is an informal guide to the provisions of USSID 18 with respect to the issue of the COMINT collection and and dissemination of U.S. identities .
One section focues on USSID 18 issues with respect to threat situations , including when an individual is held captive by a foreign power or group or when an intercept reveals a threat to a U.S. person .
The section on non-threat situations contains guidance on the disposition of the inadvertent intercept of communciations between U.S. persons , on processing and reporting of incidentally intercepted communications of a U.S. person during foreign intelligence collection , and the handling of U.S. identities in reports .
Document 8 . Director of Central Intelligence Directive ( DCID )
6/1 , " SIGINT Committee , " May 12 , 1982 .
The SIGINT Committee , now known as the National SIGINT Committee , was first established in 1958 to oversee key aspects of U.S. SIGINT activities the identification of collection requirements , evaluation of how well U.S. and allied SIGINT activities satisfy requirements , and the production of recommendations concerning SIGINT arrangements with foreign governments .
This directive is the most recent available version of DCID 6/1 .
While the directive remains formally classified , the full text of the document has been published previously in scholarly works and on the world wide web .6
The SIGINT Committee operated for many years with two permanent subcommittees the SIGINT Requirements Validation and Evaluation Subcommittee ( SIRVES ) and the SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee ( SORS ) .
In the mid-1990s two new groups were established : The Weapons and Space Systems Advisory Group , to " coordinate SIGINT on foreign weapons and space systems , " and the National Emitter Intelligence Subcommittee , which focuses on SIGINT production concerning foreign radars and other non-communications signals .

Document 9 . NAVSECGRU Instruction C5450.48A , Subj : Mission , Functions and Tasks of Naval Security Group Activity ( NAVSECGRUACT ) Sugar Grove , West Virginia , September 3 , 1991 .
While NSA directs and manages U.S. SIGINT activities , almost all collection activity is actually carried out by the military service SIGINT units including the Naval Security Group Command .
The role of the unit at Sugar Grove in intercepting the international leased carrier ( ILC ) communications passing through INTELSAT satellites was first revealed in James Bamford 's The Puzzle Palace .8
The regulation reveals that Sugar Grove is associated with what has become a highly controversial program in Europe , North America , Australia , and New Zealand .
The program , codenamed ECHELON , has been described as a global surveillance network that intercepts and processes the world 's communications and distributes it among the primary partners in the decades - old UKUSA alliance the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand .9
In reality , ECHELON is a more limited program , allowing the UKUSA allies to specify intelligence requirements and automatically receive relevant intercepts obtained by the UKUSA facilities which intercept satellite communications ( but not the U.S. facilities that receive data from SIGINT satellites ) .
It is also limited by both technological barriers ( the inability to develop word - spotting software so as to allow for the automatic processing of intercepted conversations ) and the limitations imposed on collection activities by the UKUSA allies at least as regards the citizens of those countries .
10
Thus , the NAVSECGRU instruction also specifies that one of the responsibilities of the commander of the Sugar Grove site is to " ensure the privacy of U.S. citizens are properly safeguarded pursuant to the provisions of USSID 18 . "
Document 10 .
Farewell from Vice Admiral William O. Studeman to NSA Employees , April 8 , 1992 .
This address by the departing director of NSA , William Studeman , examines NSA 's post - Cold War mission , likely budgetary limitations , and other challenges facing the agency .
Reflecting the increasing emphasis on " support to military operations , " Studeman notes that " the military account is basic to NSA as a defense agency , and the lack of utter faithfulness to this fact will court decline . "
He also observes that " the demands for increased global access are growing " and that " these business areas ( SMO and global access ) will be the two , hopefully strong legs on which NSA must stand . "
He also argues that " technical and operational innovation to deal with a changing and changed world must continue to dominate . "
Document 11 . Letter , Stewart A. Baker , General Counsel , NSA to Gerald E. McDowell , Esq. , September 9 , 1992 .
In the wake of disclosures about the role of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro ( BNL ) , particularly its Atlanta branch , in the provision of financial assistance to the regime of Saddam Hussein , questions were raised about whether the intelligence community was providing sufficient support to law enforcement .
This letter , from NSA 's general counsel , answers a series of questions from the Justice Department pertaining to NSA 's knowledge of , or involvement in , BNL activities .
The responses appear to indicate that NSA had not derived any intelligence concerning BNL activities from its intercept operations .
The letter also stresses NSA 's sensitivity to the issue of the privacy of American citizens ( noting that " NSA improperly targeted the communications of a number of Americans opposed to the Vietnam War " ) and the restrictions on reporting information concerning U.S. citizens or corporations .
Document 12 . " Activation of Echelon Units , " from History of the Air Intelligence Agency , 1 January - 31 December 1994 , Volume I ( San Antonio , TX : AIA , 1995 ) .
The first extract from the Air Intelligence Agency 's 1994 annual history provides additional information on the ECHELON network .
ECHELON units include components of the AIA 's 544th Intelligence Group .
Detachment 2 and 3 are located at Sabana Seca , Puerto Rico and Sugar Grove , West Virginia respectively .
The second reference to Detachment 3 is apparently a typo that should read Detachment 4 ( located at Yakima , Washington ) .
The deleted words appear to be " civilian communications , " " NAVSECGRU " and " NSA . "
The second extract notes that AIAs participation in a classified activity " had been limited to LADYLOVE operations at Misawa AB [ Air Base ] , Japan . "
The Misawa LADYLOVE activity was initiated during the Cold War to intercept Soviet military communications transmitted via satellite along with similar operations at Menwith Hill , UK ; Bad Aibling , Germany ; and Rosman , North Carolina .
This extract suggests that both Guam and Misawa have , at the least , been considered as possible sites for ECHELON operations .
Document 13 .
NSA Point Paper , " SIGINT Reporting on Murders of Michael DeVine in 1990 and the Disappearance of Efraín Bamaca in 1992 in Guatemala , " March 24 , 1995 .
On March 23 , 1995 , Rep. Robert Torricelli , a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , charged that the CIA had been withholding from Congress information it had obtained regarding the deaths of Michael DeVine , an American innkeeper living in Guatemala , and Efraín Bámaca Velásquez , a Guatemalan guerrilla leader and husband of an American lawyer .
Both murders , according to Torricelli , were linked to a Guatemalan army colonel , Julio Roberto Alpírez , a paid intelligence asset of the CIA.11
The revelations set off a firestorm of criticism and caused the Clinton administration to order a government - wide investigation over these and other cases of torture and murder attributed to Guatemalan security forces .
While the CIA was the main target of such criticism , Torricelli had also reportedly received an anonymous fax from someone inside the NSA alleging that documents pertaining to the Bámaca and DeVine cases were being destroyed .
12
This Top Secret NSA position paper responds to these allegations .
NSA claims that SIGINT reporting related to these cases is limited to " Guatemalan government reaction to U.S. and international human rights concerns , " and does not include specific information regarding the circumstances of death or the involvement of Colonel Alpírez .
The document is one of only a handful of declassified records in which the NSA even acknowledges specific SIGINT activities or reports .
Document 14 .
Memorandum , Daniel C. Kurtzer , Acting Assitant Secretary , Bureau of Intelligence and Research to Vice Admiral J.M. McConnell , Director , National Security Agency , Subject : Proposed Declassification of the " Fact of " Overhead SIGINT Collection , September 6 , 1995 .
In 1978 , President Jimmy Carter acknowledged that the U.S. employed reconnaissance satellites to collect imagery of foreign targets .
Early in 1995 , President Clinton declassified details concerning early satellite imagery programs such as CORONA .
However , even the existence of SIGINT satellites remained classified until late 1995 when Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch authorized the official acknowledgement of space - based SIGINT operations.13
The process involved soliciting the opinions of U.S. government departments whose interests might be affected by disclosure .
The State Department 's memo expressed concern about the impact in certain countries .
Despite the deletions , it is clear that the department was anxious about the impact in the foreign countries where the U.S. operates ground stations for SIGINT satellites the United Kingdom ( at Menwith Hill ) , Germany ( at Bad Aibling ) , and Australia ( at Pine Gap ) .
The memo also indicates that the proposal for declassification emanated from the National Reconnaissance Office .
Document 15 .
Organization Chart , NSA Operations Directorate , November 4 , 1998 .
The organization chart of NSA 's Directorate of Operations is notable for several reasons .
Traditionally , such information was not released by NSA , which under the provisions of Public Law 86 - 36 is not required to release even unclassified organizational information .
In recent years , however , NSA has released more information about organization and administrative matters , and acknowledged the use of a variety of aircraft for SIGINT collection .
The organization chart also shows how the operations directorate has been reorganized since the end of the Cold War .
Throughout much of the Cold War , the directorate consisted of three key regional groups A ( Soviet Bloc ) , B ( Asian Communist ) , and G ( All Other ) .
After the Soviet collapse the regional groups were reduced to one for European nations and one for all other .
The new organizational structure reflects the increasing empahsis on transnational activities , which cut across nations and regions .
Document 16 .
Statement for the Record of NSA Director Lt Gen Michael V. Hayden , USAF before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , April 12 , 2000 .
In a rare public appearance by the NSA director , Lt. Gen .
Michael Hayden outlines the regulatory safeguards and oversight mechanisms that are in place to ensure that the agency 's electronic surveillance mission does not infringe upon the privacy of U.S. persons , and to respond to recent allegations that NSA provides intelligence information to U.S. companies .
The agency may only target the communications of U.S. persons within the United States after obtaining a federal court order suggesting that the individual might be " an agent of a foreign power . "
The number of such cases have been " very few " since the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 .
In cases where the NSA wishes to conduct electronic surveillance on U.S. persons overseas , the agency must first obtain the approval of the Attorney General , who must have probable cause to believe that the individual " is an agent of a foreign power , or a spy , terrorist , saboteur , or someone who aides or abets them . "
With regard to the unintentional collection of communications to , from , or about U.S. citizens , Hayden stresses that such information is not retained " unless the information is necessary to understand a particular piece of foreign intelligence or assess its importance . "
In response to other allegations , Hayden asserts that NSA cannot request that another country " illegally " collect intelligence on U.S. persons on their behalf , and also that the agency " is not authorized to provide signals intelligence information to private U.S. companies . "

The list of issues on which Barack Obama has flipped now that the primaries are over is long and growing rapidly .
• He says he believes in a Second Amendment right to bear arms .
• He now opposes late - term abortion .
• He suddenly is a devotee of using faith - based institutions to deliver public services .
• He now says that he wo n’t raise Social Security taxes on anyone making less than $ 250,000 a year .
In the primary , he said he ’d eliminate the threshold entirely , including on people making as little as $ 100,000 .
• He recently opposed the Fairness Doctrine for talk radio .
• Now he says he ’s going to consult with the military before pulling out of Iraq .
But so extensive a list of flip - flops , all in the past few weeks , begs the basic question :
Was he lying before when he was a liberal , or is he prevaricating now ?
Even if Obama means what he is saying as he moves to the center trying to win the general election , the fact is that he will be forced to move very far to the left should he become president , forced by the liberals in his own party .
If Obama wins , it ’s more than likely that he will take office with a Congress filled with Democrats and liberals .
Most probably , the Senate will have at least 55 Democrats ( including pickups in Colorado , New Mexico , Virginia , New Hampshire and Alaska ) .
And there might be as many as 62 ( possible Democratic pickups include Maine , Minnesota , Oregon , Kentucky , Texas , Kansas and North Carolina ) .
The House will , of course , be solidly in Democratic control .
Faced with the same situation in 1993 , as he took office as president , Bill Clinton found no alternative but to move dramatically to the left , shelving for the moment his promises of a middle - class tax cut and welfare reform .
He had no choice .
The Democratic majorities in both Houses served him with notice : Either you stay within the caucus and not cross the aisle in search of support for centrist policies , or we will do unto you what we did to Jimmy Carter when Tip O’Neill turned on him and made his life miserable .
Clinton was forced to emphasize healthcare reform over welfare changes and to go with a liberal economic stimulus package capped by big tax increases .
The liberal stain sank so deeply into the fabric of his presidency that it caused him to lose Congress in 1994 , and almost to lose the 1996 election .
It will be the same with Obama .
On all of his basic issues , the Democrats in Congress will hold his feet to the fire and make him govern to the left .
On his signature issue of Iraq , he may find himself with a war already won , a democracy already stable and a problem already solved .
Nevertheless , he will be forced to rip the scab from the wound and set it bleeding again by bringing our troops home prematurely .
His healthcare proposals will be forced far to the left until they amount to a government takeover of the healthcare system .
Obama will not be able to govern from the center .
His party wo n’t let him do it .
Ultimately , Bill Clinton ’s congressional supporters became his jailers and he morphed from their leader into their hostage .
Dependent on every last Democrat to pass legislation in the House and to prevail over a filibuster in the Senate , he found himself pushed further and further to the left until , he told me , “ I do n’t even recognize myself . ”
He had to lade his economic and anti-crime package with pork to satisfy urban congressmen and to win their support of a bill that included a federal death penalty .
Obama will not be able to help himself .
The Democratic majority in Congress wo n’t settle for triangulation .
They will make the Obama of November into a liar and the Obama of the primaries into an honest man .
Macon .Com is reporting Macon Mall faces foreclosure .
Foreclosure action has begun against Macon [ Georgia ]
Mall because of nonpayment on a $ 141.2 million loan , and a new management company has been approved by the court to take control of the 1.4 million - square - foot facility .
" We do n't expect any operational interruptions to the mall , " said Brooke Houghton , spokeswoman for Chicago - based Jones Lang LaSalle Americas Inc. , the court - appointed retail management company now managing Macon Mall .
" We do n't think there will be any impact on the stores or the customers we serve .
We are open and ready for business as usual . "
According to court documents , in June 2005 when New Jersey - based The Lightstone Group borrowed $ 141.2 million , Macon Mall LLC and Burlington Mall LLC in North Carolina were used as collateral for the loan , as well as rents and other income from the properties .
The company purchased the two malls about the same time in 2005 for $ 166 million .
The loan currently is held by LaSalle Bank National Association as trustee for a trust that holds and owns a pool of loans including the one for Macon Mall .
The trust filed the complaint .
Since the loan was made , Parisians and the Piccadilly Cafeteria have closed at the mall , and Linens - N - Things - part of the mall property , even though it 's not inside the main building - is in the process of closing .
In a letter filed in the case , " Dillard 's has apparently communicated its intent to close its store location at Macon Mall . "
Based on an appraisal " the value of the property has fallen approximately 60 percent since June 30 , 2005 . "

Fruit is generally expensive in Japan , and people often buy grapes , peaches and melons as luxury gifts .
Japanese are often willing to pay top prices for high - end fruits , especially for the prestige of owning the very first ones of the year .
The Bush administration plans to send an envoy to talks with Iran ’s chief nuclear negotiator in Geneva this weekend in what would be the highest - level U.S. - Iranian meeting in nearly three decades , officials said late Tuesday .
William J. Burns , undersecretary of state for political affairs and the administration ’s point man on Iran , will accompany European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana with Saeed Jalili in discussions aimed at persuading Tehran to stop enriching uranium .
U.S. officials insisted that Mr. Burns will not negotiate with Mr. Jalili but only listen to what the Iranian has to say .
He will “ reiterate that our terms for negotiations remain the same : Iran must suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities , ” one official was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
Still , the meeting represents a remarkable shift for President Bush , who called Iran part of an “ axis of evil ” six years ago and has refused to engage with Tehran .
More significantly , the Saturday meeting will take place before a suspension has occurred .
Two years ago , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki , but only if Tehran stops enrichment .
Mr. Mottaki told the United States and five other powers this month that Iran would not engage in “ condescending ” talks because Middle East developments in recent years have strengthened its position to negotiate on its own terms .
The Iranian response to a refreshed package of incentives in exchange for an enrichment suspension came in a letter that was sent on July 4 and leaked to a French newspaper Tuesday .
“ The world has changed , ” Mr. Mottaki wrote in an apparent reference to the Iraq war and other regional developments that are perceived to have diminished U.S. influence .
“ Nobody can regard himself above the law or the sole enforcer of the law . ”
In his letter , a copy of which was posted on the Web site of the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur , the foreign minister added : “ The time for negotiating from the condescending position of inequality has come to an end . ”
Last month ’s package , which included political , security and economic incentives , came two years after Iran rejected a similar deal offered by the United States , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China .
We have no intention of changing this path , ” Mr. Mottaki wrote in his letter .
“ The people of Iran have worked out plans for the advancement of their country , without asking for help from others . ”
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama , meanwhile , called on Tehran on Tuesday to start negotiating with the West now , before the terms get tougher next year should he win the White House .
Mr. Obama , who has been criticized for planning to hold direct talks with Iranian officials without preconditions , sought to appear tough on the Islamic Republic in what was touted as a major foreign policy speech .
“ The Iranians should negotiate now .
By waiting , they will only face mounting pressure , ” he said .
“ Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons is a vital national security interest of the United States .
No tool of statecraft should be taken off the table . ”
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday that the next U.S. administration has “ no other option ” but to begin talks with Tehran .
“ Tehran welcomes negotiations but will not accept the precondition set by the West — the suspension of uranium enrichment , ” he was quoted as saying in a television interview .
The U.N. Security Council has adopted three rounds of economic sanctions against Iran because of its refusal to suspend enrichment , which it insists is for peaceful purposes .
But the West says the enrichment is meant to be used for a nuclear weapon .
The Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee will consider legislation this week that would expand U.S. sanctions against Iran , the panel ’s top members said Tuesday .
It comes just days after Tehran test - fired missiles it said could reach U.S. assets in the region .

Plenty of policy types like the idea of expensive gasoline , which they hope will force America to change its energy habits .
Detroit is less thrilled with $ 4 gas , but resigned to it all the same .
The question is :
What ’s the best way out for U.S. automakers and the environment ?
To tweak the machine , or build a new one altogether ?
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors are both struggling these days , stuck with thousands of gas - guzzling trucks on lots and factories geared to make even more , just as consumers turn their back on big , ...
( CNN ) -- Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens is putting his clout behind renewable energy sources like wind power .
T. Boone Pickens talks about the advantages of wind power on CNN in May .
The legendary entrepreneur and philanthropist on Tuesday unveiled a new energy plan he says will decrease the United States ' dependency on foreign oil by more than one - third and help shift American energy production toward renewable natural resources .
" The Pickens Plan " calls for investing in domestic renewable resources such as wind , and switching from oil to natural gas as a transportation fuel .
In a news conference outlining his proposal , Pickens said his impetus for the plan is the country 's dangerous reliance on foreign oil .
" Our dependence on imported oil is killing our economy .
It is the single biggest problem facing America today , " he said .
Watch Pickens discuss plan for wind power »
" Wind power is ... clean , it 's renewable .
It 's everything you want .
And it 's a stable supply of energy , " Pickens told CNN in May .
" It 's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind . "
Pickens ' company , Mesa Power , recently announced a $ 2 billion investment as the first step in a multibillion - dollar plan to build the world 's largest wind farm in Pampa , Texas .
Pickens said Tuesday that if the United States takes advantage of the so - called " wind corridor , " stretching from the Canadian border to West Texas , energy from wind turbines built there could supply 20 percent or more of the nation 's power .
He suggested the project could be funded by private investors .
Power from thousands of wind turbines that would line the corridor could be distributed throughout the country via electric power transmission lines and could fuel power plants in large population hubs , the oil baron said .
Fueling these plants with wind power would then free up the natural gas historically used to power them , and would mean that natural gas could replace foreign oil as fuel for motor vehicles , he said .
Using natural gas for transportation needs could replace one - third of the United States ' imported oil and would save more than $ 230 billion a year , Pickens said .
" We are going to have to do something different in America , " Pickens told CNN .
" You can't keep paying out $ 600 billion a year for oil . "
His energy plan could be implemented within 10 years if both Congress and the White House treat the current energy situation as a " national emergency and take immediate action , " he predicted .
Pickens , a lifelong Republican , says he is not advising either presidential candidate , but is prepared to work with the next president .
The Web site for the plan urges people to sign up and help spread the word .
Oil analyst Peter Beutel of Cameron Hanover , an energy risk manager , said Pickens ' plan could definitely reduce the country 's dependency on foreign oil .
" The best thing about it is that it 's a definite plan -- it 's not something that either party has pitted itself outrightly against .
It therefore has a tremendous chance for success on Capitol Hill . "
Analyst Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. , an investment firm , added that such a plan " has been on the drawing board for years . "
At least 21 states and the District of Columbia have set deadlines or goals for utilities to obtain electricity from clean , renewable sources instead of fossil fuel - burning plants .

The scramble has triggered construction of large - scale wind farms throughout much of the nation , including proposals for the first U.S. offshore facilities .
Delaware and Galveston , Texas , have offshore projects in the works , although a farm proposed off New York 's Long Island was shelved this year because of high projected construction costs .
In Massachusetts , where utilities are under the gun to obtain four percent of electricity from renewables by 2009 , builders await federal approval of a hugely controversial wind farm off historic Cape Cod .
The Cape Wind project envisions 130 wind turbines each rising 440 feet above Nantucket Sound by 2011 .
State officials said the farm will eliminate pollution equal to 175,000 gas - burning cars .

I wrote this yesterday , but deleted it by accident .
I still love this :
( Via e-mail , a prominent Republican strategist who occasionally provides advice to the McCain campaign said , simply , " We 're f*&ked . "
I figured BushCo would go after Maliki after he basically signed on to Obama 's Iraq position .
In an interview with Der Spiegel released on Saturday , Maliki said he wanted U.S. troops to withdraw from Iraq as soon as possible .
“ U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16 months .
That , we think , would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal , with the possibility of slight changes ” [..]
And “ The Americans have found it difficult to agree on a concrete timetable for the exit because it seems like an admission of defeat to them .
But it is n’t , ” Maliki told Der Spiegel .
Marc Ambinder writes
This could be one of those unexpected events that forever changes the way the world perceives an issue .
Iraq 's Prime Minister agrees with Obama , and there 's no wiggle room or fudge factor .
This puts John McCain in an extremely precarious spot : what 's left to argue ?
to argue against Maliki would be to predicate that Iraqi sovereignty at this point means nothing .
Obviously , our national interests are n't equivalent to Iraq 's , but ...
Malik is n't listening to the generals on the ground ... but the " has n't been to Iraq " line does n't work here .
Soon after , Maliki tried to clarify --- errr --- or verify his remarks .
I bet the video conference machine was pretty busy over the weekend .
So we get the Maliki Walkback , sort of ... But Spiegel stands by its comments ...
Obama is pleased , but McCain certainly is not .
In an interview with SPIEGEL , Iraqi Prime Minister al - Maliki expressed support for Obama 's troop withdrawal plans .
Despite a half - hearted retraction , the comments have stirred up the US presidential campaign .
SPIEGEL stands by its version of the conversation .
And they are still similar positions with Obama :
Iraq 's government spokesman is hopeful that U.S. combat forces could be out of the country by 2010 .
Ali al - Dabbagh made the comments following a meeting in Baghdad on Monday between Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama , who arrived in Iraq earlier in the day .
But how were they translated ?
McCain can say he 's winning and we won and all that ... Then why are n't we leaving ?
Well they say " Iraq is fragile . "
Huh ?
So McCain says we won , but we can't leave because it 's fragile .
Will it be fragile for 100 years ?

Professor Robert Langer pioneered biomedicines
One of the most prolific inventors in medicine has won the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize .
Professor Robert Langer 's biomaterials research has allowed for more accurate and controlled release of drugs into patients ' bodies .
His work has had a significant impact on fighting cancer and heart disease , with more than 100 million people using medicines delivered via his designs .
The 800,000 euros award is seen as an unofficial Nobel Prize for technology .
It is given every second year for a technology that " significantly improves the quality of human life , today and in the future " .
Professor Langer received the award at a ceremony in Helsinki , Finland .
He told BBC News : " I am just thrilled and shocked .
It 's a wonderful honour and I feel very , very lucky . "
His work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology involved finding a way to gradually release drug molecules into a patient 's body .
Too large
The problem was that drug molecules were too large to slip through the microscopic holes in any of the available polymers ( synthetic materials ) that encapsulated the medicine .
His solution was to develop a polymer with a three - dimensional matrix structure that allowed drug molecules to pass through and into a patient 's system .
We 're working on new biomaterials , working on a lot of nanotechnology to deliver drugs right to the cells and working on nanoparticles to deliver genetic material
Professor Robert Langer
He began his work in 1974 and by the early 1990s his polymers were being used in wafers to deliver medicines directly into the brains of cancer patients .
The wafers represented the biggest change in treatment for brain cancer patients in 25 years .
He said : " We were the first to show how to deliver large molecules [ of drugs ] ; that was the initial innovation .
" We came up with a way of creating very complex , porous systems that enabled you to release very large molecules .
" To be fair , when we first did it I am not sure we totally understood exactly how it worked . "
He added " But we also developed a lot of new materials that are now used in controlled release and also advanced the whole area of tissue engineering . "
The Millennium Technology Prize awarded Professor Langer 800,000 euro while five other technologists shortlisted for the prize each received 115,000 euros .
The shortlisted laureates were Sir Alec Jeffreys , creator of DNA fingerprinting ; Professor David Payne , co-inventor of an optical amplifier which transformed telecommunications ; his co-inventors , Prof Emmanual Desurvire and Dr Randy Giles ; and Dr Andrew Viterbi , whose eponymous algorithm aids modern communications .
The two previous recipients of the Millennium Technology Prize are Sir Tim Berners - Lee , inventor of the world wide web , and Shuji Nakamura , creator of energy efficient LEDs .
New avenues Professor Langer told BBC
News : " The fact that controlled release of drugs is helping so many people gives me the greatest satisfaction .
" It 's certainly the most rewarding thing . "
Professor Langer 's research has spawned more than a dozen biotechnology firms and led to new avenues of research into biomaterials .
His polymer research led to the design of new kind of biomaterials that can be used as artificial tissues , such as skin , cartilage , liver and other cells .
The idea is to make a temporary structure for the cells that can grow around and within the polymer material .
When the natural tissue is strong enough , the artificial " scaffold " dissolves .
Professor Langer has also pioneered remote - control systems in which the rate of drug release can be controlled by ultrasound and magnetic fields .
The work has resulted in the early development of so - called pharmacies on a chip , in which a range of medicines are delivered into a body as and when they are needed .
Professor Langer runs a lab of 100 biotechnicians at MIT , and holds more than 500 patents on technology .
He said the laboratory continued to pioneer new treatments .
" We 're working on new biomaterials , working on a lot of nanotechnology to deliver drugs right to the cells and working on nanoparticles to deliver genetic material .
" We 're also doing a lot in the area of tissue engineering , creating new organs . "

What are these ?
Naba Barkakati , an engineer who is the chief technologist for the Government Accountability Office and who also attended this week ’s briefing , said of the F.B.I. ’s forensics case against Dr. Ivins : “ It ’s very hard to get the sense of whether this was scientifically good or bad .
We did n’t really get the question settled , other than taking their word for it . ”
The bureau ’s lab work has come under sharp criticism in recent years for problems over DNA analysis , bullet tracing and other important forensic technology .
In 2004 , the laboratory mismatched a fingerprint taken from the Madrid terror bombings to a lawyer in Portland , Ore. , Brandon Mayfield , who was then arrested .
He won a $ 2.8 million settlement .
With the main suspect in the anthrax killings now dead , F.B.I. officials say they realize they will again face tough scrutiny over the strength of their scientific evidence against Dr. Ivins .
Indeed , conspiracy theories are already flourishing on many Web sites , with skeptical observers asking whether the Maryland scientist was set up to take the fall for the attacks or , worse yet , was a murder victim .
The fact that the bureau pursued another scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , for years before agreeing to pay $ 4.6 million to settle a lawsuit he had filed and then later exonerating him has only fueled the skepticism .
“ Do you believe Bruce Ivins was responsible for the anthrax attacks ? ” The Frederick News - Post , the hometown newspaper in Fort Detrick , asked its readers this week .
( Of those who responded , 34 percent said no , compared with 26 percent who said yes . )
In its case against Dr. Ivins , the F.B.I. developed a compelling profile of an erratic , mentally troubled man who could be threatening and obsessive , as in his odd fascination with a sorority from his college days .
But investigators were never able to place him at the New Jersey mailboxes where the anthrax letters were dropped , and the case against him relied at its heart on the scientific evidence linking the anthrax in Dr. Ivins ’s laboratory to the spores used in the attacks .
It took the F.B.I. several years to develop the type of DNA testing that allowed them to trace the origins of the “ attack strain , ” as it was called , and they concluded that the anthrax that Dr. Ivins controlled was the only one of more than 1,000 samples they tested that matched it in all four of that strain ’s genetic mutations .
Dwight Adams , a former director of the F.B.I. laboratory who was deeply involved in managing the anthrax genetic research until he left the bureau in 2006 , said he was confident that the groundbreaking forensic effort would be validated by the broad scientific community .
I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will ; unless it were that hide - bound pedant , Lanyon , at what he called my scientific heresies .
" Of course the man 's a pedant .
He has no real feeling for beauty .
He was a pedant , to the most extreme point , the greatest pedant I had met on earth , and with that had a vanity only befitting Alexander of Macedon .
This is that Lavalle whom the world , immersed in speculations of immediate gain , did not know nor suspect -- the Lavalle whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a theorist .
I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italian -- of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow -- of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king -- who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison , not daring to kill them , as our great cardinal -- our cardinal did -- of the miser , who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear , though he is rich , of losing them at play next morning -- of the impudent fellow who insults the queen , as they say -- so much the worse for her -- and who is going in three months to make war upon us , in order that he may retain his pensions ; is that the master whom you propose to me ?
As to the clerks , he pronounced them mere pretenders , not one of whom had ever been among the Indians , nor farther to the northwest than Montreal , nor of higher rank than barkeeper of a tavern or marker of a billiard - table , excepting one , who had been a school - master , and whom he emphatically sets down for " as foolish a pedant as ever lived . "
His tones were no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract and the unknowable ; but those of the man of action -- determined , but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from Clayton 's heart .
But the idea of this dried - up pedant , this elaborator of small explanations about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor 's back chamber , having first got this adorable young creature to marry him , and then passing his honeymoon away from her , groping after his mouldy futilities ( Will was given to hyperbole ) -- this sudden picture stirred him with a sort of comic disgust : he was divided between the impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective .
my dear fellow , " exclaimed La Fontaine , " you are a shocking pedant ! "
Her successor and distant cousin , James of Scotland ( James I of England ) , was a bigoted pedant , and under his rule the perennial Court corruption , striking in , became foul and noisome .
So necessary is this to the understanding the characters of men , that none are more ignorant of them than those learned pedants whose lives have been entirely consumed in colleges , and among books ; for however exquisitely human nature may have been described by writers , the true practical system can be learnt only in the world .
More than a million South Koreans have visited the Mount Kumgang resort
A South Korean woman has been shot dead by a North Korean soldier in a special tourism zone in the mountains of North Korean , officials from the North say .
The 53 - year - old is said to have strayed into a restricted area in the Mount Kumgang resort on the east coast .
A South Korean official said trips would be suspended pending an inquiry .
The resort has attracted more than one million South Korean visitors since 1998 , and correspondents say this is the first incident of its kind .
The tours are managed by South Korea 's Hyundai group .
Heavily policed
According to North Korean officials , the woman had strayed into a restricted area in the early hours of Friday morning , failed to heed a warning , and was shot dead .
Her body has been returned to South Korea , where it is undergoing forensic examination .
South Korea 's Unification Minister , Kim Ho-nyeon , who handles cross - border relations , said the woman had been shot after entering a fenced - off military area .
He said a major investigation was under way .
The Mount Kumgang resort offers South Koreans hotels , stores , a golf course and a spa - but it is also situated in a strategic naval zone .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says access to the special tourism zone is tightly controlled , and its border heavily policed .
Our correspondent says the resort - one of two North Korean tourist programmes - is one of the most visible symbols of the efforts by the two Koreas to engage in closer economic co-operation over the past decade .
The ventures have earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars in badly needed foreign currency .
The killing has overshadowed an earlier announcement by the South Korean President , Lee Myung - bak , that he wanted to re-open the stalled dialogue with North Korea .
In a shift from his previously tough stance , Mr Lee also offered to resume food aid to the North .
The Predator State : A Summary
James K. Galbraith ’s The Predator State is undoubtedly one of the most important books on the economics of our era .
Galbraith sets himself the task , not only of exposing the discredited economic orthodoxies of our generation , but also documenting the economy as it really exists , and setting an agenda for the future .
It is a book that desperately needs to be listened to .
And , even better than all that , it ’s a fun read .
Go out and buy it immediately .
That said , here is a brief , abbreviated summary of the book , to better pull out its themes and spread its message .
It is of necessity less clear and less well - argued than the book itself , which you should actually read if you want to argue , but it should give the gist of things .
1 : The Reaganites swept into power on the arguments of economic conservatives : lower taxes , tight money , and an assault on all opponents of market forces ( government , regulation , unions ) .
Their views were tried and failed completely .
They have no remaining defenders in academia and only slogans and cronies outside of it .
There is no longer any vision on the right ; the left should leave its defensive crouch and start proposing something new .
2 : Friedman and friends said that markets would lead to democracy — that “ economic freedom ” begets political freedom .
But economic freedom is n’t what it sounds like ; it ’s not freedom from economic want but instead , as Friedman put it , “ the freedom to choose ” or , in other words , “ the freedom to shop ” .
But control over production is as unfree as in the Soviet Union , with advertising for propaganda , R&D for planning , and Wall Street analysts for government inspectors .
“ Lines form , under capitalism , every day . ”
3 : Supply - siders argued that a ) saving is a public good because it leads to investment , b) America does not save enough compared to other countries , c ) saving would be unleashed by lowering taxes on it , d ) the resulting investment would spur an economic boom .
Every piece of this is wrong : a ) in an efficient market , all the benefits from investment are captured by the investor ; thus investment cannot be a public good unless markets are inefficient , in which case the government should step in more , b ) the correct amount of saving is a policy decision , there ’s no reason to believe other countries have it right ( the Soviet Union had a 40 % level of saving right up to its collapse ) , c ) rich people save most of their money anyway ( it ’s impossible to consume that much ) and changes in interest rates dwarf changes in tax rates ; furthermore , real investment is encouraged by high personal taxes , since this forces people to keep their money in corporations , d ) personal saving is less than 1 % of GDP ; almost all investment comes from corporations or overseas .
4 : Milton Friedman claimed that high inflation ( it was 10 % in the 1970s ) was just the result of printing too much money .
Reagan ’s
Fed adopted this belief , sending the US and many foreign countries into deep recession .
Eventually , the policy was completely abandoned and high inflation has not been seen since .
Serious inflation is n’t caused by printing money , but by wage - price spirals — the price of oil shot up , causing rising prices to cover oil costs , causing workers to demand higher wages to pay those prices , causing prices to rise even higher , and so on .
Today , most prices are set by overseas manufacturers and labor unions are so weak that workers can’t demand wage increases .
Inflation is dead .
5 : Democrats ( and some Republicans ) repeatedly insist that we need to balance the budget or face fiscal collapse .
But the budget is ruled by a simple equation : the total amount the government owes + the total amount the public owes = the total amount we owe to foreign countries .
This is simple logic : whatever is not owed within the country must be owed to another country .
But the international economy depends on other countries keeping large reserves of dollars ( see 14 ) , meaning our trade deficit must be high .
As long as this is so , we must either have the government run large deficits or ask people to do so .
The budget deficit was closed in the late 1990s because citizens picked up the slack with high credit card spending and home equity loans , inevitably leading to a slump .
Balancing the budget is for suckers ;
Democrats should spend the money on public goods instead , promoting economic growth and thus raising tax revenue .
6 : The argument for free trade comes from Ricardo ’s “ comparative advantage ” — a clever textbook exercise , but irrelevant to the real world since it assumes constant costs .
In reality , either you produce manufactured goods , in which your costs go down as you make more , or you sell off commodities , in which case your costs go up as you make more .
With the former , it takes time for local industry to build up the advantage ( requiring protectionism ) .
With the latter , you end up like Mongolia , which opened up its animal husbandry market , swelling herd sizes , turning grass into permanent desert , and killing off the entire market .
With no other exports , such a country is in big trouble .
Ricardo was wrong : diversification , not specialization , is the way to develop — and how every successful country has .
Unfortunately , we ’ve forced this broken system on most of the world .
( China has escaped , letting state - supported banks fund money - losing new companies until they grow large enough to succeed as exporters .
In the mean time , they dump their products on local Chinese , allowing them to have a very high standard of living at very low wages . )
7 : There is no trade - off between equality and efficiency .
Instead , equality leads to efficiency .
Denmark is one of the most equal countries in Europe , and as a result one of the wealthiest .
The rest are on a continuum down to unequal and inefficient .
Full employment and high wages require companies to make the most of the employees they have , increasing efficiency .
Raising the minimum wage does n’t raise unemployment , it lowers it — unemployment and inequality have risen and fallen together since 1920 .
Higher wages lead to more jobtaking and less quitting .
The remaining increase in inequality was caused by stock market giveaways to dot- commers and Bush giveaways to government contractors — which is why it was limited to Silicon Valley and the Potomac , respectively .
8 : The US is not a free market .
Of GDP , 17 % is health care ( where experts , not consumers decide how to spend ) , 16 % is housing ( subsidized by quasi- public mortgage firms and tax deductions ) , 15 % is federal welfare , 14 % is local welfare , 4.5 % is military spending , 3 % is higher education ( paid for mostly by government or conspicuous philanthropy 1 and consumed for status and not value ) .
Together , 70 % of US GDP is planned ; it ’s just that our facade of a free market makes us less efficient at planning than other countries ( especially in health care ) .
9 : In the 1970s , American industry ( particularly steel and cars ) was being challenged and weakened by Japan .
Reagan ’s assault on inflation ( see 4 ) dealt them a death blow , sending their foreign and domestic markets into deep recession , driving up the value of the dollar ( making their exports more expensive than their competitors ’ ) , and raising interest rates .
In the 1980s the technical staff left for Silicon Valley , and 1990s financial fraud killed off what remained .
When new startup founders paid themselves exorbitant salaries from VC money other CEOs rushed to keep up , making them all wealthy enough to become a separate class .
They used their new power to prey on the corporations that they ran .
2
10 : Previously , regulation kept the predators in check — unions , NGOs , and progressive businesses pushed government standards to kill regressive competitors .
But newly - wealthy predator CEOs had the Republicans take over and gut regulation .
The result is the Predator State , where every new law is a corporate giveaway .
Prescription drug benefits for Big Pharma ; NCLB to defund and deskill schools ( building support for vouchers ) ; and Social Security reform to give workers ’ paychecks to Wall Street .
( Democrats have so far prevented the latter , but corporate - funded think tanks now aim to take them down from inside . )
The programs allow further predation ; privatizing college loans has led loan companies to bribe student loan officers .
It ’s not that Republican government fails at tasks like stopping Katrina ; it ’s that such tasks of governance are not its goal — opening up New Orleans for Halliburton contracts is .
11 : The great liberal economic agenda is “ making markets work ” — small fixes for market failures .
The canonical example is job training to fight unemployment .
But job training does not create new jobs , economic growth does ; the tech boom was the last time we saw a real decrease in unemployment .
Similarly , some Dems propose universal preschool since experiments find kids with free preschool grow up to get better - paying jobs .
But those preschools did not create jobs , they just gave their students an advantage in getting them .
Universal preschool would give everyone that advantage , leaving no net impact .
And creating markets in unmarketable goods ( health care , energy , the climate ) is doomed to failure .
In these industries markets will not work ; planning is required .
12 : Planning is alleged to have been disproven by the Soviet Union ’s fall .
But it is unavoidable .
The market , even when it does work , fails to take into account the wishes of the poor and the needs of the future , since neither can buy things today .
New Orleans fell not because of a lack of foresight ( it was predicted by the local paper ) or technology ( the Army knew how to build strong levees ) but because we lacked a plan — nobody in power bothered to do anything about it .
Similarly , climate change will melt Antarctica and drown New York , Boston , South Florida , Houston , the Bay Area , London , the Netherlands , Bangladesh , and Shanghai .
Stopping it requires a plan ; an enormous one ranging from elementary school classes to government - funded research centers to a WWII - level restructuring of the economy .
13 : Deregulation can have three effects : 1 ) increasing competition and lowering wages and prices , 2 ) speeding technological change and increasing quality , 3 ) creating monopolies and raising prices .
Trucking deregulation did 1 , airline deregulation did 1 and 2 , but telecom , banking , and energy deregulation did 3 .
Charles Keating donated to the government , leading VP George H. W. Bush ’s task force to deregulate his industry and allow the Savings and Loan Scandal .
Ken Lay was Bush ’s largest contributor , leading VP Dick Cheney ’s task force to deregulate his industry and allow the Enron energy scandal .
The solution is to lower CEO pay , raise the minimum wage , and set wage standards in between .
Some liberals claim trade is the problem and the solution is to set environmental and labor standards on other countries .
These are unenforceable and will be ineffective ( companies moving overseas already build clean factories since that ’s most efficient and no significant exports are made using child or prison labor ) .
Instead , we should set wage standards at home , like Scandinavia , forcing companies to increase productivity and pay fair wages .
Wage standards should also apply to undocumented workers ; illegal immigration is caused by employers who send recruiters to Mexico for compliant and low - paid workers .
Applying wage standards to all will end these abusive practices .
14 : Any country that can pay for its imports entirely with exports can organize its internal economy ( its people and resources ) however it likes .
Countries that do not balance their trade depend instead on global capital markets and must play by their rules .
But the US is a special case : after World War II ( 1944 ) it set up the Bretton Woods system of international exchange , pegging all currencies to the dollar and backing the dollar with gold reserves .
But during Vietnam ’s deficits ( 1971 ) , Nixon broke the system , devaluing US currency and wreaking havoc on the rest of the world .
Reagan ’s tight money policies ( 1981 ) caused so much instability that other countries were forced to build up reserves of US Treasury Bonds in exchange for military , economic , and export security .
US bubbles and the Soviet Union ’s fall make this system less secure than before , but as long as it remains the US can do whatever it likes economically .
And it might as well , since economic success will strengthen the system and the policies proposed here will lead to economic success .

Dining The Finest Dining in Louisville
From premier fine dining in the English Grill to the light and airy elegance of J. Graham ’s Café to the jaw - dropping glamour of the Lobby Bar , The Brown Hotel is home to Louisville ’s most exceptional and memorable dining experiences .
While every meal at The Brown Hotel is memorable , we ’d be remiss if we did n’t suggest at least one “ Hot Brown . ”
Indeed , it ’s a culinary requisite on any visit to Louisville .
" The Hot Brown " is a world - famous dish invented at The Brown Hotel in 1926 .

Reader John DeCarli suffers with the hell that is satellite broadband access .
He writes :
I have access to the Internet via Hughes Satellite .
One of the drawbacks is a limit to how much data I can download in a 24 - hour period .
The limit with my service is 375MB and , if exceeded , my access speed is severely reduced for 24 - hours .
Downloads from Apple generally cause a problem .
Like the recent iPod touch and iTunes update .
It took four days to completely finish the upgrade .
That was due to exceeding the download limit .
Between 3 AM and 6 AM there is no limit to the download data .
What download manager will work with the Apple software updates ?
John , as someone who lived with satellite broadband for nearly three years , I am more sympathetic to your plight than you can imagine .
While satellite broadband is better than nothing , a well - placed stick - in - the - eye is better than satellite broadband .
The cheap way to go is to check Software Update during the day to see what it holds .
If you find something you really need , set an alarm for 3:01 AM , launch Software Update from its system preference , start the download , and go back to bed .
Because I value my sleep , I prefer an automated way .
For me , that way is Stairways Software ’s $ 36 Keyboard Maestro .
Using Keyboard Maestro
I constructed a macro that includes these steps :
Open Software Update ( It lives at System / Library / CoreServices / Software Update )
Pause for 20 Seconds ( This is to give Software Update time to update its database .
If it takes your Mac longer to update the database because of the slow connection , adjust accordingly . )
Type the Return Keystroke ( This is to click the Install button . )
Pause for 5 Seconds ( This is to give the Admin Password dialog box time to appear . )
Insert Text password ( Where password is your Administrator ’s password . )
Type the Return Keystroke ( To acknowledge that password . )
Create the macro so it ’s triggered at 3:01 AM every day and you should be good to go .
Before committing to it and then wondering why it does n’t work , try a couple of dry runs during the day .
You may encounter a problem , for example , when Software Update tosses up a dialog box that demands that you click a Restart button in order to begin the process .
Because you wo n’t actually begin the download until you ’ve run through every step , you can conduct the dry run without worrying about exceeding your bandwidth .
Commenters : I tried to come up with a way to do this via Automator because I prefer a free solution to one that costs $ 36 , but I was stumped when it was time to enter a password .
If you have The Way ( or , at least , Another Way ) I ’m all ears .
45 Ways for Entrepreneurs to Save Money in Recession
While every entrepreneur likes to focus on making money , it is just as important to make sure you are keeping your costs as low as possible .
There are many excellent free or low cost services or products which can knock thousands of dollars off the cost of running an online business .
Here is a list of some of the ones I recommend you consider , together with my own personal cost - saving tips :
Communication
Skype - great for communicating with colleagues and partners .
While Skype - to - Skype calls are free and Skype - to - phone calls are inexpensive , I do n’t think the quality is good enough yet for using Skype for all customer communications
Jajah - allows you to make cheap landline calls .
Calls are up to 98 % cheaper than telco charges
Truphone - enables cheap mobile calls between friends
Sim4 Travel - if you travel a lot and want to use your mobile phone while overseas .
Receiving calls while travelling is free and making calls is cheaper than with normal mobile roaming rates
DimDim - recommended for web conference calls , where you can share your desktop , slides and videos .
Free for up to 20 people
Google Sites - use for file sharing and collaboration .
A free instant intranet
Google Calendar - the best application for noting and sharing appointments with your team .
Free
Productivity
OpenOffice - a free alternative to Microsoft Office , which will probably still meet all of your needs
GoogleDrive - another free alternative to MS Office .
Cloud based and allows multiple people to edit at once .
WIll probably meet the majority of your needs too
FreeMind - an excellent mind mapping tool , for capturing all of your thoughts on a subject or issue within one page .
Free
AVG Free - as the name suggests , a free anti-virus solution .
It is as good as most commercial products
Carbonite - outstanding for data backups .
It costs $ 49 a year for unlimited data .
A small price to page for peace of mind
KeePass Password Safe - ideal for managing your passwords .
Free
CutePDF - use to create PDF documents , rather than spend hundreds of dollars on Adobe software .
Free
Freshbooks - a cost effective service for invoicing clients
Photoshop Express - if you are a light user of photo editing software use the free online Photoshop solution .
It has all the most used features in an easy to use interface
PayPal - if you need to take payments online PayPal is now the most cost effective solution and much easier to get approval during tough times , when the banks are closing their doors to new merchants .
Audacity - great for free audio editing
Jumpcut - very handy for free online video editing
If you do need to buy software , have a look if the manufacturer offers discounts for students , teachers , or educational establishments .
The savings can be huge .
However , be aware that this discounted versions cannot be used for commercial purposes
Always search for a voucher code .
Most online services offer discounts .
Very often you can search on Google to find a current discount code .
For example , search for a “ GoDaddy promotion code ” or Godaddy discount code ” and you will immediately find codes that will give you up to 25 % off domain name registration
Website Specific
Wordpress - a free and powerful blogging solution
SubHub - an advanced , hassle - free membership site solution
Google Alerts - a free way of monitoring what people are saying about you , your company and your competitors on the internet
Google Analytics - an excellent free webs stats package , which will enable you to track all of the visitor activity on your website
FileZilla - a free FTP solution which enables you to easily manage the files on your web server
iStockPhoto and Fotolia - micro-stock photo sites that are great for sourcing images
Marketing
Rather than using tools , I suggest you focus on building organic traffic through writing and publishing regular , good quality articles .
This will avoid you having to spend money on Adwords and other expensive online marketing .
Additionally , if you have n’t started a blog , it could be the right time to do it .
A good blog can build traffic , which can be directed to your main online business .
Managing Your Customers
SugarCRM - very useful for managing your customer information .
For a more simple paid solution try Kayako
Hardware
Buy hardware that is one generation behind the curve .
The improvements in each new release are getting smaller and the out - of - date models are always heavily discounted .
In most instances you ’ll never notice the difference .
Upgrade your old PC rather than buy a new one .
By simply buying a new processor and a bit of extra memory an old PC can spring back into life .
Consider one of the new low - cost Netbook laptops which are selling for £ 300 /$ 499 .
They are capable machines that are ideal for working and surfing on the road .
Buy multifunction devices where possible .
There is little point in shelling out for separate printer , scanner and copier when a single machine like the excellent Canon Pixma IP610 will take care of all these tasks .
Keep your old monitor .
Screen technology is changing slowly so you ’ll probably see little improvement from upgrading your monitor .
Sell old kit immediately .
If you have old hardware , sell it on eBay as soon as you stop using it .
Hardware values depreciate very quickly .
Outsourcing
Many simple tasks can be outsourced .
If you have simple repetitive tasks that need to be regularly undertaken , such as data entry or outbound calls , consider outsourcing them via websites such as eLance and oDesk .
Be wary of outsourcing big and complex software development projects .
Most go horribly wrong !
Other Cost Cutting Techniques
When any contract is coming to an end – mobile phone , broadband , insurance , etc – phone the supplier and threaten to cancel .
Many companies have special offers to retain existing customers .
Turn off devices on standby .
According to research , 10 % of all energy consumed in the home and offices is from devices on standby .
Save paper and ink by printing on both sides of a sheet of paper in draft mode .
Most modern printers have a duplex option which will automatically print on both sides of a sheet of paper .
Haggle on all major purchases .
It goes without saying that you should negotiate on all major purchases you make .
There are a lot of discounts and reductions to be had in a recession .
Offer customers longer contracts for a discount .
Lock in your revenue streams for as long as possible .
Identify which countries are still prospering and target your sales at them .
At the moment all oil producing countries are worth looking at .
Avoid cutting your prices ; instead give away more value e.g. online businesses giveaway a free downloadable eBook to all customers .
It costs you nothing , but can provide customers with significant value ( if the book is good ! ) .
Focus on keeping your existing customers happy .
It is much easier and cheaper to look after existing paying customers than continually having to find new ones .
Conclusion
SUV factories closing , bicycle sales and train use rocketing , commuter belts becoming " ghostburbs " as residents flock to the inner cities . . . welcome to 2008 America , where soaring oil and petrol prices have triggered a sudden revolution in travel behaviour and a seismic upheaval in the automobile industry .
Four dollars ( £2 ) for a gallon of petrol may seem like peanuts on this side of the pond , but in the shellshocked US , where pump prices have doubled since 2004 , it is proving to be the breaking point for millions of recession - hit households .
In March 2008 , according to the US department of transportation , Americans drove 11bn fewer miles than in March 2007 - a 4.3 % drop , and the first downward trend in 30 years .
As environmentalists quietly applaud from the sidelines , consumers are either abandoning their beloved SUVs for smaller , more fuel - efficient vehicles or turning in droves to alternative forms of transport .
From Denver to Dallas , from Seattle to Salt Lake City , bus and train use is up by 10 % - 15 % on 2007 .
In cities that have invested in new light rail services , passenger growth is phenomenal - up 35 % in Charlotte , North Carolina , and 28 % on a commuter rail link between Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in Florida .
Traditionally , the poor , under - resourced relation in the US travel system , public transport is suddenly riding high .
" In almost every transit system . . . we 're seeing very high rates of growth the last few months , " reports William Millar , president of the American Public Transportation Association .
Sales of bicycles and of fuel - efficient motor scooters are also soaring .
The latter up by 24 % between spring 2007 and 2008 .
But perhaps the most significant behaviour shift is in consumers ' choice of vehicles .
After two decades as the American car of choice , the sports utility vehicle has been knocked dramatically from its perch .
Sales of these gas - guzzlers , which do 12 - 15 miles per gallon , have been falling steadily for two years as petrol prices have risen .
In spring 2008 , they reached a new low , plummeting 35 % on the previous year and triggering a seminal shift by the " big three " carmakers in the US .
In May , the chief executive of Ford , Alan Mulally , announced that the company was cutting overall production by 15 % and would make fewer SUVs and more hybrids and compact vehicles , such as the Focus , Fusion and Edge .
In June , the General Motors ' chief executive , Rick Wagoner , announced the closure , between 2008 and 2010 , of four SUV and small truck plants and a review of the Hummer - a consumer version of an army tank , reviled by environmentalists .
In equally good news for the green lobby , Wagoner announced that production of a plug - in electric vehicle , the Chevrolet Volt , will begin in 2011 , with the company aiming to sell 100,000 a year .
Hybrid cars
Mulally and Wagoner both declared that the shift in consumer preferences to smaller , more efficient cars was " structural , not cyclical " .
And Ford , GM and Chrysler are now openly engaged in a race to produce the best range of fuel - efficient vehicles .
All are designing a variety of hybrid cars , SUVs and light trucks , as well as plug - in electric vehicles and models equipped with advanced petrol and diesel engines .
GM , for example , is developing a method of applying the compression - ignition efficiency of diesel engineering to petrol engines , which will improve their fuel efficiency by 15 % .
Once these vehicles reach the mass market , the impact on US carbon emissions will be significant .
In 2007 , most new vehicles sold in the US achieved a mere 15 m pg - 25 mpg , and only 2.2 % were hybrids ( mostly the Toyota Prius ) , according to Michael Renner , of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington .
But by 2015 , hybrids alone are expected to make up one in 10 vehicles on American roads .
While the impact of high oil prices on US consumers is reflected most dramatically in travel and car - buying habits , it is also having a knock - on effect in other areas of life .
With pump prices rising almost weekly , polls report that Americans are resigned to living with high fuel costs for the indefinite future .
This , combined with the depressed US housing market , is making households rethink another cherished American institution - the white picket - fenced suburban dream home .
For many Americans commuting two or more hours a day to jobs in the city , petrol costs are now matching or outweighing the savings they made by buying a home in the suburbs - prompting a trend back to city centres well served by public transport .
As a result , house prices in commuter belts such as southern California have dropped steeply , prompting the media to coin the term " ghostburbs " , but are holding up well in inner suburbs and city neighbourhoods .
There has even been a mini-boom reported in housing developments around train stations .
" The housing crisis and the energy crisis are yielding a re-urbanisation , " housing consultant Todd Zimmerman recently told ABC News .
High oil and gas prices are also having a big impact on the presidential election campaign , now in full swing .
Energy policy has moved to centre stage - alongside the Iraq war and the economic recession - to reflect voter concerns .
Barack Obama and John McCain are battling for the hearts and minds of voters increasingly concerned about the short - term impact of petrol prices on their wallets and the long - term impact of climate change on their children 's futures .
Both candidates represent a vast improvement over George Bush , in that they have pledged urgently to implement a federal greenhouse gas cap and trade legislation , and to re-engage effectively in international climate talks .
But in recent weeks , the Republican candidate , McCain , has turned rightward on energy policy , calling for a summer suspension of the federal petrol tax and committing to lifting the decades - old ban on states exploring for oil in US coastal waters .
In a Washington Post / ABC poll published on June 17 , half those surveyed described high petrol prices as a " serious burden " .
And environmentalists have accused McCain of playing short - term , vote - getting politics with the future of the planet .
" Some voters will be looking for short - term gas price relief ahead of sensible , long - term policies on global warming , and McCain is clearly making the bet that they will vote for him , " says David Sandretti , communications director at the League of Conservation Voters .
" But I do n't think it will work .
There 's a good deal of evidence that people see the gas tax holiday as a gimmick , and that they are looking for real , long - term solutions to the energy and climate crisis . "
Climate negotiations
Eileen Claussen , president of the influential Pew Centre on Global Climate Change , and a climate change negotiator during the Clinton administration , says that either candidate would boost international climate negotiations as president because both would work with Congress to pass a cap and trade bill .
" Getting the 60 Senate votes required during a recession will be very challenging and will require leadership from the White House , " she says , adding that such legislation is needed to show the rest of the world , especially China , that the US is prepared to address its own greenhouse gas emissions .
Getting congressional approval for a post - Kyoto climate treaty would be even trickier , requiring 67 senate votes .
But , says Claussen , " with presidential leadership and a good treaty , that would be possible .
The differences on global warming between the two candidates will play out on the campaign trail .
But the key point is that they both understand the issue , and understand that we absolutely have to deal with it . "
California regulators adopted the world ’s toughest pollution rules for oceangoing vessels Thursday , vowing to improve the health of coastal residents and opening a new front in a long battle with the international shipping industry .
The rules , which take effect in 2009 , would require ships within 24 nautical miles of California to burn low - sulfur diesel instead of the tar - like sludge known as bunker fuel .
About 2,000 vessels would be affected , including container ships , oil tankers and cruise ships .
International negotiators have struggled for decades to reduce pollution from oceangoing vessels but have been stymied by opposition from shipping conglomerates .
Federal legislation to control vessel emissions in U.S. ports , sponsored by Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein , both California Democrats , has been opposed by the Bush administration , which favors deferring to future international regulations .

California ’s new regulation will have a global effect : 43 % of all marine freight imported into the United States , much of it from Asia , moves through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach .
California “ needs to act now , ” Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said .
“ We ’ve known for years that a large percentage of onshore pollution comes from activities in the water .
Our ports need to expand and modernize , but the adjacent communities are not willing to tolerate the health risks . ”
The rules could save 3,600 lives in coastal communities over the first six years through reduced respiratory illnesses and heart disease , including a potential 80 % drop in cancer risk associated with ship pollutants , according to regulators .
Nichols called the shipping regulation “ the single most significant rule the Air Resources Board has adopted in the last five years . ”

Because prevailing winds blow from west to east in California , ship exhaust accounts for about a fifth of cancer - causing soot particles and half of the sulfur oxides over land .
The remainder is emitted by diesel - powered trucks , construction equipment , locomotives , industrial engines and agricultural pumps , which are all to be subject to stricter regulation as the state seeks to slash the emission of planet - warming greenhouse gases and other pollutants .
The air board estimates that the new shipping rules will save Californians at least $ 6 billion a year in health - related expenses and will cost the shipping industry between $ 140 million and $ 360 million a year .
A typical cargo ship would pay about $ 30,000 more in fuel costs for each visit , or about $ 6 per container shipped from Asia to California .
That amounts to 0.1 cent per pair of sneakers , the board noted .

Environmentalists and community groups praised the rules .
“ This is a huge victory for clean air and public health , ” said Candice Kim of the Coalition for Clean Air .
“ Ten Californians die every day due to air pollution from ports and freight transportation . ”
Shippers fiercely oppose the limits , saying that California lacks jurisdiction to regulate beyond the 3 - mile limit of state waters , and that low - sulfur fuel is in short supply , particularly in Asian ports .
The San-Francisco based Pacific Merchant Shipping Assn. last year won a court victory halting the state ’s previous effort to control shipping pollution by regulating engine emissions .
The air board believes that a fuel regulation will stand up to a court challenge , but John McLaurin , the shipping association ’s president , wrote the board this week that the regulation “ simply rehashes and represents old arguments that have already failed to pass judicial muster . ”

The rules would “ govern the internal operation of foreign vessels . . . require the ships to purchase the required fuel in foreign ports , and , in many cases , to retrofit their tanks , piping and engines , ” McLaurin wrote .
It was unclear Thursday whether the shipping industry would challenge the regulations in court .
California ’s rule would be implemented in two phases .
Beginning July 1 , 2009 , shippers would be required to use diesel oil with a sulfur limit of 0.5 % .
On Jan. 1 , 2012 , that would be reduced to 0.1 % sulfur , a level that would cut soot by 83 % , sulfur oxides by 95 % and nitrogen oxides by 6 % .
By contrast , the United Nations ’ International Maritime Organization allows fuel that is 4.5 % sulfur .
IMO negotiators will meet in October and are expected to consider new limits , but those would not take effect until 2015 or later .

Shippers asked that the California board defer any action until international rules take effect .
In a compromise , the board voted Thursday to allow its executive director to suspend California ’s regulation “ if and when the IMO or the federal government adopts a rule as effective as California ’s , ” Nichols said .
Meanwhile , fines for noncompliance would be stiff .
Vessels using fuel over the sulfur limit would pay a fee beginning at $ 45,500 for each visit , with a maximum of $ 227,500 on the fifth visit .
“ In theory , a vessel that makes 10 calls to California would be subject to paying $ 1,365,000 the first year , and $ 2,275,000 each subsequent year , ” the shipping association protested .
Board officials said that international law allows California to regulate ship emissions as long as they affect its residents .
The board ’s scientists studied pollution effects out to the 3 - mile limit , the 12 - mile limit and the 24 - mile limit , and found that “ emissions from 24 miles out directly impact the majority of our population , ” Nichols said .

Representatives of the Navy have expressed concern that vessels would be more likely to travel through their offshore testing and training range once the rule is implemented .
But Air Resources
Board staff pledged to work with Navy officials to address their concerns .

Way back in April , John Scalzi wrote on his blog :
Arrangements have been made .
Wheels set into motion .
At this point , it is inevitable .
Unavoidable .
Implacable would not be too strong a word .
What has begun ?
I can not tell you .
Suffice to say it is evil .
And yet awesome , in its way .
And it will be visited upon one of you .
Cryptic , but amusing .
I know John well enough to know that he 's a devilish schemer with a wicked sense of humor .
What , I wondered , was he up to , and who , I pondered , was the unsuspecting victim ?
Months passed , and then - on my birthday , no less - he wrote :
Finally .
It is done .
And it will be visited upon one of you .
Soon .
Yes , soon .
You should prepare yourself .
Although nothing can truly prepare you .
Because it is evil .
Yet awesome .
And it is coming .
It can be held back no longer .
And when it arrives , you will know .
And you will tremble before it .
BWA HA HA HA HA HAH HA !
I had no idea , in April or in July , that I was the intended recipient victim of John 's evil , yet awesome scheme .
But more on that in a moment , because some context is in order before we get to the punchline .
I had big plans to road trip up to Vegas with two of my friends and visit Star Trek the Experience one last time before they sent it to the land of wind and ghosts .
Unfortunately , gravity and physics had other plans , and I 'm not doing much of anything until PAX .
If you 've spent any time reading my blog , or if you 've read my first two books , you know that The Experience is very special to me , delivering some important perspective when I needed it most :
Until this moment , all I have been able to remember is the pain that came with Star Trek .
I 'd forgotten the joy .
Star Trek was about sitting next to Brent Spiner , who always made me laugh .
It was n't about the people who made me cry when they booed me offstage at conventions .
It was about the awe I felt listening to Patrick Stewart debate the subtle nuances of The Prime Directive with Gene Roddenberry between scenes .
It was n't about the writers who could n't figure out how to write a believable teenage character .
It was about the wonder of walking down those corridors , and pretending that I was on a real spaceship .
It was about the pride I felt when I got to wear my first real uniform , go on my first away mission , fire my first phaser , play poker with the other officers in Riker 's quarters .
Oh my god .
Star Trek was wonderful , and I 'd forgotten .
I have wasted ten years trying to escape something that I love , for all the wrong reasons .
I was looking forward to this road trip , because love Star Trek , and I love science fiction , but when I hurt myself , my motivation to play through the pain evaporated .
See , I 've been feeling some Star Trek fatigue recently .
There are a lot of factors , including being dooced from the Vegas con and the return of the alt.wesley.die.die.die morons , but the bottom line is : I feel like all the stuff I did n't like about Trek has started to overwhelm the things I love about it .
I have n't written a TNG review for TV Squad in months , because it has n't been as fun to revisit those first season days as it once was .
The thing is . . . maybe I 'm taking the whole thing a little too seriously .
I mean , honestly , why in the world should I give a shit about some random Internet guy who is obviously stuck in 1990 ?
Sure , it 's upsetting that I was the only series regular to be excluded from the biggest Star Trek convention of the year , but it 's not like I do n't have other things to do with my time , and other conventions to attend .
A tangible reminder to not take this stuff too seriously arrived at my doorstep recently .
It was , as promised , evil and awesome :
( More images at Flickr )
For those of you who are scratching your heads right now , that is , in fact , an authentic black velvet Wesley Crusher painting .
It was sent anonymously , and all of my friends ( truthfully , it turns out ) said they had nothing to do with it ( I guess I should have asked John 's co-conspirator , our mutual friend Burns ! if he was involved ) so I did n't say anything publicly about it while I attempted to uncover the identity of my mysterious benefactor .
This morning , I sent John an e-mail with some of the awesome comments on yesterday 's post about Zoe 's Tale .
In the ensuing conversation , he outed himself as the evil genius behind this particular artistic scheme .
For the last few months , I 've been focused on the pain that came with Star Trek .
I 'd forgotten the joy .
Star
Trek is n't about petty grudges or anonymous insults from emotionally stunted people who are stuck in 1990 .
It is something I did twenty years ago , that inspired a generation of kids to pursue science and engineering .
Star
Trek is a fantastically entertaining show , even when it 's really , really awful , and I can feel proud of being part of it , without letting it define the beginning and end of my creative life .
Without knowing that I needed a reminder not to take this stuff so seriously , without knowing - in April , when the wheels were set into motion - that around the beginning of August I 'd be feeling pretty lousy about getting cut from the show I look forward to attending every year , John did what good friends do : pick you up when you 're down , and provide reality checks when you need them the most .
Star
Trek is something that I should n't take as seriously as I 've taken it lately .
I 'd given idiots way too much control over how I felt about it , and how I felt about that part of my life where Star Trek and me intersect .
I 'd lost perspective , and it took a velvet Wesley Crusher to bring it back .
It hangs behind me in my office now , evil and awesome , a reminder to remember the joy , and not take things so damn seriously .

I left my 9 - year - old at Bloomingdale 's ( the original one ) a couple weeks ago .
Last seen , he was in first floor handbags as I sashayed out the door .
Bye - bye !
Have fun !
And he did .
He came home on the subway and bus by himself .
Was I worried ?
Yes , a tinge .
But it did n't strike me as that daring , either .
Is n't New York as safe now as it was in 1963 ?
It 's not like we 're living in downtown Baghdad .
Anyway , for weeks my boy had been begging for me to please leave him somewhere , anywhere , and let him try to figure out how to get home on his own .
So on that sunny Sunday I gave him a subway map , a MetroCard , a $ 20 bill , and several quarters , just in case he had to make a call .
No , I did not give him a cell phone .
Did n't want to lose it .
And no , I did n't trail him , like a mommy private eye .
I trusted him to figure out that he should take the Lexington Avenue subway down , and the 34th Street crosstown bus home .
If he could n't do that , I trusted him to ask a stranger .
And then I even trusted that stranger not to think , " Gee , I was about to catch my train home , but now I think I 'll abduct this adorable child instead . "
Long story short :
My son got home , ecstatic with independence .
Long story longer , and analyzed , to boot :
Half the people I 've told this episode to now want to turn me in for child abuse .
As if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids .
It 's not .
It 's debilitating  for us and for them .
And yet 
" How would you have felt if he did n't come home ? " a New Jersey mom of four , Vicki Garfinkle , asked .
Guess what , Ms. Garfinkle : I 'd have been devastated .
But would that just prove that no mom should ever let her child ride the subway alone ?
No .
It would just be one more awful but extremely rare example of random violence , the kind that hyper parents cite as proof that every day in every way our children are more and more vulnerable .
" Carlie Brucia  I do n't know if you 're familiar with that case or not , but she was in Florida and she did a cut - through about a mile from her house and midday , at 11 in the morning , she was abducted by a guy who violated her several times , killed her , and left her behind a church . "
That 's the story that the head of safetynet4 kids.com , Katharine Francis , immediately told me when I asked her what she thought of my son getting around on his own .
She runs a company that makes wallet - sized copies of a child 's photo and fingerprints , just in case .
Well of course I know the story of Carlie Brucia .
That 's the problem .
We all know that story  and the one about the Mormon girl in Utah and the one about the little girl in Spain  and because we do , we all run those tapes in our heads when we think of leaving our kids on their own .
We even run a tape of how we 'd look on Larry King .
" I do not want to be the one on TV explaining my daughter 's disappearance , " a father , Garth Chouteau , said when we were talking about the subway issue .
These days , when a kid dies , the world  i.e. , cable TV  blames the parents .
It 's simple as that .
And yet , Trevor Butterworth , a spokesman for the research center STATS.org , said , " The statistics show that this is an incredibly rare event , and you can't protect people from very rare events .
It would be like trying to create a shield against being struck by lightning . "
Justice Department data actually show the number of children abducted by strangers has been going down over the years .
So why not let your kids get home from school by themselves ?
" Parents are in the grip of anxiety and when you 're anxious , you 're totally warped , " the author of " A Nation of Wimps , " Hara Estroff Marano , said .
We become so bent out of shape over something as simple as letting your children out of sight on the playground that it starts seeming on par with letting them play on the railroad tracks at night .
In the rain .
In dark non-reflective coats .
The problem with this everything - is - dangerous outlook is that over - protectiveness is a danger in and of itself .
A child who thinks he can't do anything on his own eventually can't .
Meantime , my son wants his next trip to be from Queens .
In my day , I doubt that would have struck anyone as particularly brave .
Now it seems like hitchhiking through Yemen .
Here 's your MetroCard , kid .

Enlarge Mold can be found around some ducts in the barracks of the Wounded Transitional Unit at Fort Sill , Okla .
Some soldiers say they have been affected by air in their rooms .
WARRIOR TRANSITION UNIT WARRIOR TRANSITION UNIT LAWTON , Okla . 
Mold infests the barracks that were set up here a year ago for wounded soldiers after poor conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center triggered a systemwide overhaul , soldiers say .
Twenty soldiers , who spoke to USA TODAY early last week , said their complaints about mold and other problems went unheeded for months .
They also said they had been ordered not speak about the conditions at Fort Sill .
Officers at the Army base last week ordered that ventilation ducts in two barracks be replaced and soldiers be surveyed , anonymously if they wished , about any concerns .
Maj . Gen. Peter Vangjel , the commanding officer , said it was " inappropriate " for soldiers to be ordered not to talk about the mold .
" We 're going in and we 're going to take care of this for these guys , " he said over the weekend .
Images of mold growing on walls of wounded - soldier bedrooms at Walter Reed last year , along with issues of bureaucratic delays in health care , led to an overhaul of the Army 's wounded - care system .
Warrior Transition Units ( WTU ) were created to expedite the care and treatment of wounded and ailing soldiers .
Army commanders testified before Congress on July 22 that the population of wounded and ailing soldiers in the units had doubled from 6,000 to 12,000 since the program 's inception in June 2007 , straining resources at several installations .
Col. Robert Bridgford , garrison commander at Fort Sill , said he ordered workers last week to replace ventilation ducts encrusted with mold in two 48 - room wounded - soldier barracks at the base .
About 70 of the 142 patients who are part of the unit for wounded and ailing troops at Fort Sill live in the barracks , said Col.
Ellen Forster , who oversees the WTU program .
The soldiers are temporarily relocated during the repair work .
LEADERS : Army defends oversight of soldier care unit Early last week , soldiers told USA TODAY that in April they first noticed what looked like layers of mold in flexible air ducts above their rooms when ventilation covers were removed to be cleaned .
" ( The duct work ) was just caked black , " said Sgt. Willard Barnett , 51 , an Iraq war veteran .
Some soldiers said they have been affected by air in their rooms .
" When I wake up in the morning , I have crud in my eyes , and I have like this slimy phlegm in the back of my throat , " said Spc. James Dodson , 26 .
Vangjel and Forster said they were unaware of any complaints in April .
Bridgford said that Aug. 8 lab tests , taken in response to a July 25 inspector general 's review , show the barracks have " common mold " that is not hazardous .
He also said some vents were cleaned earlier this year .
Forster , a nurse who commands the Fort Sill hospital , told WTU soldiers Friday that the barracks are safe .

Prince Charles has his own organic farm at his Gloucestershire estate Companies developing genetically modified crops risk creating the biggest environmental disaster " of all time " , Prince Charles has warned .
GM crops were damaging Earth 's soil and were an experiment " gone seriously wrong " , he told the Daily Telegraph .
A future reliance on corporations to mass - produce food would drive millions of farmers off their land , he said .
The government said it welcomed all voices in the " important " debate over the future potential role of GM crops .
However , Dr Julian Little , chairman of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council , said he was " disappointed " by the Prince 's comments because " they do not seem to be based on any solid evidence " .
" Our experience from over 10 years of GM cultivation shows that GM technology has been found to deliver real environmental and economic benefits , " he said .
Mr Little added : " At a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges , we need to find ways to feed an ever - increasing global population . "

More from Today programme BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Prince 's " robust " comments were " likely to rankle with the government " , which has given the go - ahead to a number of GM crop trials in the UK since 2000 .
" Even for a prince who 's a long - established champion of organic farming and critic of GM crops , these are comments which verge on the extreme , " our correspondent said .
Prince Charles told the newspaper that huge multi-national corporations involved in developing GM foods were conducting a " gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong " .
Relying on " gigantic corporations " for food would end in " absolute disaster " , he warned .
" That would be the absolute destruction of everything ... and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future . "
What should be being debated was " food security not food production " , he said .
He said GM developers might think they would be successful by having " one form of clever genetic engineering after another " , but he believed " that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time " .
If they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land
Prince Charles
Send us your comments Prince Charles , who has an organic farm on his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire , said relying on big corporations for the mass production of food would not only threaten future food supplies but also force smaller producers out of business .
" If they think this is the way to go , we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable , unmanageable , degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness , " he said .
The prince also told the Telegraph he hoped to see more family - run co-operative farms , with producers working with nature and not against it .
The Prince 's comments come at a time of rising world food prices and food shortages .
The biotech industry says that GM technology can help combat world hunger and poverty by delivering higher yields from crops and also reduce the use of pesticides .
' Untenable '
In June , Environment Minister Phil Woolas said the government was ready to argue for a greater role for the technology .
But green groups and aid agencies have doubts about GM technology 's effectiveness in tackling world hunger and have concerns about the long - term environmental impact .
Responding to the prince 's comments , a spokeswoman for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said : " Safety will always be our top priority on this issue . "
Anti-monarchy Campaign group Republic said : " Prince Charles is quickly making his position as heir to the throne untenable with his meddling in politics . "

Slow growth of toenails enables long - term nicotine measurements Measuring the nicotine content in toenail clippings can help predict a woman 's heart disease risk , a US study in nurses suggests .
Analysis of toenails from more than 62,500 women showed double the level of nicotine in those with heart disease than those without the condition .
The researchers said the test may be more accurate than simply asking a person about their smoking history .
It is well established that smokers have a higher risk of heart disease .
There are existing tests for the presence of nicotine in the body , for example testing the amount of nicotine breakdown products in saliva or urine , but they only reflect recent exposure to cigarette smoke .
Men and women who smoke are around twice as likely to suffer a heart attack in their life time as those who do n't , and quitting smoking is one of the most effective ways to reduce this risk
Ellen Mason , cardiac nurse Study leader , Dr Wael Al - Delaimy said because toenails grow slowly - at a rate of around 1 cm a year - they may offer a longer - term estimate of a person 's total exposure to tobacco smoke .
And would take into account exposure to passive smoking and smoking habits such as how much smoke a person inhales with each puff .
Exposure
Over the period of the study 900 women were diagnosed with heart disease .
The women in the top fifth for toenail nicotine content were thinner , less active , heavier drinkers , and more likely to have high blood pressure or diabetes , as well as a family history of heart attack , compared to those with less nicotine in their toenails , the researchers found .
After taking other risk factors into account , they estimated that those with the top fifth levels of nicotine had almost four times the risk of heart disease than those in the bottom fifth .
The American Journal of Epidemiology study also reported the nicotine contained in toenails was a risk factor for heart disease independently of the number of cigarettes a person smoked .
Dr Al - Delaimy , a researcher at the University of California , San Diego , said : " The use of toenail nicotine is a novel way to objectively measure exposure to tobacco smoke and could become a useful test to identify high - risk individuals in the future . "
Ellen Mason , a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation ( BHF ) said the study emphasised that smokers are storing up health problems for the future .
" Men and women who smoke are around twice as likely to suffer a heart attack in their life time as those who do n't , and quitting smoking is one of the most effective ways to reduce this risk .
" People using nicotine replacement therapy should not be alarmed by this study as it is the other chemicals inhaled when smoking , such as carbon monoxide that cause the risk of heart disease , not nicotine . "

Today former vice president Al Gore challenged the nation to produce all of its own electricity from renewable energy carbon clean sources in the next 10 years .
“ We ’re borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet .
Every bit of that ’s got to change , ” Gore said .
He said the technology needed to produce renewable energy is getting cheaper , “ A few years ago , it would not have been possible to issue such a challenge .
But here ’s what ’s changed : the sharp cost reductions now beginning to take place in solar , wind , and geothermal power – coupled with the recent dramatic price increases for oil and coal – have radically changed the economics of energy . ”
Gore compared the cost of renewable energy to the price of oil , “ To those who say the costs are still too high : I ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world .
When demand for oil and coal increases , their price goes up .
When demand for solar cells increases , the price often comes down . ”
Advertisements
He continued , “ When we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day , they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs .
When we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills , we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home . ”
He talked about the warped logic of our political system , “ It is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short - term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now .
Am I the only one who finds it strange that our government so often adopts a so - called solution that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem it is supposed to address ? ”
Gore is correct in pointing out that the problem is in our political system .
You never hear of Big Solar or Big Windmill , but Big Oil is a force in Washington D.C.
Solving this energy problem is a matter of commitment and leadership , not technology .
The technology is here .
It is only a matter of whether the government will make a commitment to it , because drilling for more oil wo n’t solve the problem , but using less oil will .
As evidence , look at how much the price of oil has fallen this week because demand is dropping .
If we continue to decrease demand , the price of oil will continue to drop .
There is n’t enough oil to shift the price through increasing supply , so the answer is to come up with a cheaper alternative .
Al Gore gets it .
It ’s just too bad none of our decisionmakers do as well .

Is PetSmart to Blame for Death of Vietnam Vet ?
A 63 - year old man died from " parrot fever ; " daughter suing PetSmart .
June 30 , 2008  --
Is the country 's largest pet store chain to blame for the death of a 63 - year old father and Vietnam War veteran from Texas ?
His family thinks so .
They believe a diseased exotic bird bought at a Corpus Christi PetSmart is responsible for the death of Joe De La Garza .
And now the family is suing PetSmart for not protecting the consumer against a rare disease called psittacosis , or " parrot fever . "
Amanda De La Garza was one of 11 million Americans who own pet birds .
On Sept. 30 , 2006 , she could not resist a small $ 85 cockatiel .
" I noticed a little bird , which I later named Peachy , " says Amanda , who lived with her 63 - year - old father at the time .
Sixteen days after bringing Peachy into her home , her father died , and Amanda slipped into a coma .
" When the doctors were alerted that I had birds , I had different antibiotics and I began to respond . "
Amanda she says was shocked to learn she had contracted a bacterial infection , called psittacosis , from her pet cockatiel .
" Psittacosis is a relatively rare disease in humans , " said Dr. James Imperato at the CUNY Medical Center .
" There are only about a dozen to 25 cases reported a year . "
The death certificate for her father , Joe De La Garza , stated the cause of death as pneumonia , but Amanda suspected her bird was the real cause , and she had his body exhumed last year .
" If he died from this , I had to be sure , " she said .
An autopsy was performed and tissue samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
Amanda 's attorney , Ron Franklin , says , " what the CDC determined was that Mr. De La Garza had psittacosis .
Through genetic blood tests -- and the autopsy with those findings -- it was able to determine the primary cause of death . "
And because of these findings , the family is now suing PetSmart , where the bird was purchased .
In a written statement PetSmart says it has great sympathy for the De La Garza family 's loss but adds , " We stand behind our pets .
We believe these allegations are unfounded , and we intend to vigorously defend against them . "
PetSmart produced a contract signed by Amanda that released the company from any liability resulting from exposure to the pets she purchased .
The company says all cockatiels receive a 14 - day course of antibiotics and then a seven - day isolation period to protect people against psittacosis .
Doctors say most people recover from exposure to the disease .
" The fatality rate is very minimal in the U.S. because it can be treated very efficiently , " says Imperato .
Unfortunately , that was certainly not the case with Amanda 's father , and she describes her pain .
" I think about this every day .
My father is gone , my birds are gone , but I want the public to know about this so it does n't happen to them . "
She says she will never have a pet bird in her home again .
Psittacosis is rare , but animals carry other illnesses into our homes .
How can you protect yourself against diseases transmitted through pets ?

Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. yesterday said his one - time presidential rival Sen. Barack Obama has asked him to “ play a more prominent ” and “ deeply involved ” role in his campaign , a signal the likely Democratic nominee is looking to burnish his foreign - policy credentials that Republicans are attacking .
Mr. Biden stopped short of endorsing Mr. Obama , but predicted the Illinois senator is likely to emerge as the nominee after the last contests on Tuesday .
He also took a few swipes at presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain .
“ He has asked me to play a more prominent role – not in an administration , in the campaign – meaning would I be more available , would I travel with him occasionally , and I said once he gets the nomination , if he gets the nomination , then I ’ll do whatever he wants , ” Mr. Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , told The Washington Times yesterday in an interview .
“ I ’ll do whatever he asks me to do . ”
An Obama spokesman declined comment on “ any private conversations ” between the senators , but offered wide praise for Mr. Biden , of Delaware .
“ His expertise would of course be important to any Democratic nominee , ” said Obama spokesman Bill Burton , adding his boss has “ deep respect ” for Mr. Biden ’s service and “ deep knowledge . ”
Mr. Biden vowed to “ work my heart out ” for the party and said he made such a promise to both Mr. Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York .
He ended his own presidential bid the night of the Iowa caucus , in January , keeping to his word that he would withdraw if he was not among the top three finishers .
But given his role as an elder Democratic Party statesman and chairman of one of the Senate ’s most - prominent panels , Mr. Biden has been extremely critical of the Bush administration and has begun defending Mr. Obama in the face of increased attacks from Mr. McCain over national security and foreign policy .
Republican operatives also have delighted recently after several recent gaffes by Mr. Obama - including his misstatement of which group liberated Auschwitz and the languages spoken in Afghanistan .
This week Mr. Obama credited his uncle with being one of the American troops to liberate the concentration camps at Auschwitz , but the Red Army actually was responsible .
His campaign circulated a clarifying statement after Republicans pounced on the error , with Obama aides saying he mistakenly said Auschwitz when his uncle ’s role was liberating Buchenwald concentration camps .
He also was criticized for saying the war in Iraq is occupying the Arabic translators needed in Afghanistan .
Mr. Obama quickly realized his mistake and corrected himself - the Afghan people do not speak Arabic - but it was used to paint him as inexperienced .
Mr. Biden told The Times he talks to each of the Democratic candidates once a week on average , usually with them asking his opinion on foreign policy .
He said he informally advised Democratic nominee Sen .
John Kerry of Massachusetts on foreign policy in 2004 and will do the same in this election .
Mr. Biden yesterday weighed in on the spat between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain on whether the junior senator should visit Iraq .
Mr. Obama was last there as part of a congressional delegation in 2006 .
He told the New York Times this week he is considering a trip , but also told reporters the Republican calls for his visit to the war zone amount to “ diversions and distractions ” to avoid a substantive discussion on Iraq policy .
“ The Republicans do n’t have a strong position to argue on when it comes to substance , ” Mr. Obama said Wednesday night .
“ Their foreign policy has been a failure over the last eight years .
The war in Iraq was a huge strategic blunder ; our standing in the world is diminished ; we ’ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars ; lost thousands of lives ;
Afghanistan is in worse shape since any time since 2001 ; and we have [ Osama ] Bin Laden sending out audio tapes . ”
Mr. Biden , who has been to Iraq about a dozen times since voting in favor of the war authorization in 2002 , agreed the spat over Iraq visits is less important than the Democrats ’ overall policy argument .
“ It ’s a good political talking point , ” he said .
He said he goes to Iraq to establish relationships with military and civilian leaders there , but did not see a “ compelling ” reason for multiple visits from Mr. Obama .
“ The fact that he has only gone to Iraq once I do n’t find a compelling argument about [ his ] judgment being somehow less informed , ” Mr. Biden said .
“ Look at John [ McCain ] - he has been there maybe as much as I have and his judgment on Iraq is a disaster . ”
He lambasted Mr. McCain ’s market “ stroll ” in 2007 , when he emphasized how safe Iraq was and did not mention he was protected by dozens of troops during his walk .
Mr. Biden also disagreed with Mr. McCain ’s more - recent assessment of “ great progress ” in Iraq : “ There is no progress ! ”
Mr. Biden earlier this month inserted himself into another campaign - trail fight - when Mr. Obama said President Bush likened him to Nazi appeasers .
Mr. Biden made the rounds on political television shows to defend Democrats , and more directly Mr. Obama .
He said yesterday that Mr. Obama ’s position of “ direct talks ” with foreign adversaries makes sense .
He said the Republicans are acting as if Mr. Obama wants to pick up the phone and call Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and invite him to a meeting in Geneva .
Mr. Biden quipped that Mr. Bush , in fact , was the one who met with Vladimir Putin and assessed his intentions by staring into the Russian leader ’s eyes .
He noted he views Mr. McCain as a friend , and does n’t want to campaign against him , but , “ We can not afford 12 years of Bush ’s policy . ”
“ On all the seminal issues he ’s joined at the hip with this guy , ” Mr. Biden said .
Although Mr. Biden joins several of his colleagues on a Democratic dream “ short list ” of potential vice presidential picks , he said he does n’t want to be considered .
He has not been asked to submit vetting papers , and added that his work for the Democratic campaign does n’t mean he wants the job .
But Mr. Biden added a big caveat , saying instead of being “ considered ” he would want a “ direct discussion face to face with the nominee ” to ask , “ Am I likely to be picked ” if I “ pass all those tests in terms of my not having skeletons . ”
“ If you ca n’t look me in the eye and tell me that then … do n’t put me through the audition , ” he said .
But if that offer is made , “ You ’d have to say yes .
I do n’t know how the hell you ’d say no at this historic moment . ”

Campaigns have used plants for centuries to get their message out .
The planted audience member or radio caller is as old as the hills , but the McCain campaign is now encouraging supporters to spread his talking points and post what could be considered spam comments to specified web sites .
Advertisements
According to the Washington Post , a new McCain program allows his supporters to sign up to earn points and win prizes for posting McCain ’s talking points around the Internet .
The campaign considers this spreading the word , but most blogs would consider this spam .
According to McCain ’s site , here is how it works , “ Select from the numerous web , blog and news sites listed here , go there , and make your opinions supporting John McCain known .
Once you ’ve commented on a post , video or news story , report the details of your comment by clicking the button below .
After your comments are verified , you will be awarded points through the McCain Online Action Center . ”
The liberal blogs listed as targets by the campaign are all of the big boys Crooks and Liars , DailyKos , My DD , and Think Progess .
There is also one key swing state blog , ColoradoPols.com .
It is one thing to target the opposition , but the McCain campaign is generating such little buzz among Republicans that they will also be spamming around 70 conservative blogs .
They also have a handful of moderate and other blogs targeted .
All I can say is how badly does a candidate ’s campaign have to be going that he has to manufacture enthusiasm within his own party .
This is really pathetic when you think about it .
The campaign does not specify that the comments left have to be relevant to the blog post that they are left under , so the campaign is in essence encouraging a spam for McCain campaign .
Either the McCain folks have a serious inferiority complex , or they know that they are in big trouble .
The RNC has been doing this kind of thing for years , but McCain is the first presidential nominee to offer prizes for spamming .
“ Tell them to come back and get to work ! ” John McCain yelled out .
“ Tell them to get to work ! ”
This was at a biker rally in South Dakota where McCain was wooing the crowd by demanding that Congress return to Washington and do something about the energy crisis .
Demanding that Congress come back from vacation to do something is a time - honored political gambit .
But is it the best line of attack for a senator who last showed up for a vote himself back in early spring ?
Perhaps not .
Also , there was the problem of tone .
McCain has sometimes been charged with sounding like a cranky neighbor yelling at kids to get off the lawn .
This time , he turned into a cranky neighbor who hires you to cut his grass and then follows you around , pointing out blades that you missed .
This is energy week on the campaign trail .
In honor of the critical nature of the debate , let ’s try to clear our heads of all thoughts of Paris Hilton ads , and questions of whether McCain knew , when he expressed a yen to see his wife compete in the bikers ’
Miss Buffalo
Chip beauty contest , that the contestants frequently went topless .
Issues .
It ’s all about issues .
Both McCain and Barack Obama have spent the last few days wandering around the country , scowling at gas pumps and talking up their energy plans .
McCain dubbed his The Lexington Project .
Obama ’s seems to be called New Energy for America .
If these guys really cared , would n’t they have come up with better names ?
But we digress .

A businessman committed suicide by decapitating himself in his £ 90,000 ( $ 137,300 ) Aston Martin in order to get revenge on his younger wife who left him .
For some time the 54 - year old Gerald Mellin warned 33 - year old Mirrielle that he would commit suicide .
In addition , he showed his estranged wife the rope for the suicide , which was kept in his sports car .
A day prior to the man 's death he awarded Mrs Mellin , a mother of two , additional £ 100 a week in maintenance , the court was heard .
Shortly after that he sent his wife a text message that said : " Congratulations XXX " .
That was the last trace he left before his death .
One end of the rope Mr Mellin tied up to a tree , while the other to his neck after climbing into the car .
Afterwards he drove his Astor Martin into a busy road so other drivers could observe his terrible death .
On August 7 Mrs Mellin told the inquest : " We had split up and been to court .
He wanted me to walk away from the farmhouse and the business and leave me with nothing .
We met in a pub after a court hearing and he started having a tantrum .
As we made our way back to our cars he opened the boot and said : " There 's my rope , that 's what I 'm going to kill myself with .
I told him to grow up and give me the rope .
But he just laughed . "
Mr Mellin was the proprietor of the gym and sun tanning centre .
This is where Mrs Mellin worked as a beautician .
It was heard that the two had been married prior to their wedding , which took place in 2002 .
In 2007 the pair split and Mrs Mellin carried on living in the luxury farmhouse , located in the village of Crumlin , next to Neath , South Wales .
The court was told : " Our marriage was horrendous most of the time .
After we split he phoned me and said he wanted to do a deal with selling the business .
He had been to see an accountant but the way he did it was all wrong .
I said it was about time we stopped arguing and started behaving like adults .
That was when I met him in the pub and he showed me the rope . "
During the investigation it was heard that before committing suicide Mr Mellin had cancelled a life insurance policy , so his wife could not get paid .
" He ran up an extortionate amount of debt .
I 've got to sell the farmhouse now , just to pay the debts , " said Mrs Mellin .
There was a suicide note found in the pocket of the businessman , stating his funeral wishes .
The official cause of death was given as decapitation .
During the recording of a suicide verdict , Coroner Phillip Rogers stated : " I 'm satisfied this was a deliberate attempt by Mr Mellin to kill himself . "

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an admirer of U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama -- even though she has not yet met him in person .
Asked at a news conference on Wednesday what she thought of Obama , Merkel responded : “ I would say that he is well - equipped -- physically , mentally and politically . ”
Obama is due to meet with Merkel for about an hour on Thursday morning and will later give a speech on transatlantic relations at the “ Victory Column ” in Berlin ’s Tiergarten park .
Merkel objected to initial plans by the Obama campaign to hold the speech at the Brandenburg Gate .
His appearance is expected to draw tens of thousands of Germans , who polls show prefer him to his Republican challenger John McCain .
Since coming to power in 2005 , Merkel has repaired relations with Washington damaged when her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder clashed with U.S. President George W. Bush over the Iraq war .
Bush was famously caught on camera at a G8 meeting in 2006 giving Merkel a quick backrub and the chancellor was asked on Wednesday whether she expected more massages from Bush ’s successor -- whether it ’s McCain or Obama .
“ That ’s not really up to me , ” she joked .
“ But I would n’t resist . ”
Merkel said she would not be in Berlin for Obama ’s hotly anticipated speech , but added : “ Maybe I ’ll turn on the television . ”

Love it or hate it , the Toyota Prius is a boring car and the last thing you ’d expect to see snagging trophies at a car show .
But three Swedes with wild imaginations and a truckload of cash have turned a car with the personality of a goldfish into the world ’s wildest hybrid .
Claes Gustafson and the crew at Classe ’s Garage completely reworked one of Toyota ’s eco-wonders and gave it more video screens than the Super Bowl , more speakers than a political convention and a paint job that makes Amy Winehouse look understated .
It took eight weeks and $ 184,275 , and by the time the car rolled out of the shop the only thing they had n’t modified was the chrome trim on the grille .
Gustafson is an automotive reporter for Sweden ’s TV4 , and about a year ago the network asked if he ’d like to host his own show building a custom car .
The only answer to that question is " Yes , " and Gustafson decided to build an eco- friendly ride .
He considered a Volvo , a Saab and a Honda but picked the Prius because of its unique drivetrain .
" The goal … was to give the viewer a great show and , second , to show that a Toyota is n’t a boring and anonymous car , " he told us by e-mail .
The idea , he says , was " to show that every car can be styled . "
Saying Elvis Haeggblom and Kenny Kyrk styled the car is like saying Michelangelo painted a ceiling .
No one makes a body kit for the Prius , so they used one for the Volvo XC90 .
They ditched the back doors and swapped the fronts for a pair that open like a knife .
The back window went in the trash and the side windows were reshaped .
There ’s a carbon fiber wind splitter under the front bumper and under the door sills .

Colin Powell , George Bush 's former secretary of state and previously the general in charge of the slaughter of Iraqi troops in the first Gulf war , is scheduled to speak in Vancouver on June 12 .
Possibly setting a new standard for hypocrisy , the title of his talk is " Leadership in the 21st Century . "
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
We should n't let him into the country , and here 's why .
Powell has been dogged for years by accusations of war crimes , crimes against humanity and grave human rights abuses including torture .
There is enough evidence available to suggest that , at the very least , the federal government should investigate Powell for the alleged violations of international law .
The government has made it clear where it stands on such crimes : " The policy of the Government of Canada is unequivocal .
Canada will not be a safe haven for persons involved in war crimes , crimes against humanity or other reprehensible acts . "
Lawyers Against the War
An international jurists group , Lawyers Against the War ( LAW ) , are trying to stop Powell 's entry into Canada .
Given that Stephen Harper is prime minister and a dedicated supporter of the Bush administration and the Iraq war , the chances of success are slim .
But consider what the law says .
Canada 's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , section 35 ( 1 ) ( a ) states that a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights or for committing an act outside Canada that constitutes an offence referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Act .
Also inadmissible are persons who are , or were , senior officials " in the service of a government that , in the opinion of the Minister , engages or has engaged in gross human rights violations ... "
What constitutes crimes against humanity and war crimes ?
According to LAW , " crimes against humanity " include murder , enforced disappearance , deportation , imprisonment , torture , imprisonment in violation of fundamental rules of international law , committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group .
War crimes includes willful killing , torture and inhumane treatment , unlawful confinement , willfully depriving a prisoner of war or other protected person of fair trial rights , or intentionally launching an attack that will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians .
Spinning weapons , detainees
Powell , the general in charge of the first Gulf war , was also secretary of state from 2001 to 2005 , and thus a key member of the Bush administration that planned and executed the illegal and brutal invasion of Iraq .
Not only did Powell lie to the United Nations about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction , he was a key member of the group within that administration that devised the notorious extra-legal system whereby the U.S. captured and imprisoned non-Americans , denied them any legal protection and subjected them to a wide range of gross human rights violations , including extraordinary rendition and torture .
In a Jan. 26 , 2002 memo he suggested to President Bush that he either decide that the Geneva Convention did not apply to a " failed state " such as Afghanistan , or that it did apply , but not to anyone declared by the president to be Al Qaeda or Taliban members .
Either option , said Powell , would " provide the same practical flexibility in how we treat detainees , including with respect to interrogation and length of the detention . "
In May , 2004 , the U.S. National Lawyers Guild called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Colin Powell and others for war crimes committed during the illegal war on Iraq .
In 2003 , Powell ( along with several other U.S. officials ) was the target of two criminal complaints under Belgium 's 1993 universal - jurisdiction genocide law , for his actions in the second Gulf war .
Under pressure from the U.S. , Belgium repealed the law shortly after the charges were filed .
Powell 's history of controversy
In 1991 , an independent International War Crimes Tribunal headed by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark , found Powell and others guilty of war crimes against Iraq in the first Gulf war , including indiscriminate killing of civilians , targeting of national infrastructure , and the wholesale slaughter of thousands of Iraqi troops ( while withdrawing from Kuwait ) for no military purpose .
During the Vietnam war Powell was assigned to investigate widespread charges that U.S. troops were brutalizing Vietnamese civilians .
In claiming relations between troops and civilians were " excellent , " and in particular for failing to mention the most notorious example , the My Lai massacre , Powell was later accused by some of a cover-up .
There are enough unanswered questions about Powell 's culpability in illegal acts in both Gulf wars that the federal government should deny him entry into Canada .
Indeed , the evidence is compelling enough that if Powell does arrive in Canada the government should follow Canada 's war crimes legislation .
Under that legislation , according to LAW , Canada is obliged to arrest him and either prosecute him for torture and other crimes , or extradite him to a jurisdiction that is willing to prosecute him .
If the Harper government is not prepared to take our war crimes legislation seriously , then it should do the honest thing and repeal them .

Teams right across Europe are involved in the ExoMars project Has a wheel just come off Britain 's participation in the biggest European space mission of the next decade ?
Funding for UK - led experiments on the ExoMars rover and lander is to be cut by 25 % in their key development phase .
The one - billion - euro mission to search for life on the Red Planet has always been touted as the one project that plays to all of Britain 's strengths .
Now , unless researchers can find extra funds or reduce costs , some of them are certain to miss the flagship mission .
Professor Steve Schwartz , from Imperial College London , is working on a magnetometer instrument for ExoMars .
He told BBC News : " If this sticks , it means for sure that some instruments wo n't fly ; that some groups either wo n't participate or they wo n't participate in as many instruments as they planned to .
" And that means there will be science that either ExoMars wo n't do or the UK will lose to some international competitor . "
Tight budget ExoMars is part of the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Aurora space exploration programme .
The robotic mission is being prepared by teams across Europe , with help from the United States , Canada and Russia .
It is set to leave Earth in 2013 and land on the Red Planet in 2014 .
The LMC would look for specific molecules associated with life
The cut - back does not affect the industrial project to construct the rover vehicle and its various sub-systems - for which UK companies continue to have major inputs .
Rather , it impacts just Britain 's contribution to the science ExoMars intends to pursue once it gets down onto the surface of the Red Planet .
British university academics are developing a host of instruments that will search for the presence of microbes and also investigate Mars ' geology and environment .
As presently configured , the mission would see UK scientists assume several of the lead , or Principal Investigator , positions on the mission .
These positions are now threatened because of a decision to rein back development money .
The problem stems from the budget squeeze experienced by the funding agency which oversees UK astronomy and physics - the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) .
It has sought to claw back £ 80 m of savings to balance its 2009 - 11 budget - and ExoMars lost out in a review process that was held to find the highest priority science endeavours .
Expensive science
Although the strategic importance of ExoMars was recognised in the review , it was still recommended there be " a reduction of 25 % to the planned spending line for ExoMars " .
STFC rubber - stamped the cut " after receiving no strong arguments against this from the consultation process " .
EXOMARS MISSION CONCEPT
Set to leave Earth in 2013 ; primary aim is to search for life Will launch on a heavy - lift rocket , such as the Ariane 5 Vented landing bags allow for a larger payload Rover will carry a 16.5 kg ' Pasteur ' instrument suite 30kg geophysics / environment static station also possible
This would study the weather and listen for ' Marsquakes ' Concept to cost Esa states more than first estimates
Evolution rolls on for Mars rover " Well , that 's not actually true because I put at least one strong argument in , " said Dr Mark Sims , from Leicester University , who is developing the Life Marker Chip ( LMC ) instrument for ExoMars .
" I did n't think it was supposed to be a ' who shouts loudest gets the money ' process ... but in hindsight , maybe we should have put more responses into the Programmatic Review . "
Professor Schwartz believes the reviewers may have been scared off by the cost of ExoMars , and could have felt the relative science value was therefore not as great as some other projects .
One reason ExoMars is so expensive is because it will look for life .
This means the spacecraft and all its instruments must be prepared so that no Earth contamination is carried to Mars that might fool the detectors into thinking , falsely , they had found Martian organisms .
" By its nature , this is expensive science , " said Professor Schwartz .
" Also , it looks expensive because we are right at that phase when everything is being defined and everyone is getting ready to build . "
Ministers ' meeting
In truth , the whole ExoMars project is still some distance from being finalised .
It is not apparent yet precisely how much volume and mass will be available for instruments , both on the rover vehicle itself and in its Humboldt landing tray , a payload of scientific instruments .
Also , ExoMars ' final industrial price - the money Europe 's aerospace companies will expect to be paid to construct and deliver the mission to Mars ' surface - is still in negotiation .
Tiny UK - built seismometers would listen for " Marsquakes "
What is abundantly clear is that this flagship venture is going to cost close to double what space ministers first approved in 2005 ; and that is likely to prove problematic for many Esa member states when the next ministerial meeting is held in November .
For the UK , some hard decisions will have to be made .
At the moment , its financial contribution ( 101 m euros ) to ExoMars is second only to the Italians .
Britain will have to decide whether it wants to maintain that leading position and pick up the rising costs at its current investment rate ( 17 % ) , or step back from the planetary venture that was supposed to have met all UK objectives .
Dr Sims said UK scientists were about to start an assessment process which would try to refine the exact costs of developing their instruments .
This would allow everyone to gauge better the full impact of the 25 % cut , he added .
Asked to comment on the latest situation , the STFC told the BBC : " The STFC Review confirms the strategic priority for the UK's role in Aurora and the ExoMars mission and we expect our support for this exciting and important programme to continue .
" Any change in support , such as that proposed by [ the Programmatic Review ] , would only apply to the UK 's scale of investment in instrumentation for ExoMars and not the UK 's contribution to the wider Aurora programme , for which we will maintain our agreed commitment , pending the outcome of the Esa Ministerial .

Woodbridge —
It was 2009 when the country club in this affluent New Haven suburb started sliding into bankruptcy .
Fearful that the 150 - acre property would be scooped up by a developer looking to build affordable or multi-family housing , Woodbridge officials purchased the property that spring for $ 7 million .
Higher blood levels of the compound urate , a salt derived from uric acid that is associated with gout , may be associated with a slower progression of Parkinson ’s disease , according to an article posted online today that will appear in the June 2008 print issue of Archives of Neurology , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
Urate is a powerful antioxidant that circulates at high levels in the human bloodstream , according to background information in the article .
It may serve as one of the body ’s major defenses against oxidative stress , or damage to cells caused by nitrogen and oxygen .
Oxidative stress may contribute to the loss of brain cells that produce dopamine , leading to Parkinson ’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders .
Michael A. Schwarzschild , M.D. , Ph.D. , of Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , and colleagues studied 804 individuals with early Parkinson ’s disease who were enrolled in a drug trial conducted between April 2002 and August 2005 .
Participants ’ blood urate levels were measured at the beginning of the study .
They were then seen one month later and again every three months until 24 months had passed .
At each visit , they were clinically assessed to determine if their disease had progressed enough to require dopaminergic therapy .
Overall , 493 participants ( 61 percent ) became disabled enough by their Parkinson ’s disease to require dopaminergic therapy by the end of the study .
Patients with high blood urate levels were less likely to progress to this point .
When participants were separated into five groups based on their blood levels of urate , those in the group with the highest levels ( 6.7 milligrams per deciliter or higher ) were half as likely to require dopaminergic therapy as those with the lowest levels ( less than 4.3 milligrams per deciliter ) .
The apparent association between urate levels and Parkinson ’s disease progression could indicate that urate itself protects dopamine - producing neurons that are typically destroyed as the condition worsens , the authors note .
Alternatively , other compounds that the body eventually turns into urate could be neuroprotective .

Editor 's note :
This story is part of a series " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed -- Scientific American 's Take . "
In the new science - bashing movie Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , Ben Stein and the rest of the filmmakers sincerely and seriously argue that Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution paved the way for the Holocaust .
By " seriously , " I mean that Ben Stein acts grief - stricken and the director juxtaposes quotes from evolutionary biologists with archival newsreel clips from Hitler 's Reich .
Prepare for an intellectual night at the cinema .
No one could have been more surprised than I when the producers called , unbidden , offering Scientific American 's editors a private screening .
Given that our magazine 's positions on evolution and intelligent design ( ID ) creationism reflect those of the scientific mainstream ( that is , evolution : good science ; ID : not science ) , you have to wonder why they would bother .
It 's not as though anything in Expelled would have been likely to change our views .
And they can't have been looking for a critique of the science in the movie , because there is n't much to speak of .
Rather , it seems a safe bet that the producers hope a whipping from us would be useful for publicity : further proof that any mention of ID outrages the close - minded establishment .
( Picture Ben Stein as Jack Nicholson , shouting , " You ca n't handle the truth ! " )
Knowing this , we could simply ignore the movie — which might also suit their purposes , come to think of it .
Unfortunately , Expelled is a movie not quite harmless enough to be ignored .
Shrugging off most of the film 's attacks — all recycled from previous pro-ID works — would be easy , but its heavy - handed linkage of modern biology to the Holocaust demands a response for the sake of simple human decency .
Expelled wears its ambitions to be a creationist Fahrenheit 911 openly , in that it apes many of Michael Moore 's comic tricks : emphasizing the narrator 's hapless everyman qualities by showing him meandering his way to interviews ; riposting interviewees ' words with ironic old footage and so on .
Director Nathan Frankowski is reasonably adept at the techniques , although he is not half the filmmaker Michael Moore is ( and yes , I do mean in both senses of the phrase ) .
The film begins with the triumphant entry of financial columnist , media figure and former Nixon White House speechwriter Ben Stein to a filled college lecture hall .
( If this review were styled after the movie , I 'd be intercutting clips of Nixon flashing a victory sign with Stein 's scenes from Ferris Bueller 's Day Off and his eyedrop commercials , but you get the idea . )
Stein explains that he is speaking out because he has " lately noticed a dire trend " that threatens the state of our nation : the ascendance of godless , materialist , evolutionary science and an unwillingness among academics to consider more theistic alternatives .
A montage of short clips then shows Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and other scientists scorning religion or ID without context .
" Freedom is the essence of America ! "
Stein insists , and he frets that scientists who like their empiricism with a dash of deus ex machina are oppressed .
He and Expelled charge that scientists , in their rejection of religious explanations , have become as intolerant as Nazis .
Or maybe Stalinists — the film clips were ambiguous on that point .
( The newsreel footage from the old Soviet days kept confusing me .
Stein does know that the Stalinists rejected the theory of evolution as a biological rendition of capitalism , does n't he ?
And that they replaced it with their own ideologically driven , disastrous theory of Lysenkoism ?
Does Stein think that moviegoers wo n't know this ? )
I should note that Stein and Expelled rarely refer to " scientists " as I did — they call them Darwinists .
Similarly , this review may have already used the word " evolution " about as often as the whole of Expelled does ; in the movie , it is always Darwinism .
The term is a curious throwback , because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin 's original ideas — most researchers would call themselves neo-Darwinian if they bothered to make the historical connection at all because evolutionary science now encompasses concepts as diverse as symbiosis , kin selection and developmental genetics .
Yet the choice of terminology is n't random : Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic , atheistic ideology akin to Marxism .
Expelled then trots out some of the people whom it claims have been persecuted by the Darwinist establishment .
First among them is Richard Sternberg* , former editor of the peer - reviewed Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington , who published an article on ID by Stephen C. Meyer of the Discovery Institute .
Sternberg tells
Stein that he subsequently lost his editorship , his old position at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of Natural History and his original office .
Looking a bit smug in his self - martyrdom , Sternberg also reports that a colleague compared him with an " intellectual terrorist . "
What most viewers of Expelled may not realize — because the film does n't even hint at it — is that Sternberg 's case is not quite what it sounds .
Biologists criticized Sternberg 's choice to publish the paper not only because it supported ID but also because Sternberg approved it by himself rather than sending it out for independent expert review .
He did n't lose his editorship ; he published the paper in what was already scheduled to be his last issue as editor .
He did n't lose his job at the Smithsonian ; his appointment there as an unpaid research associate had a limited term , and when it was over he was given a new one .
His office move was scheduled before the paper ever appeared .
[ For more details see Ben Stein Launches a Science - free Attack on Darwin by Michael Shermer . ]
And so on .
These confounding facts are documented in the appendix to the unofficial Congressional report from Rep. Mark Souder 's office that the film cites in support of its story .
At the very least , the Sternberg affair is considerably more complicated and questionable than Expelled lets on .
The movie's one - sided version is either the result of shoddy investigation or deliberate propagandizing — neither of which reflects well on the other information in the film .
So it is with the rest of Expelled 's parade of victims .
Caroline Crocker , a biology teacher , was allegedly dismissed from her position at George Mason University after merely mentioning ID ; the film somehow never reports exactly what she said or why anyone objected to it .
Reporter Pamela Winnick was supposedly pilloried and fired after she wrote objectively about evolution and ID ; we do n't know exactly what she wrote but later we do hear her asserting with disgust that " Darwinism devalues human life . "
The film forgot to mention that Winnick is the author of the book A Jealous God : Science 's Crusade Against Religion — a title that suggests her objectivity on the subject might be a bit tarnished .
The movie 's unreliable reporting is even more obvious during the scene in which Stein interviews Bruce Chapman , the president of the Discovery Institute , the institutional heart of ID advocacy .
Stein asks whether the Discovery Institute has supported the teaching of ID in science classes so avidly because it is trying to sneak religion back into public schools .
Chapman says no and the film blithely takes him at his word .
No mention is made of the notorious " Wedge " document , a leaked Discovery Institute manifesto that outlined a strategy of opposing evolution and turning the public against scientific materialism as the first step toward making society more politically conservative and theistic .
Maybe Ben Stein did n't think it was relevant , but would n't an honest film have trusted its audience to judge for itself ?
