I received a voicemail message the other day from the hospital where I was a patient a week earlier .
Let ’s call it National Hospital as a courtesy .
The message said , “ Hello Demian .
This is National Hospital calling to ask if you would please fill out a survey that will be coming to you in the mail shortly , rating us on your stay here .
We hope you will give us a five , since that is the service that we strive to achieve here . ”
Well , National Hospital , I have no intention of filling out your survey , but here ’s your review .
When I got the message , I was speeding down I - 83 , heading for the Rite Aid near my apartment to pick up medication .
Normally , this would n’t have been a big deal if it had been cold or sore throat vaccines I was after , but on this particular day , it was essential to take the medication at noon and I was four hours late .
This was after waiting from nine a .m. to three p.m. for a callback from the doctor who was supposed to tell me whether or not to continue the medication .
I had picked up the prescription from this particular Rite Aid a few days earlier , but still had three doses left on my prescription of seven .
The employees had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned this , and had apparently lost either my paperwork or my medicine as I was losing my mind .
They directed me to “ the next closest Rite Aid ” which was a half hour away .
Now four - and - a - half hours late for taking my meds , the doctor finally got around to answering the four voicemail messages I had left him through the course of the day .
He confirmed that , yes , I did need to take my medicine four - and - a - half hours ago , and as a bonus , my blood work from the day before had mysteriously vanished .
I raced to the Rite Aid , trolled through a traffic jam , got lost , and ended up finally getting my prescription at five - thirty .
It was a small syringe , similar to an Epi Pen , injected in the stomach .
As someone who normally has a paralyzing fear of needles it usually took me at least 10 minutes to work up the courage to perform this task , but now I was so jacked up with adrenaline that I got into my car , blasted the radio and just did it without even a wince .
But very little of that story has to do with National Hospital .
About two weeks ago , I noticed a pain in my upper calf .
As an avid runner , I assumed it was simply muscular and left it alone for a while .
A few days later I could barely walk , stricken with searing bursts of pain every time my foot touched the ground .
I hobbled over to the hospital , assuming I had pulled or torn a tendon .
They wheeled me down into the bowels of the hospital basement , propped me on a bed and began performing a sonogram on my leg .
The doctor moved the sensor up the calf from the ankle , and when it finally came to the area where I was feeling pain , he uttered two simple words and I knew I was n’t going to be going home anytime soon .
“ Holy shit . ”
I had a sizable blood clot in a small vein in my leg .
So they wheeled me back upstairs , hooked me up to an IV of Heparin and started running all sorts of tests , poking me with needles , drawing blood , taking measurements , injecting , inspecting , and all other sorts of horrible , uncomfortable procedures , I sat back and wondered how it happened .
As I soon learned , they were in a similar predicament .
One of the three doctors handed me a sheet of paper on what they believed to be my condition .
It had a list of several criteria that would result in blood clotting , absolutely none of which applied to me .
I was n’t old , I was active , did n’t smoke , had n’t gone on any long trips , had no history of blood clots in my family , and was n’t taking birth control .
So I was laid up in a hospital bed next to a guy I called Cancer John for three days while they continued running their tests all day from six a.m. until about 10 p.m. , each result coming back negative .
One of the doctors said , “ You ’re a mystery , Demian .
You ’re baffling us . ”
Great .
The clot did n’t even really bother me .
What ticked me off were the goings - on of the place where I was stuck for those three long days .
Maybe it was my bizarre condition , or maybe it was the way the hospital was run , but I ’ve never seen such disorganization between the nurses .
The IV would stop working randomly , issuing series of painfully annoying beeps for up to an hour before a nurse would come to fix it .
Each time I asked for something , whether it was a glass of water or a Tylenol , it would take a minimum of 30 minutes to arrive .
Individual nurses ’ shifts changed constantly and so did the way I was treated .
Blood tests were irregular and sporadic and each nurse would tell me to do different things or keep my leg in different positions .
One nurse said she needed a urine test on the first day , right before her shift ended , and the jar remained untouched for the duration of my visit .
In fairness , these inconveniences were minor , but what got to me was the feeling of utter helplessness .
I could n’t leave the room or do anything for myself .
I was a prisoner to the rules and regulations of National Hospital .
For example , when a friend heard about what had happened , she got on a Greyhound bus from New York City to visit .
She arrived in the waiting room at seven in the morning the next day , but visiting hours did n’t start until 11 .
She kicked up a fuss to no prevail and I did my best to sweet - talk the nurses into letting her come up early .
In response , my nurse of the hour said , “ Listen .
This is our time .
We have to do certain things with you in the time until 11 .
Your sister ( I had to fib ) is going to have to wait . ”
I did n’t see that nurse again all day and my friend was stuck sitting in the waiting room for four hours .
I ’m out now and starting to get back into a normal routine , but the doctors still do n’t have a clue about what ’s wrong .
I ’m on two forms of blood thinners ; Coumadin in pill form and the Arixtra injections , and I ’m starting to notice the threats that surround me .
I was advised to be careful with knives , to use only electric razors .
Each pile of broken glass , every sharp corner or crack in the sidewalk is a health hazard .
It ’s a life of constant paranoia , but at least it ’s better than being holed up with Cancer John .
But anyway , there ’s your review , National Hospital .
I hope we do n’t meet again anytime soon .
As the U.S. economy continues to weaken , secondary credit markets , which play a large role in supporting consumer lending , are showing further signs of distress .
Even with the Fed pumping billions of dollars of credit into the economy with loan auctions and low interest rates , lenders are continuing to tighten standars and raise rates .
One part of the problem is a near total collapse in confidence in the market for securitized mortgages and loans .
NYT :
[ T ]he market for securitization , through which mortgages and other debts are packaged and sold as securities , has become sclerotic and almost totally dependent on government support .
The problems , intensified by bond investors who have grown leery of these instruments , have been a drag on the economy and have persisted despite the exercise of extraordinary regulatory powers by policy makers .
“ The mortgage finance system in the United States has been badly damaged , ” said Anthony Lembke , co-head of investments at MKP Capital Management , a hedge fund firm that is a big investor in mortgages .
“ There is definitely some reinvention that will need to occur , and that will include some explicit involvement by the government . ”
Private securitizations have cratered .
Data from Thomson Reuters says lenders securitized only $ 131 billion in loans in the first half of 08 , down from $ 1 trillion in the same period last year .
As a result , mortgage rates have crept up , which will keep the pressure on the housing market :
Credit is also tightening despite support in secondary markets from GSEs like Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) .
Fannie and Freddie have securitized $ 692 billion worth of mortgages so far this year , about the same as last year .
But secondary buyers are now harder to come by , and Freddie and Fannie 's desperate attempts to save themselves will now reduce their own buying and selling .
Freddie Mac , for example , announced yesterday that it would stop buying subprime mortgages in New York .
The two companies , which reported big losses last week , have said that they might reduce or slow the amount of large loans they buy from banks , a signal that two giants that had been big buyers might become sellers .
If so , that would lower the price of mortgage securities even more , raising the cost of borrowing for home buyers .
So the credit picture is still getting worse , not better .
This is in part why those calling a bottom on financial stocks are probably jumping the gun .
Until the housing and mortgage markets shows signs of stabilization , a sustained rally in financials is unlikely .

JUNE 23 -- Meet Jeffrey Barrier .
The Ohio man allegedly used a cell phone camera to snap photos of a naked woman at a tanning salon Saturday and then hid the phone in his anus in a bid to thwart police .
Standing on a chair , Barrier , 41 , took the photos at Cincinnati's Aloha Tanning , where a 35 - year - old woman was " in the nude in a tanning room , " according to a Hamilton County Municipal Court affidavit .
When cops later confronted Barrier , " he kept denying any involvement of the incident " and claimed to not have a camera .
However , a second search of the suspect turned up the camera .
As noted in a Hamilton County Sheriff 's Office report , Barrier " did hide evidence in his anus . "
Barrier , pictured in his mug shot , was charged with disorderly conduct for taking the photos and obstructing official business for hampering a police investigation .
Barrier , due in court today , is free on $ 1500 bond .

There has " always been a requirement for network management , " said Verizon CTO Richard Lynch Tuesday at the Progress & Freedom Foundation 's annual Aspen conference on tech policy , even in the analog age .
In the wake of the FCC 's recent Comcast decision , debates over " network management " have escaped the engineers ' offices and now take place even among skeptical consumers who worry about what such management will do to their Internet connections .
Lynch laid out Verizon 's view on the matter : time - sensitive packets like VoIP should be prioritized over less - sensitive packets like P2P , but the company remains committed to " deliver any and all data requested by our customers . "
Thanks to its fiber - to - the - home commitment , Verizon does n't face the same congestion issues that plague many cable operators .
While current cable networks may share a single uplink between several hundred homes , Verizon 's fiber nodes serve an average of only 32 homes — and the uplink has more bandwidth to begin with .
Verizon can currently offer 50 M bps symmetric connections , with 100 M bps connections already in trials , and it can add capacity on lit fiber simply by turning on additional wavelengths .
But Lynch rejects the idea that the only acceptable form of network management is none at all — that is , that Verizon and other ISPs should all commit to delivering all packets , all the time , with zero delay .
At the last conference where Lynch presented his idea , he was " accused quite vocally and loudly of all sorts of horrific things " and told that Verizon should just keep investing money .
Lynch oversees Verizon 's capital expenditures and notes that the company pumps $ 17 billion a year into its network infrastructure .
But building a network that could , even at peak times , deliver every single packet without delay could prove prohibitively expensive as traffic continues to grow at 50 percent a year .
If Verizon built a network that could ensure no packet ever got delayed , " customers would be upset " over what Verizon would have to charge to make that possible .
Richard Lynch
Finding a balance of cost , performance , and service quality depends on an optimized traffic flow , and to Lynch , this means dividing traffic into two classes : time - sensitive and everything else .
Such a management technique amounts to protocol discrimination , though Verizon commits not to deal in content discrimination — all VoIP calls , from all services , will receive the same treatment .
Under heavy loads , the network would prioritize the time - sensitive protocols and delay the others until capacity is available .
Lynch believes that few customers would even notice the " 22 ms delay " in other services .
Whatever techniques Verizon ultimately adopts , though , Lynch believes that the way to alleviate customer suspicion is transparency .
" We do n't have all the answers yet , " he said , adding that he was personally still thinking through some of these issues .
But full disclosure of network management practices is the " best way to go about it . "
Deep packet inspection would power such a solution , and Lynch has a message for all the " DPI haters " out there : look at the issue from an engineer 's perspective .
In his view , this is the only rational way to manage a network for the largest number of users .

Author : Some in Congress calling for war crimes trials Nick Langewis and David Edwards

Print This Email This Update : Book raises possibility of secret succession plan
The Bush administration 's laxity towards torture of prisoners could expose its top officials to war crimes charges , said investigative journalist and New Yorker writer Jane Mayer to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" I think that 's more a political question than a legal question , really , " Mayer said .
" It 's a question of whether there 's a political appetite for this .
There are Democrats on the Hill who are calling for these kinds of hearings and trials . "
As Mayer wrote in her new book , The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals , officials that may find themselves under arrest should they visit certain European countries include President Bush , Vice President Cheney , his aide David Addington , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , for violations of the Geneva Conventions and American law .
" What the book makes clear , really , is that this was n't the action of some kind of ' bad , rotten apples on the bottom of the barrel , ' as people were saying [ about ]
Abu Ghraib .
This is a program that was put into place by the top of our government to use the [ toughest terms possible ] to get information . "
" As part of that process , " the book reads , " for the first time in history , the United States sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment U.S. - held captives , making torture the official law of the land in all but name . "
" [ The ] interrogation methods used to question detainees have been lawful , safe , and effective , " CIA spokesman George Little countered in a Friday statement responding to claims made in the book .
" The program has yielded valuable information that has helped the United States and other countries save lives and disrupt terrorist operations . "
Whether or not the much - discussed practice of waterboarding is torture , for example , is a " semantic game , " but one that seems cut - and - dried from Mayer 's perspective .
She cites former Deputy Secretary of State and Vietnam combat veteran Richard Armitage , Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge among Bush administration officials who have equated the practice to torture .
While Mayer is " sympathetic " to the national frenzy that followed the shock of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks , we 've had ample time to reassess our methods and procedures .
" The question is : Seven years later , do we need to keep doing the same thing ?
And , can we , take , maybe , a rational look and see -- is this what we want our country to become , or are we better than this ? "
Update Mayer 's book contains myriad shocking revelations about the Bush administration 's war on terror policies , but it also lets some questions linger .
For example , has President Bush issued a secret order cutting Congress out of the line of succession in case the Bush and vice president Dick Cheney were simultaneously killed .
Slate 's Bruce Ackerman lays out the possibility .
Apparently sometime in the 1980s , President Ronald Reagan issued a " secret executive order " that in the event of the death of the president and the vice president " established a means of re-creating the executive branch . "
Reagan 's order violated the express terms of the Constitution and governing statutes .
Does a similar order exist today ?
We are n't told .
But we do know that Dick Cheney participated in the secret " doomsday " exercises under the Reagan order , and given his central role at present , it is imperative for Congress to find out .
The interview is available to view below .
It was broadcast on CNN's The Situation Room on July 15 , 2008 .

The imprisoned leader of a polygamist sect along with other five men arrested earlier this year in Texas have been accused of child sex assault .
Greg Abbott , the Texas Attorney - General , mentioned that he looks forward to extradite Warren Jeffs , the former leader of a polygamist sect , who was convicted of rape in 2007 and currently is imprisoned in Arizona jail .
The Attorney - General decided to keep the names of five other men undisclosed .
However , he said that there " will be an aggressive attempt to apprehend them " .
" The indictments issues today are part of an ongoing and continuing criminal investigation , " added Mr. Abbott .
He said that additional details will not yet be unveiled .
It is worth mentioning that in April 2008 over 400 children were released from the Yearning For Zion ranch .
According to officials , girls were being " prepared " to admit sex with their " spiritual husbands " , who were middle - aged men , as soon as they reach puberty and boys were taught to carry on the cycle of abuse .
Following the Court 's decision that the state child welfare officials exceeded their authority after they took the 468 children without providing evidence that they were in immediate danger , children were brought back to their parents .
The Attorney - General said that Jeffs was accused on charges of offensive assault of a child .
The other four men were given charges of " sexually assaulting young girls under the age of 17 " .
Among the four men , one was given charges of bigamy .
The other man has been accused of failing to provide information of child abuse .

So this is what had become of C. Wayne Cox .
Dick Levy , a well - known philanthropist and Silicon Valley board chairman , stared at the newspaper mug shot in disbelief .
This guy had it all – once .
Cox was an elite engineer at Varian , a medical technology company that Levy helped run .
The intelligent man with a slight Southern twang was living in a Saratoga ranch home with his wife of 27 years and two children .
He adorned his wife with strands of pearls , expensive watches and once , for Christmas , a gold cat pin with twinkling emerald eyes .
That was back in the ’80s and ’90s .
And , now , here Cox was again – the 66 - year - old man charged with fatally plowing his 1994 Infiniti into a pair of elderly church friends out for a stroll .
One witness said he reached out the window to push one of the dying victims off his hood , then drove away .
Police say Cox was a transient living out of his car .
Personal struggles
“ God , he must have gone through hell in his personal life to have dropped such a long way , ” said Levy , 70 , a board chairman at Varian Medical Systems in Palo Alto and co-chairman of several foundations and non-profits .
Sometime during the last decade , Cox ’s life fell apart .
Civil court records reviewed by the Mercury News detail a layoff from Varian in 1996 , a messy divorce two years later , financial struggles , and bouts of depression .
On Monday , Cox was arrested after a Santa Clara librarian tipped off police after discovering him at the library .
She was reading about the collision on the Mercury News Web site and recognized Cox ’s name from a police - involved “ incident ” at the library the week before .
Officers arrived minutes later to find the white - haired man sitting at a library table , surfing the Web .
Cox now sits in a jail cell in San Jose , where he has declined two interview requests .
He ’s charged with the hit - and - run deaths of Oralia Puga Ramirez , 75 , and Enedina Oliva , 70 – who had befriended each other at a Santa Clara church .
Police are waiting for a toxicology report but do n’t believe that Cox was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the women were struck in a crosswalk at Stevens Creek Boulevard and Cypress Avenue about 8:20 p.m. Aug .
9 . If convicted , Cox faces at least 13 years in prison .
Those who knew Cox at the peak of his career can’t believe what ’s now surfacing about a man they remember as a bright , successful executive , a man with no sign of a criminal record .
‘ Southern gentleman ’
“ He was a Southern gentleman , ” said Nancy Miller , 61 , of Morgan Hill .
“ He was quiet , soft - spoken and well - respected .
He was not a bum . ”
Miller knows .
In 1983 , she was Varian ’s human resources director who hired the Georgia native with a résumé that included past jobs at IBM in Kentucky and Mead in Ohio .
Records show Cox earned $ 150,000 a year during the mid-1990s to head up Varian ’s engineering department .
Like most at Varian , Levy had lost track of Cox after the company was reorganized in 1996 , when Cox was let go .
“ He was very smart , technically , ” Levy said last week .
“ He was just a normal guy running a department . ”
Ron Moeller , 67 , of Fremont said Cox hired him in 1992 .
At the time , Cox was leading a prestigious engineering team at the company , which Moeller said developed a profitable “ high - energy X - ray machine ” that eradicated cancer tumors , called the Multileaf Collimator .
“ They were selling like hotcakes , ” Moeller told the Mercury News .
“ It was one of Varian ’s great successes .
Wayne was a great mentor , very helpful to me .
And he was doing really great stuff . ”
Most had no idea that Cox was having financial and possibly psychological trouble .
Tim Harper , a San Jose vocational consultant hired to document Cox ’s employment status during his divorce , wrote in his court report that Cox said he was being treated for , and still suffering from , depression .
Harper also suggested that while Cox was a “ cordial , pleasant ” man who seemed embarrassed that he had been out of a job for two years , he also did n’t seem to be looking too hard for new work .
The documents also show Cox was in a contentious fight with his ex-wife for their cream - colored , Oakhaven Drive ranch home in Saratoga with the three - car garage , valued then at $ 700,000 .
Cox ’s ex-wife , who lives out of state , could not be reached for comment on two occasions last week .
The Mercury News is not identifying her .
It ’s unclear what Cox did between his divorce and now .
Police did n’t reveal many details about Cox , simply calling him a transient who may have been living out of his car .
Public records show Cox ’s last listed address was along Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard in San Jose .
But a check at that address shows it is a Mail Station , tucked in a bustling strip mall .
Now , he is being held without bail and ordered to appear in court Monday .
“ It seemed like he got hit , and never recovered , ” Harper said in an interview .
“ What kind of choices did he make to go from the penthouse to the outhouse ? ”

Derbyshire studied maths and music at Cambridge before joining the BBC A hidden hoard of recordings made by the electronic music pioneer behind the Doctor Who theme has been revealed - including a dance track 20 years ahead of its time .
Delia Derbyshire was working in the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop in 1963 when she was given the score for a theme tune to a new science fiction series .
She turned those dots on a page into the swirling , shimmering Doctor Who title music - although it is the score 's author , Ron Grainer , who is credited as the composer .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Now David Butler , of Manchester University 's School of Arts , Histories and Cultures has revealed for the first time the existence of 267 tapes found in Ms Derbyshire 's attic when she died in 2001 .
They were , until last March , in the safekeeping of Mark Ayres , archivist for the Radiophonic Workshop - and have lain unheard for more than 30 years .
Amongst the recordings is some ethereal whooshing from a 1969 production of Hamlet at the Roundhouse in London ; an extraordinary kit of parts for one of her most - admired pieces ; and the theme for a documentary set in the Sahara which shows how she used her voice as an instrument .
' Timeless '
Most unexpected of all , however , is a piece of music that sounds like a contemporary dance track which was recorded , it is believed , in the late sixties .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Paul Hartnoll , formerly of the dance group Orbital and a great admirer of Ms Derbyshire 's work , said the track was , " quite amazing " .
" That could be coming out next week on [ left - field dance label ] Warp Records , " he noted .
" It 's incredible when you think when it comes from .
Timeless , really .
It could be now as much as then . "
Delia Derbyshire 's voice can be heard introducing it .
" Forget about this , " she says , " it 's for interest only . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The next extract from the archives is a recording of her own voice , played forwards and backwards .
It is the raw material for Blue Veils and Golden Sands - the documentary about the Tuareg people in the Sahara .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The final version ( right ) contains cut up elements of her voice ( which she jokingly referred to as a " castrated oboe " ) , and the sound of several electronic oscillators .
The third recording from the archives features actor Nicol Williamson 's legendary portrayal of Hamlet .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" I find it spell - binding , " says Hartnoll .
" I 've got a shedload of synthesizers and equipment , whereas Delia Derbyshire got out of the Radiophonic Workshop when synthesizers came along .
" I think she got a bit disheartened and a bit bored with it all when the synthesizer came along and it all became a little too easy . "
David Butler used an old reel - to - reel tape recorder to digitise the collection Ms Derbyshire was well - known for favouring the use of a green metal lampshade as a musical instrument and said she took some of her inspiration from the sound of air raid sirens , which she heard growing up in Coventry in the Second World War .
So what next for the 267 tapes she left behind ?
" The next thing that we want to do is make the archive available to everyone who wants to hear it , " says David Butler .
" But also this has to be a living , breathing archive so we are going to commission new works as well .
" We hope to be able to commission works from contemporary electronic musicians and also those who worked with her - surviving members of the Radiophonic Workshop . "

Abusive , Discriminatory Punishment Undermines Education
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : hrwpress@hrw.org or media@aclu.org
DALLAS – More than 200,000 US public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 - 2007 school year , Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union said in a joint report released today .
In the 13 states that corporally punished more than 1,000 students per year , African - American girls were twice as likely to be beaten as their white counterparts .
In the 125 - page report , " A Violent Education : Corporal Punishment of Children in U.S. Public Schools , " the ACLU and Human Rights Watch found that in Texas and Mississippi children ranging in age from 3 to 19 years old are routinely physically punished for minor infractions such as chewing gum , talking back to a teacher , or violating the dress code , as well as for more serious transgressions such as fighting .
Corporal punishment , legal in 21 states , typically takes the form of " paddling , " during which an administrator or teacher hits a child repeatedly on the buttocks with a long wooden board .
The report shows that , as a result of paddling , many children are left injured , degraded , and disengaged from school .
" Every public school needs effective methods of discipline , but beating kids teaches violence and it does n't stop bad behavior , " said Alice Farmer , Aryeh Neier Fellow at Human Rights Watch and the ACLU , and author of the report .
" Corporal punishment discourages learning , fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it . "
The report found that in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent , African - American students are punished at 1.4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population , and African - American girls are 2.1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected .
There is no evidence that these students commit disciplinary infractions at disproportionate rates .
" Minority students in public schools already face barriers to success , " said Farmer .
" By exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment , schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more . "
Students with mental and physical disabilities are also punished at disproportionate rates , with potentially serious consequences for their development .
In Texas , for instance , 18.4 percent of the total number of students who were physically punished were special education students , even though they make up only 10.7 percent of the student population .
" A Violent Education " is based on four weeks of on - the - ground research in Mississippi and Texas in late 2007 and early 2008 , including more than 175 interviews with children , teachers , parents , administrators , superintendents , and school board members .
The report documents several cases in which children were beaten to the point of serious injury .
Since educators who beat children have immunity under law from assault proceedings , parents who try to pursue justice for injured children encounter resistance from police , district attorneys , and courts .
Parents also face enormous , sometimes insurmountable , obstacles in trying to prevent physical punishment of their children .
While some school districts permit parents to sign forms opting out of corporal punishment for their children , the forms are often ignored .
In the report , the ACLU and Human Rights Watch cite experts on best practices in school discipline , who emphasize traditional approaches such as detention , and modern approaches such as positive behavior support systems .
Positive behavior support systems , which are school - wide discipline systems that stress a clear structure of rewards and consequences for student behavior , have been effectively implemented in major U.S. school systems .
States and school boards that fail to implement best practices allow the status quo , or school beatings , to remain in place .
Human Rights Watch and the ACLU call upon the U.S. government to prohibit corporal punishment in all public schools and urge state governments , school boards , superintendents , and administrators to eliminate physical punishment in their schools .
Selected Witness Accounts :
" He took me into the office and gave me three licks . …
He made me hold onto the wall and he paddled me .
…
It hurt for about two hours , it felt like fire under my butt . "
– Matthew S. , who was paddled in second grade for throwing food in a school cafeteria in the Mississippi Delta .
" The other kids were watching and laughing .
It made me want to fight them …
When you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you , it make you mad and you want to do something about it . "
– Peter S. , a middle school student in the Mississippi Delta .
" What made me so angry : he 's three years old , he was petrified .
He did n't want to go back to school , and he did n't want to start his new school .
I was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him , equating going to school with being paddled . "
– Rose T. , mother of a 3 - year - old boy in Texas who was bruised from physical punishment after he refused to stop playing with his shoes in class .
" I went into the principal 's office . …
He gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair .
The paddle had holes in it .
Then he just did three swats . … I was hit on my buttocks . …
There were holes in the paddle to make it go faster .
…
It hurt very much .
There were definitely red marks and then swelling … almost welt - like markings .
It did n't last for more than a couple days .
…
It left me feeling very humiliated .
I think there were several levels of emotion .
Physical pain , mental humiliation . …
And being a female at that age , it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt .
That 's weird … even at that age I knew it was inappropriate . "
– Allison G. , a recent graduate punished as a teenager in Texas for being late to class multiple times .
" I 've heard this said at my school and at other schools : ‘ This child should get less whips , it 'll leave marks . '
Students that are dark - skinned , it takes more to let their skin be bruised .
Even with all black students , there is an imbalance : darker - skinned students get worse punishment . "
– Account of Abrea T. , former teacher in rural Mississippi .
" I see corporal punishment as a form of slavery .
Beating on the slaves was how the headman got them to do something … we 're focused so much on making kids do what we want .
Think about the mental capacity that this kind of treatment leaves our children with .
We are telling them we do n't respect them .
They leave that principal 's office and they think , ‘ they do n't consider me a human being . '
That young person loses self - respect . "
– Account from Doreen W. , school board member in a Mississippi Delta town .

( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain has chipped away at Sen. Barack Obama 's lead , with a national survey of polls showing the Democratic presumptive nominee up by just 1 percentage point in the presidential race .
Sen . John McCain has used some of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's tactics in questioning Sen. Barack Obama 's experience .
According to CNN 's average of recent national surveys , Obama is ahead of McCain 45 percent to 44 percent .
Obama 's lead in the " poll of polls , " which consists of seven surveys , is down from 3 percentage points on Wednesday and down from 8 percentage points in mid-July .
" From my perspective , Obama needs to introduce a game changer -- and fast -- before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the Oval Office , " said CNN contributor David Gergen , a former counselor to three presidents .
Read what Gergen thinks at the " Anderson Cooper 360° " blog
The poll of polls includes NBC / The Wall Street Journal ( August 15 - 18 ) , CBS / The New York Times ( August 15 - 19 ) , Zogby ( August 14 - 16 ) , Battleground ( August 10 - 14 ) , Gallup tracking ( August 17 - 19 ) , Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg ( August 15 - 18 ) and Quinnipiac ( August 12 - 17 ) .
The poll of polls does not have a sampling error .
In recent weeks , McCain has stepped up his attacks on Obama on national security issues .
Russia 's invasion of Georgia gave McCain an anvil to hammer away at Obama 's inexperience , CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said .
" The McCain campaign believes that some of Hillary Clinton 's tactics , especially questioning whether Obama is ready to lead , can be a real winner , " Schneider said .
Clinton nearly overtook Obama during the primary campaign after she started airing ads asking whom voters would rather have answering a 3 a.m. call to the White House .
" The McCain team has been very open that they went to school on the Hillary Clinton campaign , that they learned from that , " Gergen said .
Watch how McCain is borrowing moves from Clinton »
" And , on this 3 a .m. ad , what 's very striking , as some have pointed out over the last few days , is that Barack Obama was winning a steady streak of victories against Hillary Clinton , " Gergen said .
" And then she ran that ad , and she really went on the attack on the experience question .
And she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the Democratic primaries and won 500,000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him . "
When Russian troops invaded Georgia two weeks ago , McCain vigorously denounced the action and warned of consequences .
Obama 's reaction was more measured , and potential voters noticed , Schneider said .
" Which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with Russia ?
McCain by better than 2 to 1 , " Schneider said .
" More experience in military matters and foreign affairs . "
That argument may be even more effective for McCain than it was for Clinton , said political analyst Marc Halperin , a former Democratic strategist .
McCain is " going after more centrist voters , more swing voters , more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses , " Halperin said .

Clinton ultimately lost to Obama , but she showed how to hurt him .
" What the Clinton campaign demonstrated is , when you bring [ Obama ] back down to earth , it 's a better battle , " said Dan Schnur , McCain 's communications director in the 2000 campaign .
McCain also may have gotten a boost from his performance at last weekend 's faith forum , hosted by the Rev. Rick Warren .
Gergen said he thought both candidates handled themselves well but said he was particularly impressed with McCain 's performance .
" Along comes McCain , who not only has -- he does n't like to talk about his religion very much .
And then he talks about it openly .
But he has a very powerful story that 's emotionally connected to the audience , " he said .
" It 's the candidate who can connect emotionally to Middle America who will have the big advantage going down the stretch . "
But the recent downturn in the polls for Obama may not last .
The Democratic White House hopeful is headed for a week of what is likely to be overwhelmingly positive coverage as he names his running mate and officially accepts his party 's presidential nomination .
" The big question now is whether Obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the Democratic convention , " said Alan Silverleib , CNN senior political researcher .

All About John McCain • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
A lot of the problems with oil ( and healthcare for that matter ) revolve around the profit motive .
And as long as people can get / stay rich by jerking us around , there is n't much motivation to fix the problems .
There is profit to be made by prolonging the problems though and that 's where we are at now .
The old guard does n't want to lose their death grip on the money train and as long as people defend them , and more importantly - buy into the propaganda , they wo n't have to .
I got no love for either party but the only changes I 've seen from those currently in power have been negative and I 'm sure not buying into anything they say now .
I 'm going on GP here and saying if it 's coming from them - it 's complete and utter bullshit .
Because that is the expectation they have set .
Drilling is a pacifier because people want something done even if it 's not effective .
They have handed them no bid contracts and tax breaks and all these other taxpayer subsidies and it 's done nothing for us .
They sell us out to the highest bidder then turn around and call the other party " tax and spend " .
Biggest fucking deficit , both trade and actual , of all time and they still have the nerve to point fingers and call names .
Better clean up your own house first .
But that 's just my opinion .

This article is more than 12 years old
It was life as normal yesterday on Ascension Island , a barren British territorial outpost that pokes out of the Atlantic ocean 4,044 miles from Land 's End .
The 1,100 residents were largely unaware that their volcanic rock was taking centre stage at the United Nations , where British diplomats were requesting sovereignty over 77,220 sq miles of submarine territory around the island .
Yesterday 's slideshow presentation in New York before 21 members of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf ( UN CLCS ) laying claim to an area of the ocean floor roughly the size of the UK 's entire land surface is just the first of three submissions the UK is set to make under an international law that allows states to expand their jurisdiction .
A senior Foreign Office official told the Guardian yesterday that the UK has decided to submit similar territorial claims for seabed surrounding the Hatton - Rockall area , west of Scotland , and South Georgia and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic .
The reason for Britain 's interest ?
The hope of tapping into new reserves of oil , gas and minerals .
At present , countries can extract resources from the seabed up to 200 nautical miles from their shoreline .
But with permission from the UN commission , they can extend their jurisdiction over the seabed up to 350 miles beyond a coastline .
All they have to do is show that the ocean floor is a continuation of their continental shelf .
Britain 's venture is part of a global scramble for resources prompted by technological advances that make oil and gas reserves deep in the ocean more accessible .
The UN commission has set a deadline of May next year for countries to submit maps and supporting scientific evidence .
Britain 's claims will anger diplomats in Denmark and Iceland , who have overlapping claims to the mineral - rich Hatton - Rockall area , and Argentina and Chile , which contest sovereignty over the seabed around the Falkland Islands .
The decision follows a breakdown in negotiations between Danish and Icelandic lawyers and their British and Irish counterparts over the underwater shelf surrounding Rockall .
The Foreign Office official , who has detailed knowledge of Britain 's territorial claims , said that the UK government had invited Argentina for " technical and legal " discussions about the continental shelf around the Falkland Islands , but no talks had taken place since 2005 .
Agreement between neighbouring states is required if the UN commission is to award territorial rights , meaning some claims could take several decades to resolve , he said .
" Ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims .
But if it is not possible to resolve a dispute , then we will be preparing a submission [ to the UN CLCS ] anyway , as the UK . "
He added : " I can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by May 2009 . "
He added that Britain " reserves the right " to lodge submissions over the British Antarctic Territory , although it has no immediate plans to do so .
The Ascension Island claim means the UK has officially joined 11 other countries staking claims to submarine territory .
A further 30 - 40 are expected to lodge claims , including some developing countries .
Although it could take up to three years for the commission to rule on Ascension Island 's continental shelf , the Foreign Office is confident of success .
Speaking from his office overlooking a beach , Michael Hill , Ascension Island 's administrator , said that the submission to the UN could only benefit residents .
" It is clearly , having read a bit about it , a very long - term project . "
Yesterday 's delegation of legal and scientific experts , led by Doug Wilson , a legal adviser to the Foreign Office , and Lindsay Parson from the National Oceanography Centre , in Southampton , presented the commission with supporting geological and geophysical surveys .
" Ascension Island is going to be the only [ territorial claim ] that is relatively unproblematic , " said Martin Pratt , director of Durham University 's International Boundaries Research Unit .
" There could always be a scientific spanner in the works , but it 's going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the [ island 's ] continental shelf . "
The vast Hatton - Rockall basin , off the west coast of Scotland , believed to be rich in hydrocarbons and mineral deposits , is likely to prove more controversial .
It has been the subject of a seven - year wrangle between the UK , Ireland , Denmark and Iceland .
Shuttle diplomacy appears to have reached stalemate .
Recent meetings in Reykjavik , Dublin and Southampton failed to agree maritime borders .
The Danes and Icelanders are likely to stake out extensively overlapping claims .
Technological advances had raised expectations that wells could soon operate commercially , even in the storm - blasted seas around Rockall .
The government is already offering exploration blocs in the area close to the outer limit of the UK 's 200 mile economic zone .
The UN regulations do not , however , allow small islands that have never been inhabited to be the basis of claims for extending control over the surrounding seabed .
Britain 's claim on Rockall is currently based on measuring out from the island of St Kilda in the Outer Hebrides .
Rockall was Britain 's last colonial land grab , annexed by a boarding party from HMS Vidal in 1955 .
A plaque was cemented atop the desolate rocky pillar that protrudes 63 feet above the Atlantic .
The sailors sang " God Save the Queen " and gave three cheers .
The FBI says it has evidence showing that Bruce Ivins was behind the 2001 anthrax attacks — but with his death , this will not be tested in court .
A full enquiry into the case is needed if justice is to be done .
Was Bruce Ivins a scientist - gone - wrong who single - handedly orchestrated the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States ?
Or was the 62 - year - old anthrax - vaccine researcher at Fort Detrick , Maryland , an emotionally unstable innocent whose profile made him a convenient fall guy for the FBI ?
The jury is still out on those questions — or rather , it would be if one had ever had a chance to hear the evidence .
Ivins 's apparent suicide last month means there will not be a trial , which makes it all the more important that the government release the evidence it planned to use to accuse him .
In full .
Now .
“ Only full disclosure can lift suspicions that the FBI has again targeted an innocent man . ”
On 6 August , the FBI 's parent agency , the US Department of Justice , released what it described as hundreds of pages of evidence against Ivins , and declared it would close the case because it was satisfied it had its man .
But Ivins 's attorney , Paul Kemp , has described these documents as “ heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence ” .
He has a point .
For example , many of the documents are just search warrants — a reminder that , despite extensive searches of Ivins 's house and cars , the FBI failed to come up with any physical evidence directly implicating him in the attacks .
Similarly , the bureau has no evidence to place Ivins at the postboxes in Princeton , New Jersey , from which the anthrax - laden letters were sent .
The core of the case against Ivins , as released so far , is contained in just a couple of dozen pages of affidavits — only four paragraphs of which discuss what the FBI says is the smoking gun : the genetic analysis of the anthrax powder from the letters .
The FBI says it found four distinctive genetic mutations in the anthrax used in the attacks .
It tested for these mutations in isolates of the Ames anthrax strain from 16 domestic , government and university laboratories , alongside ones from labs in Canada , Sweden and the United Kingdom .
In all , more than 1,000 samples were collected , only 8 of which had the 4 mutations , according to the affidavit .
Each of these isolates , it says , was directly related to a strain batch named RMR - 1029 , which was created in 1997 and held in a flask at the US Army research facility in Fort Detrick .
The affidavits describe Ivins as the “ sole custodian ” of that batch .
Many other researchers had access to it , but the FBI claims to have eliminated them as suspects .
The genetic analysis itself seems quite solid .
The FBI has collaborated with some of the best outside scientists on anthrax , and on 18 August convened many of them to answer journalists ' questions about the science .
The researchers on the panel explained that none of the analysis techniques used in this case is new ; just the application to anthrax forensics .
Several peer - reviewed papers on the forensic work have already been published , and another dozen or so are anticipated ( see page 928 ) .
Although this openness about the techniques is commendable , neither the conclusions drawn from the scientific analysis , nor such crucial legal elements as the veracity of the provenance and handling of samples , have been tested in court .
So far only one side of the story has been heard : that of the prosecution .
Certainly Ivins 's behaviour in the crucial autumn months of 2001 raises questions about his emotional stability , but mental illness does not necessarily a murderer make .
The FBI should explain why it thinks the scientific evidence implicates Ivins himself , and not just the flask .
As Kemp aptly puts it : “ In this country , we prosecute people , not beakers . ”
The absence of such a full disclosure can only feed suspicions that the FBI has again targeted an innocent man in this case — as it did with former Fort Detrick researcher Steven Hatfill .
This case is too important to be brushed under the carpet .
The anthrax attacks killed five people , infected several others , paralysed the United States with fear and shaped the nation 's bioterrorism policy .
Science and law share a conviction that conclusions require evidence , and that the evidence be debated openly .
The FBI says it regrets that Ivins 's untimely death has denied it the chance to have its day in court .
So presumably the bureau would welcome a full congressional or independent enquiry into this case , as has been called for by Senator Chuck Grassley ( Republican , Iowa ) and several other lawmakers .
It is essential that such an enquiry takes place .

His document was examined recently as museum workers pulled artifacts out of storage and reevaluated them in preparation for a move to a new museum site at the First Bank of the United States , near Third and Chestnut Streets .
The museum is expected to open there in 2010 .
We 've known it for a long time : the web is big .
The first Google index in 1998 already had 26 million pages , and by 2000 the Google index reached the one billion mark .
Over the last eight years , we 've seen a lot of big numbers about how much content is really out there .
Recently , even our search engineers stopped in awe about just how big the web is these days -- when our systems that process links on the web to find new content hit a milestone : 1 trillion ( as in 1,000,000,000,000 ) unique URLs on the web at once !
How do we find all those pages ?
We start at a set of well - connected initial pages and follow each of their links to new pages .
Then we follow the links on those new pages to even more pages and so on , until we have a huge list of links .
In fact , we found even more than 1 trillion individual links , but not all of them lead to unique web pages .
Many pages have multiple URLs with exactly the same content or URLs that are auto - generated copies of each other .
Even after removing those exact duplicates , we saw a trillion unique URLs , and the number of individual web pages out there is growing by several billion pages per day .
So how many unique pages does the web really contain ?
We do n't know ; we do n't have time to look at them all ! :-)
Strictly speaking , the number of pages out there is infinite -- for example , web calendars may have a " next day " link , and we could follow that link forever , each time finding a " new " page .
We 're not doing that , obviously , since there would be little benefit to you .
But this example shows that the size of the web really depends on your definition of what 's a useful page , and there is no exact answer .
We do n't index every one of those trillion pages -- many of them are similar to each other , or represent auto - generated content similar to the calendar example that is n't very useful to searchers .
But we 're proud to have the most comprehensive index of any search engine , and our goal always has been to index all the world 's data .
To keep up with this volume of information , our systems have come a long way since the first set of web data Google processed to answer queries .
Back then , we did everything in batches : one workstation could compute the PageRank graph on 26 million pages in a couple of hours , and that set of pages would be used as Google 's index for a fixed period of time .
Today , Google downloads the web continuously , collecting updated page information and re-processing the entire web - link graph several times per day .
This graph of one trillion URLs is similar to a map made up of one trillion intersections .
So multiple times every day , we do the computational equivalent of fully exploring every intersection of every road in the United States .
Except it'd be a map about 50,000 times as big as the U.S. , with 50,000 times as many roads and intersections .
As you can see , our distributed infrastructure allows applications to efficiently traverse a link graph with many trillions of connections , or quickly sort petabytes of data , just to prepare to answer the most important question : your next Google search .
A Concrete Example of Why the Voting System Test Standards are All Form and No Substance ...
John Washburn Byon 7/2/2008 , 7:03 am PT
Guest blogged by John Washburn
I have been a long time critic of the federal 2002 Voting System Standards ( 2002 VSS ) and of the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines ( 2005 VVSG ) .
In fact , both sets of standards are virtually worthless .
There are two reasons for this .
First , the requirements enumerated in the standards are , in and of themselves , much too weak for something as vital as administering an election .
Second , both sets of standards have an explicit loophole that allows almost all the requirements — weak as they are — to be ignored .
This second objection was first brought to my attention two years ago by Howard Stanislevic .
We now have proof that this loophole is used by the labs in order to “ pass ” systems that do n’t meet the standards .
The proof is laid out clearly in the most recent certification test report submitted to the Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) by SysTest labs ( one of the labs accredited by the EAC and the National Institute of Standards and Technology - NIST ) .
SysTest recommended certification for the new voting system by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold ) even though the lab 's findings listed 79 specific failures to meet the standards .
As you read this article , keep in mind that the standards actually allow 77 of these 79 failures to be ignored !...
Last February , SysTest labs wrote its certification test report for a new voting system manufactured by Diebold / Premier .
The report listed the 79 problems the lab found during testing .
Even so , SysTest recommended the system be certified by the EAC .
Section 6 from the test report reads :
SysTest Labs has successfully completed the testing of Premier ’s Assure 1.2 voting system .
It has been determined that Assure 1.2 successfully met the required criteria of the Federal Election Commission Voting System Standards April 2002 .
Based on testing scope and results , as detailed in this report , it is SysTest Labs ’ recommendation that the EAC committee grant certification of Premier ’s Assure 1.2 voting system .
I sent a letter to the EAC objecting to this recommendation for certification — not because of the 77 “ acceptable ” failures , but because of the two failures that require denial of certification .
The test report reads like the problem log of election - day equipment failures maintained by VotersUnite !

Except for the last two findings on this list , there is nothing that would prevent ANY NIST - accredited test lab from recommending this system for certification by the EAC .
None of the 2002 VSS requirements violated by the first 77 findings are enforceable requirements !
Some definitions are in order .
A requirement is a declarative statement of the form " The system shall ... " or a declarative statement of the form " The system shall not ... " .
Two example requirements from the 2002 VSS are : From section 2.2.2.1a of Volume I of the 2002 VSS :
To ensure vote accuracy , all systems shall record the election contests , candidates , and issues exactly as defined by election officials ; .
From paragraph 5.7.2d of Volume I of the 2002 VSS : the telecommunications components of a voting system shall notify the user of the successful or unsuccessful completion of the data transmission .
is a declarative statement of the form or a declarative statement of the form .
Two example requirements from the 2002 VSS are :
An enforceable requirement is a requirement such that if the requirement is not met , then the system can not be certified .
There are almost no enforceable requirements in either the 2002 VSS or the 2005 VVSG .
This is because both standards have a conformance exception clause ( loophole ) which covers nearly every requirement listed in either standard .
The exemption paragraph is found in section B.5 of Appendix B of Volume II of the 2002 VSS and the 2005 VVSG .
From the 2002 VSS , paragraph B.5 reads [ emphasis mine ] :
Of note , any uncorrected deficiency that does not involve the loss or corruption of voting data shall not necessarily be cause for rejection .
Deficiencies of this type may include failure to fully achieve the levels of performance specified in Volume I , Sections 3 and 4 of the Standards , or failure to fully implement formal programs for qualify [ sic ] assurance and configuration management described in Volume I , Sections 7 and 8 .
The nature of the deficiency is described in detail sufficient to support the recommendation either to accept or to reject the system , and the recommendation is based on consideration of the probable effect the deficiency will have on safe and efficient system operation during all phases of election use .
The first 77 of the 79 uncorrected deficiencies listed above fit within the conformance exemption ( loophole ) defined in both sets of standards .
Some of these 77 violations are also violations of federal law , and yet they are allowed by the standards .
For example :
Findings 33 - 49 ( in my list above ) demonstrate that the system under test fails to conform to the accessibility requirements for blind voters and the accessibility requirement for some foreign language voters .
This means the system violates Section 301( a ) ( 3 ) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) .
See page 3 of the EAC advisory on compliance with this section of HAVA .
Non-conformance 72 involves the destruction of an election record .
The destruction of an election record used in a federal election prior to 22 months after that election is a felony under Title 42 , Chapter 20 , Subchapter II , § 1974 .
But , since none of these specific 18 non-conformances nor 59 of the remaining 61 non-conformances involve vote loss or corruption of voting data , none of them prevents the lab from recommending certification .
The last two findings involve the corruption or loss of voting data .
So , even with the loophole of paragraph B.5 , the system cannot be recommended for certification .
SysTest erred when it recommended the system for certification , but only because the voting system was so broken that even the B.5 loophole would not allow the system to be recommended for certification .
SysTest ’s report demonstrates that with the broad nature of the loophole found in paragraph B.5 , there is almost no failure that would prevent a system from being certified by the EAC , or that would have prevented qualification under the previous NASED / ITA program .
So , it should come as no surprise to anyone that we read about failure after failure , in election after election , by voting systems “ certified ” by the NASED Voting Systems Board .
The 2002 VSS and 2005 VVSG are made toothless because of the conformance exemption found in paragraph B.5 .
But , as broad and eviscerating as the loophole is , it is not a blanket exemption .
The report I examined was written by SysTest about a Premier / Diebold system .
But , the problems with the 2002 VSS and 2005 VVSG apply to systems from all vendors , not just Premier / Diebold , and they apply to all of the NIST - accredited test labs , not just SysTest .
SysTest found 79 non-conformances to the 2002 VSS , 18 of which also violate federal law .
But , because of the loophole paragraph , the system as tested , but containing only the first 77 of the 79 non-conformances , is certifiable .
The problem with the whole national certification program of the EAC is that the program is built on standards that are standards in form only , without substance .
Nearly every voting system currently in the field and used in elections since November 2006 was " certified " to the 2002 VSS under the previous NASED / ITA system .
Nearly every voting system to be sold to counties and municipalities until 2012 ( and perhaps beyond ) will be " certified " to the 2005 VVSG .
The labs are quick to state that they do not certify equipment .
The EAC is quick to point out that the testing is done by the labs and not by the EAC .
For years the voting equipment vendors have claimed that the 2002 VSS and 2005 VVSG are " comprehensive and rigorous . "
This real world application of the 2002 VSS to an actual voting system by a NIST - accredited laboratory should demonstrate how toothless and ineffective the 2002 VSS and 2005 VVSG are .
As hard as this is to believe , the EAC certification program is a substantial improvement over the qualification program administered by NASED .
With EAC certification , it is possible to find out the known deficiencies that are present in the system used to administer your election .
How many known deficiencies are lurking within the equipment certified by NASED and currently used in an election near you ?
You are not allowed to know !
Neither are your local election officials .
Certification test reports , listing the deficiencies of the systems certified by NASED , will never be published .
This is because the reports are considered trade secrets by the vendors .
The reports are also considered trade secrets by the ITA testing labs that tested the systems .
Most importantly , the reports are also considered trade secrets by the chairman and every member of the NASED Voting Systems Board .
This means that systems with known deficiencies certified by NASED were sold to unsuspecting counties and municipalities .
With the old NASED / ITA program , these local election officials were left in the dark and never had the opportunity to learn of known deficiencies before they used the voting systems in elections .
Instead , they get to learn of the deficiencies as the systems fail during the administration of real elections in the real world .
At least , under the EAC certification system , local election officials have a chance to learn how their voting systems will fail before they use the voting system to administer a real election .
This is how the certification process has “ improved ” under the EAC .
Is this sufficient improvement ?
Certainly not .
Listing the known deficiencies in obscure , technical reports on a government website has some small benefit .
Better still , do n’t certify systems that violate the standards .
Under the standards though , the NIST - accredited labs can recommend certification and the EAC can certify systems which violate most of the requirements of the standards .
In my opinion the EAC should not certify such systems nor should the NIST - accredited labs make such a recommendation .
But , the standards as written and enforced almost never prohibit certification of a voting system .
The central problem is that both standards ( the 2002 VSS and the 2005 VVSG ) allow lax and probably uneven enforcement of nearly all of the system requirements listed in the standards .
This is because the loophole created by paragraph B.5 is nearly without limitation , moreover , paragraph B.5 provides no meaningful guidelines on when to enforce and when not to enforce a system requirement found in the standard .
It is possible the same problem may be found in two different systems and one system is certified and the other is not .
Until this core loophole in paragraph B.5 is closed :
The standards do not prohibit the NIST - accredited labs from recommending the certification of a system that violates virtually any combination of requirements listed in the standards .
The standards do not prohibit the EAC from certifying a system that violates virtually any combination of requirements listed in the standards .
As long as a voting system does not lose or corrupt vote totals , the voting system can violate any or all other requirements listed in the standards and still be certifiable .
This is why the “ standards ” ( 2002 VSS and 2005 VVSG ) used to test and certify voting systems are all form and no substance and will be without substance for the next several years .

In a recent column , Paul Krugman tries to explain the " Bush bust . "
Instead of clear , cogent economic theory , we are fed a mass of contradictory ideas , a bit of political partisanship , and explanations that simply make no sense .
When one attempts to apply economic theory in order to explain certain events , one is reminded of Carl Menger 's dictum : " All things are subject to the law of cause and effect .
This great principle knows no exception , and we would search in vain in the realm of experience for an example to the contrary . "
Austrian economists hold that there are certain principles which can be understood and which are based upon immutable laws of human action .
Unfortunately , in Krugman 's world , events happen with no real explanation .
For example , he writes ,
One of the underemphasized keys to the Clinton boom , I 'd argue , was the way the cost disease of health care went into remission between 1993 and 2000 .
For a while , the spread of managed care put a lid on premiums , encouraging companies to expand their work forces .
But premiums surged again after 2000 , imposing huge new burdens on business .
It 's a good bet that this played an important role in weak job creation .
Why did they surge , and how would lower health - care costs help create a boom ?
Those are questions that demand answers .
First , and most important , the boom of the Clinton years was centered in the stock market , yet health insurance premiums operate across the board .
Furthermore , while the increase might have been slower during that time , nonetheless those costs did rise .
Second , a slower rise in health - insurance premiums automatically leading to a boom in the stock market is a non sequitur — or at least Krugman does not connect the dots .
Another cause of the present downturn , Krugman notes , has been soaring prices .
He writes ,
What about raw materials prices ?
During the Clinton years basic commodities stayed cheap by historical standards .
Since then , however , food and energy prices have exploded , directly lopping about 5 percent off the typical American family 's real income , and raising business costs throughout the economy .
Why has this happened ?
According to Krugman , it is because Congress did not give President Bill Clinton enough power :
Much of this pain could have been avoided .
If Bill Clinton 's attempt to reform health care had succeeded , the U.S. economy would be in much better shape today .
But the attempt failed — and let 's remember why .
Yes , the Clinton administration botched the politics .
But it was Republicans in Congress who blocked reform , as Newt Gingrich pursued a strategy of " coagulation " designed to " clot everyone away " from Mr. Clinton .
As for high food and fuel prices , they 're mainly the result of growing demand from China and other emerging economies .
But oil prices would n't be as high as they are , and the United States would have been much less vulnerable to the current price spike , if we had taken steps in the past to limit our oil consumption .
Again , we are given the non sequitur .
How do we know that Clinton 's " reform " would have lowered medical costs ?
The imposition of Medicare more than 40 years ago was the turning point in driving up medical - care costs .
How would this " reform " have resulted in lower real costs to the economy ?
Krugman does not say how , other than to tell us that those Big Bad Republicans want medical care to cost a lot of money .
In dealing with food prices , one has to wonder if food imports to China and elsewhere have skyrocketed or if caloric intake in Asia is growing .
In other words , we are supposed to believe that because the Chinese economy has been growing , the rank - and - file Chinese have been pigging out .
What kind of " steps " would have limited oil consumption ?
Mandatory rationing ?
Forcing everyone to purchase high - mileage vehicles ?
Assume that the government had done these things .
It is unclear what opportunity costs would have been imposed by measures that would have made transportation of goods and people more difficult to attain , but one can surmise that such heavy - handed regulations would have made us poorer — and much less free .
Furthermore , I do not know how further restrictions on the oil industry — which I am sure Krugman has in mind — would have lowered oil prices and made Americans less vulnerable to price spikes in petroleum .
Again , we are dealing with claims that do not pass Menger 's standards of cause and effect .
Oil is bought and sold in markets that span the world .
The only way to separate the effects of world prices and US prices is to set up trade barriers and trade the US - produced commodity in separate markets .
That is already done with sugar , where US growers are " protected " from lower - priced sugar grown elsewhere ; the price of US sugar is , on average , about three times the world price .
So , if Krugman believes that a similar program would lower oil prices , perhaps he needs to review the price - theory class he took at MIT .
If there is a cause - and - effect pattern in this article , it is based solely upon who occupies the White House , according to Krugman .
Now , one might expect such talk from the heads of the two main political parties , but a Princeton economist is supposed to operate by higher standards than what prevail in pure , partisan politics .
Can we blame Bush for what is happening and still be intellectually honest ?
Yes , but one must understand cause - and - effect in economic analysis if one wishes to affix blame that has more explanatory power than " Bush is a Republican and Clinton is a Democrat . "
To understand the current about - to - bust , however , we must look back eight years at the end of the Clinton term .
Despite Krugman 's partisan rants , it was clear that the Federal Reserve System had actively pumped up stock values , leading to a dangerous bubble that finally broke toward the end of 2000 .
By the time Bush took office in January 2001 , the NASDAQ was on its way to losing half of its value , and the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices were in freefall as well .
No doubt , the Bush administration would have loved to try to pump up the markets , but by then it was clear that stock prices had been way out of kilter in relation to fundamentals , and the markets were not going to heed the word of a president or anyone else .
Thus , the administration turned toward the moribund housing market .
Following the 9/11 attacks , the Fed lowered interest rates to near one percent and began to push housing .
Accompanying the Fed 's push was the " ownership society " mantra that came from the White House and the Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute , which put a " free enterprise " cover over what was essentially financial socialism .
Not only did we have the Fed forcing down interest rates to below their " natural " levels , but the government and its quasi - government corporations , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aggressively hawked their mortgage securities , with the implicit agreement that the government ( read that , " taxpayers " ) would " guarantee " those securities in case they lost value .
They lost value anyway .
While Krugman has recognized the bubble and , indeed , recognized it before most other commentators ( except the Austrians , of course ) , his explanation for it is steeped in partisan politics and just plain faulty analysis .
The bubble occurred , he claims , because Ronald Reagan mesmerized the country into " believing in free markets , " which led to less regulation , which ultimately led to the financial bubbles .
The solution ?
Re-regulate everything .
One hates to break it to this perennial candidate for the Nobel Prize , but the problem is not " unregulated free markets . "
For one , financial markets are heavily regulated by government .
Second , the real problem has been the belief that government can act as the backstop for every financial failure .
In fact , the various guarantees , bailouts , loans , and the other measures taken by the government to prop up failing markets have served not only to lengthen the coming recession , but also to block the recovery .
One cannot simultaneously have free and wide - open financial markets and government guarantees to back failures , which economists recognize as a moral hazard .
The government 's idea ( and too many people are buying into this nonsense ) is that if it can prop up the failing markets ( like housing ) and every brokerage house and fund that was fueled by mortgage securities , then somehow , the crisis will pass and the economy will recover .
Those holding to Austrian theory , however , know better .
First , and most important , there is a reason the housing market has tanked ; the boom was not sustainable .
People with middle - income jobs could not reach into their pockets and continue to make payments for houses that had sold at multimillionaire prices .
The malinvestments ( a distinctive Austrian term ) were too massive and the economic fundamentals ( there is that word again ) simply did not match the go - go housing market .
Second , to prop up the unhealthy , malinvested markets , governments must cannibalize the healthy markets in order to find the needed cash to transfer the wealth .
Thus , over time , not only do sick markets fail to recover , but formerly healthy ones also fall into trouble , which is exactly what happened from 1930 – 1933 .
Thus , we move into that territory where Krugman fails to tread : inflation .
The Fed has attempted to perform its so - called " bailout magic " by monetary creation , known to the ancients as inflation , which is defined not by rising commodity prices per se , but rather by the unwarranted creation of new money .
Ultimately , why are oil prices rising madly ?
Certainly , there are supply fundamentals that play a role , but the quick decline of the dollar is mostly to blame .
The tipoff has been the subsequent rise of all other commodities , which generally tends to happen in the last stages of inflation .
( The earlier stages tend to be concentrated in specific financial markets before moving to commodities and consumer goods , as we are seeing now . )
Krugman , to his credit , has opposed the Iraq war from the beginning , but he also believes that it has been a boon to the economy .
( All true Keynesians believe war is good for the economy , although they believe that " massive public works " are even better . )
Austrians , however , recognize that the huge federal budget deficits are largely caused by the war and are financed with government paper that will surely lose large amounts of its value soon enough .
( At least the Clinton administration was able to target the stock market , so the wave of sales also meant a spike in capital - gains - tax revenues , which played a major role in balancing the federal budget .
Housing sales , however , do not provide the same high - tax returns , which meant that while there was a huge amount of financial activity , the tax proceeds from this bubble were not as high as they were during the Clinton bubble . )
Perhaps Krugman needs to review the price - theory class he took at MIT .
All of these things place huge pressure on the dollar , and the poor currency has crumbled .
Again , Bush has not made a single public statement that has corresponded with the reality of the markets .
Instead , he has offered bailouts and other schemes that will only prolong the financial agony .
All of these things place huge pressure on the dollar , and the poor currency has crumbled .
Again , Bush has not made a single public statement that has corresponded with the reality of the markets .

So , can we blame Bush for what is currently happening and what will surely happen in the next year ?
Absolutely , and we can do it with great relish and authority .
Nonetheless , if we are going to criticize this president , one hopes that we do not fall to the Big Lie that George W. Bush believed in those free markets that utterly failed him and the country .
Krugman seems to have done so , and judging from what we hear from Congress and the media , it seems that the loudest voices in this crisis are also the voices that are just plain wrong .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday August 13 2008
To clarify the article below , the one in five proportion was of cases in which paternity was resolved through DNA testing in 2007 - 08 ; fathers were wrongly identified in 0.2 % of overall cases processed by the CSA during that period , or one in 500 .
Our headline should have said ' One in 500 fathers wrongly identified by mothers in Child Support Agency claims ' .
· This article was further amended on Wednesday September 10 2008 .
We have now amended the headline in line with the above clarification .
Nearly one in five paternity claims handled by the Child Support Agency end up showing the mother has deliberately or inadvertently misidentified the father , figures show .
Since DNA paternity testing figures began to be collected in 1998 - 99 , 4,854 paternity claims have turned out to be false after DNA testing .
Under child support legislation it is a criminal offence to make a false statement or representation , and to provide false documents or information .
However , according to the CSA , there has not been a single prosecution of a woman for making a false claim .
The figures showing the number of false paternity claims have been compiled using freedom of information legislation .
The latest figures for 2007 - 08 show that out of 3,474 tests ordered , 661 or 19 % named the wrong man .
The figure is a record for the CSA since central figures started to be collated nationally .
The negative results for tests taken in 2004 - 05 were 10.6 % , in 2005 - 06 were 16.4 % , and 13.6 % in 2006 - 07 .
Government - approved paternity tests , based on samples in multiple parts of the body , are deemed to be 99.99 % accurate .
The CSA does not have figures for whether any women have named the wrong father on more than one occasion .
They also appear to have no information as to why women named the wrong father .
CSA rules state that if the DNA test establishes that the named father is the actual father , then he must pay for the cost of the test .
If the DNA establishes he is not the father then the taxpayer pays , so there is no consquence for the mother in making a false claim .
The government has spent £ 9.37 m on paternity tests since 1998 .
This includes refunds for DNA tests privately funded .
Under CSA rules , men must pay maintenance the moment they are named as the father of the child .
They can challenge the ruling by asking for a DNA test but have to pay for it themselves .
Chris Grayling , Conservative spokesman for work and pensions , said yesterday : " This is an extremely worrying trend and one where proper action should be taken .
If some CSA claimants are getting away with making false applications , it will not only slow things down for other families , but it also sends the wrong message about the things we 're willing to accept . "
The revelations came as CSA figures this week showed the much - criticised and reformed agency has been unable to collect £ 3.8 bn in outstanding money owed by non-resident parents to parents who care for the child .
The figure represents an increase of £ 120 m on last year .
Around £ 2.2bn of the debt is " probably uncollectable " , and the overall figure is rising by £ 10 m a month , the statistics showed .
But the CSA said the latest performance figures showed 768,000 children were benefiting from maintenance payments - an extra 65,000 over the previous year and an increase of 207,000 since March 2005 , before the agency 's improvement plan was launched .
Of the £ 1.05 bn benefiting children - an increase of £ 252 m since March 2005 - a total of £ 137.6 m collected was arrears .
Both figures represent the highest level of money ever collected or arranged in a 12 - month period .
At the same time , research by Grayling shows that more than 6,200 non-resident parents registered with the CSA are living abroad , but only 25 % of them are paying any child maintenance .
Of the cases abroad 5,000 owe a total debt of more than £ 26 m , an average of more than £ 5,000 each .
There are 121,000 uncleared applications to the CSA .
The agency now costs more than £ 500 m a year to run , more than double the cost in 1997 .
It cost £ 563 m in 2007/08 compared with £ 520 m last year and £ 226 m in 1997 - 98 .
DNA testing
Paternity tests are relatively simple .
In the past , blood samples were tested , but most now involve using a swab to take samples of cells from inside the cheek .
The mother , child and assumed father must all take the test and the same type of test , whether blood samples or cheek cells .
After examining the individual genetic markers in DNA , scientists can give an answer that is more than 99 % accurate .
Paternity tests are not available on the NHS .
The tests , for mother , child and assumed father , usually costs £ 257.58 , according to the NHS Direct website .

I can't tell you how we got ahold of a first - generation iPhone loaded with version 2.0 of the iPhone operating system .
What I can tell you is that if I do reveal this information , homicidal ninjas will come to my house and kill my family .
Nevertheless , we do have one – and we were able to take a look inside and find a few minute yet interesting changes .
Here 's a preview of some of the ways in which iPhone 2.0 differs from iPhone 1.0 .
i Phone 2.0 , of course , is the operating system that will come preinstalled on iPhone 3G models when those start shipping on Friday , July 11 .
i Phone 2.0 will also be available as a free software upgrade to people who have first - generation iPhones .
In the photo of the iPhone home screen , above , you 'll notice at least two differences from the first - generation OS : there 's a new Contacts application ( on the old phone , contacts were accessible only via the " Phone " icon ) , and the long - awaited App Store is there ( that 's where you 'll buy new iPhone - native software and games ) .
And now , to the details .
Photo Geotagging
We noticed the camera gave us this message as soon as we snapped a picture .
The fact that the camera wants to know your position is a clear indication that it would like to add geographic metadata to your photos , using GPS ( on iPhone 3G ) and WiFi / cell - tower triangulation ( on all iPhones ) to figure out where in the world you are and encode that into your pictures .
Location Services
Also new in the settings section is the ability to switch location - based services on and off .
If you 're paranoid about your new iPhone applications snooping on your location and reporting that data to some secret data center in the sky , this would be the switch you 'd want to set to " off . "
Contacts Search
The Contacts application now features a long - awaited search function .
No more scrolling through endless menus :
You can just type the first few letters of a name and the list narrows down to matching entries as you enter each letter .
The search applies to fields that are n't visible , too , so you can search on company names , for instance .
Here , we entered the search term " Wired " and Chris Anderson , the magazine 's editor in chief , popped up in the search results .
Amy Winehouse popped up when we typed in " trainwreck . "
Push E - Mail
One way in which the first - generation iPhone has failed to measure up to the demands of Crackberry - using , " always on " info - junkies is that it lacks " push " e-mail .
No more : Now , in addition to having the iPhone check for e-mail every 15 , 30 or 60 minutes ( as you can do with the current model ) , iPhone 2.0 also supports push e-mail .
That means messages will be delivered to your phone as soon as they 're received by the mail server .
If you want to set an annoying " you 've got mail ! " chime to ring every time a message comes in , that setting is still under Sounds .

In May 2007 , Bill Gates revealed that his company had sold 40 million Windows Vista licenses .
During his final keynote in January 2008 , Gates announced that Vista sales had crossed the 100 million threshold .
In April 2008 , the company revealed that Windows Vista had sold over 140 million copies .
Three months on , in its fourth quarter earnings report , Microsoft is claiming that another 40 million licenses have been sold ( the increase is probably due to the release of SP1 ) :
Revenue growth was primarily driven by continued customer demand for all products , including Windows Vista , which has sold over 180 million licenses since launch , the 2007 Microsoft Office system , server software , and Xbox 360 consoles and games .
The 180 million number came along with the company 's announcement that it had hit an annual revenue mark of $ 60 billion .
Vista has been available for over 18 months , so an average of 10 million licenses sold per month is quite impressive .
Microsoft is , however , counting sales and not users ; some customers have decided to downgrade from Vista back to XP ( they can upgrade to Vista as they please ) but these are still counted in the sales numbers .
Estimates state that it took 51 months for Windows XP to reach 400 million users , but neither XP numbers nor Vista numbers take into consideration the millions of copies of Windows that are pirated .
Microsoft rarely gives out sales numbers , but Vista is another story .
Due to bad press , the company apparently wants to remind everyone that Vista is still selling well .
The software giant recently announced that it would be putting resources into launching a marketing campaign that will fight back against Apple 's ads and incorrect Vista assumptions and will instead tell the " real Vista story . "

Oil prices have been climbing rapidly in the past few years , and especially in recent months .
Some point to speculation , others suggest that the fundamentals justify high prices .
In 2006 I wrote a couple of posts here about how you could predict the future of oil prices .
Unfortunately , reality did not align with theory , and my predictions were not accurate .
Here is another approach to the problem which aims to look at the fundamentals and determine what is the rational market price for oil .
The starting point is Harold Hotelling ’s 1931 model of the economics of nonrenewable resources .
Hotelling showed that , based on very simple and general assumptions , nonrenewable resources like oil should follow a predictable price path .
The price should increase gradually , year after year , with the rate of increase equal to prevailing interest rates .
This price increase is likely to suppress demand and lead to gradually reduced production levels .
So we see prices go up , demand and production go down , until the nonrenewable resource is exhausted and completely consumed .
Here ’s a figure stolen from a website which stole it from somewhere else :
This is a rather complex diagram .
The upper right quadrant depicts price on the vertical axis rising exponentially as time moves to the right .
Then the upper left quadrant is a simple demand model which shows demand level on the horizontal axis decreasing as price rices on the vertical axis .
We then move to the lower left quadrant which shows production level ( which equals demand level , in equilibrium ) on the horizontal axis decreasing as time on the vertical axis moves downward .
A couple of interesting points are , first , that prices become much higher than the costs to produce the resource , the opposite situation from competitive markets in other kinds of commodities .
Yet resource owners restrain production without the need for a cartel or any coordination .
They are motivated solely by their own individual profits .
And further , this production schedule actually maximizes the net value to society of the renewable resource .
An enlightened dictator would impose a decreasing production schedule in exactly the same form that Hotelling showed happens automatically in a free market .
However one of the most surprising aspects is that despite its generality and seeming soundness , the Hotelling model has universally failed to accurately predict the behavior of markets in nonrenewable resources .
Oil has been produced for over a century , and rather than a gradual and predictable increase in price , its price was generally stable for most of the 20th century , with various ups and downs .
Then in the past few years and months its price has shot up far faster than the rate that Hotelling would predict , the rate of interest :
One possible explanation of this long - term failure is that in the past , oil was treated more like a renewable resource ; new oil was reliably being discovered , as quickly as it was being consumed .
However this has stopped being true for twenty years now , and we are finally seeing a realization that oil is very much a finite resource .
It is possible that we may be witnessing a transition to an era where the Hotelling model dominates .
In that case , the current rapid price increase can be interpreted as a transition from a renewable - resource price to a nonrenewable - resource price .
Where , then , will this price transition end up ?
Although the Hotelling prediction of the yearly change in prices is robust and simple , deriving an initial price level from his model is quite difficult and uncertain .
The basic idea is to postulate a so - called “ backstop ” price for the commodity , the price at which there is an adequate substitute , where demand for the commodity will drop to zero .
Then the initial price level should be such that as the price rises gradually , at the rate of interest , and demand drops due to the price increase , we reach the backstop price at exactly the same time that we run out of the commodity ; in the case of oil , as the last economically recoverable drop of oil is coming out of the ground .
I ’ll illustrate with a sample scenario , but it will be clear that many alternative assumptions are possible .
Let us assume that oil uses can be replaced , in the fullness of time , by solar - powered electricity .
A barrel of oil has 5,800,000 BTUs of energy , which is equivalent to 1700 kiloWatt - hours .
Presently , solar electricity is available for about $ 0.30 per kWh in favorable locations such as the American southwestern deserts .
However the effective price will be higher in less sunny locales ; for example , in Germany the price is $ 0.50 per kWh .
Depending on distribution scenarios , solar electricity may have to be produced relatively locally , meaning less favorable conditions , so we will adopt the higher figure as a starting point .
Today , then , we could replace oil for 1700 * $ 0.50 = $ 850 per barrel using solar energy , if we had the infrastructure in place to run transportation on batteries and replace other uses of oil .
Solar electricity is likely to fall in price due to technological improvements , although demand increases may moderate that fall .
Installed solar prices have not decreased for the past 5 years , for example , as demand increases have more than kept up with production improvements due to economies of scale and improved technology .
As far as the Hotelling price increase , the rate of interest in constant dollar terms is generally quoted as being in the 3 - 5 % range .
Let us use a value of 4 % , which implies a doubling time of 18 years .
We will see oil rice gradually in price , as solar electricity gradually falls , and when they meet , we will stop using oil .
All that time we are converting our infrastructure to rely on electricity rather than oil .
At the point where the prices meet , we should have used up our oil .
So how much oil is there ?
This is also an area of controversy , largely due to assumptions about how much more oil will become economically recoverable because of higher prices , and also the possibility of future oil discoveries in relatively unexplored areas such as the arctic sea floor .
My personal opinion is that the more pessimistic estimates are more likely to come true , for two reasons .
In the first place , the rate of new discoveries over the past 10 - 15 years seems lower than would have been predicted .
Second , many of the estimates of economically recoverable oil make an obvious mistake , in that they do not take into consideration the increase in expenses due to higher energy costs , when estimating what price would allow producing certain resources .
Therefore , for this rough estimate I will adopt a more pessimistic scenario , corresponding to the USGS 95 % - likelihood low bound .
This graph from the US EIA illustrates a number of possibilities :
The blue lines represent the most pessimistic scenario , an ultimate recovery of 2.2 trilliion barrels .
The green lines reflect various demand scenarios .
These are uninformed by the Hotelling model , so I would use the horizontal green line to approximate demand which is suppressed by constantly rising prices , until we are almost out of oil , at which time a blue line falls from this horizontal green line to zero .
This zero point is only approached asymptotically in this graph , but a ballpark figure for substantially reduced production levels would be the decade of the 2060s , a bit more than 50 years in the future .
Going back to our oil price doubling time of 18 years , this is about 3 doublings , implying a price change from today to the endpoint by a factor of 8 .
With today ’s backstop solar price of $ 850 to replace the energy in a barrel of oil , this corresponds to $ 106 per barrel as an estimate of what today ’s oil price should be .
To the extent that solar electricity falls in price over the next 50 years , the backstop price will be lower .
If it falls by a factor of 2 , the Hotelling oil price today would be only about $ 50 .
These considerations suggest that the recent oil price of about $ 130 / barrel is unsustainable in the medium term ( over the next few years ) .
If we maintained this price , oil demand would be over - suppressed , too much effort would be devoted to conversion to solar and other alternatives , and we would find ourselves in a position where we could stop using oil long before we needed to .
This would hurt oil producers in the long run , as they would find demand dropping for their product while they still had plenty of easily recoverable oil available .
Worse , our resources in this critical time would be mis-allocated and the net wealth available to future generations would be reduced .
However it ’s also worth noting that we were at an arguably reasonable price level only a few months ago .
The recent price spike may turn out to be a short - term bubble and we might well see a return to prices in the $ 50 - 100 range within the next year or two .
That would put us at a sustainable price level that would allow for steady price increases , doubling every 18 years or so , as alternatives ramp up and are ready to fully replace oil in about 50 years , just as we run out .
It will be interesting to see how closely actual events approximate this theoretical scenario .

In a close encounter with the future of transportation , a police helicopter almost hit what its crew insists was an alien spacecraft .
And then they chased it .
Seriously .
At least , that 's what Britain 's Telegraph newspaper reports .
According to the story , a three - member police team was on its way back to a defense base near Cardiff , Wales , when the pilot spotted a " flying saucer - shaped " vehicle hurtling toward them from below .
The helicopter swerved sharply to avoid getting nailed , and then gave chase , making it as far as the British Bristol Channelbefore running low on gas and turning back .
The South Wales police admit that the report is legit .
" We can confirm the Air Support Unit sighted an unusual aircraft , " a spokesperson said .
" This was reported to the relevant authorities for their investigation . "
The story comes just weeks after the British Defense Ministry released 30 years of " official reports " involving UFO sightings .
Among them : a helicopter crew that tracked two unidentified flying objects on their radar for over 40 miles , and a 1984 incident where three experienced air traffic controllers tried to " talk in " a UFO that landed on one of their runways .
The Ministry will release another 150 UFO - related files over the next four years .
*
UFOData Magazine * has filed a freedom of information request with the British government in order to learn more about the Cardiff incident , and has asked its readers to anonymously report any information they might have about the sighting .
Run into any UFO 's lately ?

This post is by Sheryl Canter , an online writer and editorial manager at Environmental Defense Fund .
Last week we sent an email to our action network asking how people were coping with high oil prices .
The response on our sister blog , the Green Room , was enthusiastic — over 600 comments !
Here are some of our favorites , organized by topic :
Strategies to Increase Gas Mileage
From Ann :
I ’ve been driving 60 mph on the highway and have seen a dramatic improvement in my gas mileage .
I ’m getting 38 - 40 mpg in my Toyota Camry on the highway !
Drive 60 when you go .
From Mike Frisch :
I have dropped my fuel use by 70 - 80 % 1 ) I bicycle two days per week ( 25 mile round trip ) – great exercise & fun .
2 ) I purchased an electric bike / scooter ( Ego cycle 2 LX , cost $ 1700 ) and I use it two days per week – costs 10 cents to charge it – great fun .
3 ) On the days I have to use my car , I carpool , and I drive 60 mph or less to save fuel .
Editor ’s Note :
For others thinking of trying scooters , be sure to do it safely .
Motorcycle and scooter accidents are on the rise due to inexperienced converts .
Alternative Fuels to Power Cars
From Charlton Jones :
In April I completed the conversion of an older car to all electric .
I have been driving for less than 5 cents a mile since .
I used lead acid batteries and components off the shelf .
I did n’t invent anything .
I can drive on the freeways and have 150 mile range .
It ’s surprising that the car manufacturers can’t do as well .
GM had the lead in electric cars in 1996 with the EV - 1 , but then they crushed them all .
( If GM had been in change in 1492 , Columbus would still be in port . )
I enjoy my electric car , but I also ride a bicycle for short trips .
It ’s a shame more people do n’t realize how smoothly a bicycle fits into traffic at very low cost in fuel , pollution and congestion .
Bicycles and electric cars can solve the current oil fiasco .
Editor ’s Note :
Is there a business opportunity here ?
Another commenter , Bobby J. , asks if Charlton would be willing to make one for him !
From Tom Smith :
My dad has always shown an interest in renewable energy .
Now he is involved in a project that I find very appealing .
Instead of using commodities like corn to make biofuel , his project involves algae .
The algae requires CO2 and our nation ’s power plants are under pressure to reduce CO2 emmisions .
If biofuel production plants are constructed next to power plants and other sources of CO2 , we can turn the CO2 emissions into a positive by consuming it to grow algae for renewable energy production .
Editor ’s Note : Contrary to what abinkow says in his comment , algae is indeed a very promising source of fuel .
Electricity from Human Movement
From Abe Velez :
We of course need to find more ways of capturing and re-purposing sustainable energy , and here ’s one that I think should happen : the fitness industry in the U.S. is bigger than ever , but right now we ’re powering our treadmills by burning energy ( mostly non-sustainable electricity from coal etc. ) in order to then burn our bodies ’ own energy ( calories ) .
This does n’t make sense .
How can we close the loop and use all this chocolate cake - fueled energy of ours to power our fitness equipment ?
Editor ’s Note :
This is happening !
See our post on electricity from human movement .
From haikuza :
Has anyone heard of Trevor Field ’s Play Pumps , or Raj Pandian ’s Swing Generators ?
It ’s the coolest thing .
Inventions use playground equipment & all that natural kid energy to pump water and generate electricity .
We could get our kids off Ritalin & harness the power !
Ca n’t find a proper link to Pandian ’s work , but you can google him .
Editor ’s Note : Apparently both were invented by Raj Pandian .
He invented a swing , a seesaw , and a merry - go - round that generate electricity ( see the links I added ) .
Cool stuff !
For more examples of human power conversion , check out our story on electricity from human movement .
Ways to Encourage Solar Power
From Pavel Ivanov :
I want make solar power available in my home and I am looking to buy a house .
The problem is the architecture of the city is such that the houses are street oriented ( facing the street ) and not solar oriented ( the main slope of the roof facing south ) .
I would prefer to have a lot of south windows and definitely not west windows .
With the south windows the sun can warm the room during the winter but not during the summer – east and west windows work in the opposite way .
From halhurst :
In Idaho there is a prototype generating technology project called the solar road , which produces solar power from a paved driving surface .
Considering the vast area , both public and private , which is already paved , this is an idea which bears looking into .
Editor ’s Note : Interesting !
I found some articles on solar roads on Treehugger and Renewable Energy World .
Obstacles to Saving Energy at Home
From fugue137 :
The increasing rate of renters vs. homeowners presents another interesting conundrum : few landlords will upgrade the energy efficiency of their rental properties , preferring to force the energy costs onto their tenants .
Of course , energy efficiency of a house depends both on equipment and on usage patterns , so I propose a federal law mandating that landlords and tenants must split utility bills 50 - 50 .
Um , except that it ’s unconstitutional .
But nobody really reads that thing anymore anyway , and this law would surely do some good .
From Marilyn :
To use less energy , we should be able to hang our laundry out on clotheslines .
But many Homeowner Associations ( HOAs ) across the country have restrictions against their use .
Pressure should be placed on HOAs and state legislatures to rescind this regulation .
It is just common sense to dry laundry using solar energy and not use the electric or gas dryer .
We Need Improved Public Transit !
From Mark Farmer :
Do away with toll roads and instead pay for the repair of bridges and highways with increased gasoline taxes !!
This past Saturday I and thousands of other motorists on the Mass .
Turnpike spent nearly one hour to go less than ten miles just to get through the limiting toll booth at exit 9 .
There was no accident , just a back up from the toll plaza .
There must be millions of gallons of fuel wasted at toll booths and millions of man hours lost at these uneeded bottle necks .
Editor ’s Note : Believe it or not , many states do not allow motorist user fees like tolls to be used for public transit !
A pending bill in the House would change this .
From Carolyn Moore :
[ Build Better ] Public Transit – Yeh !
I wanted to use it to get to my last job which was a 20 minute drive from home .
Turns out it would take 2 hours with one transfer plus a mile walk at beginning , middle and end , and if one did n’t make the transfer in time , add another hour .
No one has 4 to 6 hours a day to commute when 40 minutes will do it .
Then I wanted to make a trip from Phoenix , AZ to Portland , OR ( 2 major cities ) by train .
This is the route : Bus to Flagstaff , train to LA , switch to a train to Stockton , bus to Sacramento , train to Portland , and better part of 3 days .
Insane !
From Andrew :
I saw on the local news here in the Chicago area how Amtrak had SOLD OUT tickets for seats aboard their trains this weekend .
When was the last time any of you heard that on the news ???
I think it ’s awesome .
Proof positive that when faced with hardships , people WILL explore alternatives .
We can whip the oil problem , America !
Taking the first step is often the most difficult part of it all .
Once done however , the rest comes with relative ease .
That said , SUPPORT AMTRAK !
Give us MORE TRAINS !
From Jeannine Mead :
I believe public transportation is of vital importance … not only in cities , but between cities , small and large .
Amtrak should be upgraded in all parts of the country and have regular schedules starting in early morning and run until at late in the evening .
I live 40 miles from a large city and trying to get into it for anything is impossible with the traffic .
We are not commuters , but we do enjoy going into our large city for concerts and other activities although town has turned into a commuter town and this is happening all over the country .
Innovative Ways to Get to Work
From Linus :
I work in a remote location about 30 minutes outside a moderate - sized rural town .
To save money and the environment , my coworkers and I changed our schedules to 9 - hour days and convinced our employer to let us use a company vehicle ( a hybrid Escape , no less ) to make the commute .
We buy punch cards to keep track of payment and have a set departure time and scheduled drivers , so we do n’t have the headaches typical of standard carpools .
Five people in a car getting over 30 mpg is a big improvement !
From Lisa Petrie :
I approached the Supt. of Schools in my district a couple of years ago , and asked if teachers could ride the local school bus instead of driving our own cars .
He loved the idea !
I had to carry my school photo ID so that the bus drivers recognized me , but that ’s easy enough .
My schedule this past year prevented me from riding , but I plan to work around that this year .
Kids in my school call the bus the “ loser cruiser ” .
But when they see adults taking the bus , by choice , perhaps this could be a first positive lesson in mass transport for them … ?
Honestly , I ’ve had great conversations with high school kids on the short ride to school .
Nice .
From Joe Thurston :
I am a systems programmer at a large insurance company .
I could easily do my job at home .
Give employers incentives to re-think the need to have a body on site .
Virtually everyone in my organization could work at home 2 days a week – think of all the commuter miles that would be saved !
The biggest stumbling block is an old - fashioned attitude among management – they need to have a reason to think differently .
Make Cities More Bike - Friendly
From Michael Mullowney :
In areas where public transportation is not an option , people ought to consider biking as a more realistic option and great way to exercise .
In the long run , employers could help here by providing locker rooms so an employee could clean up after a potentially sweaty commute .
From Mary :
Make bicycling safer .
There are a few bike lanes and they are not enforced .
I see cars in them all the time .
People here have been killed by motorists .
There are alot of people who get angry because we want bike lanes .
I am fortunate enough to live in a neighborhood where alot of my errands can be run locally .
The places are too far for me to walk to due to my disability but I can easily make these trips on a bike .
Unfortunately , bicycling is hazardous and I have a baby and do n’t care to put our lives in danger doing so .
From Brian :
Change public transit vehicles to accommodate all bicycles .
Some , such as the older trolley cars in San Diego , make it difficult to load your bicycle .
You must climb narrow vertical steps up and down to get from street level to car floor level .
Holding the bicycle firmly your front wheel swings around wildly , banging on the sides .
You may find things knocked off your backpack .
The newer cars permit a street - level entry .
Road bikes are especially difficult to load , what to speak of mountain bikes .
Thanks to everybody for posting so many useful observations and ideas !
On February 28th , the court document In re Rachel L. was published .
On March 25th , that ruling was vacated , and the California Court of Appeal granted a rehearing , scheduled for June 23 , 2008 .
Counsel for the three state groups , CHN , CHEA , and HSC , were present at the hearing , and were granted time to speak .
CHN was very concerned about the initial ruling , and is hopeful that the court will recognize that the interpretation of Califorinia law , as understood by homeschoolers for decades , is correct , and that no change in California law regarding the teaching of children privately at home is needed .
Homeschooling by using one of the alternatives to public school currently available under California law remains legal .
After the hearing , CHN Trustee Karen Taylor described her experience at the hearing to the members of CHN's two largest email lists :
" The court of appeals rehearing was today , in Los Angeles .
We were expecting this to be a closed hearing , but it was open , and members of the press were there .
The line was long , waiting to get in the courtroom , and there was some concern that we would not all get in .
Those from the state homeschooling groups were really glad when they kept on counting past us , meaning we were going to be allowed to observe the proceeding .
CHN , CHEA , and HSC had many attorneys present , and they travelled quite a distance to be there .
I think it was good that so many of them were able to hear the arguments .
The hearing began at 10:00 am and it was supposed to go for 2 hours .
Instead , it went on for an additional 45 minutes , and that was at the discretion of the three judges .
There were 12 attorneys who spoke and each had an agreed upon time limit .
But , the judges were very involved and often stopped them and asked questions .
It was very interactive , and the judges were attentive .
They also made references to some of the amicus briefs , and were very knowledgeable .
Our state groups had an attorney present to speak on behalf of California homeschoolers .
She spoke for 15 minutes , which was longer than the court expected for her , but when it was noted that she had gone over ( because so many questions were asked ) , one of the judges asked if she had anything else to add because " Your argument has been excellent so far . "
That was very nice to hear !
I think her points were some of the best received of the day .
I know everyone who was present will take something different from the day .
For me , it seemed that the judges are trying to do what they feel is best .
At one point , one of them said " Keep in mind this court has an obligation to interpret the intent of the legislature , and it is a huge burden . "
Right before they left the courtroom , one of them thanked those in the courtroom for appearing and being diligent in providing information , and said that the issues are monumental .
It appears that they have an understanding of the significance of their decision .
Homeschoolers in California as well as the nation hope that they 'll reach a favorable decision . "

A statement from the California Office of the Secretary of Education
" My feeling is very much in line with the governor in that it is a parental choice as to how they will educate their children , " said Chris Bertelli , assistant secretary of education .
" To require a credential for a parent that is home - schooling is ludicrous . "
" No other state in the country requires a credential , " Bertelli said .
" It would be nearly impossible to enforce and would do so much more damage than good . "
A statement from the LA County Department of Education
" As long as they are a private school registered with the state then as far as we are concerned they are a legal home school , " said Victor Thompson , director of student support service for the L.A. County Department of Education .

Touring America 's oilrigs and nuclear plants , John McCain sometimes sounds as if he 'll produce enough wind to power the nation all by himself .
So strongly does his current rhetoric smell of methane -- the gas emanating from manure -- that he might even qualify for an alternative energy tax incentive .
The former straight talker , who once could not help but tell the truth , has found the voice of the demagogue within .
As McCain seeks to exploit public anger over the price of gasoline , first with his dubious " gas tax holiday " and now with his campaign for offshore oil drilling , the thoughtful legislator who defied his own party on global warming and Alaskan oil leasing has been replaced by that much more familiar Congressional figure -- a rented mouthpiece for the energy industry .
Not surprisingly , this new McCain is not quite as accessible to the press as the earlier version , partly because he resents the media attention devoted to his Democratic opponent and partly because he no longer is so eager to answer every question a reporter might pose .
He prefers to listen to the cheers of eager boobs who believe him when he says , " We 're not going to pay $ 4 a gallon for gas because we are going to drill here , and we are going to drill now ! "
But should he ever stop yelling and start thinking again , there will be plenty of questions awaiting him , including these :
Senator , if you truly think we should be doing " all of the above " to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , why have you voted against every recent Congressional measure to encourage renewable energy sources ?
If you still worry about the effects of climate change , then why do you now emphasize drilling for additional oil offshore rather than energy sources that do n't create greenhouse gases ?
And why do you continue to talk about so - called " clean coal , " which does n't actually exist ?
Why do you say that offshore drilling will cut gasoline prices when the Energy Information Administration predicts that will not happen for a decade and will make little difference even then ?
According to your best estimate , when will " drilling here and drilling now " reduce the price of gasoline in the United States ?
Please explain why you no longer believe in the data supplied by the Energy Information Administration , which you asked to provide the economic analysis for the climate - change bill that you co-sponsored with Sen. Joseph Lieberman .
When you assure audiences that drilling offshore will produce more oil within a matter of months , as you did in Bakersfield , Calif. , last week , are you relying on sources other than the Energy Information Administration ?
Please identify the person or persons who told you that the oil industry can produce more petroleum within the next several months if we start offshore leasing today .
Did you learn of that miraculous capacity from one of the many oil company lobbyists who have advised and raised money for your campaign ?
When you said that there was no significant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico even during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , were you aware that at least seven million gallons were spilled as a result of Katrina ?
How much oil must leak from a damaged offshore rig or barge before you would consider the spillage to be " significant " ?
By the way , where will all that new offshore drilling occur if the states of Florida and California continue to oppose offshore leasing , as their governors have vowed to do ?
Do you still support the right of those states to prevent drilling in their coastal waters , as you promised last year ?
Does n't that promise conflict with your claim that offshore wells will produce enough new oil to lower gasoline prices ??
Finally , what is so funny about checking tire pressure to save energy ?
Are you aware that auto and tire maintenance -- like other conservation and efficiency measure -- can save far more oil than offshore leasing will ever produce ?
Did you know that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged the people of California to pump up their tires ?
Is it really prudent to mock him ?
“ Al - Qaeda linked ” organization threatens to target Beijing 2008 just as their predecessors did Athens 2004 , the 2002 World Cup , the 2006 World Cup , Euro 2008 , the local egg and spoon race , etc , etc , etc

IntelCenter and SITE Intelligence Group , two “ terrorism monitoring firms ” who routinely obtain so - called Al - Qaeda tapes that usually turn out to be completely fraudulent , yesterday released a video purported to feature members of a Chinese Muslim terror group threatening to attack the Olympics .
“ The threat , attributed to the Turkistan Islamic Party ( TIP ) , is contained in a new video which shows a burning Olympics logo and an explosion imposed over a venue to be used for the Beijing Games , ” reports Sky News .
“ It is believed to be based across the border in Pakistan , where security experts say it has received training from al Qaeda . ”
Terrorists who routinely threaten to attack global sporting events have a track record of failing to follow up on their promises .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Euro 2008 , held in Switzerland and Austria , was preceded by an “ Al - Qaeda ” threat to “ transform the safest countries in Europe to the hell seen in Iraq or Afghanistan ” .
Having personally visited Switzerland last week , Geneva and Montreux did n’t really remind me of Kabul or Baghdad .
In addition , before both soccer World Cup tournaments in 2002 and 2006 we were told that Al - Qaeda were planning to strike .
Nothing happened .
The 2004 Olympic Games in Athens Greece was also a target .
Nothing happened .
This leads us to question if “ terrorists ” are really behind the videos at all , because the tapes certainly are n’t doing anything for their street cred .
Judging by the latest video , we are still being led to believe that well - equipped deadly terrorist organizations still can’t afford to obtain a $ 200 video camera to ensure their audio does n’t sound like a badly dubbed 80’s B movie .
Watch the clip .
The “ explosion ” described in news reports appears to sound more like a cheap firework when one views the video .
It seems as though an impression of an inhumane , divorced from civilization , rugged and barbarous stereotype is being deliberately groomed by the creators of the tapes so as to heighten their mystique and fearmongering quality .
The origin of the video leads right back to our old friends once again , IntelCenter and SITE Intelligence Group .
SITE have resolved to keep things simple this time on the back of this past May ’s embarrassment , when they claimed terrorists had put together an elaborate image of Washington DC after a nuclear attack .
It turned out that the picture was a screenshot from a video game called Fallout 3 .
As we have exhaustively documented , Intelcenter is an offshoot of IDEFENSE , which was staffed by a senior military psy - op intelligence officer Jim Melnick , who has worked directly for Donald Rumsfeld .
The organization released the “ laughing hijackers ” tape and claimed it was an Al - Qaeda video , despite the fact that the footage was obtained by a “ security agency ” at a 2000 Bin Laden speech .
They were also behind the release of videos of Bin Laden speeches cobbled together from 5 - year - old footage and claimed it was a new tape .
IntelCenter was recently caught adding its logo to a tape at the same time as Al - Qaeda ’s so - called media arm As - Sahab added its logo , proving the two organizations were one and the same .
The Pakistani based Al - Qaeda group Jundullah , formerly headed by the alleged mastermind of 9/11 , an organization which enjoys the funding , support and protection of the CIA , also produces propaganda tapes and literature for As - Sahab and in turn IntelCenter .
All good reasons to treat this latest tape exactly for what it is – crude propaganda designed to coerce people to continue to buy into the fraud of the war on terror and the justification for the only real war taking place , that being waged on our freedom of movement and quickly disappearing liberties .

Collateralized debt obligations that helped drive banks to $ 400 billion of writedowns and credit losses are finding buyers under a different name : Re-Remics .
Re-Remic stands for " resecuritizations of real estate mortgage investment conduits , " the formal name of mortgage bonds .
They are composed of AAA rated bonds backed by so - called Alt - A mortgages , issued to borrowers with higher credit scores who do n't prove their incomes , seek higher debt ratios or buy investment properties .
Holders of mortgage bonds use Re-Remics to separate better - quality from riskier debt .
That increases the chance the higher - ranked debt will retain its AAA rating , enhancing its value enough to boost the total worth of the mortgage pool , said Doug Dachille , chief executive officer of New York - based First Principles Capital Management LLC , which oversees $ 7 billion in fixed - income investments .
A bond trading at 40 cents on the dollar could be split into a piece worth 80 cents and another piece that could then be sold cheaply enough to offer returns as high as 20 percent , Dachille said .
Commercial banks and savings - and - loans held more than $ 370 billion of non-agency mortgage bonds on March 31 , according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data .
Much of that can only be sold at fire - sale prices after record subprime - mortgage defaults and home - price declines sparked losses on the underlying loans .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup 's annual update on confidence in institutions finds just 12 % of Americans expressing confidence in Congress , the lowest of the 16 institutions tested this year , and the worst rating Gallup has measured for any institution in the 35 - year history of this question .
Gallup first asked about confidence in institutions in 1973 , repeating the question biannually through 1983 , and obtaining annual updates since then .
This year 's update comes from a June 9 - 12 Gallup Poll .
In the latest update , Congress ranks just below HMOs , for whom 13 % of Americans express " a great deal " or " quite a lot " of confidence .
Big business , the criminal justice system , organized labor , newspapers , television news , and the presidency all receive relatively low confidence ratings .
In contrast , Americans express the most confidence in the military , as they have each year since 1988 ( with the exception of 1997 , when small business edged it out ) .
Small business ranks second in the current poll , just ahead of the police .
These are the only three institutions that for whom a majority of Americans express a high degree of confidence .
From 1973 through 1985 , organized religion was the top rated institution .
Today , just 48 % of Americans are confident in organized religion , one of its lowest ratings ever .
The lowest score for religion to date was 45 % in 2002 at the height of the Catholic Church 's priest sex abuse scandal .
Crisis of Confidence ?
Prior to this year 's 12 % confidence rating for Congress , HMOs had the registered the lowest historical score , of 13 % in 2002 .
This rating does not include the 45 % of Americans who now say they have " some " confidence in Congress ; a nearly equal proportion -- 41 % -- say they have " little " or " no " confidence in Congress .
Even though the Supreme Court ( 32 % " great deal " or " quite a lot " of confidence ) and presidency ( 26 % ) are rated more positively than Congress , all institutions are at or near their lowest ratings to date .
The rating for the presidency is just one percentage point above its worst rating of 25 % from 2007 , while the Supreme Court 's rating is its worst .
Government institutions are not alone in experiencing a decline in public confidence .
While only one institution ( banks ) has seen a significant decline in confidence over the past year , all have dropped compared with 2004 , the last presidential election year .
The three government institutions and banks have had the greatest drops in confidence over that time , while the military and big business have seen the least change .
Long - term changes as above are usually more evident in these confidence measures than year - to - year changes .
The current data are no exception -- there has been little change from the 2007 ratings , aside from a 9 - point drop in confidence for banks ( from 41 % to 32 % ) .
Beyond that , the only other significant changes are modest increases in reported confidence for the police ( 58 % up from 54 % ) and the medical system ( 35 % up from 31 % ) , but both cases mainly reflect a rebound to 2006 levels after experiencing declines in 2007 .
Implications
The poor economy and lack of effective government action on important issues such as gas prices , the Iraq War , and immigration help contribute to the erosion of trust and confidence in government institutions .
Earlier this week , Gallup reported historically low job approval ratings for the three branches of the federal government .
These confidence in institutions ratings underscore the public 's frustration and signal an electorate that may be hungry for change in Washington come the fall 's elections .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 822 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted June 9 - 12 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

We 've been trying to get our kids to ride their bikes for about a year and a half .
It has n't been a constant battle – we would try for a bit , then take a month off .
Rinse .
Repeat .
It 's been tough , but that 's what makes today so rewarding .
Today , we have success .
All three kids riding : spinning around the driveway , hair waving in the wind , ear - to - ear smiles on their faces .
Life is good .
Last year , Geekdad Dan Olson took a look at how to encourage kids to ride bikes .
Dan made a lot of great points addressing the psychological aspects of motivating kids to ride .
Today , I 'm going to evaluate a variety of physical methods for getting kids on two wheels .
Like many parents , we had our children riding tricycles at an early age .
This gave them two necessary skills that would carry over to bike riding : pedaling and steering .
These very early experiences paid off too .
When the time came for a bike with training wheels , they were n't afraid and understood what they were supposed to do .
In researching this post , I was amazed to find that quite a few people feel very strongly that training wheels on a child 's bike are an unadulterated evil on par with letting kids play with loaded automatic weapons in the middle of a highway during rush hour .
We do n't subscribe to this school of thought .
Rather , we believe that just getting the child on the bike is the most important thing .
Our kids are n't going to be commuting to school on bikes anytime soon .
So bicycles - for them - are a tool for exercise and fun .
And as long as they were riding around outside instead of lounging around watching Spongebob , we were happy .
When it came time to ditch the training wheels , I did some research on the best practices for getting kids rolling on two wheels .
I was surprised at the variety of methodologies people had for getting kids to ride by themselves .
Here are seven of the most popular ways , plus a rating on how each works :
Take off just one of the training wheels .
This seemed ridiculous to me .
You might as well ask yourself " Which side of your kid do you want to scrape with a cheese grater ? "
Because in my mind , the kid is just going to fall down and scrape up one side over and over and over again .
We tried this method for about five minutes , generating the results I expected .
Rating : Tired .
Start with an undersized bike .
Go into any bike store and you 'll learn that a well - fit bike allows its rider to straddle the top tube while standing flat footed on the ground .
With this variation , the child should be able to stand flat footed while sitting on the seat .
It makes him feel more in control .
By waiting as long as we did to get our kids to ride , this process became part of our routine by default .
In the end , I think it was helpful and made them feel more in control of their bikes .
Rating : Wired .
Put away the bike and use a scooter .
This suggestion recommends giving the child a 2 - wheeled scooter and encouraging her to play with it .
Once she is able to coast around with both feet on the scooter , she will feel more comfortable coasting around on a bike .
Because the scooter has a lower center of gravity and an easier bailout procedure , the child is apt to feel more comfortable .
We did n't try this because I did n't want to buy a bunch of scooters .
Plus , the kids would be learning how to ride a scooter ... not a bike .
Rating : Tired .
Take the pedals off .
I found this suggestion in one of the comments to
Dan 's article .
It seemed pretty smart to me - let the child coast around on his bike without the hinderance of pedals .
We gave it a try , but I think my kids were still too small when we experimented with it and just not ready .
I think the idea has merit , it 's easy to implement and I 'm pretty sure it would be a good part of anyone 's routine in making kids comfortable with bike balance .
Rating : Wired .
Hill training : Find a grassy spot with a small hill , not too many ruts or rocks , that includes a flat area before ending in a slight incline .
Kids will be able to get the feeling of coasting before running up the slight incline and slowing down .
This suggestion comes with too many geographical requirements .
I guess my wife might be open to playing the part of Sacagawea , but I did n't feel like reconnoitering the land , school after school , park after park , trying to find a spot that met the all the requirements in this suggestion .
Instead , we tried our backyard and came to a quick conclusion :
Unless you live off the 13th at Augusta , yards tend to be too bumpy , making the focus on balance all - consuming .
The ideas of steering and pedaling are thrown out the window pretty quickly .
Kids like it because falling on grass is n't as bad as asphalt , but we gave this one up in a hurry .
Rating : Tired .
Trailer bike .
These bikes lack a front wheel and attach to the seat post of an adult bike .
For us , this was a breakthrough .
I picked one up this summer and - for my kids - the combination of not having to steer and just focusing on the pedaling led to exhilaration .
They .
Were .
Riding !
It lit a fire under them and they immediately began practicing on their own .
I also suspect that - because the bike is attached to the adult bike - they felt some of the subtle adjustments I made to keep the bike stable ... especially at low speeds .
Rating : Wired .
Running with the child on the driveway .
The most simple is saved for last because , in the end , this is what worked in our situation .
Like an untold number of parents before us , I ran after the bikes - encouraging my kids and shouting out pointers : * Keep pedaling !
Do n't look down -
look ahead !*
With this method , it helps to give the child some balance support to keep them from falling in the beginning .
Some advocate holding the child by the neck (! ) , some say by the shoulders .
There 's evena company that makes a product for this method , but I think they 've just repurposed inventory left over from the incredibly misguided fad of dwarf throwing .
I opted for holding the bike steady from beneath the seat .
I was able to help them with their balance and - when I felt they were ready - I let them go without them knowing that they were on their own .
Rating : Wired .
Learning to ride a bike is one of the toughest skills a child will learn .
And the challenge for a kid who is still figuring out how to control his or her body is daunting .
Coordinating balance , pedaling , turning and stopping is a tall order for children who have a tough time doing just 2 things at once .
But we got through it .
And if you 're struggling to get a child to ride , you will too .
Strap on the helmet , tuck the shoelaces away and pick a method and see how it works .
Most of all , be patient .
We dealt with a lot of frustration on our final day , before they really got it .
The only rule we had any day that we practiced was that you can't end your day on a fall .
If they went down , they had to get back up and try again .
Sure , we went through a couple of boxes of Band Aids during this ordeal , but skinned knees heal .
The sense of accomplishment will last forever .

I try very hard to be tolerant of others ' beliefs .
I do n't pretend to have all the answers and I certainly do n't want to begrudge others answers that work for them .
However , I draw the line at the whole false equivalence of the Intelligent Design / Evolution argument .
In fact , even though I recognize it goes against the Constitution , I 'm not sure that should n't be a test for elected office :
If you feel that the idea of Intelligent Design ( which can not be proven in any kind of scientific way ) should be taught alongside with evolution ( which is as much a theory as gravity is ) , then you do not belong in a position where you can make that decision .
Which makes Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal all that more frightening for being on the short list for the Republican Veepstakes .
On Face the Nation , Jindal tells guest host Chip Reid that even though we should teach our kids at the highest levels of science , it 's wrong to " withhold " from them the concept of Intelligent Design .
As a parent , when my kids go to schools , when they go to public schools , I want them to be presented with the best thinking .
I want them to be able to make decisions for themselves .
I want them to see the best data .
I personally think that the life , human life and the world we live in was n't created accidentally .
I do think that there 's a creator .
I 'm a Christian .
I do think that God played a role in creating not only earth , but mankind .
Now , the way that he did it , I 'd certainly want my kids to be exposed to the very best science .
I do n't want them to be -- I do n't want any facts or theories or explanations to be withheld from them because of political correctness .
The way we 're going to have smart , intelligent kids is exposing them to the very best science and let them not only decide , but also let them contribute to that body of knowledge .
Really ?
Should we also let students " decide " on whether the theory of gravity makes more sense to them than the notion of a benevolent God moving us around on puppet strings ?
Does that contribute to the body of scientific knowledge ?
Transcripts below the fold :
REID : Let me make a sharp turn here to a different issue , an issue that has raised some controversy .
Now , you were a biology major in college .
I think you had a double major .
But you were a biology major , and you support the teaching of intelligent design in schools .
Do you have doubts about the theory of evolution ?
Gov. JINDAL : A couple of things .
One , I do n't think this is something the federal or state government should be imposing its views on local school districts .
You know , as a conservative I think government that 's closest to the people governs best .
I think local school boards should be in a position of deciding the curricula and also deciding what students should be learning .
Secondly , I do n't think students learn by us withholding information from them .
Some want only to teach intelligent design , some only want to teach evolution .
I think both views are wrong , as a parent .
REID : But how about you personally ?
Where do you stand personally on the issue ?
Gov. JINDAL : As a parent , when my kids go to schools , when they go to public schools , I want them to be presented with the best thinking .
I want them to be able to make decisions for themselves .
I want them to see the best data .
I personally think that the life , human life and the world we live in was n't created accidentally .
I do think that there 's a creator .
I 'm a Christian .
I do think that God played a role in creating not only earth , but mankind .
Now , the way that he did it , I 'd certainly want my kids to be exposed to the very best science .
I do n't want them to be -- I do n't want any facts or theories or explanations to be withheld from them because of political correctness .
The way we 're going to have smart , intelligent kids is exposing them to the very best science and let them not only decide , but also let them contribute to that body of knowledge .
That 's what makes the scientific process so exciting .
You get to go there and find facts and data and test what 's come before you and challenge those theories .

The government will come under increased pressure today to ban new coal - fired power stations such as the one planned for Kingsnorth in Kent unless they are equipped to trap and store carbon pollution underground , as a committee of MPs publishes a critical report .
The environmental audit committee urges ministers to make it clear that coal power plants that do not fit carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) equipment will be closed down .
It says the government must set a deadline , after which the operation of unabated coal - fired power stations should not be permitted .
Tim Yeo , chairman of the committee , said : " We can not afford to develop new coal - fired power stations when we have no guarantee about when they will be fitted with CCS , if at all . "
A failure to set such a deadline would make it difficult for the UK to meet carbon - reduction targets , the committee said .
The government is debating whether to allow the German - owned utility E.ON to press ahead with a new coal - fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent .
The company wants to proceed with the scheme , promising to fit CCS later if it can be proved to be technically and financially viable .
Environmentalists see the Kent project as a vital test of the government 's green credentials and want Kingsnorth given the go - ahead only if CCS is installed .
Greenpeace believes the environmental audit committee 's conclusions support its case and leaves the government with its back against the wall .
John Sauven , Greenpeace 's executive director , said : " Gordon Brown must now show he has the courage to tackle the threats of energy security , climate change and high energy prices by introducing tough new standards for power stations that limit global - warming emissions .
And , in doing so , he must rule out current plans for Kingsnorth . "
Last month , David Cameron said a future Conservative government would impose such emissions restrictions , to in effect ban new coal plants without CCS .
Today 's report said CCS technology could " contribute significantly to emissions reductions " and could play a decisive role in the battle against global warming .
But that progress has been " regrettably slow " .
No full - scale CCS project that buries pollution from a power plant has yet been built , though the UK government is running a competition that aims to demonstrate the technology by 2014 .
Supporters say the technology could remove 90 % of the carbon emissions from coal and will be critical in developing countries such as India and China .
However , critics say it is unproven and that governments have underestimated the scale and expense of the vast infrastructure that would be needed .
Even with the promise of CCS , the committee warned that coal should be seen as a last resort in the UK .
The committee said the government could be considering a new era of coal - fired power stations because it was the easy option , and warned that such an approach was extremely dangerous .
With no certainty about when the technology will be commercially available , the MPs said , plans to develop new coal - fired power stations would lock the country into a high - emissions future .
Tim Jones , climate policy officer at the World Development Movement , which campaigns against new coal - fired plants , said : " The government should be closing down dirty coal - power stations , not allowing new ones to be built .
And the government certainly should not be relying on carbon capture and storage to justify new coal - power stations . "
Next month 's planned climate protest camp will target the Kingsnorth site .
The Royal Society wrote to ministers in April to suggest that new coal - fired power stations were only allowed on the condition that they lose their permit to operate if they failed to capture 90 % of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 .
Sir Martin Rees , president of the society , said : " This will give a clear signal to industry and provide the conditions in which the government and industry can work together to take a lead on developing a very valuable technology . "
The energy minister , Malcolm Wicks , said he was " pleased " that the environmental audit committee recognised the steps Britain had taken towards developing clean coal technology with the UK carbon capture and storage demonstration project , but insisted that coal was vital for the future .
" We are committed to the development of CCS technology and we intend to be one of the first countries to demonstrate the technology for a coal - fired station on a commercial scale , " he said .
" Coal is and will remain a vital part of the global energy mix , and this will be the case for many years to come . "

Government is n’t exactly on the leading edge of the technological revolution .
The GAO reported yesterday that several federal agencies still rely on “ paper and file ” systems to store emails .
And John McCain , devoted Luddite that he is , has admitted he does n’t know how to use a computer .
But even for members of Congress who do know a thing or two about technology , their ability to use it to communicate with constituents is restricted by arcane congressional rules — rules that are now at the center of a partisan slug fest on Capitol Hill .
Suppose you ’re a congressman , and you ’d like to post a periodic video message on your website updating constituents on your activities .
You film it , post it on YouTube , and embed a link on your homepage .
It ’s that easy , right ?
Wrong .
By including YouTube content on your page , you ’d find yourself in violation of policies that pre-date the Internet by a couple hundred years .
An obscure 6 - member , bipartisan panel called the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards ( also known as the “ Franking Commission ” ) , adhering to rules established in 1789 , has long regulated congressional communications , making sure that federal dollars are used only for nonpartisan purposes and not for political proselytizing , which must instead come out of individual members ’ campaign funds — a reasonable enough idea in an earlier time , but one that ignores dramatic changes in the way people communicate in our Twitter age of hyperconnectivity .
The regulations are in desperate need of revision , and on that point members of both parties agree .
But the devil is in the details … and it ’s those details that have ignited a breathless exchange of amped - up rhetoric between Democrats and Republicans in recent weeks .
It began with a letter ( .pdf ) , dated June 24 , from Rep. Michael Capuano ( D - Mass . ) , chairman of the Franking Commission , to Rep. Robert Brady ( D - Penn . ) , who heads the Committee on House Administration .
Capuano set forth a series of suggestions for changes to House rules , recommending that video be permitted , but that it “ not be posted on a website or page where it may appear with commercial or political information or any other information not in compliance with the Houses ’s content guidelines . ”
Translation : members of Congress would be prohibited from using YouTube unless the website creates a separate channel that meets “ whatever requirements are established by the House administration committee . ”
Capuano encouraged Brady to “ view these recommendations as a first step in a process towards modernizing the regulations that govern communications . ”
To this , House minority leader John Boehner , Republican of Ohio , responded Tuesday with a fiery missive to “ Online Community & Activists , ” warning that Capuano ’s recommendations constitute “ an attack on free speech ” that would bring members ’ ability to use ubiquitous Internet tools like YouTube “ to a screeching halt . ”
( Never mind that Capuano ’s letter was actually directed towards expanding the realm of tech options available to congressional web pages . )
“ If the proposed rule is adopted , ” Boehner continued , “ the free flow of information over the Internet between Americans and their representatives will be significantly curtailed …
This would essentially amount to new government censorship of the Internet , by a panel of federal officials that is neither neutral nor independent . ”
On Wednesday , the shouting match continued with a new letter from Capuano , who suggested that Boehner had so thoroughly mischaracterized his positions that he doubted the House Republican leader had read his original letter .
He then restated his views in simpler terms :
Our only concern is commercialization — not imposing limits on free speech …
Apparently the Republicans spreading these lies would rather operate without rules and open the House to commercialism .
Maybe they do n’t care if an official video appears next to a political advertisement for Barack Obama or John McCain , creating the appearance of an endorsement .
And I guess they do n’t care if constituents clicking on their videos will be treated to commercials for anything you can imagine , from the latest Hollywood blockbuster to Viagra .
Certainly , advertisements are a reality in today ’s world and most people can distinguish .
However , it is also a reality that Members of Congress who use taxpayer money to communicate with constituents should be held to the highest possible standard of independence — and the appearance of independence .
All this partisan bickering obscures the basic point .
The current rules are badly antiquated and in need of updating .
And open - government advocates are pushing Congress to get beyond the predictable , point - scoring back - and - forth .
For example , the Sunlight Foundation , a Washington - based nonprofit that champions greater transparency in government , is trying to tear down the barriers that prevent members of Congress not only from using YouTube , but from Twittering from the House floor or using Facebook .
( You can join its “ Let Our Congress Tweet ” campaign here . )
Says Sunlight program director John Wonderlich about Capuano ’s cautious approach to opening House.gov to the larger Internet world :
While reconsidering or reforming these antiquated restrictions is a laudable goal , the proposed guideline reforms are only a half - measure toward modernized engagement online , and do n’t address the underlying problems with these unnecessary restrictions ….
If Members can use whatever brand of inkpen , or any brand of paper , or buy whatever shoes they want , they should be given radically expanded freedom to use the Internet , and make the same empowering discoveries that their constituents are .
Even if that same pen was once used to scribble a ransom note .
In the meantime , if you have strong views one way or the other , you may consider Twittering your member of Congress .
Just know that if he ’s at work , he may not get the message .

Congratulations ( of sorts ) go to the UK as British household debt is highest in history .
British households are now more indebted than those of any other major country in recorded history , it has emerged .
Families in the UK now owe a record 173 pc of their incomes in debts , official figures have shown .
The ratio of debt to income is higher than any other country in the Group of Seven leading industrialised economies , and is sharply higher than the 129 pc of incomes it was five years ago .
Michael Saunders of Citigroup warned that - at 173 pc of household incomes - the debt burden is higher even than Japan 's when it peaked in 1990 , before more than a decade of deflation .
Philip Shaw of Investec said : " Although we take the view that the economy will avoid a recession , our confidence is ebbing . "

Barclays Warns Of Financial Storm
Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm , warning that the US Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall " below zero " .
" We 're in a nasty environment , " said Tim Bond , the bank 's chief equity strategist .
" There is an inflation shock underway .
This is going to be very negative for financial assets .
We are going into tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell .
Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth . "
Barclays Capital said in its closely - watched Global Outlook that US headline inflation would hit 5.5 pc by August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates six times by the end of next year to prevent a wage - spiral .
If it hesitates , the bond markets will take matters into their own hands .
" This is the first test for central banks in 30 years and they have fluffed it .
They have zero credibility , and the Fed is negative if that 's possible .
It has lost all credibility , " said Mr Bond .

The Dangerous Neighbor Vladimir Putin Takes on a Powerless West
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin approached the crisis in Georgia coolly and efficiently , prompting admiration even from some American observers .
But Moscow 's brutal strike against Georgian President Saakashvili has divided the Western world , with the split running straight through the European Union .
The New Yorker magazine cover was not the first caricature of Sen. Barack Obama to raise howls about insensitivity , even racism .
And it 's safe to assume , regrettably , that it wo n't be the last .
Let 's be honest :
The current discomfort about the portrayal of Obama in satire , comedy and caricature - the wickedly irreverent realm of American politics - has much to do with the arrival of the first person of color as a presumptive major - party nominee .
This is a work in progress for Americans .
Count me among those who regarded the New Yorker magazine cover as a brilliant , funny , richly ironic satire on fears about the Obamas that certain right - wingers have been trying to exploit .
In satire , context is everything .
For those of us who grab the New Yorker from our mailboxes every week , there was little doubt about artist Barry Blitt 's intentions .
Exaggeration past the point of absurdity is the satirist 's tool .
If too much explanation is required , the irony is lost to the literal .
The reaction to the New Yorker cover suggests that it did n't work for many Americans .
Fine .
One of the truisms of satire is that it does n't always work when it pushes the envelope , but it 's never great when it plays it safe .
I give the magazine credit for trying .
My larger concern is the broader timidity about subjecting Barack Obama to the pointedly creative forces in editorial cartooning and late - night comedy .
He is no longer merely a state legislator or even one of 100 U.S. senators .
He is about to become a major - party nominee for president .
In other words , he 's fair game for what Jon Stewart described as the " carrion birds " of late - night comedy .
" We 're sitting up there saying , ' Does he seem weak ?
Is he dehydrated yet ?
Let 's attack . ' "
So far , the late - night comics have pulled their punches on Barack Obama .
Editorial cartoonists have been only slightly less restrained .
On July 8 , we ran what I thought was a pointedly effective editorial cartoon by Pat Oliphant about Obama 's post - primary shifts to the center .
The four - panel cartoon showed Obama leaping from one side of the road to the other .
Several readers called to complain that the cartoon exaggerated Obama 's thin profile and large ears .
It did ; that 's what caricatures do .
Was it critical of a specific aspect of a politician who was otherwise in sync with the cartoonist 's belief ?
Yes , equal - opportunity criticism is what the good ones do .
Was it racist , as some callers suggested ?
I think not .
More calls and e-mails came after Wednesday 's editorial - page cartoon by Signe Wilkinson showed a " thin- skinned " Obama raining tears over the New Yorker cover .
Was it literally true ?
No .
One reader suggested that " good satire is supposed to be an extension of the truth , not based on a falsehood . "
I must note that , while Obama declined to comment , his campaign spokesman ( before the cover even came out ) did denounce it as " tasteless and offensive .
And we agree . "
By the way , a note to offended Obama supporters who might have missed Thursday 's editorial cartoon by Nick Anderson : Republicans did not literally offer flag pins to victims of the devastated economy .
It was n't really fair , either , but it was a strong cartoon .
So were the cartoons by our own Tom Meyer that portrayed Hillary Rodham Clinton as a dinosaur , Bill Clinton as a hyena , John McCain as an old man , or myriad caricatures of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as , well , less than reverential .
I am well aware of the history of editorial cartoons or " jokes " being used to fan fears of immigrants or to demean women and African Americans .
There is a need to recognize the distinction between perpetuating stereotypes and skewering an individual for his or her actions .
Barack Obama must not be allowed a free pass from the satirists .
It would not be healthy for his campaign , or for the evolution of race relations in this society .
It 's a distinct sign of progress that so many Americans have transcended racial barriers to embrace Obama 's messages of hope .
The next step will have arrived when we can laugh at his foibles and contradictions with neither fear nor self - consciousness .
Taking standardized tests is a skill that most students who are looking to pursue a college education after high school will need to master .
The SAT , or Scholastic Aptitude Test , is administered by the College Board .
The ACT , ( American College Testing ) is another form of a standardized test that most colleges accept .
Many high school students will take both and use the test with the highest score on their college applications .
The tests can be taken as often as the student desires because most colleges super score the results – use the highest score you received on a single section and not in a single test .
Colleges do not look poorly on retaking college admission tests .
In fact , they consider it a sign of growth and perseverance and an opportunity to improve your scores and admission to your dream college .
Both tests have undergone many evolutions since they were first administered , and they continue to evolve .
As such , many parents will feel they are out of their depth if their child asks them for help with SAT and ACT preparation .
This is why SAT and ACT prep courses have become so popular .
At SAT Prep Course Reviews , we understand that although the SAT and ACT prep process may feel intimidating for your student , it can also feel overwhelming when choosing the best preparatory course for your child .

As night bar manager at Barney ’s Beanery in Pasadena , Eric Gonzalez has an awesome responsibility :
He ’s master controller of nearly 100 televisions .
So when the Summer Games began Aug. 8 , he was nervous .
Should he bump Major League Baseball and other mainstream events off the big screens ?
Would his hard - core sports patrons complain that synchronized diving , team handball , BMX cycling , trampoline and other Olympic fare were for bars that serve arugula salads ?
“ If customers do n’t like what you put up there , they will let you know , ” Gonzalez said in the control booth , where patrons are n’t allowed .
“ You hear the boos . ”
Turns out he need n’t have worried .
His customers are lapping up as much Olympic action as he can put on .
Sometimes the more obscure , the better .

“ They even wanted to see the skeet shooting or clay shooting , whatever they call it , ” he said .
With the Beijing Games in full swing and NBC showing a record 3,600 hours of it on broadcast and cable , many sports unfamiliar to Americans -- such as single - handed dinghy racing , air - rifle shooting and women ’s weightlifting -- are getting their moments in the sun .
Few if any athletes in these events will see their faces on a Wheaties box , but these oddly compelling sports are winning over fans typically devoted to the holy trinity of baseball , basketball and football .
“ Everyone wants to see a woman lift 250 pounds over her head , ” explained Ken Moody , 47 , a self - described football guru sitting at the bar .
He stayed home one night last week to watch the live online stream of women ’s weightlifting .
Veteran shock jock and sports fan Don Imus summed up the phenomenon on his radio show when he mentioned coming across coverage of team handball .
“ I do n’t know what it was , ” Imus said , “ but I saw it , and I watched it .
And I rooted for one of the teams . ”

But if you think some of this year ’s sports are strange , consider what Olympic fans were watching in 1900 .
That year in Paris , Charles de Vendeville of France took gold in underwater swimming , in which competitors got a point for every second they stayed underwater and 2 points for every meter swum .
Also on the schedule in Paris : obstacle swimming , in which competitors had to climb over boats .
Frederick Lane of Australia was the champ .
In 1904 in St. Louis , there was the “ plunge for distance . ”
Competitors dived into a lake and had to stay motionless for 60 seconds or until their heads broke the surface -- whichever came first .
Americans swept the medals , led by William Dickey , who got down more than 62 feet .
All of those were one - year wonders .
Tug of war , however , was on Olympic bills from 1900 to 1920 .

If any of those sports had been included in this year ’s Olympics , Philip Crabb , who lives just outside New York City in New Jersey , probably would have watched them .
Although a fan of the New York Yankees and Giants , he likes his Olympic sports obscure .
“ I watched the equestrian dressage , which was really kind of weird , ” said Crabb , who oversees the international supply chain at luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton .
“ I did n’t know it existed , but there were people who spent almost their whole lives preparing for this moment . ”
He was also engrossed in team handball and the preliminaries for archery .
Crabb did n’t care that the online feeds lacked play - by - play commentary .
“ You get a sense of solitude , like you are there on your own , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t tell you the names of all the players , but you start following them . ”

New sports are added to the Games roster by the International Olympic Committee , which in typical bureaucratic fashion bases its decision on 33 criteria , including “ strategic planning process ” and “ scope of development programs . ”
Joining the roster at this Games is BMX racing , in which bicycles ride around a track with hills and jumps .
It was n’t even invented until the 1960s .
So much for patterning events on the ancient Greeks .
What the IOC giveth , it can also taketh away .
This is the last Games , unless the committee changes its mind again , for softball and baseball .

One evening last week at Barney ’s Beanery , a Rangers - Red Sox baseball matchup was on in the place of honor -- the giant TV behind the bar that ’s almost as wide as the 40 beer taps lined up under it .
But when prime - time Olympic coverage began at 8 p.m. , the Games took its place .
There were no complaints , even though the first featured event was synchronized diving .
From the end of the bar , Chuck Taylor , 40 , watched in awe .
Although a NASCAR fan , Taylor , who works in a bank combating money laundering , had no trouble calling the dual dives a sport .
“ If golf is a sport , ” Taylor said , “ this is a sport . ”

Emily Aull , 22 , was watching in a booth with friends .
With the sound off , they caught on just from the visuals .
“ At first it was all amazing , ” she said of the divers , who strove to make their side - by - side flight as uniform as possible .
“ Then we got really picky , really quickly .
We ’d say , ‘ Oh , look at that hand out of place . ’ ”
There were viewers who remained true to their mainstays .
Bob Bradford was seated right in front of the giant screen .
His head , however , was tilted toward a smaller TV .
“ I ’m watching the baseball game , ” he said .
“ I ’m not watching the Olympics at all . ”
Advertisement
Buzz Howard , 77 , was also watching the action on the diamond .
He had little interest in the Olympics until he was told baseball would be played .
“ That I will probably watch , ” he said .
Jim Pierini , 53 , an admitted football fanatic , said there was room for variation .
“ This is only once every four years , ” he said , glancing away from the diving , which he was watching with his daughter .
If Pierini had the choice , right then , to watch the Games or an in - season football match , which would it be ?
Advertisement
He did n’t have to think but a split - second before answering : “ The Olympics . ”
Maybe for now , but there ’s a wide world of sports out there .
Off - road unicycling has adherents in North America and Europe .
Chessboxing , which alternates four minutes of chess with three minutes of boxing , is done in Germany .
And in Afghanistan , there ’s a sport in which men on horseback score points by carrying a goat carcass over the goal line .

Do n’t tell the IOC .
Even after a few beers , that one might not look so good on the big TV .

There have been many stories over the past few years about copyright infringement on Flickr .
To date most have been about individuals maliciously downloading the work of others to resell it as their own or companies using photographs commercially violating either the licensing restrictions of the photo or ignoring the need for a model release .
What most remain unaware of is that Flickr fosters copyright infringement through their API .
The most egregious part of this is that Flickr knows it .
Even if done with out malice you can expect them to spin it that they do not foster copyright infringement through their API or , as you ’ll later see , that they ’re immune from being liable for improper use of their API because of their API terms of use .
6 months ago I realized that two applications leveraging Flickr ’s API were ignoring photo licensing settings that every user configures in the “ Privacy & Permissions ” section of their “ Your Account ” page .
Â
Even now regardless of a photos designated licensing setting , whether Creative Commons or All Rights Reserved , these and other applications are publishing Flickr photos to 3rd party web sites and image files , high resolution if available , are being downloaded for reuse on personal computers .
Worse still is that as recently as this weekend MyxerTones employed Flickr ’s API inappropriately in effect making every Flickr photo available for sale as cell phone wallpaper for 2 days .
My first realization that there was a problem with how Flickr ’s API was being managed was when I found a medium size version of my photo “ Penny Harvest Rockefeller Center , New York ” displayed on CoinNews .
net in late December 2007 just after Christmas .
I wrote the administrator of CoinNews .
net immediately and found out that they were unaware of the copyright infringement .
It was explained to me that they were just using a freely available plugin that enabled them to publish the photographic work of others from Flickr via specified tags .
The blog plugin they were using , “ FlickrRSS “ , was pulling the most recent photos tagged with “ penny harvest ” whether designated as “ All Rights Reserved ” or not .

With in days of this discovery Dave Winer announced FlickrFan .
FlickrFan creates a high resolution photo screensaver based on a user or a tag based Flickr RSS feed .
Photos from the specified user (s ) or tag(s ) are downloaded from Flickr to a local computer without sensitivity to the copyright license chosen by the photographer .
( See FlickrFan : A Heads - Up For License Conscious Flickr Photographers ) .
I contacted Dave about this , but strangely he would only carry on a conversation through blog comments .
He in essence refused my invitation to talk about how his application worked over the phone or via email .
His comments created more questions than they answered .
In the end it left me scratching my head as to who the responsible party is in such application development .
Is Dave immune because he ’s leveraging RSS feeds that pulls content in a set format determined by Flickr or is Dave responsible for constructing an application that properly factors in photo licensing information contained with in Flickr ’s feeds and / or API ?
To pursue the matter further I contacted Flickr in December via an email to their support team .
My email went unanswered .

In early January I had the good fortune of taking part in a panel discussion , Media Web Meet Up III : The Producers , with Heather Champ who is the Community Manager at Flickr .
I took the opportunity to let her know about this problem with either the Flickr API or how the API was being enforced .
I was told that she ’d get back to me as soon as possible .
After a few polite email exchanges that spanned several months I never heard anything more from Heather on the matter .
Then this weekend a Flickr contact ( stargazer95050 ) let me know that my photo
Out of the Gloom , which like all my photos has the “ All Rights Reserved ” license designation , was being sold as cell phone wall paper through MyxerTones.com .
It turns out everyone ’s Flickr photos were available for purchase through MyxerTones.com from July 3rd to July 5th , but Myxer disabled their Flickr integration after receiving numerous complaints .
Â Myk Willis of Myxer addressed the growing chorus of concerned Flickr photographers aware of their Flickr integration gone wrong this past Saturday apologizing and explaining the situation from his perspective .
This latest incident is by far the most egregious , as the use of photographs from Flickr were being sold with out the consent of a single photographer , all while photo licensing terms were programmatically ignored .
I ’m glad to see that Myxer took the proper steps to disable their Flickr integration , but this is the latest example of Flickr playing with fire .
On some varying level it is easy to point the finger at Myxer , Dave Winer ( author of FlickrFan ) , Eightface ( the company behind FlickrRSS ) or any other developer / company for improperly using the Flickr API , but I would argue that responsibility ultimately lies with Flickr .
Flickr controls their API and they control who uses their API .
They issue API keys and supposedly monitor who they give these keys to whether companies like Myxer , independent software developers like Dave Winer or blog plugin developers like Eightface .
Â
Flickr even goes so far as to provide Terms of Use for their API and the do their best to place responsibility of recognizing image licensing terms on the developers using the Flickr API .
Section 1a , sub-section ii
Comply with any requirements or restrictions imposed on usage of the photos by their respective owners .
Remember , Flickr does n’t own the images – Flickr users do .
Although the Flickr APIs can be used to provide you with access to Flickr user photos , neither Flickr ’s provision of the Flickr APIs to you nor your use of the Flickr APIs override the photo owners ’ requirements and restrictions , which may include “ all rights reserved ” notices ( attached to each photo by default when uploaded to Flickr ) , Creative Commons licenses or other terms and conditions that may be agreed upon between you and the owners .
In ALL cases , you are solely responsible for making use of Flickr photos in compliance with the photo owners ’ requirements or restrictions .
If you use Flickr photos for a commercial purpose , the photos must be marked with a Creative Commons license that allows for such use , unless otherwise agreed upon between you and the owner .
You can read more about this here : www.creativecommons.org or www.flickr.com/creativecommons.
So why blame Flickr ?
Regardless of Flickr ’s terms with the developers utilizing their API I have an individual agreement , as every Flickr user does , with Flickr .
That agreement states in section 9b of the Yahoo !
Terms of Service …
With respect to photos , graphics , audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service other than Yahoo !
Groups , the license to use , distribute , reproduce , modify , adapt , publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Service solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available .
This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Service and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo !
removes such Content from the Service .
Note the bold text “ solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available ” .
This is a slippery slope for Flickr and Yahoo as I ’m uploading photos on Flickr to share with friends and the Flickr community .
No where have I authorized an all encompassing distribution of my photography to third parties .
Do n’t get me wrong I ’m not saying Flickr should shut down their API .
I employ services that use Flickr ’s API all the time with out problem .
I authorize Moo to print cards with my photos , I authorize that my Flickr feed be picked up by Twitter and I authorize the use of my web site photo gallery to pull photos from Flickr .
In each of these examples I have authorized how my photography is used in line with my licensing terms “ All Rights Reserved ” .
In fact if you look at your Flickr Account page in the Privacy & Permissions section you ’ll find that you can authorize who downloads , prints , blogs , and searches your photos from Flickr .
In my case I have opted to :
Let no one download my photography other than myself
Let no one print my photos other than myself
Make my photography available through public searches
Make my photography available to be blogged .
In the examples I ’ve provided counter to my Privacy & Permissions settings …
Flickr RSS via the Flickr API has enabled others to blog my photography outside of the safeguards set in place through the “ Blog This ” button on each of my Flickr photo pages .
Note : Flickr RSS is often used to provide image thumbnails on blogs and I have no problem with this , but medium size photos enable a resolution of display that is too great less a photographers consent .

Mxyrtones / Myxer via the Flickr API has enabled a company to sell and make available downloads of my photography with out any authorization or agreement .
Taking myself and my communications with Flickr out of the equation … this is a known problem .
Other application developers have become acutely aware of the problem of leveraging Flickr ’s API while respecting the copyrights of photographers and the licensing terms they specify .
As recently as March 2008 this very topic has been discussed in the Flickr API discussion forum ( API usage and image copyright … ) .
When you read this previously noted thread you begin to enter the realm of finger pointing .
Ask a photographer who they blame when their image is published inappropriately through a 3rd party application using Flickr ’s API and they ’ll blame the developer .
Ask the developer in this situation and they ’ll blame the photographer for making their photographs available .
In fact most developers quite logically will state that photographers should turn off their Privacy & Permissions setting to make their photographs available through public searches .
Unfortunately that only removes photographs from tag searches , but not searches across pools or sets .
On the other hand the counter argument is , “ Why should a photographer turn off the ability of their photographs to be searched because a developer is n’t capable of programming the proper logic to display photographs with the proper licensing restrictions ? ”
What both parties have missed to date is that Flickr is ultimately responsible to honor their agreement with individual photographers and to manage their API in such a fashion that the Privacy & Permissions settings specified by Flickr photographers are honored .
I am personally disappointed that Heather Champ did not pursue looking into this in a more timely fashion .
Â
I have gone above and beyond in giving her an opportunity to address my concerns privately through several email correspondences and a personal conversation .
Seven months is a lifetime in this day and age of blogging on the Internet .
That being said I do n’t let developers off the hook either when it comes to responsibility of releasing applications using Flickrs ’ API .
Although Flickr has ultimate responsibility in managing their API and subscribers , developers have the responsibility to understand the law and not break it .
When a photographer uploads photographs to Flickr they ’re not signing away their rights to their work for 3rd party developers to do what they will with them .
If you ’re a photographer who uses Flickr I would encourage you not to wait 7 months as I have before publicly talking about this .
The only way Flickr is going to address and / or fix this problem is by Flickr members letting them know this situation is unacceptable .

A second mobile phone call to Yuri Popov , the Russian diplomat , chairman of the talks , added an element of the ridiculous to the impasse .
" I called and spoke to Popov and he said he could not get to the office because his car had a flat tyre , " said Mr Yakobashvili .
" This was preposterous .
I said the delegation must have more cars .
He said there is another car but its tyre is flat too .
At this point I knew it was a trap and I was very angry . "
[ This is based on a talk hosted by the LSE Student Union 's Islamic and Feminist Societies on 22nd January 2007 ]
From a personal perspective , I identify as both a Muslim and a feminist and I do n’t see this as in any way contradictory .
To this end , I ’d like to discuss five potential challenges to a reconciliation between feminism and Islam .
From a professional perspective , I am interested in how policy can support Muslim women ’s rights and interests accepting that the term ‘ Muslim women ’ includes myriad of people not all of whom agree with each other .
1 ) Theory vs reality
As a Muslim , I have very little criticism to make of the Qu’ran in terms of its treatment of women .
As a doctrinal text , it did indeed widen women ’s options , and enshrined rights that women did not previously have .
It is , I think , entirely accurate to say that the Qu’ran was an advocate for women ’s liberation .
The practice of Islam all over the world , with some exceptions of course , is generally one of active policing of Muslim women , our bodies , our autonomy .
In this country , we do have forced marriage , we do have murder in the name of honour , and we do have female genital cutting or mutilation within the Muslim community , and using Islam as a justification .
We can argue about the validity of those interpretations of the Message of course , but the reality is that those interpretations exist .
They are real , whatever the theory of how things ought to be .
I know that one defence against this would be to say that there is Islam the religion and Muslims the people , but I do n’t think that ’s good enough .
Because it is Muslims as people that need to be ensuring that Islam the religion fulfils its potential .
I think it has been too easy for some people to excuse the oppression of Muslim women by Muslims by claiming that the ‘ true ’ version of Islam is n’t so sexist .
2 ) History vs present
We seem to be a bit stuck in the past when it comes to finding inspiring Muslim women to learn from .
We have definitely had some inspiring Muslim women in the past .
But have there been no inspiring women in the last millennia ?
What have Muslim women been doing for 1000 years that we ca n’t seem to find them ?
I raise this point because Bibi Khadija ( Prophet Muhammad ’s ( pbuh ) first wife ) and other women of her time are regularly referred to as evidence of Islam ’s progressive approach to the woman question .
And they are excellent examples of , in my opinion , feminist Muslim women .
But I think that we have also had some inspiring Muslim women in our lifetimes .
Shireen Ibadi and Fatema Mernissi are two current examples and there are many others if you do n’t happen to agree with their take on things .
Just as Bibi Khadija challenged the way women were perceived in her time by taking on roles that were the purview of men , so too are there Muslim women challenging prevailing social norms and trying to reframe what options are open to Muslim women in the present .
I would like to see more Muslims , especially Muslim men , embracing these trailblazing women as examples of :
- excellent Muslim leaders , for all Muslims
- inspiring Muslim women for those interested in Muslim women ’s rights
3 ) Sex and gender
There does seem to be a tension between some of the fundamentals of feminism and some of the core ideas within Islam .
Feminism is very much about understanding and then redefining gender roles and relations .
Although feminists disagree about many things , they are committed to equality and freedom for women .
Related to this is the idea of choice .
Thus most feminists subscribe to the idea that women should have the right to choose whether and how they should fulfil roles such as wife , child carer and bread - earner .
Feminism separates biological sex from socialized gender .
In this understanding men can be the primary carers of children while the mother works more outside of the home in paid labour .
Islam on the other hand has more difficulty with the idea that gender is a social construct .
Gender roles are seen to be derivative of biological sex and are therefore not so flexible .
Motherhood , and caring for children and the domestic sphere generally , is understood to be one of the most important , if not the only , responsibilities of a woman .
That is not to say that a Muslim woman cannot join the paid labour market .
But I do think there is deep resistance to the idea that a father could take up more of the caring responsibilities when this happens so that the division of labour in the home is more balanced .
Individual men do of course do this , and it is a process of negotiation that is ongoing and ever - changing .
But the status of motherhood is very high in Islam which I think presents a challenge to the idea that it is a gender role that is socially constructed and not a biological fact .
So the circumstances where men are doing more of the care work I think are very much the exception and not seen as the ideal situation .
4 ) The role of men
A lot of Muslims and a lot of feminists seem to be quite obsessed with the position of Muslim women in Islam .
That ’s great for me of course .
But how helpful is it really in terms of advancing my interests to be the object of constant battle , debate , and discourse ?
Is the issue really about ‘ Muslim women ’ in these discussions ?
Feminism talks about gender inequality as much as it talk about women ’s rights .
And , perhaps most importantly , feminists emphasise gender relations as a primary vehicle for the oppression of women .
But the important point to take away from it is that feminists care about men .
The way to liberating women is to engage with men .
What men are doing matters .
Women can only be un-oppressed if we understand who is gaining from the oppression , why , how they are doing the oppressing , etc .
Men are a part of the conversation about why women lack power in society .
Islam does also recognize the equal importance of men I ’d say , but I do n’t think as Muslims we follow that opportunity through in our debates .
We are perhaps too happy talking about Muslim women , and Muslim women are the battleground of so many of our conversations and debates about what is right and proper and halal .
But why do n’t we talk about what is going on with Muslim men ?
5 ) Rights and law
Both feminism and Islam have a healthy preoccupation with women ’s rights .
They differ , however , in how they attempt to realize these rights .
Feminism ’s purpose is to change society using law when necessary .
They see women as agents and subjects .
They strive to embody the ethos and politics of feminism , and they are the emancipators - doing the actual changing of society so women have more equality .
Islam ’s purpose is to change society as well , but its agent of focus is often the individual .
It seeks to encourage individuals to be ethical and just from within an understanding of the Divine .
It has guidelines about how we should eat , speak , dress , pray , relate to each other , etc. and it is through this self - regulation of individual behaviour that an ethical society could then be built .
Muslims do also flirt with establishing norms in law for example through Shariah .
But it is when these guidelines about self - conduct become codified in law that difficulties arise because a central tenant of Islam is that there is no compulsion in religion .
If I choose to drink or eat pork , it is my potential sin and my soul that could suffer .
It is up to me to take responsibility for my choices to stay on or stray off the Path .
Establishing law when we ’re talking about murder is understandable .
When we ’re speaking of other areas such as dress , individual choice is a more acceptable guiding principle .
If there is no compulsion in religion I should not be forced to wear the hijab .
But I ’m not sure how well Muslims have been grappling with choice in this country .
Are we really ok with women choosing not to wear the hijab ?
In these discussions amongst Muslims , I find that we do n’t use the language of ‘ rights ’ to make our points .
More often I hear the language of ‘ dignity ’ used , as in “ we want to preserve the dignity of Muslim women ” .
And ‘ dignity ’ is used interchangeably with ‘ modesty ’ .
In this narrative , Muslim women are treated more as objects rather than agents or subjects .
And the purpose is not to change society , but to change individuals , to change individual Muslim women .
What I would like to see is :
- Muslims embodying the faith : living righteously and ethically .
- Muslims acting as emancipators : engaging more actively with women ’s rights .
It ’s not enough to say that there ’s nothing contradictory between feminism and Islam .
Muslims must be an active , proactive force for change against the clear , sustained and grave oppression of Muslim women .

Willie Walsh , the chief executive of British Airways , last week said that the airline industry was facing its " worst ever " business environment .

He has said it is inevitable that fares will rise . "
BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) -- Heidi Krieger proved herself one of the world 's top athletes in the 1980s , winning medal after medal in the shot put for East Germany .
Andreas Krieger says his body changed soon after he began taking what coaches said were vitamins .
Now , the former sports star looks disdainfully at the awards , dismissing them as " doping medals " and honors that turned a woman into a man .
Heidi Krieger , the 1986 European women 's shot - put champion , became Andreas Krieger after a sex - change operation in 1997 .
He says he had been fed so many steroids by his coaches without his knowledge that physical and emotional problems began .
The young woman 's physique changed drastically , as did her feelings .
" I felt much more attracted to women and just felt like a man .
But I knew I was not lesbian , " Krieger told CNN .
Her coaches said they were giving her vitamin pills , but they were actually feeding her Oral - Turinabol anabolic steroids .
Watch how Krieger 's body changed »
Krieger is among an estimated 10,000 East German athletes thought to have been given performance - enhancing drugs to help build their country into a sports powerhouse .
In the 1970s and 1980s , the German Democratic Republic was one of the most successful Olympic Games nations .
But after the fall of Soviet Communism , it was revealed just how much steroids were fueling the medal machine .
Sports leaders , including Manfred Ewald , the head of East Germany 's National Olympic Committee from 1973 until 1990 , were convicted in the doping programs .
Krieger , who is now married and runs an army surplus store , says he has taken his life into his own hands and does not want to be seen as a victim .
But he and other former East German athletes tricked by their coaches are worried that too little has been learned from their plight .
Doping remains a major issue in sports , and many drug tests will be conducted in Beijing , China , as officials try to catch any cheats hoping to go undetected and get Olympic glory .
Experts say the next step for sportsmen and women looking for an illegal boost to physical performance could be gene therapy -- so - called " gene doping . "
Sports physician Willi Heepe said gene therapy means the body will basically dope itself .
If that happens , " the human monster will be a reality , " he told CNN .
Krieger is worried that the pressure to win could create new victims .
" If today 's athletes say they want to take the risk , they really do n't know what risk they are taking , " he said .

Advertisement The Mayor of Kamikatsu , a small community in the hills of eastern Japan , has urged politicians around the world to follow his lead and make their towns " Zero Waste " .
He told BBC News that all communities could learn from Kamikatsu , where residents have to compost all their food waste and sort other rubbish into 34 different categories .
Residents say the scheme has prompted them to cut down on waste generally and food waste in particular .
If the policy spread , it would reduce the amount of food waste , and so take some of the pressure off high food prices .
Kamikatsu may be a backwater in the wooded hills and rice terraces of south - eastern Japan but it 's become a world leader on waste policy .
There are no waste collections from households at all .
People have to take full responsibility for everything they throw away .
It 's a good idea to send things back to the earth so I support it
Hatsue Katayama Kitchen waste has to be composted .
Non -food waste is processed either in local shops which accept goods for recycling or in Kamikatsu 's Zero Waste Centre .
There , people have to sort their unwanted items into 34 different boxes for recycling .
Residents have to sort plastic bottles ( used for fruit juice , for example ) from PET ( polyethylene teraphthalate ) bottles ( used for mineral water ) because PET is more valuable when it is separated out .
There are specific boxes for pens , razors and the sort of Styrofoam trays on which meat is often purchased .
These have to be washed and dried .
The scheme was adopted when councillors realised it was much cheaper than incineration - even if the incinerator was used to generate power .
Winning idea Many locals are enthusiastic participants .
Take Kikue Nii , who strips labels off bottles then washes and dries them before sending them to recycling .
She takes her other everyday waste to the local shop where she receives a lottery ticket in return for a bag of cans .
The community uses incentives to encourage recylcing
She has won a £ 5 food voucher four times .
It 's not a huge amount but it 's better than nothing .
She is also a big fan of composting .
" I think I produce less waste because I have to compost it , " she says .
" When I can't use the whole vegetable or meat , I try to cook it again with wine and so on .
It makes a very good soup .
Everyone should have a composter if they can . "
Her neighbours Fumikazu Katayama and his wife Hatsue are ardent composters , too .
Hatsue says : " I have to do it every day ; it 's certainty a bit of work .
But it 's a good idea to send things back to the earth so I support it .
I just do it naturally now ; it 's part of the routine . "
The Katayamas take the rest of their waste to the Zero Waste Centre for sorting - carrying the waste bag between them .
Global question Questions remain about the scheme .
Some of the composters are boosted by electric power , which creates greenhouse gas emissions .
And it 's possible that the savings in greenhouse gases from recycling are negated by the need for people to drive to the Zero Waste Centre .
Old curtains or kimonos are expertly converted into bags Natsuko Matsuoka , one of the originators of the centre , disagrees - she says people generally tie in the journey with a weekly shopping trip .
A poll showed that although the Zero Waste policy has many admirers , 40 % of people were n't happy about all aspects of the scheme .
The Mayor Kasamatsu Kasuichi is undeterred : " We should consider what is right and what is wrong , and I believe it is wrong to send a truck to collect the waste and burn it .
" That is bad for the environment .
So whether I get support or not , I believe I should persuade people to support my policy . "
Now he invites other politicians around the world to follow suit .

What are these ?
It was called “ un mensaje personal a Puerto Rico , ” a television spot in which Barack Obama spoke to the camera in stilted but effective Spanish .
“ I was born on an island , ” he said , “ and I understand that food , gas , and everything costs more . ”
Obama got trounced in the Puerto Rico primary this week .
But the advertisement , with the candidate ’s personalized appeal and willingness to try the language , is a sign of the unusual tactics that Obama ’s campaign is preparing to deploy on the mainland as it tries to win over a Latino electorate that voted overwhelmingly for his party rival , Hillary Rodham Clinton , in Democratic primaries .
Some Democrats have worried that Latinos view Obama warily and will be drawn to Republican nominee John McCain , who has been popular in that community and has campaigned in it aggressively -- already airing Spanish - language radio ads in the heavily Latino battlegrounds of New Mexico and Nevada .

But there are signs that Obama begins the general election battle for Latinos with significant advantages .
A new Gallup Poll summary of surveys taken in May shows Obama winning 62 % of Latino registered voters nationwide , compared with just 29 % for McCain .
Others have found a wide gap as well .
The pro-Democratic group Democracy Corps compiled surveys from March through May that showed Obama with a 19 - point lead among Latinos .
And a Times poll published last month showed Obama leading McCain among California Latinos by 14 points .
Republicans say McCain ’s numbers among Latinos at the moment are disappointing -- far below the goals set by a campaign that has long believed McCain could challenge the traditional Democratic dominance of the Latino electorate .
The numbers suggest that McCain ’s image has suffered after a competitive GOP primary in which he renounced some of the moderate views on immigration popular among many Latinos .
For example , McCain , who was a chief sponsor of legislation creating a path to citizenship for most of the nation ’s estimated 12 million illegal immigrants , now says he believes the government must focus first on securing the U.S. - Mexico border before dealing with illegal workers .

The new position helped mollify some conservatives who viewed McCain as soft on illegal immigration .
But it now leaves the senator forced to come from behind in an area that was supposed to be a strength .
And McCain must weigh two competing needs : attracting Latinos in the Southwest and Florida turned off by the GOP ’s hard - line opposition to his legislation and mobilizing conservative whites who could prove crucial in Ohio and other battlegrounds .
“ If the McCain people do n’t realize they need to beef up that operation , then clearly he ’s not going to be president , ” said Robert de Posada , a Republican consultant on Latino politics .
Obama ’s sizable lead has surprised Democratic strategists after a primary campaign that appeared to foreshadow Latinos as a major weakness .
The Gallup survey of Latinos found that Obama , despite his string of losses to Clinton , performed just as well as Clinton in a theoretical matchup against McCain .

Obama is “ doing better than anyone imagined at this point , ” said Simon Rosenberg , head of the pro-Democratic group NDN , which specializes in Latino outreach .
“ But he does have room to grow . ”
The Obama campaign recently hired a press spokesman to work full time on Spanish - language media .
Helping with the planning is U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - Los Angeles ) , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Federico Pena , a former secretary of both Energy and Transportation under Bill Clinton .
Also , on Thursday , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , who was a point person for Clinton on Latino outreach , said he would campaign vigorously for Obama , and called him “ inspiring . ”
In comments to reporters , though , Villaraigosa sounded nostalgic about Clinton , praising her “ passion and persistence and intestinal fortitude . ”

Richardson said he was in Los Angeles on Tuesday recruiting local Latino actors and comics to serve as surrogates for Obama .
It is part of an effort to paint the Illinois senator , who was born in Hawaii and had an African father , as someone who can relate to the immigrant experience .
The personal approach is a departure from past Democrats who focused primarily on issue - based appeals .
It is similar in tone to the strategy used by President Bush , who highlighted his Texas links to Latino culture and Mexico -- and won more than 40 % of the Latino vote .
“ With Latinos , you stress that Obama ’s a minority like us , ” Richardson said .
“ You stress that he comes from a modest background . ”
Obama does not speak Spanish , but campaign aides said that the Puerto Rico ad showed that he could master pronunciation by studiously rehearsing the script .
Advertisement
Still , some say Obama is far from closing the sale with Latinos .
The Rev. Luis Cortes , a political independent who heads a Latino evangelical network , said Obama had yet to lay out a specific agenda for Latinos and remains very much a stranger compared to Clinton and McCain .
Cortes is scheduled to meet with Obama next week in Chicago , and he said Obama has agreed to address a Latino prayer breakfast later this month .
“ His campaign has been at 10,000 feet , ” Cortes said , “ so the question is how do we get to him ? ”
Both campaigns view the fast - growing Latino vote as crucial to their national strategies .
McCain has told some Republicans that he believes his popularity among Latinos might help him in California , for example , and both campaigns are planning to fight it out for Latino votes in Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada and Florida -- states that could well decide the Electoral College .
Advertisement
Steve Schmidt , a McCain strategist , said the campaign was “ confident ” it would build support over the next five months .
“ The reality is we have to do well and we think we can exceed what President Bush did in 2004 , ” Schmidt said .
“ We think we can top 40 % of the Hispanic vote in this election . ”
The radio ads running in the Southwest promote McCain ’s “ realistic ” plan to “ jump - start ” the economy .
And McCain is trying to show Latinos that , despite his hardened views on immigration , he still will push his party to change its often harsh rhetoric on the issue .
Advertisement
A Memorial Day ad online honored Latino green card holders serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The ad uses a clip from a Republican debate in New Hampshire where McCain called on his fellow party members to “ remember that these are God ’s children ” and said that while immigrants must come to the country legally , “ they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them . ”

The story behind Dean Kamen 's Segway scooter , and his combustive meeting with the kingpins of Apple and Amazon .
Excerpt from Code Name Ginger .
by Steve Kemper
Steve Kemper was given complete behind - the - scenes access to Dean Kamen and the Segway design team during development of the much - hyped " human transporter . "
The result : A new book , Code Name Ginger .
Here 's an excerpt .
 Ed .
Evidently , he 's always late , said Aileen Lee , John Doerr 's associate .
It was almost 8:30 A.M. , half an hour after the meeting was supposed to start , and everyone in the locked and guarded ballroom was still waiting for Steve Jobs .
The December 8 meeting at the Hyatt Regency near the San Francisco airport had been Doerr 's idea .
He wanted Dean to brainstorm about Ginger with him and some friends , including Jobs and Jeff Bezos .
The three billionaires could spare only a couple of hours , so Doerr 's request required a long trip for a short meeting .
Brian
Toohey did n't mind .
Barely settled in as Ginger 's new vice president of regulatory affairs , he was still dazzled by Dean 's roster of acquaintances and it was worth some inconvenience to meet these West Coast business icons .
Tim Adams and Mike Ferry felt a bit more jaded and exasperated .
Traveling to and from San Francisco chopped two days out of a schedule with no fat in it .
Tim and Mike also suspected , as did Dean , that Doerr was setting them up for an ambush on his home turf .
But all of them also realized that people who invest $ 38 million sometimes need their hands held , so Tim , Mike , and Brian had each put together a PowerPoint presentation for what Tim called " another dog and pony show . "
You have a product so revolutionary , you 'll have no problem selling it .
The question is , are people going to be allowed to use it ?
 Jeff Bezos
In addition to Jobs and Bezos , their audience would include Bob Tuttle , Dean 's top lieutenant ; Michael Schmertzler , representing the $ 38 million investment of Credit Suisse First Boston ; Bill Sahlman , professor of entrepreneurial studies at Harvard Business School and the yenta who had introduced Dean to Doerr and other investors ; and Vern Loucks , a minor investor in Ginger as well as a board member .
Schmertzler had changed his mind about not coming , probably because of his evergreen suspicions of Doerr .
Brian , keyed up , got to the ballroom early to check the audiovisual equipment .
By the time the others arrived , he had filled the screen with a giant photo of Dean , wearing jeans and sitting on an iBOT , smiling widely as he shook President Clinton 's hand in the Oval Office .
The smile was missing as Dean pushed a tall hotel luggage carrier into the ballroom .
The carrier held a couple of large black duffels , oddly protuberant , and some taped - up cardboard boxes , including an old Apple computer box .
Dean instructed the security guard to lock the ballroom doors and not to let anyone enter without permission from someone inside .
When the doors were locked , he opened the duffels and the boxes , removed a couple of chassis and control shafts , and assembled two D1 Gingers using a screwdriver and hex wrenches .
He finished in ten minutes , turned one on , and began tearing around the ballroom , looking happier with every revolution .
Jeff Bezos arrived .
Dean zipped up to him , stopping sharply at his shoe tips .
Bezos did n't flinch .
" See how much I trust you ? " said Bezos .
" Is that good judgment ? " said Dean .
Bezos claimed the other Ginger , and his laugh soon gusted through the ballroom .
Doerr entered wearing casual clothes and old sneakers .
Dean surrendered his Ginger to him .
Everyone was having too much fun to mind Jobs 's tardiness .
Dean did n't mind either , for other reasons .
He had flown his jet to San Francisco yesterday , carrying the Gingers .
A limo hired by Doerr had whisked him and the machines to Jobs 's house , where the two of them spent the afternoon .
Jobs did most of the talking .
Ranting , really , about Ginger 's design .
So Dean more or less knew what Jobs was going to say today and was n't in a great hurry to have the Ginger guys hear it .
The others were so intent on Ginger that they did n't notice Jobs walk in .
He was dressed even more casually than Dean , in sneakers , a black turtleneck , and Levi's in which a white pocket poked out of a big front hole .
There was a hole in his wallet pocket , too .
Within a couple of minutes , after some quick introductions , everyone settled around the big square table , Jobs at one corner , flanked by Dean and Doerr .
" Good morning to everyone , " said Tim , smiling at the front of the table .
" Before we start , we 'd like to ask you to hold your questions until after each presentation . "
" Yeah , right ! " snorted Bezos , followed by that honking laugh .
" Otherwise we might as well not be here , " said Jobs .
" How long is your presentation ? " asked Doerr .
" Each pitch is about ten minutes . "
" I can't do that , " said Jobs .
" I 'm not built that way .
So if you want me to leave , I will , but I can't just sit here . "
Tim studied Jobs for a moment , then turned to the screen and put up a spec sheet about Metro and Pro .
" As you can see " began Tim .
" Let 's talk about the bigger question , " interrupted Jobs .
" Why two machines ? "
" We 've talked about that , " said Tim , " and we think  "
I think [ the design ] sucks .
Its shape is not innovative , it 's not elegant and it does n't feel anthropomorphic .
 Steve Jobs
" Because I see a big problem here , " said Jobs .
" I was thinking about it all night .
I could n't sleep after Dean came over . "
There were notes scribbled on the palm of his hand .
He explained his experience with the iMac , how there were four models now but he had launched with just one color to give his designers , salespeople , and the public an absolute focus .
He had waited seven months to introduce the other models .
Bezos and Doerr nodded as he spoke .
" You 're sure your market is upscale consumers for transportation ? " said Jobs .
" Yes , but we know that 's a risk for us , " said Tim , " because we could be perceived as a toy or a fad . "
If they charged a few thousand dollars for the Metro and it was a hit , said Jobs , they could come out with the Pro later and charge double for industrial and military uses .
Tim 's eyebrows shot up approvingly .
He looked at Dean , whose face was a mask , so he turned elsewhere .
" Mike ? " he said , looking at Mike Ferry for a marketing opinion .
" It 's a good point , " said Mike , giving his usual noncommittal response .
" What does everyone think about the design ? " asked Doerr , switching subjects .
" What do you think ? " said Jobs to Tim .
It was a challenge , not a question .
" I think it 's coming along , " said Tim , " though we expect  " " I think it sucks ! " said Jobs .
His vehemence made Tim pause .
" Why ? " he asked , a bit stiffly .
" It just does . "
" In what sense ? " said Tim , getting his feet back under him .
" Give me a clue . "
" Its shape is not innovative , it 's not elegant , it does n't feel anthropomorphic , " said Jobs , ticking off three of his design mantras .
" You have this incredibly innovative machine but it looks very traditional . "
The last word delivered like a stab .
Doug Field and Scott Waters would have felt the wound ; they admired Apple 's design sense .
Dean 's intuition not to bring Doug had been right .
" There are design firms out there that could come up with things we 've never thought of , " Jobs continued , " things that would make you shit in your pants . "
There was n't much to say to that , so after a pause Tim began again : " Well , let 's keep going , because we do n't have much time today to -" " We do have time , " said Doerr curtly , changing his own ground rules .
" We want to get Steve 's and Jeff 's ideas . "
" The problem at this point is lead time in our schedule , " said Tim .
Jobs snapped his head from Doerr on one side to Dean on the other , as if he'd been slapped .
" That 's backwards , " he said , his voice rising .
" Screw the lead times .
You do n't have a great product yet !
I know burn rates are important , but you 'll only get one shot at this , and if you blow it , it 's over . "
Agitated , he turned to Bezos .
" Jeff , what do you think ? "
" I think we'd do a disservice to the machine if we did n't give a great design firm a chance , " said Bezos in a calm , soft voice , trying to lower the volume .
" I think Steve is right that as he so elegantly put it , they could do things that would make us shit in our pants . "
Jobs grunted .
After another pause , Tim moved on to the issue of service , determined to move ahead despite the punches coming at him .
Within two sentences , Jobs was on him again .
Tim put up his next slide , about the new plant , but again Jobs came at him with a flurry of half - insolent questions .
Where are you building a plant ?
Why are you building a plant ?
Why are you manufacturing the machine yourselves ?
Partly , explained Tim , because giving our code to someone else would be a great risk .
Not a good reason , in Jobs 's view , because the code could easily be reverse - engineered .
No it could n't , said Tim .
Could , said Jobs .
He added that Tim should be spending money and management time on other things , especially since there was no way he could convince any world - class manufacturing and procurement people to move to New Hampshire , for God 's sake , his tone implying that only slow - witted rubes could bear such a place .
Dean lifted an eyebrow .
" We have an adequate staff " , said Tim defensively , but it sounded as weak as the adjective .
Tim had lost control of the meeting .
That was probably Doerr 's plan all along .
Dean sat silently , offering no help or defense as Jobs rampaged through Tim 's presentation .
Brian
Toohey spoke next , on the regulatory obstacles Ginger would face and how he intended to overcome them .
Brian was a big , burly man who knew how to boom his voice , which may explain why he got two minutes into his spiel before Jobs began interrupting .
Doerr suggested that instead of going through each slide , everyone should " take a study hall and read the deck " that Brian had handed out , then ask questions .
Bezos had already read it , so he started chatting quietly ( for him ) with Dean .
" Jeff , have you read the entire deck ? " said Doerr in a schoolmaster 's voice .
" Yes , John , I have , " said Bezos , amused .
When the study hall ended , Bezos held up Brian 's handout .
" I think this plan is dead on arrival , " he said .
" The U.S.A. is too hostile . "
The " car guys " were going to lobby against Ginger and they were going to win .
" No they 're not , " said Brian , smiling .
Bezos suggested starting slow , using one city or country as an experimental station .
Once Ginger 's benefits were clear , the company would have a wedge to pound into U.S. regulations .
The perfect place to begin , thought Bezos , was Singapore .
" You only have to convince one guy , the philosopher king , and then you have four million people to test it . "
Vern Loucks , who had been quietly watching the fireworks up to this point , said , " You mean Gob Click Tong .
He 's not a king , he 's the prime minister .
I can get us in to see him if we want to do that , " he added .
Michael Schmertzler had n't said much .
Now he asked when they should instigate a strategic leak to arouse interest in the product .
But Jobs was still shaking his head at Bezos 's suggestion .
Because of the Internet , he said , slow was no longer possible .
People would learn about Ginger in a flash of bits and bytes , and would want one now .
So a small launch in a foreign place was foolish , because if the machine was unavailable in the United States , the company would blow its chance for $ 100 million of free publicity in its biggest market .
Plus , Singapore was a nest of pirates , and the company would end up spending a fortune fighting them .
If the company wanted a slow , controlled launch , better to start on a handful of U.S. college campuses .
" If you show this to Hennessy , " Jobs said to Doerr , referring to John L. Hennessy , president of Stanford University and a world - class engineer , " he 'll shit in his pants . "
Evidently Hennessy did that more readily than Jobs did .
" And if you offer to give him a hundred of them if he 'll run a safety study and a usage study , that 's a done deal in ten minutes , " continued Jobs .
" You do that at ten colleges and maybe at Disney , so people can see them but not buy them . "
But he warned that even this sort of slow launch was filled with dangers .
If one stupid kid at Stanford hurt himself using a Ginger and then announced online that the machine sucked , the company was sunk , because there was no way to control that or counter it if people could n't ride one for themselves .
With a big fast launch , on the other hand , a few malcontents would n't be heard above the general hoopla .
" I understand the appeal of a slow burn , " he concluded , " but personally I 'm a big - bang guy . "
For the first time that day he smiled .
" The risk with a fast burn , " he continued , " is that it exposes you to your enemies .
You 're going to need a lot of money to fight thieves . "
" We have a few things they can't get , " said Dean .
" Specialty components with only one source . "
" They 'll figure out a way around that , " said Jobs .
" I 've spent nine years looking , " said Dean , " and I do n't think so . "
" I think the emphasis of this conversation is wrong , " said Bezos .
" You have a product so revolutionary , you 'll have no problem selling it .
The question is , are people going to be allowed to use it ? "
Jobs said he lived seven minutes from a grocery and was n't sure he would use Ginger to get there .
Bezos agreed .
Schmertzler wondered if it might be wiser to start with commercial sales .
Bezos liked the ideait was safer and could give the business a solid foundation for growth .
By then it was 10:30 .
Bezos and Jobs had to leave .
As they stood , Dean rose too .
He had been almost silent , listening to Jobs like everyone else .
Now he thanked Jobs and Bezos for coming .
" This is the most energetic discussion we 've ever had , " he said , " and like all good energetic discussions it leaves you with more questions than answers , and leaves you questioning everything you thought you knew . "
He paused .
" And that 's good . "
Still , despite the fireworks , Mrs. Clinton ’s associates said she seemed to have come to terms over the last week with the near certainty that she would not win the nomination , even as she continued to assert , with what one associate described as subdued resignation , that the Democrats are making a mistake in sending Mr. Obama up against Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee .
Her associates said the most likely outcome was that she would end her bid with a speech , probably back home in New York , in which she would endorse Mr. Obama .
Mrs. Clinton herself suggested on Friday that the contest would end sometime next week .
But that is not a certainty ; Mr. Obama ’s announcement on Saturday that he would leave his church was just another reminder of how events continue to unfold in the race .
She has signaled her ambivalence about the outcome , continuing to urge superdelegates to keep an open mind and consider , for example , the number of popular votes she has won .
Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee , a superdelegate who has been at the forefront of calling for uncommitted Democrats to make a choice soon after the last vote , said in an interview that Mrs. Clinton called him last week and urged him to “ keep an open mind until the convention . ”
Assuming Mr. Obama reaches the number of delegates and superdelegates he needs to secure the nomination in the coming week , Mrs. Clinton will be faced with three options , associates said : to suspend her campaign and endorse Mr. Obama ; to suspend her campaign without making an endorsement ; or to press the fight through the convention .
Several of Mrs. Clinton ’s associates said it was unlikely she would fight through the convention , given the potential damage it would do to her standing in the party , which is increasingly eager to unify and turn to the battle against Mr. McCain .

Mrs. Clinton would almost surely face the defection of some of her highest - profile supporters , as well as some members of her staff .
She would no doubt also face anger from Democratic leaders .
Rumors of the imminent demise of the MP3 format are exaggerated , and I for one wo n't stand for it .
A recent DVice article claims that the compressed MP3 is going the way of the Dodo bird because everybody 's going to switch to lossless formats , which retain every audio bit on the CDs from which they were ripped .
According to the article , lossless codecs will " destroy " the MP3 format because hard drive and media capacities are on the rise , Blu - Ray movie soundtracks are encoded losslessly , iPod docks are showing up in high - end home stereos and Apple could flick a switch and have iTunes start encoding into Apple Lossless by default .
Balderdash , I say !
The article is correct , of course , about hard drive capacity , Blu - Ray , iPod docks and Apple .
And I agree with Neil Young that high - quality audio codecs have their place .
But on the way to the article 's conclusion – that lossless codecs will destroy the MP3 – the wheels fall off of its argument , so to speak .
While lossless formats are certainly on the rise , especially amongelite file sharers , the MP3 will be with us for a long time .
Here 's why .
1. Flash is the future
As portable flash memory becomes as capacious as the portable hard drives of five years ago , more manufacturers are opting for flash in their MP3 players .
It 's a superior way to store portable music , offering better battery life , longer overall product life and slimmer designs .
Notice how Apple is throwing its weight behind the ( relatively ) low - capacity iPod Touch and iPhone , rather than the 160GB hard drive - based iPod Classic DVice 's article mentions ?
Flash is the future of digital audio players , pure and simple .
As for cellphones , which are increasingly being used to listen to music , almost none of them have hard drives .
The thing is , flash memory units suitable for MP3 players and cellphones currently top out around 16GB , and many of those devices average only around 1 - 2 GB of memory .
That means , for practical purposes , that the average MP3 player actually has less room for music than the first hard drive - based MP3 player ( 5GB ) .
Lower capacities mean compressed formats , as always .
2. Companies like to save money
Say you 're the CEO of a company that makes portable audio devices .
Tooffer a player that can hold , say , 50 albums , would you prefer to encouragethe use of lossless formats by paying ten five times as much for memory and resorting to a larger design ?
Did n't think so .
Or say you 're in charge of a digital music web start - up .
In between wrangling code , forging business deals and avoiding lawsuits , you may find yourself buying server space to store or cache music .
Would you be willing to pay ten times the bandwidth and storage costs in order to provide lossless audio to your customers when most of them can't tell the difference between that an MP3 ?
No , which brings me to my next point .
3. MP3 Sounds Good Enough Most of the Time
I grant that MP3 sdo n't sound as good as WMA or AAC , which are newer technologies , letalone as good as lossless codecs , which do n't lose any data during the compression process .
But people have chosen convenience over audio quality for yearsnow , and audio hardware manufacturers have responded by largely abandoning the middle market between the average listener and audiophiles who'll pay anything for good sound .
Even if that changes , and people start buying better speakers and headphones , any format that 's even slightly more convenient is still going to beat aformat that sounds slightly better .
And by " convenient , " part of what I mean is " compatible with a wide array of devices , " whichbrings me to my next point .
4 . The lossless codec market is fractured
The MP3 came of age during a singularity : the moment when the worldstarted looking online for music .
Not so with lossless formats , whichare being adopted in a vast and varied landscape .
The mainoptions are Apple Lossless , Windows Media Lossless and FLAC ,
and all have significant reasons to survive ( Apple is n't goinganywhere , neither is Microsoft and neither is the open - source movement behind FLAC ) .
Without one dominant lossless format , it 'll be difficult if notimpossible for manufacturers , music stores , and – let 's face it – file sharers to get on the same page , whereas all of the above are compatible with MP3 .
MP3 fileshave been multiplying worldwide at unmeasurable rates since beforethe time of Napster The Elder .
It 's going to take more than Blu - Ray soundtracks , bigger harddrives and an iTunes preferences setting to dislodge it from itsposition as the default digital audio format .
5 . If anything , we 'll move beyond 16 - bit audio
Nothing lasts forever .
Eventually , technology will push us beyond the MP3 to some better - sounding digital format .
But that next leap in mainstream audio codecs , when it happens , will likely involve 24 - bit audio that sounds better than CDs , not lossless files that sound identical and can be reasonably aped by a far more convenient codec .
Viva MP3 !

Waxman : " It may well turn out to be the largest war profiteering in history . "
A BBC investigation estimates that around $ 23 bn ( £ 11.75 bn ) may have been lost , stolen or just not properly accounted for in Iraq .
The BBC's Panorama programme has used US and Iraqi government sources to research how much some private contractors have profited from the conflict and rebuilding .
A US gagging order is preventing discussion of the allegations .
The order applies to 70 court cases against some of the top US companies .
War profiteering While Presdient George W Bush remains in the White House , it is unlikely the gagging orders will be lifted .
To date , no major US contractor faces trial for fraud or mismanagement in Iraq .
The president 's Democratic opponents are keeping up the pressure over war profiteering in Iraq .
Henry Waxman , who chairs the House committee on oversight and government reform , said : " The money that 's gone into waste , fraud and abuse under these contracts is just so outrageous , it 's egregious .
" It may well turn out to be the largest war profiteering in history . "
In the run-up to the invasion , one of the most senior officials in charge of procurement in the Pentagon objected to a contract potentially worth $ 7bn that was given to Halliburton , a Texan company which used to be run by Dick Cheney before he became vice - president .
Unusually only Halliburton got to bid - and won .
Missing billions
The search for the missing billions also led the programme to a house in Acton in west London where Hazem Shalaan lived until he was appointed to the new Iraqi government as minister of defence in 2004 .
Judge Radhi al Radhi : " I believe these people are criminals . "
He and his associates siphoned an estimated $ 1.2 bn out of the ministry .
They bought old military equipment from Poland but claimed for top - class weapons .
Meanwhile they diverted money into their own accounts .
Judge Radhi al - Radhi of Iraq 's Commission for Public Integrity investigated .
He said : " I believe these people are criminals .
" They failed to rebuild the Ministry of Defence , and as a result the violence and the bloodshed went on and on - the murder of Iraqis and foreigners continues and they bear responsibility . "
Mr Shalaan was sentenced to two jail terms but he fled the country .
He said he was innocent and that it was all a plot against him by pro-Iranian MPs in the government .
There is an Interpol arrest warrant out for him but he is on the run - using a private jet to move around the globe .
He stills owns commercial properties in the Marble Arch area of London .

What are these ?
A 21 - year - old student from the UK has designed a cardboard bicycle that he has dubbed " the ultimate green machine . "
Supporting anyone up to 168 pounds , the frame , which costs around $ 6 to make , is made from the cardboard used in industrial packaging , whilst the wheels and chain are standard bike issue , and will cost around $ 24 .

Phil Bridge , who is studying Industrial Design , came up with the idea as he was researching reasons why people do n't use pedal power to get around town .
" A typical round town bike can cost several hundred pounds , " says Mr Bridge .
" That 's a large investment for people who are n't sure whether they will use it .
The idea of cardboard is to completely devalue the bike " .
The bike is still at prototype stage , and Mr Bridge says he still needs to finalize the design .
" The prototype does work but it is still quite limited and there are a few problems , " he says .
Rain , however , is not one of them , he claims .
I realize this pours gas on the bad parenting flames of yesterday , but holy crow , I can't not show you this story .
Yesterday reader tooji tipped me off to the story of Blake Peebles , a 16 - year - old in Raleigh , N.C. , whose parents have let him drop out of school so that he can focus on a professional gaming career via Guitar Hero .
Blake convinced his folks ( that is , " We could n't take the complaining anymore , " said his mom ) to let him drop out last September .
They hired in - home tutors to continue his education there , at least , but there 's no doubt priority number one is Guitar Hero .
There 's a vaguely defined goal of Blake playing it professionally , either through Major League Gaming or by winning prizes in a national and international competitions .
But so far he 's only made about $ 1,000 , most of that value realized in meals and other freebies won at local competitions .
The other pro gamer the reporter contacted for this story said he 's cashed in about $ 25,000 in his entire career .
The description of Blake 's room , his interests ( or lack thereof ) , and his folks ' decision to let him do this just ... well , they do n't make anyone look good .
It would be one thing if the guy was a bona fide music or athletic prodigy .
However quixotic a career in either field might be for the majority who pursue it , at least there 's a long history of it paying off if you are that good enough .
But Blake 's never touched a real guitar ( cue up the get - a - life bait ) .
He did n't seem interested in much of anything in high school ( a Christian academy where his parents had enrolled him ) and wheedled his way out of going by complaining that it was a waste of time .
( That line should sound very familiar to my folks .
If only playing Master of the Lamps on the Commodore 64 could have won me some free Chik - Fil - A . I might have had better luck . )
You gotta read it to believe it , and nearly three weeks after it was first published , it is still one of The News & Observer 's top e-mailed stories .

The Sierra Nevada Corporation claimed this week that it is ready to begin production on the MEDUSA , a damned scary ray gun that uses the " microwave audio effect " to implant sounds and perhaps even specific messages inside people 's heads .
Short for Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio , MEDUSA creates the audio effect with short microwave pulses .
The pulses create a shockwave inside the skull that 's detected by the ears , and basically makes you think you 're going balls - to - the - wall batshit insane .
The MEDUSA can also " produce recognizable sounds " and is aimed primarily at military uses , but New Scientist revealed there are other uses in the works , too .
Advertisement
And if you 're thinking ear plugs are this thing 's Kryptonite , think again .
Lee Sadovnik of Sierra Nevada Corp. said normal audio safety limits are off the table since the sound bypasses the eardrums and emanates from within the skull .
" The repel effect is a combination of loudness and the irritation factor , " he said .
" You ca n't block it out . "
Wet blanket James Lin of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois in Chicago wants more testing done , however , because of the perceived health ramifications of such a device .
Lin said lower , whisper - level intensities work fine , but the higher incapacitating levels expected by the military could fry more than a few brains out on the battlefield .
" I would worry about what other health effects it is having , " Lin said .
" You might see neural damage . "

And those " other uses " hinted at above ?
Try subliminal advertising ; or suggestive subconscious comments that you do n't really " hear " but can influence decision - making anyway .
Or , alternatively , the beam can be ramped up to 11 and just kill you outright .
WIN !
Fun Gizmodo Fact :
The MEDUSA is useless against a raging pack of schizophrenics .

" Raise less corn and more hell , " Mary Elizabeth Lease harangued Kansas farmers during America 's Populist era , but no such voice cries out today .
America 's 21st - century financial victims make no protest against the Federal Reserve 's policy of showering dollars on the people who would seem to need them least .
Long ago and far away , a brilliant man of letters floated an idea .
To stop a financial panic cold , he proposed , a central bank should lend freely , though at a high rate of interest .
Nonsense , countered a certain hard - headed commercial banker .
Such a policy would only instigate more crises by egging on lenders and borrowers to take more risks .
The commercial banker wrote clumsily , the man of letters fluently .
It was no contest .
The doctrine of activist central banking owes much to its progenitor , the Victorian genius Walter Bagehot .
But Bagehot might not recognize his own idea in practice today .
Late in the spring of 2007 , American banks paid an average of 4.35 % on three - month certificates of deposit .
Then came the mortgage mess , and the Fed 's crash program of interest - rate therapy .
Today , a three - month CD yields just 2.65 % , or little more than half the measured rate of inflation .
It was n't the nation 's small savers who brought down Bear Stearns , or tried to fob off subprime mortgages as " triple - A . "
Yet it 's the savers who took a pay cut -- and the savers who , today , in the heat of a presidential election year , are holding their tongues .
Possibly , there are n't enough thrifty voters in the 50 states to constitute a respectable quorum .
But what about the rest of us , the uncounted improvident ?
Have we , too , not suffered at the hands of what used to be called The Interests ?
Have the stewards of other people 's money not made a hash of high finance ?
Did they not enrich themselves in boom times , only to pass the cup to us , the taxpayers , in the bust ?
Where is the people 's wrath ?
The American people are famously slow to anger , but they are outdoing themselves in long suffering today .
In the wake of the " greatest failure of ratings and risk management ever , " to quote the considered judgment of the mortgage - research department of UBS , Wall Street wears a political bullseye .
Yet the politicians take no pot shots .
The British mercenary Simon Mann was today sentenced to 34 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea .
The Eton-educated former SAS officer was sentenced after a trial last month during which it was claimed that a number of western governments knew about the coup plans .
The court heard that Sir Mark Thatcher , the son of the former British prime minister , was a committed member of the group .
Mann was arrested in Harare , Zimbabwe , in 2004 with dozens of mercenaries when their private plane landed .
He acknowledged knowingly taking part in the attempt to topple the government , but his lawyer argued Mann was a secondary player .
The sentence is longer than expected .
During the trial , José Olo Obano , Equatorial Guinea 's attorney general , urged the court to sentence Mann to 31 years , eight months and three days .
The death penalty was not permitted under the terms of Mann 's extradition from Zimbabwe .
It was suggested last month that Mann may be released before completing any sentence .
Mann , wearing a grey prison uniform , stood impassively as the sentence was read out by the presiding judge , Carlos Mangue , in the heavily guarded courtroom .
Another defendant , Mohamed Salaam , a Lebanese businessman , received a jail sentence of 18 years , while four Equatorial Guinean nationals were given terms of six years each .
Another was jailed for one year , and one other was acquitted .
Mann was ordered to pay a fine and compensation to the Equatorial Guinea state totalling around $ 24 m ( £ 12.1 m ) .
Mangue said in the ruling that Mann failed to show " an attitude of regret " , despite his apology before the court .
During the trial in Malabo , a contrite Mann claimed he was " not the person I was " after four years in prison .
He claimed that Spain and South Africa , with the endorsement of the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , had supported the plot .
By January 2004 , two months before the attempted coup was put into action , it was , Mann said , " like an official operation .
The governments of Spain and South Africa were giving the green light : ' You 've got to go , you 've got to do it . ' "
Senior members of the Equatorial Guinea army , police and cabinet were also implicated , Mann said , and he was given details of President Teodoro Obiang 's daily movements and his health problems .
From the Pentagon in Washington , and from the CIA and the big US oil companies , came tacit approval for regime change , according to Mann .
Thatcher " was not just an investor , he came completely on board and became a part of the management team " , Mann claimed during his trial .
He said Thatcher had provided $ 350,000 ( £ 178,000 ) in funding for the coup .
Thatcher pleaded guilty in South Africa to unwittingly funding the purchase of an aircraft allegedly linked to the mercenaries .
He was given a four - year suspended sentence and fined £ 265,000 , after entering into a plea - bargain deal .
Mann was convicted in Zimbabwe of attempting to buy arms for an alleged coup plot and sentenced to seven years imprisonment .
He was rendered from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea in January .
His lawyers accused Zimbabwean officials of a criminal conspiracy in secretly flying him out of the country before his appeals procedure was finished .
Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has ruled the small west African nation of Equatorial Guinea since a 1979 coup overthrew his uncle .
He pockets vast profits from offshore oil drilling .
Equatorial Guinea is Africa 's third - largest oil producer , but the bulk of its population remains very poor .
Obiang 's regime is accused of being one of Africa 's worst violators of human rights .
Mann told the court that he took Thatcher to the Chelsea home of Ely Calil , the Lebanese businessman who is alleged by the government of Equatorial Guinea to have been the main financier of the plot .
He named the management board as Calil , himself , a London property developer , Thatcher and a Lebanese colleague of Calil who lives in Beirut .
Calil has always strongly denied involvement in the coup plot and says Mann was pressured into repeated in court allegations that previously been extracted from him under torture in Zimbabwe .
Thatcher 's money was used to buy a small plane that would transport the new provisional president , Severo Moto , from his opposition exile in Spain to Malabo via the Canary Islands .
Mann accepted he was doing the job for money – said to be $ 15 m - but he claimed he was sympathetic to the story he was told that oil money was not reaching the people .
" I believed it was right . "
Sweden Rolling Out 183 MPH High - Speed Green Train
August 12th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Maybe you ’ve heard about the proposed high - speed train in California .
Well , Sweden is beating the West Coast to the punch with their Green Train .
The Green Train , or Gröna Tåget , will cut energy use on rail lines by 30 percent through lowered operational costs and journey times .
Top speeds reached 183 MPH on a test run .
Best of all , the Green Train can operate on the current rail infrastructure .
That means there ’s no need to lay down new tracks .
Energy saving measures on the train include a permanent magnet motor to increase propulsion chain efficiency and a system that saves up to 15 percent of traction energy by assisting drivers with speed and traction force information .
While the Green Train is significantly slower than California ’s proposed high - speed rail ( and the same speed as the French high - speed train ) , it has set a Swedish speed record .
Additionally , it is already in the testing stages , while the California rail wo n’t be ready for at least 20 years .
Research on the Green Train will conclude in 2010 or 2011 , so it should n’t be too long before the system is operational .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
毎週お届けしている本コラムも今年の12月には10周年を迎える。筆者は連載当初から参加しているメンバのひとりであり、10周年かと思うとなかなか感慨深いものがある。この10年を振り返ってという話題はまた別の機会に譲るとして、筆者自身はずいぶんと変化した。そのひとつに「連載当初はバリバリとプログラミングをしていた一方で、最近は自らコードを書くことがめっきり少なくなった」ということが挙げられる。「これが35歳定年説の実体か?」とも思いつつ、それでも先日、とあるプログラムを書くためにコードの森を探検するチャンスが久しぶりにあった。今回はそのときに気がついた「ちょっとしたトピック」を紹介しよう。
C言語によるオブジェクト指向プログラミング
世の中に 「オブジェクト指向プログラミング」という考え方がある。古くから提唱されている概念であり、近代的なプログラム言語はほとんどオブジェクト指向でデザインされているといっても過言ではない。オブジェクト指向の概念を乱暴に説明すると、扱うデータを「オブジェクト」と呼ぶ塊として捉え、さらにそのデータを操作するプログラム(これを「メソッド」と呼ぶ)も、そのオブジェクトの持ち物として扱おうというものだ。これによりデータとアルゴリズムが散逸することを防ぎ、プログラム開発の効率が高まったり、プログラムを維持する保守性が向上したりといったメリットが期待されている。
ところで未だに様々なシーンで活用されており根強い支持を受けているプログラム言語にC言語がある(本コラムのバックナンバー「C言語はなぜ廃れないか」も参照されたい)。C言語は歴史も古く、当然ながらオブジェクト指向言語ではない。しかしオブジェクト指向の考え方に基づくプログラミングスタイルはC言語でもそれなりに実現することができ、例えばCOOL
( C- language ’s Object Oriented Language ) といったプログラミング手法も提唱されている。筆者もその昔画像処理のC言語ライブラリを開発した際に、オブジェクト指向をベースとしてC言語ライブラリを設計した経験がある。C言語ながらオブジェクト指向を取り入れて美しくデザインされたGTK+というプログラムライブラリに感銘を受け、見様見真似で自らのライブラリを設計したものだ。
オブジェクト指向プログラミング言語ではないC言語で、なぜわざわざオブジェクト指向をやろうとするのか。その答えはいくつかあるが、ここでは「オブジェクト指向の考え方は優れているが、それをプログラム言語でサポートしようとするとどうしてもプログラム言語の仕様が膨らんでしまう」という点を指摘しておきたい。「C言語はなぜ廃れないか」でも指摘したように、C言語はハードウェアに近いシンプルなプログラミング言語である。一方で、オブジェクト指向プログラミング言語の多くはいわゆる高級言語として提供される場合が多い。それ故に、システムに近いところをプログラミングしたり、汎用性を確保したり、パフォーマンスを重視したりといったプログラミングではC言語が有利となる。このようなC言語の柔軟性とオブジェクト指向の開発効率を両立させようとしたとき、C言語でオブジェクト指向プログラミングをする意義が出てくる。
オブジェクトシステムの実現
先に紹介したGTK+から派生したライブラリで、GObjectというシステムがある。このGObjectはまさに、C言語でオブジェクト指向プログラミングを実現しようとするための基礎的なコードを提供するものである。本ライブラリも版を重ね、かなり高度なオブジェクトシステムを構築することができるようになっている。
ところが物事は一般的に、多機能になればなるほど複雑になる。そして複雑になればなるほど使い方が難しくなる。そこで高度に複雑化したGObjectには、オブジェクトを簡単に使えるようにするためのからくりがいくつか用意されている。そのひとつがGObject Builderと呼ばれる仕組みである。このGObject Builderを使えば、GObjectを設定するための複雑なC言語プログラム・ソースコードを書かずとも、簡略化されたGObject Builder用ソースコードを書くだけでGObjectを利用できるというのだ。
GObject Builder用のソースコードは、C言語にオブジェクト指向のエッセンスを散りばめた独特のプログラムスタイルで記述される。同プロジェクトのウェブサイトに掲載されている説明によれば、その文法はJavaの影響を受けているとのこと。Javaの文法がその根本的な部分に関してC言語に影響を受けていることと対称的で面白い。
C++が通った道と同じ道
さてここまで読んで「cfront」という言葉を思い浮かべた方は、古くからC++プログラミングに親しんできたベテラン開発者か、もしくは特殊な環境でC++プログラミングをされている開発者の方に違いない。
C++というプログラム言語がある。これはC言語にオブジェクト指向プログラミングの文法を組み込んだ、C言語のオブジェクト指向拡張ともいえるプログラム言語である(同様のアイデアでC言語を拡張したプログラム言語に、Objective-Cという言語もある)。このC++、現在でこそC++で書かれたプログラムのソースコードを、直接、オブジェクトコードに変換できるが、その昔は、いったんC言語のソースコードに変換してからC言語のコンパイラ経由でオブジェクトコードに変換していた。そのC言語ソースコードへのトランスレータがcfrontと呼ばれるツールだった。
GObject Builderを利用したプログラミングは「 GOBソースコード → Cソースコード → オブジェクトコード」という変換をたどる。これは「C++ソースコード → Cソースコード → オブジェクトコード」という昔のC++プログラミングを彷彿とさせる手続きだ。
GObject Builderの立場は「あくま でC言語プログラムの一部として利用するためのツール」であり、新たな言語を開発したのではないという違いはある。GObject Builderの開発者はこのことを意識していたかどうか、とくにこの件に関する記述が関連文書の中には見つからなかったため、その答えは定かではない。しかしcfrontの出力したCプログラムを追いかけてデバッグしていた時代を懐かしく思い出したオジサンプログラマは、「歴史は繰り返すものだなあ」と感慨に耽った次第である。
TGR was lucky enough to get invited to EA ’s EA3 last month .
We saw lots of great and promising upcoming games from EA , including Dead Space , Rock Band 2 , and Left 4 Dead .
One of the most promising and talked about game at EA3 was Mirror ’s Edge , being developed by Swedish developers DICE , better known for the Battlefield series .
With everyone set , a member of the Mirror ’s Edge team walked us through an early level within in the game .
There were two things that DICE wanted to let us know before they got onto showing us the game .
First is the essence of speed : picking up speed and gaining momentum is one of the major factors to consider while playing the game .
They also focused on keeping the controls very simple , making the game ’s speed as accessible as possible .
By using the L1 and L2 , you are able to control some of the movements of the character , L1 for upwards motion and L2 for downwards .
By running up to a ledge and by pressing L1 , you can jump over it .
L2 is used to crouch or a crawl , but it can also be used as a power slide if you have enough momentum and speed behind you .
By combining the two , you are able jump over a ledge , and instead of having a heavy fall and breaking your momentum , by pressing the L2 button at the right time , you can roll when the character lands that would keep you ’re speed an momentum going .
DICE explained that individual moves are kept as simple as possible , but that the real skill lies within stringing together series of moves to keep your speed and momentum up .
A feature that was shown early on during the walkthrough is called Running Vision .
While in game , it turns objects red that could be targets , or used as escape routes if the going gets tough .
We were told that the feature could be turned off at the beginning of the game for the players that want a challenge , but having a simple , visual cue for the player to use makes sense : the character would have a better sense of their capabilities than the player could ever hope to learn in a few hours of gameplay .
Next , we were shown one of the many sewers that are in the city .
Modeled after real tsunami sewers in Tokyo , DICE thought it would be a great idea to have these drains in the city as they provide great spaces to have fun and to provide difficult obstacles to overcome .
Our guide mentioned that there are multiple ways to get through most situations .
After been chased down into the sewers by a helicopter , a sniper team appeared , and there were two options that could be taken : pick up a sniper rifle yourself and take them out from a distance , or move you forward and take them out close range .
He decided to try and get close to them , but eventually got shot by one of them .
This actually showed us how the game manages health .
Like many modern games , there is no pretty gauge or row of hearts : the world gets desaturated and blurry , and the more distorted your vision is , the closer to death you are .
Also like many modern games , health regenerates when not in combat .
DICE really wants the player to choose if and when they need a weapon in Mirror ’s Edge .
Having a weapon really slows down the player , and many maneuvers are unavailable with weapon in hand .
Weapons are meant as a last resort , but using martial arts is a good way to go .
DICE explained to us that “ combat is basically like Gears of War : the combat is all about duck and cover and in our game , it is about isolating and disarming . ”
In one example , there were four enemies on the screen , all with machine guns , and were you to go head first , you would fail .
“ You have to use your moves to slip them up and then take them out one at a time , ” we were told .
Watching our guide pull off disarming moves and finish them off one by one felt a lot more intense and personal than just running in , guns blazing .
So why first - person ?
DICE explained to us that they wanted to do this action adventure game in first - person because there are enough third - person action adventure games out there already , and it would n’t be anything new .
“ We felt that first - person is giving us something different and new .
We felt that first person is more a immediately visceral experience than third person .
There is actually a difference between watching and actually moving , actually being in that action and being an action hero .
Watching the chase sequence and actually being in it .
So we wanted to bring something new to this genre . ”
They were n’t kidding : every movement you make ( jump , fall , land , run , attack ) forces the camera to respond like you ’re right there .
We did ask if the player would feel disorientated while playing the game .
Our guide pointed out a red box at the center of the screen , and explained that it helped the player to keep their eyes focused on one spot , much like a figure skater would when spinning .
" You need that red cue in the center of the game .
We found that when you take it away , you get motion sickness because a flat screen is n’t what your brain is used to seeing .
In the end , it does n’t know what to look at so it looks at everything .
So we needed that box for you to focus and control your eyes as what you are supposed to be looking at . ”
Mirror ’s Edge is shaping up something amazing .
It ’s such a beauty to look at : bright , clean , and vibrant colors really separate it from all the other big games that seem to want to use different shades of gray .
The game has been in development for two years now , and we saw from this walkthrough that every day has been a job well done , as this could be the most exciting , original , and imaginative title of the year .
EA and DICE have something very special here .
”
The motorcade that blew through the chilly morning recently turned more than a few heads in a city that ’s seen it all : a dozen full - throated Harley - Davidsons ridden by guys covered with black leather and tattoos , and an elderly U.S. senator bringing up the rear .
Ted Stevens emerged from his car for a campaign rally to the sound of cheers from his supporters and a round of hearty handshakes from his burly motorcycle escorts .
“ We love him , ” said Michael Kane , leader of the local Harley club , before he and his men moved inside the packed campaign headquarters to empty the doughnut platters .
“ He ’s done 40 years of service to this state , getting money for the state for stuff we absolutely need .
He ’s a great man . ”
If there have been any immutable facts of life in a state chiseled by shifting glaciers , it is the state ’s two iconic politicians : Stevens , 84 , the nation ’s longest - serving Republican senator ; and Don Young , 75 , the Republican who has held Alaska ’s only House seat for the last 35 years .

Together , they have helped build one of the nation ’s wealthiest states out of an unruly territory , pushing foreign fishing fleets out of Alaskan waters , opening the way to oil development on the North Slope and using their considerable power from decades on Capitol Hill to funnel billions of dollars of federal money into roads , schools , hospitals and rural development .
But the two men who once were considered unbeatable now face bruising fights in Tuesday ’s primary election that could put their once solidly Republican congressional seats up for grabs .
Both have been caught up in a long - running federal investigation that has already seen three GOP state lawmakers , the former governor ’s chief of staff and three others convicted on corruption charges .
Stevens was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of concealing $ 250,000 in home renovations and gifts from an oil services firm .
Young , who faces a highly unusual election challenge from his party ’s lieutenant governor , has spent more than $ 1 million defending himself , though he has not been charged .
Many Republicans across the state have rallied to the politicians ’ defense , arguing that the state risks losing their proven ability to deliver billions of dollars in federal grants and projects for Alaska .

“ This indictment thing ?
You go to Washington , D.C. , and if anybody can throw the first stone , I ’d like to meet them , ” said Judy Geraghty , a Fairbanks resident who attended Stevens ’ campaign rally .
Stevens “ has done so much for the state .
And it took time to build up the seniority to be able to do it .
Why throw that away ? ”
But some Alaskans have another view .
A large sign in the shape of a slice of bread appeared briefly near Wasilla this month .
“ Ted ’s Toast , ” it said .
“ There ’s a definite attitude of wanting a change , to the point where a lot of people do n’t care what it is .
Just make a change ; get them out .
We hear that on both sides of the aisle , Republican and Democrat , ” said Diane Benson , a Native Alaskan writer and Democratic Party activist who is running for Young ’s seat .
Young is running neck and neck in the polls with his leading Republican challenger , Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell .
Stevens appears likely to win the primary , but in a general election match - up , he is trailing Anchorage ’s Democratic mayor , Mark Begich .

“ We could lose .
This could become a blue state ; Obama could take this state , ” said Anchorage developer David Cuddy , who leads the pack of six Republicans challenging Stevens in the primary .
“ Can you imagine if Sen .
Stevens is spending the final five weeks of this campaign in a federal courthouse , facing felony corruption charges , and every night the news is covering it ?
He ’s going to lose 2 - to - 1 in November . ”
The internal Republican struggle , pitting moderates like Stevens and Young against Gov. Sarah Palin ’s supporters from the religious right , is the most serious of its kind in a state that has n’t favored a Democrat for president since 1964 , said Carl E. Shepro , a political science professor at the University of Alaska .
“ People are -- I do n’t know if ‘ disgusted ’ is the right word , but -- with the appearance that you can do these things and think you ’re going to get away with it , ” Shepro said .
“ And the other thing is :
It seems like they ’ve all sold out for very little money -- and that ’s kind of embarrassing . ”
Stevens has predicted that he will be acquitted and has successfully pushed to have the trial moved up to Sept. 26 in order to put the case behind him before the general election .

Cuddy , 55 , only started seriously campaigning in late July , after Stevens was indicted .
Former U.S. Treasurer Angela “ Bay ” Buchanan , who managed the three unsuccessful presidential campaigns of her brother , conservative Patrick J. Buchanan , has signed on to run his election effort .
“ If the election were held tomorrow , I think Ted Stevens would beat me , ” Cuddy admitted .
But his campaign had already made great strides and , he said , still had some time to work with .
Young was blindsided when Parnell announced his candidacy at the GOP state convention in March but insists now that there are no hard feelings .
“ This is what our democracy ’s all about .
People go up and say , ‘ I have a better dream .
I think I can represent the people a little bit better . ’
Then the American people get to choose , ” said Mike Anderson , the congressman ’s campaign spokesman .
Advertisement
He said Young was offering Alaskans 18 terms in Congress and the political muscle in Washington that comes with them .
“ What he ’s said is : I think I have some experience ; I have seniority -- you ’ve blessed me with that seniority -- and now there ’s more things we can do together in terms of an economic future for Alaska , ” Anderson said .
Parnell , 45 , has been endorsed by the governor and shares , with Cuddy , a determination to reject the pork - barrel politics that were the two incumbents ’ most famous gift to the state .
“ Alaskans two years ago really began to take back the government as a people .
Alaskans were disgusted with backroom negotiations , a lack of transparency in public processes and just a lack of ethics and character in government , ” Parnell said .

How will that measure up against pledges by Young and Stevens to use their clout to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the outer continental shelf to oil drilling and construct a new pipeline to carry North Slope gas to market ?
" I have sought reelection because I think it ’s vital that we win , ” Stevens , wearing a military - style windbreaker with an American flag pin , told supporters in Fairbanks .
Then he made an uncharacteristic plea for help .
“ I ca n’t remember a time in these 40 years that I ever refused to see an Alaskan or try to solve the problems they brought to me , ” he said .
“ I ’ve got one major problem now , and that is to be reelected .
So I would ask each of you to stand with me now . ”

Linda : Spalding Education International has been an oasis of research - based reading long before The National Reading Panel identified the components of successful instruction .
Oasis is an apt description because Spalding Education International ( SEI ) is located in Phoenix , Arizona , on the edge of the Sonoran desert .
From there ,
The Spalding Method has spread throughout the United States with outposts in Australia , New Zealand and South America .
Unlike the big publishing houses that embrace each reading fad as it came along , SEI stays true to the mission of its founder , master teacher / author Romalda Spalding , preserving and spreading The Spalding Method .
Those familiar with Spalding know that it is a total language arts program , teaching spelling ( with handwriting ) , reading and composition .
However , Spalding is not as well known as it should be , given its wonderful results .
Why the low profile ?
Dr. Mary North , Spalding ’s Director of Research and Development , has agreed to answer that and other questions about the Method and SEI .
Mary :
When Romalda Spalding was in her 80s and still actively teaching teachers , school administrators grew concerned about what would happen to The Method after her death .
With her collaboration , they set about creating an organization to preserve and perpetuate the method she had devoted her life to teaching .
Spalding Education International is a non-profit organization because Mrs. Spalding ’s primary focus was always on keeping costs low so that The Spalding Method would be available to anyone who needed it .
As per her instructions , everything SEI earns is plowed back into developing and updating courses , creating needed instructional materials and , of course , to pay for staff and office .
There is little money left over for promotion .
Linda :
Word of mouth has spread the good news about Spalding , but literacy would take a great leap forward if Spalding was better known .
When I started teaching Spalding , I bought The Writing Read to Reading ( WRTR ) , text for The Spalding Method , and the phonogram cards and that was all there was .
I see that you have more instructional materials now .
Tell me what changes you have made since WRTR was first published in 1957 and why you have made them .
Mary :
The Writing Road to Reading is in its fifth revised edition , making it the longest continuously published textbook in the history of HarperCollins .
Much has changed in education since Mrs. Spalding wrote her book , and not for the better .
She did not go into great detail regarding teacher instructions because she assumed a background knowledge that , for the most part , is no longer taught to teachers or students .
The 5th revised edition makes explicit the knowledge base , insights and classroom techniques that were inferred in earlier editions , making the Method easier to teach and to learn .
The revisions made to Spalding teacher courses are designed to do the same thing .
So , in answer to your question , the revisions and new materials are to help those who teach Spalding and , by doing that , expand our outreach .
Linda : I was introduced to The Spalding Method in the book , Turning Back the Tide of Illiteracy by Marguerite Field Hoerl , so I ordered The Writing Road to Reading .
In our local library I found an old book by Mr. & Mrs. Spalding ; a guide to teaching oneself the method .
I studied both books carefully , then followed their suggestion that I study the WRR for at least 40 hours before attempting to teach it .
In addition , I ( as teacher ) lead myself ( as student ) in making the spelling notebook .
Only then did I begin teaching my high school special education students .
When I finally was able to take a Spalding course , and even though I had carefully studied the books and followed them as best I could , I was stunned at the amount of additional information and new skills that I gained during the course .
I soon realized that I had learned more — not only about the teaching of reading , but about teaching in general — in that two week course than during all of my " teaching methods courses " at university .
I returned to my classroom prepared and confident that my teens would finally learn to read , and they did .
How do other teachers respond to the courses and content ?
Mary :
Teachers who take the courses find them enormously helpful and often ask why this information was not part of their personal or professional preparation .
SEI provides two 45 - hour courses for teachers as well as on - site follow - up .
The courses are aligned with the 5th edition of WRTR and are now called Integrated Language Arts 1 and ILA 2 .
Linda : I see on your web page that you have added courses for parents .
Mary : Yes , Spalding for Home Educators is new this year .
It is offered in two parts .
Part 1 ( 15 hours ) focuses on basic skills needed for teaching kindergarten through grade 2 . Part 2 ( 15 hours ) expands instruction to grade 3 and above .
Although we have had many requests over the years for such a course , it has been surprisingly difficult to launch .
Home educators are a loose - knit group not easily reached with information .
Frankly , we need help to spread the message that we will offer the course anywhere we have an available instructor and 10 or more parents who want to take it .
The details are on our web page .
Some home educator sites link to our web site , which is helping , and we welcome others to do so .
Speaking of our web page , we have added a forum where teachers and home educators can submit any questions they may have about teaching Spalding .
A qualified staff member will usually be able to answer within 24 hours .
Linda :
What is the difference between Spalding for Home Educators and A Parent Introduction to Spalding , your other parent course ?
Mary :
The 10 - hour Parent Introduction is for parents of children in schools where Spalding is taught .
It is less detailed since they are not the primary educators of their children .
Principals and teachers love the interaction — that the course fosters — between home and school .
Additionally , parents are delighted to know how to help their children at home .
Linda :
What about the other instructional materials I see on your web page .
Tell me about them .
Mary :
The K - 6 Teacher Guides are a response to requests , from both home educators and classroom teachers , for more direction .
The Guides are designed to be used in conjunction with the 5th revised edition of WRTR .
In addition to providing guidance for lesson planning , the guides elaborate on lesson delivery ; assessment and evaluation ; plus contain many tips for more effective teaching .
Another reason for creating the Guides was to meet state and local textbook adoption committee expectations .
Teacher Guides have become an industry standard and adoption committees have a hard time understanding a program that does not provide them .
Linda :
You added something called a Word Analysis CD this year .
What is that ?
Mary :
All words listed in sections A - Z of The Writing Road to Reading have been analyzed to expedite lesson planning .
The CD can be used to sort words by rules , parts of speech , spelling lists , and syllable patterns , all categories needed for teaching the week ’s spelling / vocabulary words .
Teachers and parents tell us it saves a great deal of time .
Linda :
That sounds really useful .
Do you have other products that will be coming out in the future ?
Mary :
Yes , a couple of things .
In response to home educators ’ requests for decodable books aligned to Spalding phonogram introduction , eight ( 8 ) Kindergarten decodable readers will be available for the 2008 - 09 school year .
They are specifically written to provide phonogram practice .
These handsomely illustrated readers , used with WRTR and the Guide , will be introduced at weekly intervals , beginning with week eight .
They will incorporate the phonograms taught that week , along with those already taught .
The complete set will include 8 narratives , 8 informatives and 4 informative - narratives .
The books will also be sold individually .
Providing nascent readers with books is important , and their excitement over being able to read a real book is wonderful to behold .
In addition , we believe the decodables will help textbook adoption committees who have frequently cited our lack of readers as a reason for rejecting The Spalding Method .
Linda : And after Kindergarten ?
Mary :
First grade decodables are in the planning stage .
Mrs. Spalding believed that children have no need for special readers after first grade .
After that grade , children can read the good literature recommended in WRTR .
We provide a grade level reading list and leave it to the teacher or parent to select appropriate books .
Linda : I read in The Spalding News that you are engaged in a research study .
Please tell me about that .
Mary :
This research project is a four - year study by Arizona State University to establish the efficacy of The Spalding Method .
We have plenty of evidence that Spalding - taught children progress faster and have higher test scores than students taught by other language arts programs , but we need the kind of scientific study outlined in NCLB .
So far we are delighted with the Kindergarten and first grade results .
We publish each year ’s report , as it becomes available , in The Spalding News and on our Internet website .
Linda :
That is exciting , but not surprising .
In addition to being a God send to my younger students , Spalding has been my best tool for remediating reading problems in older , discouraged students .
I even used Spalding at the local jail , where I was forced to do some of the fastest instruction ever !
Since the turnover in a local jail is great , I usually had new students arrive , and others leave , each week .
Since I was only allowed in one evening a week , I targeted spelling with rapid testing / teaching / testing .
I now use Spalding at the university level , putting my freshman composition classes through rapid remediation in handwriting and spelling before we move on to developing higher skills for using the three types of writing .
Mary , how did you u2018 discover ’
Spalding , and how did you become so involved with this wonderful , successful , precise way of teaching reading , spelling , and writing ?
Mary : I am here because of the amazing progress my 7th grade remedial students made with Spalding .
That was some 30 years ago when , as a new teacher , I was desperate to help my students .
On the advice of a friend , whose son had been tutored with Spalding , I bought the book .
I taught my students and myself almost simultaneously .
The results were amazing .
My colleagues wanted to know what I knew that they did n’t .
The word got around and the administration asked me to bring Mrs. Spalding in to teach other teachers .
One thing led to another and Spalding was eventually adopted district - wide .
Linda :
Did you then retire from the district and go to work for Spalding ?
Mary :
It was about then when my administrator asked me to assist with the creation of what is now called SEI .
Mrs. Spalding brought her nephew , Warren North , to Phoenix to help .
Warren had just retired from NASA where he had been involved in the selection of the first seven astronauts .
Understanding that improving literacy was the key to improving education , Warren agreed to serve as president of SEI .
The two of us met and the rest , as the saying goes , is history .
Linda :
You were obviously in the right place at the right time .
Surely , Spalding served as Cupid in introducing you and your husband .
What about the rest of your staff ?
How many are there , by the way ?
Mary :
There are 11 of us .
Linda : Only 11 ?
The big publishing houses have departments bigger than your whole crew .
Mary :
We are all dedicated to perpetuating The Spalding Method and have become very good at multi-tasking !
We need to keep expenses down in order to keep doing what we do .
The research study , as important as it is to the future of Spalding , is an enormous drain on our budget .
It required that we identify five experimental schools and provide , at our expense , all the training and materials that the teachers need .
Finding control schools with matched populations was a big investment in staff time and took much effort , as well .
Of course , the real key to Spalding success is the highly motivated cadre of Spalding Teachers and the Spalding Teacher Instructors who teach our courses .
They are the real future of Spalding .
Seven of them serve with me on the Curriculum Development Committee .
The Committee wrote the 5th revision of WRTR , and designed the Guides and our other instructional materials .
All committee members are Spalding Certified — some , like me , by Mrs. Spalding herself .
Linda : I do envy those of you who had the opportunity to study under her !
Those of us who have been Spalding partisans over the years have wondered how your organization has survive whole language and the other fads that periodically blow through colleges of education and into elementary school classrooms .
It can not have been easy .
Mary :
It was n’t .
My class of 7th grade remedial children , most of whom read below a fourth grade level , were the flesh and blood victims of those fads .
Finding Spalding was the answer to my prayers .
At the time , I did n’t know why it worked .
It was enough for me that it did .
Later , I wanted to understand why the Method is so successful and consistent .
I read the research and earned my doctorate because I thought that having higher credentials would help me persuade others of the need for research - based instruction .
Much later , the National Reading Panel studied the research and concluded that successful reading instruction requires certain components , phonemic awareness and phonics key among them .
Those of us in the trenches said " at last . "
Then , when NCLB passed , the big publishing houses turned on a dime , sprinkled a little phonics holy water over whole language , and claimed to be " phonics based . "
After being shunned for teaching phonics all those years , Spalding suddenly had a bunch of well - financed competitors .
Who said , " Be careful what you wish for ! " ?
Yet , as you noted , and despite everything , Spalding has persevered .
I wish you could read the grateful letters from parents and teachers .
They are the reason that we work on .
We are continually reminded of the difference Spalding makes in children ’s lives .
Speaking of that , the friend who told me about Spalding , is now editor of The Spalding News !
When she retired from The Phoenix Gazette , where she was an editorial writer , I asked her to come to work for SEI .
Because of her experience with her son , she felt that it was something she had to do .
Her son had been in a dreadful first grade reading program and thought that reading was a mystery he would never solve .
After a summer of Spalding tutoring , he was reading and loving it .
He could n’t believe it could be so easy .
He asked his tutor , " Are you sure this is all there is to it ? "
And " Does everyone know this ? "
Thirty - five years later , we are still working on it .
Linda :
Thank you , Dr. Mary North , for giving me , and my readers , so much of your time .
I hope that all parents , whether they are homeschooling their children , or not , will do much reading and learning at the Spalding Education International website .
I remain as committed to Spalding as ever , and my present and former students think of Mrs. Romalda Spalding as — a wonderful extra Grandmother who has given them the best of all gifts — the Gift of Literacy .

10 Things Sony Screwed Up
We sure loved the Walkman , but since that revolutionary device Sony has dropped the ball quite a few times .
Below you will find 10 particularly messy ones .
1. PSP UMD Movies
Such a bad idea that even pointing out the mistake ( expecting people to watch cinema movies on a 4.3 inch screen ) has become a cliche .
Understand : the concept is so fundamentally flawed that it you ca n’t even say it without sounding unoriginal and stupid .
How can that get past a trained team of engineers ?
The problem was massively amplified by the Sony ’s patented “ Assume Victory And Start Screwing Them Before They Buy It ( TM ) ” approach .
You could n’t output video to any other device ( like , say , one with a screen bigger than a paperback book ) , and with the blu -ray being pushed at the same time it became clear that Sony expected you to buy every single movie three times .
This company believes Tomb Raider is worth over a $ 100 per viewer , and there ’s just no negotiating with people that insane .
Target and Walmart apparently agree , having discontinued UMD movie sales .
And Walmart stock NASCAR - themed Barbies .
2. DualShock 3
Sony and I have different ideas about what it means to spend over half a thousand dollars on a console .
I figure that a Sony executive had better drive over here in a limo and polish the thing for me with a jewel - encrusted dusting wand .
Sony take the alternative tack of figuring “ Hell , if they ’ll put up with that they ’ll put up with anything ! ” and proceed with the most shameless bait - and - switch in recent memory .
November 2006 : Players told that rumble is “ last generation ” , and instructed to buy Sixaxis .
September 2007 : Sixaxis discontinued , players told to buy Dualshock 3 .
When you ’re already losing two hundred dollars per console this kind of money grubbing is n’t just shocking , it ’s retarded .
It ’s like selling your home to set up a soup kitchen but then kicking everyone you feed in the ass – you ’re losing a lot , working very hard and everyone still thinks you ’re a dick .
3. Customer Service
Continuing the “ Lose money AND Piss off customers ” extravaganza , Sony have adopted the returns policy of a dirty magazine store .
You ’re treated like an untrustworthy pervert the instant you do business and asking for a refund will be met with the kind of stare you ’d get by complaining that this inflatable doll does n’t feel right and you ’d like to try another in the store .
For example , the customer who was told the warranty on his PS3 was void because the console got dusty .
For the Amish out there reading this on a converted donkey - cart , electrical devices attract dust like a little sign in dust - ese reading “ Free booze and dust - cheerleaders here ! ” – and according to their press the PS3 contains more electronics than a fleet of Cybermen .
Refusing to service a dusty console is like the White Star Line refusing to deal with the Titanic disaster by crying “ Well , if you ’re going to get the damn thing WET we ca n’t be held responsible ! ”
They claimed that the dust damage was an Act of God and refuse to release the repair report photos without a subpoena .
I may not work for Sony , an you can probably tell by the fact I have n’t insulted your intelligence yet , but I ’ve got to think you should n’t say things like “ You will have to take legal action to get us to do our job and God hates our console .!
4. Backwards Compatibility
Sony have access to one of the greatest software libraries in existence , the vast array of awesomeness that is the PS2 .
If you think this make an excellent crutch while building up a quality catalogue of next - generation titles , then congratulations – you ’re far , far better at this than a major gaming company !
Realising that customers were DARING to buy the wrong Sony games while developers fumbled with the PS3 hardware , backwards compatibility was stripped out of the console – first moving from hardware to inferior software emulation , then disappearing altogether .
I ’m no dreadlocked anticapitalism hippy fighting the corporation and shampoo consortiums , but when one part of your company cripples its own product to prevent a subdivision of their own brand from making sales ?
You could flood Dundler - Mifflin with laughing gas and still get better business decisions .
5. Pro Evo 2008
Why would people who ’ve just laid out the cost of a kidney in some countries then play previous gen games ?
Probably because Sony reached a zen point of absolute failure by screwing up the release of the actual games .
Games that already worked far better on “ inferior ” consoles .
Struggling with the Cell processor ( which requires a team of Rubix - cube juggling MENSAns to understand ) Konami released a version Pro Evo 2008 vastly weaker than the XBox 360 one .
Hell , it was inferior to FIFA 97 on the Super Nintendo , which at least never stopped actually moving .
This is frankly unacceptable – the only crashes we see on this generation of hardware should be beautifully rendered with CrushEvisceratePhysics ( TM ) picking out highlights as our fender cartwheels through pedestrians .
6 . Their Grip on Reality
Business analysts have started checking the Sony headquarters water supply for hallucinogenics – because some of their recent decisions sure as hell ca n’t be explained by financial reports or the state of the industry .
If Sony were a person instead of a corporation we’d be hiding the sharp objects and edging towards the door , as they ’ve been exhibiting a level of delusion normally preceded by “ No , seriously , these mushrooms are safe to eat man . ”
They just do n’t seem to get that the days of merciless control of the two computer games magazines that exist are over .
These days we can talk to each other , usually saying things like “ Can you believe this latest shit from Sony ? ” ( Protip : the answer is usually “ No ” ) .
The masterpiece of this starkly denial of reality was Jack Tretton ’s now infamous statement that he would pay $ 1200 for any PS3 somebody could find on the shelves .
Approximately four nanoseconds later the net was flooded with so many pictures of unsold ( and slightly dusty ) PS3s that Sony would have to invent alchemy , and apply it to the moon , to pay the bill .
7. Dealing with the Internet
Sony eventually did notice the Internet , but they ’ve been treating it like a bunch of unruly children who need to be disciplined for treading on their corporate lawn .
They were rudely awakened when they tried to lay down the law on popular gaming site Kotaku .
Kotaku printed something that Sony did n’t like , and were sternly told that they ’d misbehaved and were no longer welcome at any official events and would receive no press releases .
We presume Sony then added that Kotaku should go to their room and think about what they ’d done .
Now , unless you ’ve spent the last ten years in the same lead - lined cave as Sony , you ’ll know that the Internet does n’t take kindly to this kind of thing .
Half a day of massively condensed PR disaster later , the head of Sony America PR phoned Kotaku to personally apologise .
8 . Dealing with people who actually sell PSPs
The view of customers as naughty children has had much worse effects than that , however .
Towards the end of 2006
Sony sued beloved import business Lik - Sang for having the unmitigated gall to sell PSPs to people who want them .
Whatever Sony are after , apparently sales and a customer base are n’t part of the plan .
The problem was that Lik - Sang were exporting Japan region consoles to other parts of the world – aka “ Solving the region - discrepancy problem that only exists because Sony invented it in the first place . ”
This is classic parent - style authority instillation , “ It does n’t matter if I ’m right just DO WHAT YOU’RE TOLD ” , which in the case of UK and US customers means waiting until SCEA damn well feel like releasing titles over here .
Because as we all know , when customers are forcibly prevented from buying a product legally , there ’s absolutely nothing they can do but wait patiently to do their corporate master ’s bidding .
I ’m no lawyer , bu when the business sues to prevent you from buying their product I do n’t think it even counts as piracy anymore .
9. Proprietary USB
By this point it ’s becoming clear that Sony Computer Entertainment is an oxymoron or a prank , a vast “ Missing the Point ” competition between sadistic electronics experts .
We can only hope that the man behind TransferJet won a good prize , because this proprietary USB is the most incredibly point - defeating device since the army deployed experimental anti-porcupine missiles .
Intel , Microsoft , HP , Samsung and others got together to push a Wireless USB standard , hoping to remove the mutated spaghetti junction that lurks behind the glittering facade of your computer setup .
Sony are now attempting to punk the entire industry with their own incompatible technology , and goddammit Sony , when you spend money developing a version of Universal Serial Buses that is n’t bloody Universal you need psychological help or a spanking .
When even Microsoft want to work on an open , sharable standard there ’s a chance you ’d need to be the child of Blofeld and Ming the Merciless to stand in the way .
10 . The PS3
Rabid PS3 fanboys , shivering because they had to give up heating to pay the mortgage installments on their overpriced monolith , continually insist that the PS3 WILL dominate the future of gaming .
Somehow forgetting that we ’ve been buying a new console every five years for over two decades .
So for every year it takes before our primitive organic brains to evolve up to appreciating the majesty of Sony ’s vision another 20 % is knocked off the likely lifespan of the machine , and its been two years already .
Two years of being hideously outsold by a little white box of calculator parts with a motion sensor because Sony set their technical bar a little high , as in “ Scientists run spacetime curvature simulations on PS3s ” high .
Hell , if you ’d at least let us do that it ’d be a cool game .

“ Fathers , our daughters are waiting for us , ” Mr. Wilson , 49 , told the men .
“ They are desperately waiting for us in a culture that lures them into the murky waters of exploitation .
They need to be rescued by you , their dad . ”
The Wilsons organized what was considered the country ’s first father - daughter purity ball 10 years ago , as their oldest girls entered adolescence .
Randy Wilson is the national field director of church ministries for the Family Research Council , a conservative advocacy group , and Lisa Wilson is a stay - at - home mom .
“ The culture says you ’re free to sleep with as many people as you want to , ” said Khrystian Wilson , 20 , one of the Wilsons ’ seven children , including five girls .
“ What does that get you but complete chaos ? ”
For the Wilsons and the growing number of people who have come to their balls , premarital sex is seen as inevitably destructive , especially to girls , who they say suffer more because they are more emotional than boys .
Fathers , they say , play a crucial role in helping them stay pure .
“ Something I need from dad is affirmation , being told I ’m beautiful , ” said Jordyn Wilson , 19 , another daughter of Randy and Lisa .
“ If we do n’t get it from home , we will go out to the culture and get it from them . ”
Recent studies have suggested that close relationships between fathers and daughters can reduce the risk of early sexual activity among girls and teenage pregnancy .
But studies have also shown that most teenagers who say they will remain abstinent , like those at the ball , end up having sex before marriage , and they are far less likely to use condoms than their peers .
No one knows for certain how many purity balls are held nationwide , because they are grass - roots efforts .
The Abstinence Clearinghouse , an advocacy group , says it sells hundreds of purity ball kits annually to interested groups all over the country and abroad .
Parents may legally home - school their children in California even if they lack a teaching credential , a state appellate court ruled Friday .
The decision is a reversal of the court ’s earlier position , which effectively prohibited most home schooling and sparked fear throughout the state ’s estimated 166,000 home - schoolers .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who had vowed to allow home schooling through legislation if the court did not act , praised the ruling .
“ This is a victory for California ’s students , parents and education community .
This decision confirms the right every California child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children , ” he said .
“ I hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home - schooled children once and for all in California , but assure them that we , as elected officials , will continue to defend parents ’ rights . ”
In February , the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled in a child protection hearing that parents must have a teaching credential to home - school their children .
The decision caused a nationwide uproar among home - schoolers , religious activists and others , and the court agreed to reconsider its decision , a move described as unusual but not unprecedented .
Advertisement
The issue arose in part because California ’s laws do not specifically address home schooling , unlike those of at least 30 other states .
Friday ’s ruling essentially upheld the position of the state Department of Education and state Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell , who have traditionally allowed home schooling as long as parents file paperwork with the state establishing themselves as private schools , hire credentialed tutors or enroll their children in independent study programs run by charter or private schools or public school districts .
“ As head of California ’s public school system , it would be my wish that all children attend public school , but I understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child , ” he said .
“ I recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling .
It is my hope that today ’s ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion . ”
The court also said that the right of parents to home - school their children can be overridden if a child is in danger .

Home - schooling families celebrated the ruling .
“ We ’re ecstatic , happy and thrilled , ” said Loren Gould of Westchester , who teaches her son , Logan , 7 , at home .
“ He gets to keep his love of learning alive .
. . .
The world is his classroom . ”
The case stemmed from the Long family of Lynwood , who were accused of mistreating some of their eight children .
All of the children are or had been enrolled at Sunland Christian School , where they would occasionally take tests , but they were taught in their home by their mother .
Lawyers appointed to represent the two youngest children had asked the court to require them to attend a public or private school full time so adults could monitor their well - being .
The family court declined , but the children ’s lawyers appealed .
Advertisement
The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled in February that Sunland officials ’ occasional monitoring of the Longs ’ methods of teaching were insufficient to qualify as being enrolled in a private school .
Because Mary Long does not have a teaching credential , the family violated state laws , the ruling said .
The Longs , the Sunland school and others appealed , and the appellate panel agreed to revisit the ruling .
That panel heard arguments in June at a freewheeling hearing attended by at least 45 attorneys representing disparate groups .
Democratic and Republican politicians , religious and secular home - schoolers , and liberal and conservative legal scholars all weighed in , saying the court had erred .
Phillip Long , who has said the family chose to home - school the children because of their strong Christian beliefs , said Friday that he does n’t believe the court was swayed by the legal arguments .
“ Only one thing swayed this court -- politics , ” he said .
“ This court was under pressure .
. . .
They did it to protect themselves and their reputation .
Those judges want to be Supreme Court judges , they want to move up .
They ’re not going to do anything to upset their careers . ”
Advertisement
Though the appellate court upheld the right of parents to home - school , it did direct the family court to revisit whether the Longs should be allowed to continue to home - school their children .
It ’s unclear what will happen , because in July the family court terminated its jurisdiction over the family ’s children , though the children ’s lawyers are appealing that decision .
Long is confident he will prevail .
“ Educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd Circuit , ” he said .
“ It preexisted this state .
It preexisted us .
Parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning . ”
California does little to enforce the education department ’s provisions and insists that doing so is the local school districts ’ responsibility .
Advertisement
In addition , state education officials say some parents home - school their children without the knowledge of any entity , making them virtually impossible to locate .
Home - schoolers and government officials have largely accepted this murky arrangement , but the court faulted the Legislature for failing to clarify the rules .
“ It is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider , as a matter of policy , whether home schooling should be permitted in California .
That job is for the Legislature .
It is not the duty of the courts to make the law ; we endeavor to interpret it , ” Justice H. Walter Croskey wrote in a ruling signed by the two other members of the panel .
“ Our first task , interpreting the law of California , is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction . ”
To that end , the court said additional requirements for home - schoolers in other states such as standardized testing or home visits should be considered by the California Legislature .
Advertisement
“ Given the state ’s compelling interest in educating all of its children . . . and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in California , additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful , ” according to the ruling .
Statements such as those irked some home - school organizations that are weary of regulation , but were supported by constitutional scholar Erwin Chemerinsky , the dean of UC Irvine ’s law school , who urged the court to overturn its initial ruling that banned most home schooling .
“ I believe it ’s the right of parents , if they chose , to be able to home - school their children .
That ’s absolutely their right , ” he said .
But “ the state has an important interest [ in ] making sure all children are adequately educated . ”

The law firm that is representing the MPAA in Sweden has identified a selection of popular content owned by MPAA members that is made available for unauthorized download by users through The Pirate Bay .
The lawyers based the requested damages on the value of each movie or television episode ( ranging between $ 37 and $ 68 ) and the number of estimated downloads ( ranging between thousands and tens of thousands ) .
How they selected the individual works and determined the total number of downloads is n't clear .
The unflappable Sunde is n't impressed with the claims .
He told Swedish newspaper SvD that the figure is a fabrication and that the content industry should be thanking him instead of attempting to sue him .
" We might be able to pay in Monopoly money .
This proves that they are out of touch with reality .
They might as well ask for a billion crowns .
This is fear - based propaganda ; they 're trying to make it sound serious when we link to things that you download from elsewhere , " Sunde told SvD .
" We should send them an invoice instead .
All research shows that file - sharing grows the market for the movie industry .
I go by research ; they make it up as they go . "
We asked the MPAA for additional details and comments , but the organization declined to provide further clarification , and said only that " a claim for damages has been filed and it is now a matter for the Swedish court . "
The increasingly embattled Pirate Bay is also facing an onslaught from Swedish prosecutors as well as litigation from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , which wants $ 2.5 million .
Although the situation looks stormy for The Pirate Bay , the feisty torrent tracker has recovered from far worse in the past .
Following a raid conducted by Swedish law enforcement agents in 2006 , The Pirate Bay recovered and was seaworthy again within three days despite being declared completely sunk by the MPAA .

4K Was Just Too Small for Those Large - Gauge IMAX Sequences
Creating seamless , realistic digital effects for director Chris Nolan is always a tall order , but doing so in IMAX resolution was an extra added attraction for the post - production studios who worked on Warner Bros . ’ box office hit The Dark Knight .
“ Chris [ Nolan ] has a very astute eye , ” says Nick Davis , the film ’s visual effects supervisor .
“ It was important for the visual effects to look as though they were shot on set .
He did n’t want the film to take on a gimmicky visual - effects look . ”
In keeping with that philosophy , Nolan shot footage for the major visual - effects sequences with IMAX cameras , making The Dark Knight the first feature film shown in IMAX that was n’t originally shot in 35 mm .
“ By shooting in IMAX format we could fill the whole frame , and the images are sharper and have more detail , ” Davis says .
“ But the vendors had to work in much larger resolution and , logistically , it was a difficult movie to finish . ”
Visual - effects post - production houses Double Negative , Framestore CFC , BUF , and Cinesite worked on the film ’s roughly 700 visual - effects shots .
Framestore CFC ’s 200 - plus shots centered on a major IMAX sequence set amidst the tall buildings in Hong Kong , and on digital makeup for Harvey Dent , who appeared in 112 shots as Batman ’s nemesis Two - Face , none of which were IMAX shots .
BUF created the opener in IMAX resolution and Batman ’s “ Sonar Vision , ” which appears primarily during the Prewitt Building sequence .
Cinesite helped with rig removal , wire removal and 2D cleanup for the complicated mechanical effects .
The lion ’s share of the effects , including all the sequences in Gotham City , went to Double Negative .
Of their 370 shots , 170 take place during three major IMAX sequences :
The opening bank heist , the extravagant armored - car chase , and a hostage rescue in the Prewitt Building .
In addition , Double Negative worked on a few IMAX shots during the Gotham City evacuation .
“ The visual effects go into the cracks , forming backgrounds and foregrounds , ” says Paul Franklin , visual effects supervisor at Double Negative .
“ They ’re always there to support the images in a scene .
Never the reason to do the scene . ”
To support the IMAX scenes , the studios could not work in full IMAX resolution , which is theoretically 18 K ; instead , the target resolution was approximately 8 K , the maximum resolution for scanned film .
Even that was difficult .
“ A single 8 K frame requires 200 MB of data , ” Franklin says .
“ So we had to upgrade our whole infrastructure .
We needed faster network speeds to move data around , massively beefed up servers , and – the most important thing – a new compositing solution . ”
Shake Up
The studio had upgraded its machines to 64 - bit operating systems about a year ago , but Double Negative ’s compositing software of choice , Apple ’s Shake , still operated in 32 - bit memory space .
“ Shake falls over with images much more than 3 K resolution , ” Franklin says .
“ Fortunately , we have a strong R&D team . ”
Because the studio had Shake - experienced artists on the crew and existing Shake - based software and workflows , the R&D department created an additional application that worked in conjunction with Shake to get around the memory limitations .
“ It ’s a separate , standalone set of tools , not a plug - in , ” Franklin says .
“ A kind of overlay .
Users could transition to the new software easily . ”
New blade servers increased data - storage space and improved data transfer rates .
“ In 1999 , when we worked on Pitch Black [ released in 2000 ] , we needed to access 2 TB of data , ” Franklin says .
“ This show used over 100 TB of data . ”
Additional acreage in the render farm amped up the processing power .
“ For Batman Begins , we had 200 RenderMan licenses , each of which ran on dual - processor machines , ” Franklin says .
“ For this film , we beefed up to 900 licenses , each running on four processors – 3600 processors .
The limiting factor was how much power we could get into the building . ”
The new processors ’ lower power consumption requirements released enough of the energy budget to accommodate the additional servers .
However , a larger crew and more artist workstations still tipped the studio toward a power wall .
“ We tripped the fuses twice , but there were no other outages . ”
With the new infrastructure , the 64 - bit compositing solution , and efficient load distribution techniques for the 3D pipeline in place , the crew wrangled a small number of shots for the opening bank - heist sequence , which they delivered in October 2007 , six months ahead of the rest of film .
Warner Bros. released that sequence as a prologue in front of IMAX screenings of I Am Legend .
“ It was our test sequence for the pipeline , ” Franklin says .
“ We did those shots at 8 K .
After that , we went down to 5.6 K except for high - contrast shots where the camera lingers on vehicles and architecture . ”
The lower resolution reduced the data requirements to approximately 160 MB per frame .
As for the content in the shots , to support high - res IMAX close - ups of Gotham City , Double Negative artists overhauled all the buildings that they picked up from Batman Begins , adding geometric detail and repainting all the textures .
In addition , the studio modeled the Prewitt Building from scratch for IMAX shots using reference filmed on location in Trump International Hotel and Tower , which was under construction in Chicago .
“ We had to create more environments from scratch and had more matte paintings than in Batman Begins , ” Franklin says .
“ We also built the digital Batpod and Batmobile , and all those assets had to hold up in full - frame , harsh lighting conditions .
Things we could get away with at 2 K would n’t cut the mustard on Dark Knight . ”
In addition to the higher - resolution format pushing the need for detail , the camera moved closer to the digital architecture , the digital vehicles and the digital stunt doubles .
Ground Work
“ I think Chris [ Nolan ] had greater confidence this time , ” Franklin says .
“ For example , they attempted to do the shot of the Batmobile turning into the Batpod as a physical effect with rigs .
But Chris was n’t getting the speed and energy he wanted , so we did a digital version . ”
In shots with the Batpod racing straight ahead , the bike and rider are real ; when Batman turns the bike , lays it down flat , or climbs a wall with it , both are digital , as is ( sometimes ) the road beneath the bike ’s wheels .
“ We tracked the Batpod into live - action plates filmed in Chicago , but in some cases we needed a digital road for new camera moves , ” Franklin says .
“ The only way was to photograph the road in excruciating detail .
We recreated a quarter mile of LaSalle Street and 250 yards of Lower Wacker Drive to one - centimeter resolution . ”
For tracking , the studio uses boujou , PF Track , 3D Equalizer and a proprietary photogrammetry toolset .
“ We can give it point tracks from any source and it will give us a solve for the camera , ” Franklin says of the proprietary software .
To match the IMAX camera lenses , Double Negative primarily characterized Zeiss lenses from Hassleblad cameras .
“ The difference is that the IMAX camera uses proprietary mounts to fit the lens to the camera body , ” Franklin says .
“ We shot lens - specific distortion grids , but did all the other characterizations with the still lenses . ”
To create the road , they photographed the surface at 5 K resolution with Canon EOS - 1DS Mark II still cameras and LIDAR - scanned the surface to produce a terrain map .
“ With the 1DS Mark II , we could shoot many times faster than before , ” Franklin says .
“ We ’d wait for a gap in traffic or have the police stop traffic for 10 minutes .
For Batman Begins , we had to wait for nighttime .
It was the same for photographing the buildings .
We could wait for the light to be flat rather than wait for the buffer to empty . ”
Matte painters worked in 8 K resolution , and the artists painted texture maps in either 8 K or 16 K resolution , depending on the view .
“ That was a bottleneck , ” Franklin says .
“ Photoshop does n’t handle images above 4 K very efficiently and it ’s a closed tool , so we could n’t get in there and add stuff to it .
Working with Photoshop was possible , but slow .
It took three or four times longer than usual to paint the textures . ”
Rendering was less of a problem .
To optimize render times , the studio rewrote shaders and created a new tool called Spangle to preview RenderMan renders in realtime .
“ It renders on NVIDIA cards , ” Franklin says .
“ It does n’t impact the render farm . ”
In addition , a 3D relighting system allowed compositors to change the direction of lights , if needed , without going back into the 3D pipeline .
What You See ( Not )
A second big bottleneck , though , was in viewing the images .
“ Our biggest monitors are 2 K , ” Franklin says .
“ You ca n’t realistically buy a 5.6 x 3.6 K monitor , and the highest - resolution digital projector is about 4K . ”
So the studio wrote a set of tools that extracted 2 K tiles from the images for the artists to view , but for dailies , they sent files from their London - based studio to DKP 70 mm , the IMAX - subsidiary post facility in Los Angeles , for recording onto film stock .
“ It was a minimum of 10 days before we saw the shots back in the UK , ” Franklin says .
What ’s more , to view the shots , they had to book time at London ’s only IMAX theater .
“ And you ca n’t rock and roll on IMAX projectors , ” he adds .
“ You have to rewind and go again , so we had only a couple chances to view the output . ”
As a result , instead of doing IMAX dailies , they did tests to establish the end result and made assumptions based on those tests .
“ It was like 10 or 15 years ago , when it was difficult to view 2 K frames on digital monitors , ” Franklin says .
“ But this is what 3D artists in particular have always done .
We ’re used to looking at low res images during the process . ”
Framestore CFC VFX supervisor Tim Webber echoes Franklin ’s analysis .
“ Most of our problems came from the process , ” he says .
“ We expected it to be a little harder , but it was way harder .
These days , we work with people all over the world , send images digitally and get feedback .
But with physical film , there ’s a big delay .
And matching the color space was harder because they did n’t do a digital grade , so we had to match the IMAX output recorders .
They still use CRT recorders , which have a different color response than the laser output recorders most people use today , so we had to put work into that . ”
Rather than DI , director Nolan and DP Wally Pfister used their preferred photochemical process .
“ Wally would go into the lab and call the lights and they ’d print it , ” says Franklin .
“ There was no real - time , hands - on grading . ”
Scoping it Out
In addition to the IMAX shots , the studios had to produce versions of their shots for anamorphic 35 mm prints , as well .
[ See “ Marrying IMAX and 35 mm in The Dark Knight “ ] .
For the all - digital sonar - vision shots , BUF created separate IMAX and scope images .
“ Chris wanted to different shot values , ” says Alain Lalanne , visual effects producer .
“ They tell the same story , but because of the size of the images in IMAX , we had to do things differently .
So we had to find technical ways to make all the versions and compute them .
It took a lot of organization . ”
Double Negative and Framestore CFC , however , could lift scope images from the IMAX footage .
“ We worked at IMAX resolution all the way through and then did a 2:40 extraction , ” Franklin says , “ taking the cinemascope slug out of the larger picture , and then downresing to 4 K .
We initially started working in 2 K for cinemascope , but decided that since we had the resources to do IMAX at 5.6 K , we ’d do the scope at 4K . ”
Even though editorial provided extraction guides , cutting the correct shot out of the IMAX scans was tricky .
“ The telecine operators set up the racking for the color cine transfers to give editorial a safe image for projection , but we got a scan of the whole negative , so there was a discrepancy , ” Franklin says .
“ Tiny things like that would n’t normally make much difference in 2 K resolution , but everything in IMAX gets magnified . ”
Franklin believes the lessons learned on this film will help the studio in the future – even if it never again works in 5.6 or 8 K resolution .
“ Filmmakers increasingly want us to work in 4 K , and that used to be a big deal , ” he says , and then laughs .
“ After working on 5.6 and 8 resolution , 4 K is proxy resolution . ”
You might have bought the LG G4 without knowing how to troubleshoot it when you encounter overheating issues .
Well , good thing because you can now fix it yourself .
Here are some of the methods to fix the issue of overheating with your LG G4 device .
Restarting Your Device
Sometimes , you just have to allow it to stop and rest .
You can do this by letting it cool off by pressing and holding the Power button and then tap Restart .
Doing this will reboot your device , which allows you if it is still overheating .
Turn Off Bluetooth , GPS , and Wi-Fi
If the first option would n’t work , then you have to consider turning off unnecessary wireless connectivity in your device .
This is because they have a direct impact on how hot your battery can be , which can be the main factor causing your device to overheat .
Reduce The Brightness
When your screen is too bright , you can end up overheating your device .
This is because the background lighting can drain the battery so quickly .
You simply have to adjust the brightness level by going to Settings -> Apps -> Settings -> Display .
You will then be able to find the option to reduce its brightness .
Close Apps Running At The Background
One of the reasons causing your battery to drain fast is having some apps running in the background .
These are the main causes of overheating for your LG G4 .
You will be able to close the apps by tapping the Recent apps button , then you have to tap and drag the apps you want to close either left or right .
You can also tap the Clear all option in order to close all background apps .
Disable The Bloatware On LG G4
Needless to say , manufacturers including LG would load their new phones with apps that you hardly even use .
The problem is that you ca n’t uninstall them , but only to disable them is your best option here .
Simply go to Settings -> Application Manager .
You need to find the app you want to activate from the All tab .
Then , you need to tap on it and click the Disable button .
The Clintons know no respect for rules or propriety or restraint in the pursuit of power .
But Clinton 's latest speech in Florida should cause even veteran Clinton - hating jaws to drop some more :
Now , I know that Senator Obama chose to remove his name from the ballot in Michigan , and that was his right .
But his choice does not negate the votes of all those who turned out to cast their ballots , and we should not let our process rob them and all of you of your voices .
To do so would undermine the very purpose of the nominating process .
To ensure that as many Democrats as possible can cast their votes .
To ensure that the party selects a nominee who truly represents the will of the voters and to ensure that the Democrats take back the White House to rebuild America .
Now , I ’ve heard some say that counting Florida and Michigan would be changing the rules .
I say that not counting Florida and Michigan is changing a central governing rule of this country - that whenever we can understand the clear intent of the voters , their votes should be counted .
I remember very well back in 2000 , there were those who argued that people 's votes should be discounted over technicalities .
For the people of Florida who voted in this primary , the notion of discounting their votes sounds way too much of the same .
How do you respond to a sociopath like this ?
She agreed that Michigan and Florida should be punished for moving up their primaries .
Obama took his name off the ballot in deference to their agreement and the rules of the party .
That he should now be punished for playing by the rules and she should be rewarded for skirting them is unconscionable .
I think she has now made it very important that Obama not ask her to be the veep .
The way she is losing is so ugly , so feckless , so riddled with narcissism and pathology that this kind of person should never be a heartbeat away from the presidency .

Mortars and rockets fired by insurgents frequently hit the Green Zone Three US service personnel have been killed and 31 wounded by rocket attacks on the Green Zone and a base elsewhere in Baghdad , the US military has said .
The rocket attack at 1530 ( 1230 GMT ) on the Green Zone , which houses government offices and foreign embassies , killed two personnel and wounded at least 17 .
A separate attack at the same time on a forward operating base in the Rustamiya district killed one and injured 14 .
The attacks came after fighting between US and Iraqi forces and a Shia militia .
Twenty - two people were killed and more than 50 others injured in the clashes in the capital 's eastern district of Sadr City , a stronghold of the Mehdi Army .
The militia 's leader , radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr , has called for a mass demonstration in three days ' time against the US military presence .
On Saturday , the Iraqi president , prime minister and other political leaders called for militias to be disbanded .
Analysts said the call was aimed mainly at the Mehdi Army , which has recently been involved in heavy fighting with the security forces across southern Iraq .
Students freed Meanwhile , Iraqi security forces said they had found 42 university students unharmed after they were kidnapped near the northern city of Mosul earlier on Sunday .
The students were freed unharmed several hours after being kidnapped
The male students were on two buses ferrying them to Mosul from their homes in Shurkat , 70 km ( 40 miles ) further south , when they were ambushed and captured .
Students who live outside Mosul often travel home on Thursdays , and return on Sundays .
Mosul has recently been the scene of extra security effort as US and Iraqi forces try to target al - Qaeda in Iraq fighters , who have regrouped in the area since being forced out of Baghdad and western Iraq .
Also on Sunday , hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of Father Youssef Adel in the capital 's Karrada district .
The Assyrian Orthodox priest was killed on Saturday at his home .
One of the mourners , Midhat Faez , was quoted as saying the assassination was aimed at provoking conflict between Muslims and minority Christian community .
" As Christians , we are terrified and our numbers are gradually diminishing , " he said .

Normally adults carry their baby on their back but as those which have been infected slowly die , the youngsters , with no mother to feed them , also perish .
" We walk around the bat colony in the Bush every day and you can hear the young bats crying for their mothers , " said Jenny Maclean , who runs the rescue centre on the Atherton Tablelands in northern Queensland .
LONDON / LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
As a lengthening economic slowdown bites , the antidote for the renewable energy sector may come as a surprise -- a lower oil price .

Government subsidies and record prices for competing fossil fuels have underpinned the alternative energy boom , but now they are now starting to work against the sector .
Reliance on subsidies exposes the likes of wind and solar power to the whim of governments grappling with wider voter priorities during a global economic slowdown .
As oil and energy bills have soared consumers have become less tolerant of the extra costs passed on to them by utilities for the greener option .
“ Government priorities in the last five years or so have been very clearly environment , security of supply , and way down the list has been price ... all of a sudden affordability has shot to the top , ” said Citigroup utilities analyst Peter Atherton .
“ If oil drops back to $ 80 then government can probably live with it ( the extra cost of climate policies ) . ”
Higher oil prices have made onshore wind competitive with natural gas , making continuing subsidies there less important , but more expensive renewable energy sectors and especially solar will be hurt by a policy pull - back .
Europe , the United States , China and India want to ramp up power production from low - carbon wind , solar and biomass to battle climate change and source more secure , domestic energy .
But goals to produce power from the sun or wind stoke energy costs because utilities pass on the higher price to consumers .
“ We ’ve seen a worsening more to do with economic weakness than anything else , it ’s much harder to push through or in some cases even maintain support packages that push up energy costs when consumers are under pressure , ” said Michael Liebreich , chairman of research firm , New Energy Finance ( NEF ) .
“ If oil comes below $ 100 ... the consumer will bear it , ” Liebreich said , adding that a prospective U.S. cap and trade scheme , which would impose an extra cost on carbon emissions from industry , looked less certain now than six months ago .
Global investment in clean energy from April to June was less than the same period last year , and at $ 33 billion barely half the last quarter of 2007 , initial NEF figures show .
Most Californians wo n’t support the state ’s ambitious efforts to fight global warming if they raise energy costs , a survey conducted by a pro-business group found last week .
CREDIT CRUNCH
The overall result globally is less clear climate policy .
Beijing ’s efforts to rein in rash lending and curb inflation are hurting wind power project financings , in a country poised to become the world ’s fastest growing wind energy market , said Steve Sawyer , secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council .
An EU deal fleshing out how to get a fifth of energy from renewable sources by 2020 may now be delayed until April from expectations of agreement in December , amid horse - trading to ease targets , said Sawyer .
Britain has suggested for possible inclusion in the target technologies which trap carbon emissions from coal plants , called carbon capture and storage .
The U.S. election is delaying other measures .
United Nations talks to agree a new global climate treaty are dragging as negotiators await the stance of a new U.S. president .
Extension of current U.S. tax credits in return for generation of wind , solar and geothermal power may not now meet a December 31 expiry date , after becoming embroiled in an election dispute about links to fossil fuel subsidies .
Other sources of electricity besides renewables , including gas , coal and nuclear , also get subsidies , environmentalists point out .
COST
The long - term future of renewable energy looks assured , as scientists and economists warn of catastrophic climate change if the world continues to rely on fossil fuels .
The sector has drawn big hitters , such as oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens , who is building a $ 10 billion wind farm in Texas .
Wind power this year passed a global milestone of 100 gigawatts installed power , and may be helped further by a succession of offshore wind projects planned in Europe .
And momentum could snow - ball if $ 148 billion clean energy investment last year spurs cost cuts which make the likes of solar power compelling energy alternatives .
But in the meantime cost concerns are paramount .
The high price of solar power reflects a bottleneck in the raw material , solar grade silicon , and is threatening to choke policy support and demand , forecast to grow at 35 percent a year .
“ I ’d say it ( policy ) is a risk , but the bigger risk is raw material costs .
If that does n’t come down then the solar industry is in trouble , ” said Sam Dubinsky , analyst at Oppenheimer & Co in New York .

Recently the number one search engine , Google , has unveiled to the public Knol , the company 's website that allows experts to write , express ideas on their fields of expertise .
The main difference between Knol and Wikipedia is the authorship .
On Knol the public will have the actual names of the authors , whereas Wikipedia allows anyone to edit anonymously , just tracking the IP .
" We are deeply convinced that authorship - knowing who wrote what - helps readers trust the content , " outlined Cedric DuPont , product manager for Google 's Knol .
According to Mr DuPont , the entries on the public website , called knol.google.com , are dubbed " knols " .
The name " knoll " is a nice , very simple word to remember , and it's part of knowledge , " said Udi Manber , the head of search engineering at Google .
In December Google performed a limited test of its new service .
It is interesting to note that the service has almost the same tools that single blog pages have .
However , Knol encourages experts to reduce the amount of content on a topic to a single page , which is not updated chronologically .
" What we want to get away from is ' this last voice wins ' model which is very difficult if you are a busy professional , " said Mr DuPont .
The search engine looks forwards to rank entries by popularity in order to encourage competition .
For a better understanding , let 's check an example : this knol on lung cancer features lots of details on the topic , along with images and a glossary .
If you check the upper right corner , you may notice the name of the author Jessica Donington , and her title , Thoracic Surgeon NYU School of Medicine .
As other contributors publish on lung cancer , Google will rank related pages in accordance with user ratings , reviews and the number of people 's references to certain pages .
Knol does not edit nor endorse the entries and those who visit a specific page will not be able to edit information without the permission of the author .
In case readers consider any content objectionable , they can notify Google .
Knol uses the so - called " moderated collaboration " , where any reader of a certain topic page may suggest edits to the author , who can choose whether to accept , reject or alter changes before publishing .
Google was able to reach an agreement Conde Nast 's New Yorker magazine , allowing Knol 's publishers to use one of the magazine 's cartoons in each entry .
In addition Google will allow writers to run ads on their articles and will share the income .
Mr DuPont mentioned that the primary goal of Knol is not to provide competition to Wikipedia but to serve as a main source of authoritative information that anyone can use to edit Wikipedia articles .
" Knols will fill gaps on what we have on the web today .
That is what we hope , " he added .

Microsoft believes
Apple is winning the battle on the desktop using " lies " and " myths " against Windows Vista , and has promised to fight back .
Evoking the spirit of his apple - cheeked little daughter , Microsoft 's vice president for Windows consumer product marketing Brad Brooks promised partners that by telling the " truth " about Windows Vista , they can overcome lies of a " highly vocal minority " .
" They say it 's the i-way or the highway , " Brooks told Microsoft 's worldwide partner conference in Houston , Texas , on Tuesday , without actually naming Apple .
" We think that 's a sad message . "
" There 's a conversation in the market place right now and it 's plain wrong , " he claimed .
" Windows is awesome ...
Windows Vista is a good product . "
He closed : " As my daughter said , the ' truth will make us strong ' . "
Not a laughing matter in Redmond
Brooks skirted over what the lies were .
Apple has for two years , though , been running a popular series of TV ads skewering Windows Vista , and those commercials have clearly been rubbing up Microsoft the wrong way .
Microsoft 's own Windows Vista " wow " campaign vanished long , long ago .
And whether it's the power of the TV spot or Microsoft 's own ineptitude in delivering a delayed operating system that was too bloated for most PCs already out there to handle and that lacked adequate third - party support , Apple 's has grabbed 6.6 per cent of the desktop market in the US during Windows Vista 's lifetime .
Indian - origin researcher uncovers mechanism behind allergies
Tue , 01 Jan 2008 ANI
Washington , August 8 ( ANI ) : An Indian - origin scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies has announced the identification of the molecular mechanisms that underpin allergic reactions .
Dr. Inder Verma , a professor in the Laboratory of Genetics , believes that this work may pave the way for new therapies to stop the summer sneezing , and to treat more severe allergic responses .
" These results may allow us to develop acute inhibitors of allergic reactions that do not have the side - effects of current treatments such as drowsiness , " he says .
He says in a research article in the journal Cell that specialised cells in the body , mast cells , release the chemical histamine whenever an individual encounters an allergen , such as pollen , and thereby offer protection against the allergen .
However , he adds , this process can abnormally occur throughout the body in people with allergic diseases , leading to severe inflammation and in the worst cases , anaphylactic shock and death .
Dr. Verma says that the new study implicates a multi-tasking molecule called IKK2 , a protein kinase , in allergic reactions .
While experimenting with mice , he says , it was observed that the animals with mast cells lacking IKK2 had reduced allergic reactions .
" That was one of the first clues that IKK2 had other roles to play , " says Dr. Verma .
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Kotaro Suzuki , who led the current study , added : " IKK2 knock out mast cells could n't release enough histamine . "
The researchers say that IKK2's role in the allergic response does not stop there , for the late phase of the response also required it .
The research team is now testing inhibitors of IKK2 as acute treatment for allergic reactions .
They believe that IKK2 inhibitors may have the added benefit of reducing both the early and late phase allergic responses .
The researchers also think that IKK2 may have a role in pathologies like diabetes and nervous system diseases too .

Several civil rights activists and media watchdog groups are calling on Verizon Wireless and company CEO Lowell C. McAdam to drop its contract and distribution deal with Loren Feldman and 1938 Media for promoting stereotypes about African Americans .
1938 ’s president Loren Feldman — who is white — hosts and stars in a skit titled “ TechNigga ” on the company web site .
In the three minute long skit , Feldman wonders aloud about the lack of black technology bloggers on the Internet .
“ I ’d love to see the black tech crunch and get a different cultural view on technology , that would be unbelievable , ” he says in the skit .
“ I wonder what that would be like . ”
After the screen fades out , Feldman comes back draped in a wave cap and costume jewelry representing fictional site “ TheTechNigga.com . ”
He is later seen on camera drinking and discussing another fictional site , “ HoTracker.com . ”
“ Feldman has a history of using the Internet to promote racism and demeaning and negative racial stereotypes against African Americans on his internet site , ” Najee Ali of Project Islamic Hope said in a statement .
“ Verizon CEO Lowell C. McAdam needs to demonstrate that Verizon understands they should demonstrate corporate responsibility and will not tolerate racism , or bigotry .
The Verizon distribution deal with Feldman sends a horrible message that Verizon seeks to partner with racists like Feldman and that Verizon and CEO McAdam find nothing offensive with ‘ TechNigga ’ , ” he added .
Ali and Project Islamic Hope , The National Action Network , L.A. Humanity Foundation , Sister Tammy Lee of Sister Lee Media Group , and Industry Ears are also calling on people to contact Feldman concerning the deal with 1938 .
He can be reached here .

Russia forces the USA out from the traditional arms market .
Russia has won a 4 - billion - dollar contract with Saudi Arabia in a competition with the USA and France .
This achievement of the Russian defense complex can be explained by both the high quality of the national military hardware defense equipment and the blunders of its Western competitors .
However , Russia should not rest on its laurels : the current state of the nation ’s defense industry is not good enough .
It is not ruled out that the contract with Saudi Arabia may repeat the unfortunate fate of MiG supplies to Algeria .
Russia forces USA out from its traditional arms markets
Russia has entered the market area which has traditionally been under the USA ’s control .
In this case it goes about Saudi Arabia .
Rumors of Russia ’s intention to sign a multi-billion - dollar contract with the country appeared in November of 2007 when then - President Vladimir Putin met with the Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud .
On the eve of the meeting Putin toured Arab states , and visited Arab capital Riyadh where none of Russian and Soviet leaders had been before .
The West considered it a newspaper hoax , because Saudi Arabia was totally dependant on arms supplies from the West – presumably from the USA .
More importantly , the country has not voiced a desire to change the supplier .
However , Russia and Saudi Arabia preferred not to reveal details of their talks on the contract , which continued for about six months .
Now it is known that the contract is evaluated at four billion dollars .
The Saudi king got interested in the wide range of Russia ’s defense equipment : from aircraft and armored vehicles and missile complexes .
It became known that a half of the contract accounts for 100 Mil helicopters ( mainly , Mi-17 and Mi-35 ) .
Half a billion dollars accounts for 150 T - 90C tanks .
The contract also includes 20 middle - haul air defense systems Buk - M2E and several hundreds of BMP - 3 infantry combat vehicles .
Why did Riyadh prefer Russia to the USA in terms of the military hardware ?
Saudi Arabia has been under strong influence of the USA and the UK for decades .
It was caused by the struggle between the USSR and the West for influence areas , including the Middle East .
Saudi kings saw a threat to their power from the USSR that tried to develop socialist regimes in Arab states .
The state of affairs is different now .
The Soviet Union broke up , which gave Saudi Arabia an opportunity to negotiate and cooperate with Russia .
It is worthy of note that Russian weapons have been attractive to foreign buyers from the point of view of price and quality combination .
Russia used to make arms shipments to other Gulf States such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait before .
Experts say that Russian military vehicles showed better technical qualities than their Western analogues , which made Saudi Arabia evince great interest in Russian products .
However , the better quality of Russia ’s defense equipment in comparison with US analogues was demonstrated during the 1991 Operation Desert Storm .
At that time most countries , including those possessing Soviet arms , joined the anti-Iraqi coalition .
Syrian T - 72 tanks successfully covered longer distances than USA Abrams tanks that broke down because of overheating and sand .
That is only one of such episodes .
It is clear that such incidents did not make US arms more authoritative .
In addition , last year the US Senate deprecated the deal with Saudi Arabia , according to which it was to obtain a set of high - precision bombs .
The US administration believed that the bombs could fall into terrorists ’ hands .
Thus , Riyadh tried to find another supplier .
They arranged the supply of helicopters and tanks with the French , but France demanded to extend the contract and to include Navy ships in it .
However , Saudi Arabia did not like such impudence and apparently decided to punish France by signing a contract with Russia .
The contract evidences Russia ’s success , but now the USA has nothing to worry about .
Russia ’s deal with Saudi Arabia is just a pinprick to them .
For the time being , the Russian defense industry is a goose that lays golden eggs , but they are of poor quality .
Russia should not forget that Saudi Arabia will not stand such treatment and in case of malfunction it will come back to the USA .
It is important for Russia at this juncture to save the reputation of a credible supplier .
Urgent measures are necessary to improve the state of the Russian defense industry .
In fact , it is the only branch of Russia ’s industry that produces competitive goods on the world market .
Young people do not want to engage in the defense industry because of low salaries .

India 's Agni missiles increase military reach
India has test - fired its longest - range nuclear - capable ballistic missile , Agni-III , officials said .
The surface - to - surface missile was test - fired off the coast of Orissa state in eastern India .
With a range of more than 3,000 km ( 1,865 miles ) , the missile could hit targets as far off as Beijing and Shanghai , analysts say .
The Agni-III is India 's most sophisticated long - range missile .
It was successfully test - fired last year .
The first attempt to test the missile in July 2006 failed after it developed a snag during the flight and came crashing down into the Bay of Bengal .
The missile was re-configured for the second launch in April 2007 .
Boost capability
Indian defence spokesman Group Captain Ramesh Kumar Das said the latest test was launched from the interim test range at the Wheeler 's Island in the Bay of Bengal .
The intermediate range ballistic missile is capable of carrying a 1.5 - tonne nuclear payload .
When deployed , it will boost India 's second - strike capability as it can be launched from anywhere using a mobile launcher .
It will need a few more tests before it can be inducted into the armed forces , Group Captain Das said .
Possession of the Agni-III will give India deep strike capability because it would have Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai and the US island base of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean well within its striking range .
The Agni-II missile , already tested and deployed , has a range of 2,000 km ( 1,243 miles ) .
The Agni-1 has a range of 750 km ( 466 miles ) .
The Agni ( literally " fire " in Hindi and Sanskrit ) missile family is believed to be the mainstay of the Indian missile - based strategic nuclear deterrence , Group Captain Das said .
He said the Agni family would continue to expand its stable , providing a breadth of payload and range capabilities .
Flying dog poo art causes museum chaos in Switzerland
GENEVA ( AFP ) - A giant inflatable dog turd by American artist Paul McCarthy blew away from an exhibition in the garden of a Swiss museum , bringing down a power line and breaking a greenhouse window before it landed again , the museum said Monday .
The art work , titled " Complex S( expletive ) " , is the size of a house .
The wind carried it 200 metres ( yards ) from the Paul Klee Centre in Berne before it fell back to Earth in the grounds of a children 's home , said museum director Juri Steiner .
The inflatable turd broke the window at the children 's home when it blew away on the night of July 31 , Steiner said .
The art work has a safety system which normally makes it deflate when there is a storm , but this did not work when it blew away .
Steiner said McCarthy had not yet been contacted and the museum was not sure if the piece would be put back on display .
I ’ll replace this status report with an article about topdown parsing of JSON at a later time .
If you ’re looking for a production - quality JSON library , get simplejson .
If performance is critical , try python -cjson .
While the main motivation for my work on topdown parsing was a number of bigger projects ( at least one of them will appear on a site near you in a not too distant future ) , I ’ve also used some spare time to play with TDOP - based parsing of other formats .
One example is a JSON parser , the first version of which took about an hour to write , and which resulted in about 60 lines of JSON - specific code ( 30 lines for the parser definitions , 30 lines for the tokenizer ) , and 120 lines in total ( including the parser framework , that is ) .
Even the JSON - specific parts were mostly cut and pasted from the Python expression parser , and then just tweaked a little to fit .
The code is not quite ready for public consumption ( just a leetle more testing is required … ) , but I ’ll get there .
I did find the benchmarks a bit interesting .
Using a 10 k JSON record , I get the following timings :
tdopjson : 12.6 ms
simplejson , with C accelerator : 20.2 ms
simplejson , without C accelerator : 24.8 ms
That is , this “ quick hack ” is about twice as fast as a robust and well - optimized production parser , and is a quite a bit faster than even a Python / C hybrid parser .
Not bad .
This specific JSON record happened to be Python - compatible , so for comparison , I also fed it directly to Python ’s eval ( which is n’t something you ’d want to do with arbitrary JSON , of course ) :
eval : 5.3 ms
Removing the “ interpretation ” code from the TDOP parser only shaves off a few milliseconds , so using TDOP for validation and then passing the result to eval would be a step back ( it ’ll still beat simplejson , though ) .
I also tried the JSON parser in the pyparsing example collection , but that could n’t parse any of my existing samples ( all based on samples from the JSON specification or real - life JSON services ) .
Using the sample provided with the parser , pyparsing seems to be about 30 - 40 times slower than the topdown approach .
The identity of the peasant woman is not known
A new X - ray technique has revealed a previously unknown portrait of a woman by Vincent van Gogh , which was painted over by the artist .
The peasant woman 's face was hidden behind the work Patch of Grass , completed by Van Gogh in Paris in 1887 .
Scientists Joris Dik and Koen Janssens used high - intensity X - rays from a particle accelerator to scan the painting and reveal the face beneath .
Van Gogh is known to have often reused canvasses to save money .
The identity of the peasant woman in the painting is not known .
The powerful X - ray bombardment caused atoms in the picture 's layers of paint to emit " fluorescent " X - rays of their own , which indicated the chemicals they originated from .
That enabled a colour map of the hidden picture to be produced .
The portrait fills a square area measuring 17.5 cm by 17.5 cm ( 6.8 by 6.8 inches ) .
Mr Dik , a materials scientist from Delft University , and Mr Janssens , a chemist from the University of Antwerp in Belgium , published their scientific paper online in the journal Analytical Chemistry .

- John Henry Newman
When I first discovered Smalltalk , it took me a while to get my head around the fact that in image based Smalltalk systems , source code is not written in flat files .
Source code in files was so ingrained into my thinking , I had to unlearn and leave a lot of assumptions I have made .
In most programming languages programs are written and defined using text files , typically source code is written in text files , using a text editor or an IDE such as Eclipse , IntelliJ or Visual Studio .
At this point it just “ dead code ” in text files , there are no running objects , this is often referred to as compile time .
Before a program runs , the runtime environment is created , the program ’s source code is parsed , compiled and executed , and when the program finishes the runtime environment is destroyed , so in essence every time a change is made to source code the entire program is created from scratch .
Smalltalk is pure object oriented and everything is an object and everything is achieved by sending messages to objects .
In Smalltalk we dont use source code in text files to define programs ( classes methods etc ) instead objects are used to define Smalltalk programs , objects themselves are used to define new classes method etc .
Now an object can exist only at runtime , and in Smalltalk everything happens on the fly , there is no such thing as compile time , Smalltalk is a runtime , it is not just a programming language , its a living system , it is a world of “ living objects ” .
This requires a paradigm shift and it often is one of the biggest barriers I find people face when entering into the Smalltalk world .
Smalltalk pushes “ Object thinking ” to another level , but once you push past that barrier you enjoy all the benefits of working with living objects , you can interact with objects , inspect them modify , extended and change them on the fly .
This is the main reason why Smalltalk environment have such powerful IDE’s .
So what happens when the smalltalk VM is shut down or not running ?
Do the objects then die ?
No .
The objects are in a suspended state or go into hibernation and are stored in an image .
This is analogous to a VMware image , when you close a vmware image the operating system goes into a suspended state , so the next time the vmware image is loaded to exactly the same state it was before .
In Smalltalk objects essentially never die ( note objects without any references will be garbage collected ) , they simply go into a suspended state in the image , in a Squeak Smalltalk image it is very likely some objects are probably 30 years old !
In Smalltalk everything is an object , classes are first class object too , so they can respond to messages just like any other object , so it trivial to create new classes on the fly .
The image based system of the Smalltalk might be a stumbling block for people entering into the Smalltalk world but I think this is one of the main things that gives Smalltalk its power , its awesome IDE and the ability to work with live objects makes development so much more productive .
So Smalltalk code doesnt live in files so what happens to version control systems then ?
I do most of my Smalltalk development in Squeak and I use Monticello as the versioning system , in Smalltalk source code itself are represented as objects and are basically modelled as a collection of packages , classes , and methods .
Code changes then simply become addition / removal or update of these elements .
Since the entire source code are modelled in objects , Smalltalk version control systems have very powerful merge and diff algorithms .
The version control systems are language aware and source code changes and history can be tracked down to individual method .
Smalltalk is an amazingly powerful environment , developing in a Smalltalk made me see what incremental development is really about .
I guess with GemStone now working on a Ruby VM which is primarily based on the GemStone / S Smalltalk VM , folks from the Ruby world can also experience developing with living objects
Museum staff prepare for the Hadrian exhibition
A POINT OF VIEW
Roads , obviously .
Sanitation .
But no great buildings from their time in Britain .
But the greatest legacy is how we use language to persuade , says Lisa Jardine .
In a rapidly changing world , I am intrigued to find that the ability to use Latin with confidence continues to provoke widespread wonder and admiration .
Last week , at the opening of the exhibition on the Roman Emperor Hadrian at the British Museum , the Mayor of London addressed the assembled company in Latin , to general acclaim .
MONTY PYTHON'S VIEW
And what have the Romans ever given us in return ?
The aqueduct ?
Oh .
Yeah , they did give us that .
That 's true , yeah .
And the sanitation .
Yeah , the sanitation .
Remember what the city used to be like ?
I 'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation , the two things the Romans have done .
And the roads .
Obviously the roads .
The roads go without saying , do n't they ?
But apart from the sanitation , the aqueduct and the roads ... Irrigation .
Medicine .
Education .
Yeah , yeah , all right , fair enough .
From The Life of Brian
Why , he asked the long - dead Emperor rhetorically , had he failed to build in Britain a monument to match the Pantheon in Rome ( whose remarkable dome Hadrian is supposed to have designed ) ?
Instead , the Mayor continued , Hadrian 's architectural legacy to us is something as humdrum as a wall .
Perhaps those who admire the Latin language are right .
Heroic buildings are , as Boris Johnson observed , one of the Roman Empire 's great legacies .
But more lasting and far - reaching even than these is the influence of the Roman rhetorical tradition - an array of instructions and strategies for using language to persuade .
Our legal system , public debating conventions , and even the way contentious issues are argued over daily in newspapers and on television , have all been shaped and defined by a method credited to the great Roman orator Cicero , and reduced to a set of practical rules in the Oratorical Institutes of the later pedagogic writer Quintilian .
At the heart of this system are techniques for arguing in utramque partem - being able to take either side on any contentious issue .
The importance of " argument on both sides " derives from the assumption that there are few debatable matters that can be settled simply by mustering the facts for and against .
More usually , opinions on one side or the other of any argument are formed , and audiences swayed , on the basis of astute manipulation of limited evidence , backed up by an array of persuasive tactics , designed to construct a convincing case .
Boris Johnson is a passionate advocate of a classical education Quintilian calls such arguments controversiae - from which we get the word controversial .
In the Roman law courts this leads to a method of arguing forensically which is still known today as adversarial .
As these words suggest , arguing in utramque partem arouses strong feelings on both sides .
Anticipating and controlling strong emotions is part of the training both Cicero and Quintilian advocate at an advanced stage in the preparation of anyone whose career requires a mastery of rhetoric in all its complexity .
As Cicero puts it , in his lastingly influential work
On the perfect orator ( De Oratore ) : " The man who can hold forth on every matter under debate in two contradictory ways of pleading , or can argue for and against every proposition that can be laid down - such a man is the true , the complete , and the only orator . "
So the great persuaders are those who can not only marshal the evidence on behalf of any question , but can also organise that material rhetorically , to present their case in the best possible light .
And if called upon to do so , they can also present the opposite side of the argument just as convincingly .
Except in cases of absolute certainty - where truth and falsehood are clear and incontrovertible -- , there is likely to be at least one accomplished advocate on either side of the question .
For and against Roman discussions of exemplary forms of public debate are particularly relevant today .
Our press and broadcast media currently thrive on the lurid presentation of controversy , particularly in the areas of science and medicine .
Some of us are beginning to think that the tradition of adversarial argument is being tested to the limit .
Ofcom points out that it is not within its remit to pronounce on the accuracy of a television documentary - only news programmes are required by law to be factually accurate
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View
Last month the media regulator Ofcom published its response to complaints brought against a Channel 4 programme shown in March 2007 , entitled The Great Global Warming Swindle .
The programme is written , directed and narrated by Martin Durkin - a film - maker with a reputation for being combative ( he once made a programme which claimed that the medical dangers of silicone breast implants had been exaggerated for political reasons ) .
The thrust of the programme is that the formidable array of international scientists lined up in support of the view that global warming is caused by rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and that these rising levels are man-made , amounts to a conspiracy .
As Durkin states it : " In this film it will be shown that the earth 's climate is always changing , that there is nothing unusual about the current temperature and that the scientific evidence does not support the notion that climate is driven by carbon dioxide , man -made or otherwise .
Everywhere you are told that man-made climate change is proved beyond doubt .
But you are being told lies . "
It sits in an interesting way alongside another film aired a year earlier - former US vice - president , and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , Al Gore 's 2006 full - length documentary , An Inconvenient Truth .
This presents with equally robust partisanship the case that a man-made global warming crisis is scientifically irrefutable , is indeed already upon us , and that action on the part of each of us is urgently needed .
Although Gore 's film is scrupulously argued and illustrated , it too has been challenged by those who disagree with its assumptions and conclusions .
Last year a High Court Judge pronounced it one - sided , and found that it contained nine factual errors or exaggerations .
Taking sides Ofcom received 265 complaints about The Great Global Warming Swindle from individual members of the public , and a group complaint which included a number of eminent scientists .
All were concerned that it was not presented with due impartiality and that it misrepresented the facts .
Natural cycles or man-made warming ?
In its judgment , Ofcom points out that it is not within its remit to pronounce on the accuracy of a television documentary .
Only news programmes are apparently required by law to be factually accurate .
In the time - honoured tradition of Cicero and Quintilian , documentary - makers are allowed to present their argument using any tactics and material they choose , as long as these do not wilfully mislead .
In a polemical programme like The Great Global Warming Swindle , strong partiality is allowed in the interests of informed debate .
Ofcom 's view is that most people watching would be aware that there is a scientific consensus that human production of carbon dioxide is a major cause of global warming , and would understand that the views expressed in the programme are only espoused by a small minority .
So , their ruling is that there was no harm in Martin Durkin rhetorically tilting the scales of his argument in favour of that minority view .
On the other hand , the regulator said Channel 4 did break rules on impartiality .
It also found that several interviewees , including the government 's former chief scientific advisor , Sir David King , and Professor Carl Wunsch , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had been treated unfairly .
In particular , they said , the programme had made some significant allegations without offering an opportunity for appropriate and timely response .
Temperatures rising An Inconvenient Truth and The Great Global Warming Swindle together provide an almost text - book case for Cicero and Quintilian 's in utramque partem debating .
Al Gore presents his case
One might even propose that , on the evidence of their films , Al Gore and Martin Durkin are a good match for the Roman ideal of a " perfect orator " .
Each organises his arguments and illustrative material with spectacular virtuosity .
And judging by the widespread , heated debate both films have produced , the two spokesmen have gripped the imaginations of sympathisers and opponents alike .
The resulting furore has succeeded in keeping the issue of global warming almost constantly in the public eye .
And yet the Ofcom ruling makes me profoundly uneasy .
If , as the regulator maintains , there is a general consensus that we are ourselves responsible for increasing carbon emissions , and global warming , then is it reasonable to use the format of the factual documentary to claim the contrary ?
If the case made in The Great Global Warming Swindle is currently argued only by a small , vocal minority , then it is a distraction , taking up emotional time and energy .
Meanwhile , the climate change clock is ticking .
We need to stop talking about it and act now .
While believers and non-believers debate in utramque partem , we may already be headed towards global disaster .
Personally , I do n't want to take that risk .
After all , look what happened to the Roman Empire .
Below is a selection of your comments .
To start with a conclusion , and then select the " evidence " to fit around your argument is unscientific , and has no place in any scientific debate .
In science you start with all the evidence / data , and then try to explain the pattern with the simplest explanation , then you test that explanation by using it to make predictions about future data .
Personal opinion is irrelevant if it contradicts the evidence .
Franchesca Mullin , Belfast , Northern Ireland
It is reasonable to use the format of a factual documentary to claim the contrary of a widely accepted principle , provided that the documentary presents evidence to support the contrary viewpoint .
No matter how many people passionately believe in something , that does n't make it true and it is always useful to question such beliefs .
Examples are autism caused by MMR jabs or religious beliefs - both of which are or were widely held but have no evidence to support them .
Brian , Dundee
Your view seems to be that the human - caused rise in atmospheric CO2 level and the link to actual and projected temperatures is a racing certainty .
As a consequence of your judgement you think that Durkin 's programme is a misleading waste of time and should not have been broadcast .
Good science works by producing more and more robust theories which drive out false ideas by continuing to produce accurate predictions of current and future observations .
Bad politics works by suppressing competing ideas rather than outperforming them .
I am not taking sides in the global warming argument : my concern is about the suggestion that unpopular views should not be aired .
David Fargus , Watford , Herts , England Having described the basis of rational and balanced argument , it is a shame that the last three paragraphs of this article represent the complete opposite .
They depend upon the implied assumption that a general consensus is necessarily correct .
History has demonstrated that the opposite is true on countless occasions .
Minorities ( small , vocal or otherwise is irrelevant ) are often proved right and should never be excluded from debate .
If you restrict freedom of speech you will not help to avoid disaster , you will hasten it .
Richard Dalglish , Moreac , France
By all means train people in debate , & onwards from school too .
There is too much woolly thinking , even lack of any thought at all these days .
Would it be possible to train journalists in this form of debate ?
I 'm getting extremely fed up with the presented diet of sound bites & would like something longer , & more reasoned .
This would help promote thought , & clarity of thinking as well - or is people thinking clearly not what Those in Charge want at all ?
Sharon , Portsmouth I was always under the impression the rhetorical method / school was Greek in origin , not Roman ...
Leigh , Oxford Cannot agree with statement of " no great buildings from their time in Britain " were left by the Romans .
How about Hadrian 's wall which must have had more masonry than the Coliseum in its heyday , and was certainly larger .

Sell Your Sizzle Not Your Cow !
The best - looking product wo n’t sell itself ;
The prettiest dotted line wo n’t sign itself , a check wo n’t sign itself and a credit card wo n’t give you it ’s details . . . without the intelligent persuasion of somebody ’s words – either verbal or written compelling the owner to do so , giving you a sale .
You have no doubt heard of the phrase ‘ Do n’t Sell the Steak – Sell the Sizzle ’ however do you know this came about from a 10 year word study ?
Back in 1937 Corporations throughout the country commissioned Elmer Wheeler to set up his “ Word Laboratories ” and find out winning sentences to sell their goods .
Wheeler realized that it was the sales people in the stores who were n’t asking the right questions to their customers .
So he tried and tested 105,000 sentences on over 19,000,000 customers ( such a feat would not be viable nowadays – even Donald Trump could n’t afford it ) .
He found out exactly what sentences worked like gangbusters .
These tested Sentences still work today and will for another 70 years at least .
They are timeless .
Wheeler formulas , rules and principles for devising word combination ’s which make people buy .
The 10 year study , resulted in the formation of the Wheeler Word Laboratory .
The purpose of this unique laboratory was to measure the relative selling effectiveness of words and their sales techniques , to determine with a great degree of accuracy what formation of words and techniques makes the sale more accurate and faster .
Many stores and manufacturers participated in supplying the Wheeler Word Laboratory with hundreds of selling sentences to be tested , and sales gains were recorded everywhere .
Wherever a salesperson was given a “ Tested Selling Sentence ” with its proper “ Tested Technique ” to replace a time - worn statement , sales gains were noted .
For instance , a single sentence increased sales of a manufacturer ’s hand lotion at
B. Altman ’s on Fifth Avenue from 60 per week to 927 .
Another tested combination of words made sales 78 per cent of the times used at R. H. Macy & Company in selling their long - profit brand of coffee and tea .
On another occasion two “ Tested Selling Sentences ” completely sold Bloomingdale ’s , Saks 34th Street , Abraham & Straus of Brooklyn , and William Taylor ’s of Cleveland out of tooth brushes – a staple item – for the first time in the history of these important stores .
Ten years of study of salespeople – ten years trying out formulas , rules , and principles – casting them aside for others – have brought forth some sound , sensible methods of salesmanship .
I have the non exclusive rights to Wheeler ’s ‘ Tested Sentences That Sell ’ – I want to share with you each of his 5 Wheelerpoints over the next week or so .
The Five Wheelerpoints are :
1. Do n’t Sell the Steak – Sell the Sizzle !
2. Do n’t Write – Telegraph .
3. Say It with Flowers .
4. Do n’t Ask If – Ask Which !
5 . Watch your Bark !
Wheelerpoint 1 : Do n’t Sell The Steak – Sell the Sizzle !
What we mean by the “ sizzle ” is the BIGGEST selling point in your proposition – the MAIN reasons why your prospects will want to buy .
The sizzling of the steak starts the sale more than the cow ever did , though the cow is , of course , very necessary .
Hidden in everything you sell , whether a tangible or an intangible , are “ sizzles . ”
Find them and use them to start the sale .
Then , after desire has been established in the prospect ’s thinking , you can bring in the necessary technical points .
The good waiter realizes he must sell the bubbles – not the champagne .
The grocery clerk sells the pucker – not the pickles , the whiff – not the coffee .
It ’s the tang in the cheese which sells it !
The insurance man sells PROTECTION , not cost per week .
Only the butcher sells the cow and not the sizzle , yet even he knows the promise of he sizzle brings him more sales of his better cuts .
For instance , let us take a certain modern vacuum cleaner and see how many “ sizzles ” we can develop to get the prospect saying “ I want ! ” instead of “ Oh hum ! ” :
1. Positive Agitation .
2. Time - to Empty Signal .
3. Dirt Finder .
4. Automatic Rug Adjuster .
5. Non-kink Cord .
6. Instant Handle Positioner .
7. Non-tangle Revolving Brush .
8. Grit Removers .
9. Lint Removers .
10 . Dust Removers
These ten big “ sizzles ” will make people buy this particular make of vacuum cleaner .
The construction , the mechanism , and the prices are important , of course , but the “ I want ” points , are labor - saving , more leisure , cleaner homes and health .
Therefore , the vacuum cleaner salesman must advise himself :
Do n’t sell the price tag – sell less backaches !
Do n’t sell construction – sell labor - saving !
Do n’t sell the motor – sell comfort !
Do n’t sell ball bearings – sell ease of operation !
Do n’t sell suction – sell cleaner rugs !
Health , comfort , labor - saving , leisure , and cleaner homes are the “ sizzles ” in this particular vacuum cleaner ; construction and mechanism the “ cow ” .
Are you beginning to see what is meant by first finding the “ sizzles ” in what you are selling , before even attempting to form the words to convey the “ sizzles ” to the prospect ?
Put on a pair of “ sizzle specs ” now and look at your own “ sales package . ”
Then write down the one , five , ten , or twenty “ sizzles ” you find – in the order of what at first blush you believe will be of importance to the prospect .
Then Learn to Have “ You - Ability ”
One BIG QUESTION is running through your prospect ’s mind as you are showing your product and telling your sales story .
“ What will it do for me ? ”
Therefore , almost everything you say or do must be said and done in such a way – it ALWAYS answers this important question !
You must develop a NEED for your product in the mind of the prospect – for until he realizes a need , you will make little sales progress .
Now all of the “ sizzles ” you list for your product or services may create a need in the mind of the customer – however you need to remember this , although these “ sizzles ” may be of EQUAL IMPORTANCE to you , they may differ in importance to your prospect /s .
If you have “ you - ability , ” you will be able to take your “ sizzles ” and fit them to each prospect with uncanny accuracy !
“ You - ability ” is the ability to get on the other side of the fence – to put on a pair of invisible “ sizzle specs ” and see your product through the EYES OF THE CUSTOMER .
“ You - ability ” is the ability to say “ you , ” not “ I ” – and the ability to present the “ sizzles ” in the order that the CUSTOMER considers important .
Summary of Wheelerpoint 1
Buried in every spool of thread , in every row of safety pins , in every automobile , in every insurance policy , in every grocery , drug , or toilet goods item or every product or service , are reasons why people will want to buy it .
These big reasons we call the “ sizzles . ”
Before you even start to see your prospects , you must line up , in your own mind , the “ sizzles ” they will consider important .
You will then have a “ planned presentation , ” based on all the information you can get about your prospects and your selling package .
You will find that the use of the word “ you ” in your sales presentation , in your written words , ( which today can be your blog , emails , letters , website copy ) . . . will have far more results than the word “ I . ”
Being able to say “ you ” instead of “ I ” is known as “ you - ability . ”
Remember this first Wheelerpoint :
“ Do n’t sell the steak – sell the sizzle . ”
Then with “ you - ability ” in mind you can convey these “ sizzles ” effectively to the prospect in the “ telegraphic ” manner explained in the next chapter .
It ’s the sizzle which sells the Your steak – not the cow !
Dedicated to kikcing your ass until you succeed .
Warmly
Trevor ‘ Toe Cracker ’ Crook

THE growing threat of terrorism has pushed many governments to reassess that balance between civil liberties and state protection .
This week Britain 's Parliament passed a bill that will allow the detention of terrorist suspects without charge for 42 days .
Civil - rights groups such as Liberty point out that at 28 days , Britain already has the highest limit of western ( and some eastern ) democracies .
Other countries at high risk of terrorism , such as Spain or Turkey , may hold suspects for far less time .
America 's government got around the issue by excluding “ unlawful enemy combatants ” from its two - day limit .
A Supreme Court ruling on Thursday June 12th allowing prisoners at Guantánamo Bay to challenge their detentions may change that .

Two days after the fact , questions continue to surround John McCain 's surprisingly strong performance Saturday at Pastor Rick Warren 's Saddleback Church .
The mainstream media and blogosphere alike are abuzz with rumors that McCain pierced Warren 's so - called " cone of silence " and , more serious still , may have purloined his legendary POW " cross in the dirt " story from the late Alexandr Solzhenitsyn .
But on one point , there is no dispute .
Despite CNN 's assurances to the contrary , Rick Warren simply asked Barack Obama and John McCain different questions .
From the very first question , Warren treated McCain with biblical kid gloves , editing out scriptural references that might have proven uncomfortable for the religiously reticent Republican :
QUESTION TO OBAMA :
These first set of questions deal with your personal life as a leader and I 'm not going to do this with any other segment , but as pastor I 've got some verses that have to do with leadership .
The first issue is the area of listening .
There is a verse in Proverbs that says fools think they need no advice but the wise listen to other people .
Who are the wisest three people you know in your life and who are you going to rely on heavily in your administration ?
QUESTION TO MCCAIN :
This first question deals with leadership and the personal life of leadership .
First question , who were the three wisest people that you know that you would rely on heavily in an administration ?
Chuck Todd of MSNBC was quick to note the strikingly different answers Obama and McCain offered , but not the clearly different questions they were asked :
" Take the VERY first question Warren posed to both candidates : who are three people you 'll depend on for wisdom in the presidency .
Obama seemed to answer this in a very personal way , talking about his wife and grandmother .
McCain went right to this message , checking boxes on Iraq ( Patraeus ) and the economy ( Whitman ) for instance .
Now , I 'm betting Obama 's answer came across as more authentic but McCain 's was probably more effective with undecided swing voters . "
Given the very different framing of the question Warren posed , it 's no surprise that Barack Obama and John McCain produced strikingly different responses in both substance and style .
Obama took Warren 's personal question personally , and cited his wife and grandmother as both " wise and honest ' ' before moving on to a litany of political figures on both sides of the aisle .
( Obama 's mention of the radical social conservative Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) was transparent pandering to his audience . )
For his part , McCain responded to Warren 's political question and pointed to General David Petraeus , Obama supporter Congressman John Lewis and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman .
( McCain was quick to return to his stump speech and extol the glories of eBay as America 's economic future . )
But Warren 's divergent paths for Obama and McCain split further with the very next question on leadership and moral weakness .
Again , Warren turned to the Bible for Barack Obama , but to Dr. Phil for John McCain :
QUESTION TO OBAMA : Let 's talk about personal life .
The Bible says that integrity and love are the basis for leadership .
This is a tough question .
What would be looking over your life , everybody 's got wings [ sic ] , would be the greatest moral failure in your life and what would be the greatest moral failure in America ?
QUESTION TO MCCAIN :
We had a lot leaders because of their weaknesses , character flaws , stumbled , become ineffective [ and ] are not serving anymore , serving our country .
What 's been your greatest moral failure and what has been the - what do you think is the greatest moral failure of America ?
Again , the different framing of the question put Obama at a distinct disadvantage .
After admitting his own troubled , selfish youth as his personal failing , Obama turned to scripture to highlight America 's failure to live up to its own ideals :
" I think America 's greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still do n't live by that basic precept in Matthew that whatever you for the least of my brothers , you do for me . "
In contrast , McCain killed two birds with one stone .
He dispensed with his own marital infidelity in a single sentence , " my greatest moral failing , and I have been an imperfect person , is the failure of my first marriage . "
( The issue never surfaced again , and Warren 's admission Friday that he " absolutely " would have compunctions about voting for an adulterer never became an issue for McCain . )
More important , McCain highlighted America 's greatest shortcoming as a failure to " serve cause greater than yourself . "
That theme - " country first " - is the rhetorical cornerstone of the McCain campaign .
And the contrast of his response with Obama 's discussion of his own battle with what Warren termed " fundamental selfishness " could n't have been more strategic for McCain .
Warren 's different framing of the inquiries he posed and the tailored , selective follow - ups continued in his discussion of marriage .
Warren asked Obama and McCain alike to " define marriage . "
But while Obama was then asked , " Would you support a constitutional amendment with that definition , " Warren instead offered John McCain an opportunity to weigh in on a hotly contested ballot measure being pushed by the religious right in California :
" Let me just ask a related question to that .
We got a bill right here in California , Proposition 8 , that 's going on because the Court overturned this definition of marriage .
Was the Supreme Court of California wrong ? "
It 's no secret that the foes of same - sex marriage see Proposition 8 as essential to fueling Republican turn - out in November .
And so it went all night .
And so it went all night .
Thanks in no small part to Pastor Warren 's biblical guidance , Barack Obama spoke in a personal , conversational style , making a point throughout to refer to the principles of his Christian faith in the misguided attempt to please an audience indifferent to him at best , downright hostile at worst .
So while Barack Obama talked of " trying to do God 's work , " John McCain did the work of his campaign advisers .
Despite Warren 's feeble requests not to do so , McCain just repackaged his stump speech and made purely political appeals .
In so doing , John McCain probably had the best night of the campaign .
So I have started to release versions of Padre , the Perl IDE .
It is usable but far from being an IDE yet .
Maybe it would be a good time to stop and think a bit about a few questions :
Who and why needs an IDE for Perl ?
Why and in what can Padre be better than the existing tools ?
On the web site of Padre I have started to collect links to articles and discussions about Perl development tools .
IDEs , debuggers and why people would need or why they should not use one .
I even asked on the perl - trainers mailing list what do they use ?
Let 's try to group people writing Perl code according to their level of experience and Perl projects according to their size .
There are some very experience Perl programmers - mostly those who attend Perl conferences or practicing PerlMonks or participate in Perl Monger meetings or mailing lists - ( also known as the Perl community ) who have their own tools ( many use vi or emacs ) and do n't see anything lacking .
Even if they do , they rather solve it in their preferred tool than switch to something else .
There are a few hundred or maybe thousand such people in the world .
I would really like those to start using Padre as they can be the people adding more features to it but they are not likely to switch , unless the IDE can provide everything they had in the old system and some real advantages .
At least in some situations .
Experienced developers new to Perl are usually used to have an IDE in their other languages .
I see people from the C++ , C# and Java world , when they need to write in Perl they complain a lot about the lack of IDE .
They are so used to have one that it is much harder for them to switch to a simple editor .
Those of them who are already familiar with Eclipse are lucky as EPIC seems to be quite a nice plug - in to Eclipse .
Those who do n't know Eclipse yet will still have the learning curve .
Total beginners and people who rarely use Perl might benefit a lot from some of the features of an IDE .
These people tend to use Perl for small scripts but they need a lot of hand holding in finding functions , finding and installing modules that might do part of the work .
They need lots of help in writing better perl code ( e.g. recommend use strict and use warnings if they are not using ) .
During training we usually do n't want to deal with editors people do n't know , hence Padre needs to behave as expected from any simple text editor .
It just need to have some extra features built in that will help the people with their first steps in Perl .
So I think beginners can benefit a lot from an IDE , the problem is that those who can recommend an IDE - the experienced people - will not use it much unless there are some advantages to it .
So besides providing the features that are needed for beginners it will be important to add advanced feature that might bring some of the advanced Perl programmers over to use Padre .
At least in cases where they have to deal with less experienced people .

This dish was satisfying and tasty but it could n't decide if it was a weird , partially - inverted plate of nachos or a nacho - inspired casserole .
For my money , I prefer Basic Breakfast Nachos where the eggs are scrambled ( maybe with cooked sausage ) , placed on corn chips , covered with cheese and placed under the broiler for a minute .
For more of a baked casserole that uses chorizo , try our Mexican Breakfast Quiche which is near perfect , compared to this just - alright recipe .
I ate and enjoyed these Baked Breakfast Nachos , but I doubt that I 'd make it again .
( This recipe was submitted in 2005 .
It was tested and photographed in March 2017 . )
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
In a large skillet at medium - high heat , fry the chorizo sausage .
When fully browned , remove the chorizo from the skillet with a slotted spoon and drain it .
Set aside on folded paper towels .
Reduce stove top temperature to medium and saute the onion in the grease left from sausage - for about 10 minutes - until carmalized .
Prepare a large casserole dish by coating the bottom and sides with softend butter .
Place casserole dish in oven to preheat .
( This will help assure that your eggs set . )
In a mixing bowl , lightly beat the eggs with the Tablespoon of water and pinch of salt .
Add the sausage and stir to combine .
Remove the prepared baking dish from the oven and add mixture from the bowl .
Top with enough tortilla chips to create a thick layer above the egg mixture .
Layer the cooked onion and cheese on top of the chips .
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes - until eggs are fully set .
Top with salsa and serve .
Mr Breakfast would like to thankfor this recipe .
Last month , Neil Berkett ( the new CEO of Virgin Media , one of my ISPs in London ) announced that Network Neutrality was " bollocks " and that Internet services would have to pay for premium connections or be relegated to the " Internet bus - lane . "
In other words , rather than giving me the sites I asked for as fast as they could , Virgin would henceforth deliver the sites that paid bribes faster than other sites ( Virgin tried to spin this by saying that the sites that paid would get priority traffic — but how do you prioritize one service 's packets without de-prioritizing other sites ' packets ? ) .
I said then that I would resign my Virgin account over this , and now that I 'm back in London , I 've been able to look up my account number and send off the following letter ( they have 28 days to respond , and I 'll post their reply here too ) :
Complaints ,
Virgin Media ,
PO Box 333 ,
Matrix Court ,
Swansea SA7 9ZJ May 7 , 2008 To Whom it May Concern :
We are writing to you today to cancel our Virgin Broadband account , having read the remarks of your new CEO , Neil Berkett , in which he described the idea of Net Neutrality as " bollocks , " promising that any Internet service that failed to pay off Virgin to deliver its packets would be put into the " Internet bus lane . "
We contracted with Virgin Broadband to provide us with access to the Internet , on the implicit understanding that Virgin would supply us with the packets we requested at the highest speeds it could manage .
We did not sign up to be used as tokens in a tawdry game in which Virgin demands back - handers from the world 's websites in exchange for access to us .
We want to access the Internet , not be traded to another inmate for two packs of cigarettes .
We believe that this is a material violation of our agreement with Virgin , that Virgin has substantially altered the nature of the service we are paying for .
Therefore in accordance with your own terms and conditions , para , J4 , " If we and / or Virgin Media Payments break the terms and conditions of this agreement , you 're free to end this agreement " we would ask you to terminate my contract without any penalties or fees .
Sincerely ,

Pro-democratic pressure for change has been building in Tonga Tonga 's king , George Tupou V , is to give up much of the near - absolute power his family has held for generations .
He is to surrender his role in day - to - day governmental affairs and be guided by the PM , his spokesman has said .
The monarch - who took over from his father , Tupou IV , in September 2006 - is being formally enthroned on Friday .
The palace had long pledged democratic reforms , but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing , correspondents say .
George V , 60 , is making the changes to prepare the monarchy for 2010 , when most of the new parliament will be elected , said Hon Fielakepa , the Lord Chamberlain and royal spokesman .
" The Sovereign of the only Polynesian kingdom ... is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people , " he said .
Last week , the government said the king had completed the sale of his ownership of state assets which had contributed to much of the royal family 's wealth .
Tonga is one of a handful of countries in the world where the monarch has a hand in the daily running of government .
But pressure for change has been building in the South Pacific nation .
Unrest boiled over into riots in 2006 at a pro-democracy rally in the capital , Nuku'alofa , that left eight people dead and destroyed much of the city .
George V's coronation was delayed as a result .

Earlier this week , Keith Olbermann complained about FISA and the Justice Department ’s proposed changes on domestic snooping .
It was nice to hear Olbermann excoriate the government for creating an " embryonic police state , " never mind this sucker is beyond gestation and growing in our midst like a tenacious weed .
Olbermann took the Democrats to task for allowing the FISA revision and allowing the Bush neocons and the Justice Department to propose local cops be tapped to snoop for the feds , in other words recruited to become Stasi operatives taking orders from the DHS , FBI , and CIA , " embedded " in the neighborhood cop shop as of 2003 with the enactment of HR 3439 .
Ain’t nothing embryonic " about it .
Olbermann showed his real colors .
He said the next president — assumed to be Obama , as Olbermann is a Democrat — will be saddled with Bush ’s intelligence " embryo . "
Keith made it sound like Obama disapproves and the already long established and well developed snoop state apparatus will be a yoke around his neck .
In fact , Obama voted in the Senate for the current FISA bill , to the chagrin of no shortage of Democrats , many now finally coming around and realizing there is no difference between Democrats and Republicans and if you turn ’em upside down they all look alike .
Under Democrat Lyndon Johnson , the snoop state flourished , from COINTELPRO to the CIA ’s Operation CHAOS and beyond .
" At this time , there was an impression given to the intelligence community of ‘ get the job done ’ regardless of the methods , " writes Major Kevin G. Donaleski , USMC .
In 1975 , the Church Committee concluded government officials , in both Democrat and Republican administrations , had " violated or ignored the law over long periods of time and have advocated and defended their right to break the law " and had " undertaken the secret surveillance of citizens on the basis of their political beliefs ….
primarily through secret informants , but also using other intrusive techniques such as wiretaps , microphone ‘ bugs ’ , surreptitious mail opening , and break - ins . "
Back in the day all of this was illegal .
Now , under the guise of the Patriot Act , the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 , the Protect America Act of 2007 , and a flurry of executive orders the violation of the Constitution is regarded as legal .
Obama , if elected , will not throw out these laws , or shut down the NSA ’s warrantless surveillance , he will enhance them .
In fact , once elected , Obama will likely organize and unleash his promised National Security Force , a secret national police force larger than anything over at the Pentagon .
Can we expect Keith Olbermann to talk about these issues come November and the selection of Barack Obama ?
Probably not , although he seems willing to take the Democrats in Congress to task for going along to get along with Bush and his neocon students of Carl Schmitt , the Nazi jurist who advocated a dictatorship of the executive .
It ’s all partisan double talk .
Far too many Democrats , apparently including Mr. Olbermann , are not really interested in restoring the Constitution and the republic .
It ’s all about getting their guy in office .
Obama revealed his true colors when he voted for the FISA " compromise . "
Once in office , the Democrats will make the same old flaccid excuses now made by the neocons in order to continue the erosion of our liberty .

New research strongly suggests that a mix of preventative agents , such as those found in concentrated black raspberries , may more effectively inhibit cancer development than single agents aimed at shutting down a particular gene .
Researchers at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center examined the effect of freeze - dried black raspberries on genes altered by a chemical carcinogen in an animal model of esophageal cancer .
The carcinogen affected the activity of some 2,200 genes in the animals ’ esophagus in only one week , but 460 of those genes were restored to normal activity in animals that consumed freeze - dried black raspberry powder as part of their diet during the exposure .
These findings , published in recent issue of the journal Cancer Research , also helped identify 53 genes that may play a fundamental role in early cancer development and may therefore be important targets for chemoprevention agents .
“ We have clearly shown that berries , which contain a variety of anticancer compounds , have a genome - wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development , ” says principal investigator Gary D. Stoner , a professor of pathology , human nutrition and medicine who studies dietary agents for the prevention of esophageal cancer .
“ This suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents , which berries provide , may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes . ”
Stoner notes that black raspberries have vitamins , minerals , phenols and phytosterols , many of which individually are known to prevent cancer in animals .

“ Freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times , giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer , ” he says .
To conduct this study , Stoner and his colleagues fed rats either a normal diet or a diet containing 5 percent black - raspberry powder .
During the third week , half the animals in each diet group were injected three times with a chemical carcinogen , N - nitrosomethylbenzylamine .
The animals continued consuming the diets during the week of carcinogen treatment .
After the third week , the researchers examined the animals ’ esophageal tissue , thereby capturing gene changes that occur early during carcinogen exposure .
Their analyses included measuring the activity , or expression levels , of 41,000 genes .
In the carcinogen - treated animals , 2,261 of these genes showed changes in activity of 50 percent or higher .
“ These changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation , marked inflammation , and increased apoptosis , ” Stoner says .
In the animals fed berry powder , however , a fifth of the carcinogen affected genes – exactly 462 of them – showed near - normal levels of activity , when compared with controls .
Most of these genes are associated with cell proliferation and death , cell attachment and movement , the growth of new blood vessels and other processes that contribute to cancer development .
The tissue also appeared more normal and healthy .
advertisement
Lastly , of the 462 genes restored to normal by the berries , 53 of them were also returned to normal by a second chemoprevention agent tested during a companion study .
“ Because both berries and the second agent maintain near - normal levels of expression of these 53 genes , we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer , ” Stoner says .
“ What ’s emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough , ” Stoner says .
“ And berries are not enough .
We never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries .
So we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone . ”

Air Force Dismantles Crashed C-130 in Military - Style : With Lots of Explosives
What do you do with a C - 130 cargo aircraft that has made a crash - landing in an insecure area of Iraq ?
If you ’re the 447th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron you wire it with explosives and you blow it up .
Again and again and again … until it ’s in small enough bits to load onto a flatbed and ship back to an air base .
Apparently it ’s pretty rare for an aircraft to make emergency landings in the field , which is good news .
Though if it resulted in more videos like this , we would n’t complain .

An abridgement of the letter from Albert Einstein to Eric Gutkind from Princeton in January 1954 , translated from German by Joan Stambaugh .
It will be sold at Bloomsbury auctions on Thursday
... I read a great deal in the last days of your book , and thank you very much for sending it to me .
What especially struck me about it was this .
With regard to the factual attitude to life and to the human community we have a great deal in common .
...
The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the Bible a collection of honourable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish .
No interpretation no matter how subtle can ( for me ) change this .
These subtilised interpretations are highly manifold according to their nature and have almost nothing to do with the original text .
For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions .
And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people .
As far as my experience goes , they are also no better than other human groups , although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power .
Otherwise I cannot see anything ' chosen ' about them .
In general I find it painful that you claim a privileged position and try to defend it by two walls of pride , an external one as a man and an internal one as a Jew .
As a man you claim , so to speak , a dispensation from causality otherwise accepted , as a Jew the priviliege of monotheism .
But a limited causality is no longer a causality at all , as our wonderful Spinoza recognized with all incision , probably as the first one .
And the animistic interpretations of the religions of nature are in principle not annulled by monopolisation .
With such walls we can only attain a certain self - deception , but our moral efforts are not furthered by them .
On the contrary .
Now that I have quite openly stated our differences in intellectual convictions it is still clear to me that we are quite close to each other in essential things , ie in our evalutations of human behaviour .
What separates us are only intellectual ' props ' and ' rationalisation ' in Freud 's language .
Therefore I think that we would understand each other quite well if we talked about concrete things .
With friendly thanks and best wishes
Yours , A. Einstein
We ’ve written here before about people traveling to undergo plastic surgery , but moving to another country then getting plastic surgery to look more like the people whose country / continent you are living in , is a whole new ( not to mention depressing ) concept .
An increasing number of immigrants in Europe are opting to change their facial features in order to look more “ western ” , or less conspicuous on the street .
Apparently , the nose is most characteristic of where we come from which is why rhinoplasty is the most popular surgery amongst these immigrants .
In Spain , the surgery costs Euro 5000 and takes 20 minutes .
In one of my previous posts I wrote how although Spain can be culturally insensitive , I did n’t find Spain racist at all .
But after reading that about 2,500 South Americans ( mainly Ecuadorians and Colombians ) have nose jobs every year ( many of those live in Madrid ) , it made me think again :
Why do these Latinos want to go to such an extent to fit in ?
What sort of discrimination are they suffering ?
How have we let social stigmas in our so - called “ multi-cultural - multinational - society ” go so far as to warrant reactions like this ?
Back when I was doing research , one of my advisors once joked that , if you wait long enough , you can produce an old result using new methods , manage to get it published , and everyone will be impressed .
I think his time limit was 15 years .
Apparently , when it comes to big ideas about science ( rather than scientific results ) , the schedule 's a bit accelerated .
Just shy of 10 years ago , Chris Anderson , then Editor - in - Chief at Wired , published a piece in which he claimed that cloud computing was making the scientific method irrelevant .
All those models and theories did n't matter , so long as an algorithm could identify patterns in your data .
The piece was wrong then , as I explained at the time ( see below ) .
It has n't gotten any more right in the meantime .
Yet a quote from Chris Anderson 's article led off a new column last month that essentially says Anderson was right , he just had the wrong reason .
It 's not cloud computing that 's going to make theory irrelevant — it 's AI , the piece argues .
Once trained , AI can recognize patterns using rules that we do n't comprehend .
Set it loose on scientific data , and it can pull things out without needing anything like a model or a theory .
The column is sweeping in its scope , and it includes some good and accurate information .
But its fundamental premise is based on a misunderstanding of how AI is being used in science .
I 'll illustrate that using one of its own examples : the use of neural networks in particle physics .
Identifying a new particle , like the Higgs boson , depends on being able to recognize not the particle itself , but the spray of particles that it decays into .
Neural networks have gotten pretty good at detecting patterns , and so they 've come to be used in particle physics , searching through the debris of countless collisions , looking for a pattern that represents something interesting .
This , the column suggests , hints that AI is replacing the need for theory in particle physics .
That 's wrong on multiple levels .
To begin with , particles like the Higgs boson can't decay to any old random spray of lighter particles .
They obey rules that dictate which particles are possible , and in which combinations .
Those rules are what allowed us to identify the Higgs in the first place , and they were set by theory — the Standard Model of physics , to be specific .
Yes , you do n't necessarily have to teach a neural network those rules to get it to recognize particles .
All you need to do is feed it enough examples of collisions with and without a Higgs in them .
Of course , the only way that 's possible is to have a bunch of examples of the Higgs in the first place ... which we needed the Standard Model to know we produced .
And the resulting neural network would n't have its own alternative version of the Standard Model percolating through its nodes ; it would just be doing standard pattern recognition .
Could a neural network be trained to find something completely new , unpredicted by theory ?
Maybe .
But you 'd have to train it on lots of things we know are n't interesting and then get it to look for exceptions .
And , of course , we know those things are n't interesting because we have a solid theoretical understanding of particle physics .
Would any of the results it pulled out have testable consequences ?
Nope .
We 'd have to go back to crafting a theory to get those .
I 'm not going to claim that neural networks or some other form of AI will never be able to find something truly novel on their own , or that we 're never going to have to revise our current understanding of the value of theories and testable models .
But I 'm comfortable saying that we 're not there yet , and it's not clear that we 've gotten any closer .
My original response to that old Chris Anderson 's column , first published in June 2008 , appears unchanged below .
Nope , the cloud wo n't obscure it either
Every so often , someone ( generally not a practicing scientist ) suggests that it 's time to replace science with something better .
The desire often seems to be a product of either an exaggerated sense of the potential of new approaches , or a lack of understanding of what 's actually going on in the world of science .
This week 's version , which comes courtesy of Chris Anderson , the Editor - in - Chief of Wired , manages to combine both of these features in suggesting that the advent of a cloud of scientific data may free us from the need to use the standard scientific method .
It 's easy to see what has Anderson enthused .
Modern scientific data sets are increasingly large , comprehensive , and electronic .
Things like genome sequences tell us all there is to know about the DNA present in an organism 's cells , while DNA chip experiments can determine every gene that 's expressed by that cell .
That data 's also publicly available — out in the cloud , in the current parlance — and it 's being mined successfully .
That mining extends beyond traditional biological data , too , as projects like WikiProteins are also drawing on text - mining of the electronic scientific literature to suggest connections among biological activities .
There is a lot to like about these trends , and little reason not to be enthused about them .
They hold the potential to suggest new avenues of research that scientists would n't have identified based on their own analysis of the data .
But Anderson appears to take the position that the new research part of the equation has become superfluous ; simply having a good algorithm that recognizes the correlation is enough .
The source of this flight of fancy was apparently a quote by Google 's research director , who repurposed a cliché that most scientists are aware of : " All models are wrong , and increasingly you can succeed without them . "
And Google clearly has .
It does n't need to develop a theory as to why a given pattern of links can serve as an indication of valuable information ; all it needs to know is that an algorithm that recognizes specific link patterns satisfies its users .
Anderson 's argument distills down to the suggestion that science can operate on the same level — mechanisms , models , and theories are all dispensable as long as something can pick the correlations out of masses of data .
I can't possibly imagine how he comes to that conclusion .
Correlations are a way of catching a scientist 's attention , but the models and mechanisms that explain them are how we make the predictions that not only advance science , but generate practical applications .
One only needs to look at a promising field that lacks a strong theoretical foundation — high - temperature superconductivity springs to mind — to see how badly the lack of a theory can impact progress .
Put in more practical terms , would Anderson be willing to help test a drug that was based on a poorly understood correlation pulled out of a datamine ?
These days , we like our drugs to have known targets and mechanisms of action and , to get there , we need standard science .
Anderson does provide two examples that he feels support his position , but they actually appear to undercut it .
He notes that we know quantum mechanics is wrong on some level , but have been unable to craft a replacement theory after decades of work .
But he neglects to mention two key things : without the testable predictions made by the theory , we 'll never be able to tell how precisely it is wrong and , in those decades where we 've failed to find a replacement , the predictions of quantum mechanics have been used to create the modern electronics industry , with the data cloud being a consequence of that .
If anything , his second example is worse .
We can now perform large - scale genetic surveys of the life present in remote environments , such as the far reaches of the Pacific .
Doing so has informed us that there 's a lot of unexplored biodiversity on the bacterial level ; fragments of sequence hint at organisms we 've never encountered under a microscope .
But as Anderson himself notes , the only thing we can do is make a few guesses as to the properties of the organisms based on who their relatives are , an activity that actually requires a working scientific theory , namely evolution .
To do more than that , we need to deploy models of metabolism and ecology against the bacteria themselves .
Overall , the foundation of the argument for a replacement for science is correct : the data cloud is changing science , and leaving us in many cases with a Google - level understanding of the connections between things .
Where Anderson stumbles is in his conclusions about what this means for science .
The fact is that we could n't have even reached this Google - level understanding without the models and mechanisms that he suggests are doomed to irrelevance .
But , more importantly , nobody , including Anderson himself if he had thought about it , should be happy with stopping at this level of understanding of the natural world .

The fish was much bigger than this ( Pic : Afolabi Sotunde )
Over 20,000 fishermen entered the annual fishing contest in the northern state of Kebbi .
Bello Yakub , 48 , wrestled his monster fish out of the water with the help of two flimsy nets to win prizes worth $ 33,900 ( £ 17,000 ) .
He said this was the first time he had won in more than 30 attempts .
" I just hope I can use the prize money for something good , " he told reporters .
He won a car , fishing gear , £ 1000 in cash and a place on the Hajj pigrimage to Mecca .
But his catch is not a record - three years ago , the winner caught a fish weighing 75kg ( 11st 11lb ) .
The huge fish are called Giwan Rua , which means " elephant of the water " .
The men line up a kilometre away from the Fadan Mata river outside the village of Argungu and at the sound of a gun charge into the water .
Fishing is only allowed on the two - mile stretch of water once a year .
Last year the festival was cancelled because of elections held in April .
Fishermen wade through the water , which reaches chin - high in parts , dragging nets along the bottom .
Fish are placed inside a hollowed out calabash - a kind of dried pumpkin .
Many fishermen are poor swimmers and use gourds tied together as flotation devices .
The prize money is provided by the Kebbi state government and the ministry of culture and tourism .
The festival developed from a celebration of peace between the city states of Sokoto and Kebbi , who had been at war with each other until the 16th century .
It has been held regularly , along with an agricultural show and other cultural displays since 1934 .
US Exports to Iran grew tenfold under Bush presidency
( AP ) The value of U.S. exports to Iran grew more than tenfold during President Bush 's years in office even as he pressed for tougher international limits on trade and accused Iran of nuclear ambitions and helping terrorists .
Records show that at least $ 148,000 of weapons and other unspecified military gear has been sent to Iran .

The Age of Reason and the Age of Innocence are past .
The Age of Unreason is upon us .
Consider the national energy policies being promoted by McCain and Obama , as examples , or consider the current energy policies of the nation .
These policies are rational and reasonable for those who aim to benefit from them and succeed in doing so .
Who are these people ?
They are those who seek to aggrandize their wealth and power at the expense of others .
They are those who succeed in their endeavors by getting laws passed that favor them , such as biomass , ethanol , and solar panel subsidies .
They are those who succeed at deceit and trickery , and who shift risks and costs from one set of persons to another .
In other words , they are those engaging in criminal behavior .
They are criminals .
But if we conceive of these energy measures as being aimed at the welfare of you and me , or at the General Welfare , then the national energy policies typically are irrational .
By this I mean that they are not policies that you or I would engage in , either as reasonable personal choices or as choices made by persons , such as we are , who respect the property of others .
We would not lawfully take money from our neighbors , and then we would not reasonably pay this money to farmers to grow corn to produce ethanol and end up paying more than if we had purchased gasoline from the nearest supermarket or Mobil station .
We would not claim to own the sea bed of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and prevent others from looking there for oil or minerals .
We would not force everyone to use a particular kind of washing machine or light bulb .
We find ever more of our choices being made for us by national policies , all of which share this common defect of being not only unreasonable but necessarily unreasonable .
We observe a widespread unreasoning acceptance of this unreasonable procedure .
We observe the general run of leaders in our major institutions ( press , university , pulpit , science ) who are either silent about these national impositions or support them .
This widespread acceptance of unreason by unreasoning persons is why I nominate this age as The Age of Unreason .
An alternative label is The Age of Irrationality .
What is energy policy ?
Energy policy , in common parlance , means a national energy policy , a made - in - Washington energy policy .
And that means a diktat , a decree , an edict , emitted from the bowels of Congress , signed by the Executive , enforced by the bureaucracy , and paid for by us .
The last thing that ( national ) energy policy will be or can be is a rational policy aimed at the production and consumption of energy by free persons .
The last thing that it will or can aim at is the General Welfare .
The last thing that it will or can be is constitutional .
Instead , the next energy policy will , like the current one , be unreasonable and irrational .
As now , the next energy policy will be a set of complex commands fashioned behind closed doors and covering everything from light bulbs to lawn mowers .
It will abridge natural liberties and constrain our personal actions to irrational paths .
The next energy policy , like the current one , will blanket the entire U.S. with one set of unconstitutional rules .
What is a non-criminal rational energy policy ?
There is no such thing as a non-criminal , rational , national energy policy .
Congress can only create national policies , but no national policy ( with any non-zero content ) can possibly be rational or non-criminal .
The only rational and non-criminal national energy policy is the null set , that is , nothing , the set of commands that is empty , no national commands at all , no national energy policy whatsoever .
Corn ethanol subsidies do not just happen by chance to be an unreasonable policy .
Restrictions on ocean drilling do not just happen by chance to be criminal .
National policies like these must typically be unreasonable and criminal because of the business that Congress is in .
The business of Congress is to shift costs and risks from one set of persons to another .
The business of Congress is to tax , seize , and take .
The business of Congress is to subsidize one person at the expense of another .
The only national energy policy that does not , in the way of the fascist , curtail liberty while leaving standing the shell and pretense of private property and free markets , is no national energy policy whatsoever .
Liberty means the liberty to choose one ’s own autos , fuels , energy sources , light bulbs , appliances , boats , means of transportation , location , insulation , furnaces , without being influenced by regulation , subsidy , and taxes .
Liberty means not being told what to do by the dictator known as Congress .
I am no fan of constitutions .
Ours has loopholes big enough to drive trucks through .
The Framers aimed at fostering a strong national government , and they succeeded .
Nevertheless , it takes large doses of unreason to torture the language of the poor Constitution to death , such that it yields up as legal the powers and measures that today routinely make up national policies .
With all of the defects of the U.S. Constitution , it still takes considerable unreason to overpower its provisions in favor of the criminal government we have today .
Another election year is upon us .
McCain and Obama are out voicing their energy policies .
Will this talk influence some votes and the election ?
It might .
Will it affect what eventually comes out of Congress ?
Maybe .
Will it result in an energy policy that improves our lot ?
No .
The opposite is far more likely .
There is scarcely any line in any McCain or Obama speech on energy policy that is not unreasonable .
The premise of their speeches is unreasonable .
Who needs a national energy policy ?
Such a monstrosity can be right for no one except the special interests it is designed to benefit at our expense .
Each of us already has his own energy policy , and that is the way it should be .
A news article says " Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged to free the United States from dependence on oil from the Middle East and Venezuela within a decade … "
McCain ’s policy is the same ( see here . )
" As President , I ’ll propose a national energy strategy that will amount to a declaration of independence from the fear bred by our reliance on oil sheiks and our vulnerability to the troubled politics of the lands they rule . "
Policies do not get much more unreasonable than a national policy of oil independence .
Both candidates intend to reshape energy markets , or what is left of them , in a major way .
Their laundry lists differ , but they both are engaging in large - scale national planning .
Both have already pre-judged the case by declaring a goal of oil independence from the Middle East .
Why ?
What if millions of Americans want to trade with the Iranians or Iraqis or Saudis ?
Why do we need these bozos to tell us when we should stop using someone ’s oil and switch to a more or less expensive domestic or foreign source ?
Why are we not each of us in a better position to judge and adapt as time passes ?
Why are we not in the best position each of us to decide what to do concerning energy ?
Are n’t we the ones who are deciding on location , transport , housing , heating , travel , clothing , and so on ?
Are n’t we the ones who face the changing costs and prices ?
Who are these obnoxious politicians with their suffocating arrogance and paternalism telling us what to do ?
One would have thought that central ( national ) planning went out in 1989 with the Soviet Union .
But in the Age of Unreason , such is not so .
The unreasoning mind still considers that command and control make things work .
But central planning is maladaptive and unreasonable as von Mises showed decades ago .
Personal adaptations to changing prices will accomplish the transition to alternative energy sources at appropriate times and places and in appropriate ways .
They will do so smoothly , whereas the State ’s planning will increase uncertainty , make faulty decisions , be subject to political whims and forces , undermine economic growth , and destroy wealth .
An energy transition is a type of emergent or spontaneous process .
It can , if allowed to , happen naturally through decentralized decisions
To learn from the errors of others , like the Soviets , is reasonable .
To learn from the logical thoughts of others , like von Mises , is reasonable .
At present , the political machinery that is shaping our destiny is a force for Unreason that dominates the voices of Reason , and this is why we live in an Age of Unreason .

The man was found asleep in the drifting boat
A last drink proved one too many for a 78 - year - old Swede who fell asleep while trying to row home - from Denmark .
Reports say the man had been drinking in the Danish town of Helsingor but found he did not have enough money for the ferry home to Sweden .
Instead of waiting until morning , he stole a dinghy and tried to row the 5 km ( three miles ) across the Oresund Strait to Helsingborg , police said .
But he fell asleep half - way and drifted until he was rescued by the coastguard .
The man , who has not been named , was found still asleep in the bottom of the boat , and towed back across the strait - a busy shipping lane - to Denmark .
He was put on the next ferry home after he had sobered up , writes the Danish news service Ritzau .
Police said the owner of the dinghy had decided not to press charges , Reuters reports .
An unprecedented cutback in driving is slashing the funds available to rebuild the nation 's aging highway system and expand mass - transit options , underscoring the economic impact of high gasoline prices .
The resulting financial strain is touching off a political battle over government priorities in a new era of expensive oil .
A report to be released Monday by the Transportation Department shows that over the past seven months , Americans have reduced their driving by more than 40 billion miles .
Because of high gasoline prices , ...

When are the US presidential debates and how do they work ?
Details are emerging today about Sen. Barack Obama ’s proposal for a new “ Council for Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships . ”
While information is still being released , there are two immediate concerns with the proposal :
The announcement emphasizes government funding — not changing the character of government to allow more space for civil society solutions .
But even worse , Obama ’s plan says that when a faith - based organization takes federal dollars , it would lose its ability to preserve its faith - based character through maintaining hiring standards consistent with its mission .
It could be forced to hire an atheist .
In other words , it would strike at the heart of the faith - based initiative .
Faith - based and community groups have tremendous potential to solve social problems because they are personal , flexible and local in their responses .
By contrast , government programs are often large , one - size - fits - all and do not respond nearly as quickly .
The Bush administration has rightly highlighted the significance of such faith - based and community groups in addressing social needs and urged that government change in ways that will allow such approaches to flourish .
One primary emphasis has been the need to preserve the religious integrity of groups that participate in government programs to tackle social problems — this is essential to their mission and effectiveness .
We should evaluate any policy efforts to maximize civil society and faith - based solutions by whether they move in the direction of reducing the size and scope of government and whether they help individuals escape dependence and achieve a life of independence .

These names will ring familiar to fans of that galaxy far , far away — the setting for the Star Wars movies , including the new animated feature Star Wars : The Clone Wars .
Now what about V391 Peg b? GJ 3021 b? WASP - 15 b?
If you guessed Star Wars droids , you 're wrong .
They 're the names of actual planets found around other stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy .
Slowly but surely researchers are learning that our stellar neighborhood is filled with extrasolar planets , better known as exoplanets .
Many of them are just as , if not far more , exotic as anything in the Star Wars saga .
And someday they may have names that are equally memorable .

Scientists have found over 300 exoplanets since 1991 , and they hope to find a great deal more .
David Bennett , an astrophysicist at the University of Notre Dame and a dedicated planet hunter , says that current estimates peg the number of stars bearing planets at about 30 percent , though he thinks this figure is closer to 50 percent , as researchers believe that current technology is not yet up to the task of spotting certain categories of planets such as small , Earth - size ones .
With 100 billion stars populating the Milky Way galaxy , that means some 50 billion planetary systems may await discovery , many of which may hold multiple planets resembling our eight - planet configuration .
" We think there are actually more planets out there than stars , " says Bennett .
Unlike the livable worlds in Star Wars , none of the exoplanets discovered thus far are sufficiently Earth - like in either size or distance from their star to be deemed good candidates for life .
The vast majority of known exoplanets are so - called " hot Jupiters " ( or " hot Yavins , " in Star Wars parlance ) : large , gaseous bodies orbiting close to their host stars .
The apparent preponderance of inhospitable places stems from the limitations of currently available detection methods .
Ground - based telescopes gather indirect evidence of an exoplanet 's presence around a star , in the form of regular variations of starlight , and smallish planets like Earth have tiny , hard - to - discern effects on their massive hosts .
But NASA and other space organizations have launched or are planning new missions to better identify Earth - like planets .
A European satellite called COROT ( COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits ) has been successfully hunting exoplanets since 2007 , and early next year NASA plans to power up the Kepler space telescope .
This device will spy on 100,000 stars simultaneously from solar orbit over four years to try and suss out the miniscule signatures of Earth - like planets .
For now , we must rely on artist 's impressions to get a sense of what all these extrasolar worlds may look like .
But getting actual pictures of exoplanets should become possible in the coming years .
The New Worlds Observer project , tentatively scheduled to start up late next decade , will use a flower - shaped " starshade " to block out a star 's overwhelming , planet - obscuring glare .
Scientists then hope to snap direct images of exoplanets and study their atmospheres for telltale signs of life such as oxygen and water vapor .
" The New Worlds Observer will allow us to look for evidence of oceans and even continents on exoplanets whose stars are close to Earth , " says Webster Cash , the developer of the starshade and an astrophysicist and planetary scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
And then may come some proper planet names .
Exoplanets are presently referred to by their host star plus a letter ( a , b , c… ) depending on how many other planets are present in the system , and the stars themselves are typically just cataloged by the first syllable or two of the constellation that they appear in , with some digits before or after ; hence those R2D2 - like designations .
The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , which officially names heavenly bodies , has resisted naming exoplanets , for now .
" But once we find some really important , Earth - like ones , the IAU will probably be forced to make a naming decision , " Cash says .
And with 50 billion exoplanets–plus waiting for names , who knows ?
Maybe our grandchildren will grow up learning about real planets with names dreamed up by George Lucas .

Introduction
Many JavaScript programmers overlook or do not know of the ability to write object - oriented JavaScript .
Whilst not conventionally an object - oriented language , JavaScript is a prototype - based language , which means that inherited classes are not derived directly from a base class , but rather are created by cloning the base class which serves as a prototype .
This can be used to one 's advantage in implementing encapsulation , inheritance and polymorphism in JavaScript , therefore creating a sense of object - orientation .
Object - oriented JavaScript also has several advantages .
As it is an interpreted language , it means that methods and properties can be added to the class at any time , and do not have to be declared in the class constructor , like other object - oriented languages such as C ++.
As JavaScript supports variable data types , class properties do not have to take a fixed data type ( such as boolean or string ) but rather can be changed at any time .
Furthermore , object - oriented JavaScript is more flexible and efficient than procedural JavaScript , as objects fully support encapsulation and inheritance and polymorphism can be implemented using the prototype property .
Prerequisites
Although this is an introductory article to object - oriented JavaScript , it would be beneficial to have an understanding of object - oriented programming , as this article does not go into this aspect in too much detail .
However , a list of key object - oriented programming terms are listed and defined below for some guidance in this respect .
Key Terms
Several key terms will be used in this article which are summarized below :
Class : Definition of an object including it 's methods and properties .
Encapsulation :
This is where the data passed around inside an instance of an object is kept contained within the instance of that object .
When a new instance of the object is created , a new set of data for that instance is created .
Inheritance :
Where an object becomes a " child " object or subclass of another class , and the " parent " class 's properties and methods are applied to the subclass .
Polymorphism :
Where a subclass of a class can call the same generic inherited function in its own context .
Property : A variable associated with a class .
Method : A function associated with a class .
A Simple Class in JavaScript
Defining a Class
A basic class can be implemented very easily in JavaScript .
All that must be done in order to define a class is for a function to be declared :
< script language= " Javascript " > .. function MyClass ( ) { } .. </ script >
These three lines of code create a new object called MyClass , instances of which can be created with the new operator , such as :
var c = new MyClass ( ) ;
The function MyClass also acts as the class constructor , and when a new instance of that class is called with the new operator , this function is called .
Creating Class Properties
This code so far is just a simple class with only its constructor declared .
To add properties to the class , we use the this operator , followed by the name of the property .
As previously stated , methods and properties can be created anywhere in JavaScript , and not just in the class constructor .
Here is an example of adding properties to MyClass .
.. function MyClass ( ) { this .
MyData = " Some Text " ; this .
MoreData = " Some More Text " ; } ..
These properties can be accessed by :
var c = new MyClass ( ) ; alert ( c. MyData ) ;
This piece of code adds the property MyData and MoreData to the class .
This can be accessed anywhere within the class constructor and the class methods using the this operator , so MyData can be accessed by using this .
MyData .
Also note that unlike some object - oriented languages , class properties are accessed with a .
and not a -> .
This is because JavaScript does not differentiate between pointers and variables .
If the class reference is stored in a variable when created , then the class properties can be accessed by the variable name followed by a .
then the name of the class property , in this example myData , which is accessed with c.MyData .
Creating Class Methods
As said earlier in the article , class methods are created using the prototype property .
When a method is created in a class in JavaScript , the method is added to the class object using the prototype property , as shown in the following piece of code :
.. function MyClass ( ) { } MyClass.prototype.MyFunction = function ( ) { } ..
For clarity , the method here is created by using = function ( ) .
Equally , the method can be created by declaring function MyClass.prototype.MyFunction ( ) .
What this code does is make MyFunction a method of MyClass using the prototype property .
This then gives MyFunction access to any other methods or properties created in MyClass using the this operator .
For example :
.. function MyClass ( ) { this .
MyData = " Some Text " ; } MyClass.prototype.MyFunction = function ( newtext ) { this .
MyData = newtext ; alert ( " New text :
" + this .
MyData ) ; } ..
This piece of code creates the MyClass class , then creates a property called MyData in the class constructor .
A method , called MyFunction is then added to the MyClass object , using the prototype operator , so that it can access the MyClass properties and methods .
In this method , MyData is changed to newtext , which is the only argument of the method .
This new value is then displayed using an alert box .
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a useful part of object - oriented programming that " encapsulates " or contains data in an instance of a class from the data in another instance of the same class .
This is why the this operator is used within a class , so that it retrieves the data for that variable within that instance of the class .
Public , Protected and Private Members
Encapsulation is implemented in JavaScript by separating instance data within a class .
However , there is no varying scale of encapsulation through the public , protected and private operators .
This means that access to data cannot be restricted , as seen in other object - oriented programming languages .
The reason for this is that in JavaScript it is simply not necessary to do so , even for fairly large projects .
As of this , class properties and methods can be accessed from anywhere , either inside the class or outside of it .
Encapsulation in Practice
An example of encapsulation can be shown below :
.. function MyClass ( ) { this .
MyData = " Some Text " ; } MyClass.prototype.MyFunction = function ( newtext ) { this .
MyData = newtext ; alert ( " New text :
" + this .
MyData ) ; } .. var c = new MyClass ( ) ; c.MyFunction ( " Some More Text " ) ; var c2 = new MyClass ( ) ; c2.MyFunction ( " Some Different Text " ) ;
If called , c. MyData would return " Some More Text " and c2 .
MyData would return " Some Different Text " , showing that the data is encapsulated within the class .
Conclusion to Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an important part of object - oriented programming , so that data in different instances of a class are separate from one another ; this is implemented in JavaScript by using the this operator .
However , unlike other object - oriented programming languages , JavaScript does not restrict access to data within an instance of a class .
Inheritance
Inheriting Properties
As said earlier in the article , there is no direct inheritance in JavaScript , as it is a prototype language .
Therefore , for a class to inherit from another class , the prototype operator is used , to clone the parent class constructor , and in doing so , inheriting its methods and properties .
The parent class constructor is also called in the subclass 's constructor , to apply all of its methods and properties to the subclass , as shown in the code below :
.. function Animal ( name ) { this .name = name ; } function Dog( name ) { Animal.call ( this , name ) ; } Dog.prototype = new Animal ( ) ; Dog.prototype.ChangeName( newname ) { this .name = newname ; } ..
In the code example above , two classes are created — a base class called Animal and a subclass called Dog which inherits from Animal .
In the base class constructor , a property called name is created , and set a value passed to it .
When an inherited class is constructed , two lines of code are needed to inherit from the base class , as demonstrated with Dog :
Animal.call ( this , name ) ;
This line of code is called from within the subclass 's constructor .
call ( ) is a JavaScript function which calls a function in the specified context ( the first argument ) .
Arguments needed by the called function are passed also , starting from the second argument of call ( ) , as seen with name .
What this means is that the base class constructor is called from within the subclass constructor , therefore applying the methods and properties created in Animal to the subclass .
The second line of code needed to inherit from a base class is :
Dog.prototype = new Animal ( ) ;
What this line of code does is set the prototype for the inherited class ( which will clone the parent constructor when used ) to be a new instance of the parent class , therefore inheriting any methods or properties in methods in the subclass .
Notice also that once a subclass has inherited from a parent class , any data that needs to be accessed from the parent class can be accessed using the this operator , from within the subclass , as the methods and properties are now part of the subclass object .
Inheriting Methods
Like properties , methods can also be inherited from a parent class in JavaScript , similar to the inheritance of properties , as shown below :
.. function Animal ( name ) { this .name = name ; } Animal.prototype.alertName = function ( ) { alert ( this .name ) ; } function Dog( name ) { Animal.call ( this , name ) ; this .collarText ; } Dog.prototype = new Animal ( ) ; Dog.prototype.setCollarText = function ( text ) { this .collarText = text ; } ..
An inherited method can be called as so :
var d = new Dog( " Fido " ) ; d.alertName ( ) ;
This would call alertName ( ) , which is an inherited method of Animal .
Creating an Instance of an Inherited Class
Classes that inherit from another class can be called in JavaScript as a base class would be called , and methods and properties can be called similarly .
var d = new Dog( " Fido " ) ; alert ( d.name ) ; d.setCollarText ( " FIDO " ) ;
Methods that are inherited in a subclass can also be called similarly with the variable name in place of the this operator :
var d = new Dog( " Fido " ) ; d.alertName ( ) ;
Conclusion to Inheritance
Inheritance is the one of three important concepts of object - oriented programming .
It is implemented in JavaScript using the prototype and call ( ) functions .
Polymorphism
Polymorphism is an extension on the principle of inheritance in object - oriented programming and can also be implemented in JavaScript using the prototype operator .
Polymorphism is where a subclass of a class can call the same generic inherited function in its own context .
For example :
.. function Animal ( name ) { this .name = name ; } Animal.prototype.speak = function ( ) { alert ( this .name + " says : " ) ; } function Dog( name ) { Animal.call ( this , name ) ; } Dog.prototype.speak = function ( ) { Animal.prototype.speak.call ( this ) ; alert ( " woof " ) ; } function Cat( name ) { Animal.call ( this , name ) ; } Cat.prototype.speak = function ( ) { Animal.prototype.speak.call ( this ) ; alert ( " miaow " ) ; } ..
This code means that if an instance of Dog is called and then Dog 's speak ( ) function is called , it will override the parent class 's speak ( ) function .
However , although we want to do something different with each subclass 's version of speak ( ) , we want to call the parent class 's generic speak ( ) function , through Animal.prototype.speak.call( this ) ; , which calls the inherited function in the context of the subclass .
Then after that we do something else with it , which for Dog is alert ( " woof " ) ; and for Cat is alert ( " miaow " ) ;
If called , this would look like :
var d = new Dog( " Fido " ) ; d.speak ( ) ; var c = new Cat( " Lucy " ) ; c.speak ( ) ;
The first two lines would alert " Fido says : " ( the parent class 's speak ( ) function ) followed by " woof " ( Dog 's speak ( ) function ) .
The second two lines would alert " Lucy says : " ( the parent class 's speak ( ) function ) followed by " miaow " ( Cat 's speak ( ) function ) .
Conclusion to Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a very useful part of object - oriented programming , and whilst in this article it is not pursued too deeply , the principles remain constant and can be applied like this in most aspects of polymorphism in JavaScript .
Conclusion
After reading this article you should be able to :
Create classes with methods and properties
Create inherited classes
Create polymorphic functions
This is just an introductory article , but I hope you can use these learned skills for more complicated object - oriented structures .

Advertisement Swarms of robots could one day be exploring space or doing dangerous jobs on Earth , say researchers .
Promising prototypes of co-operating robots were on show at the Artificial Life XI conference this week .
Advances in technology mean it is now possible to create self - assembling robot chains as well as tiny robots for as little as £ 24 .
Roboticists say the swarms of robots could prove more adaptable and smarter than individual , self - contained ones .
Crowd control " For a long time in robotics there was this focus on a ' smart machine ' , an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping , " said Dr Seth Bullock , the University of Southampton researcher chairing the Alife XI conference .
" But that 's extremely challenging ; it 's going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves . "
To that end , a group of undergraduate students at the University of Southampton has developed a swarm of identical , matchbox - sized robots , each of which costs just £ 24 to produce .
Swarm robots could one day explore other planets Demonstrated at the conference the prototypes showed how swarm robots can independently divide up tasks , with no central program controlling them .
They skitter around , communicating as they encounter each other via the same kind of infrared technology used in mobile phones .
Red and green lights on the robot were used to show which task they had chosen .
After a short while , the group autonomously divided itself - 80 % red and 20 % green .
The swarm can cope with disruption too .
If a handful of the " green " robots are removed from the arena , the remainder will redistribute themselves again into the 80/20 split .
Scientists say this flexibility gives swarm robotics an edge over traditional approaches for far - flung missions .
" You might have some complex robot that is sent to Mars , has a technical problem , and then the mission is basically over , " said Klaus - Peter Zauner , the leader of the Southampton swarm robot project .
" With swarm robots , even if a percentage of them fails , they 'll still be able to achieve their goal . "
Chain gang
Another swarm robot project on display at Alife XI was Sbot , part of a European - funded collaboration between the Free University of Brussels and the Institute for Cognitive Science and Technology ( ISTC ) in Rome .
The Sbot robots are equipped with powerful grippers , and as they encounter each other , independently decide who will grip whom .
The team has linked up chains of as many as 20 of the robots in a demonstration of self - organising co-operation .
The robots can also cope with events their designers never predicted .
" If you design software with typical engineering tools like ' if this and that then do this ' , it 's like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible moves you 'll never get there , " says Elio Tuci , an ISTC researcher involved in the project .
Instead , the Sbots have been equipped with software that learns and adapts as it encounters different situations .
Planetary exploration and assembly of satellites and space stations are two favoured applications for swarm robots , but they could also be of great use on Earth .
Swarms of tiny robots like the Southampton prototypes could be deployed in a collapsed building , for instance , dividing their tasks among looking for survivors and checking for further dangers such as gas leaks .
Josh Bongard of the University of Vermont wants to use the swarm ideas with bigger robots for bigger tasks .
" One application we 're looking at in the US is renewable energy technologies , " said Dr Bongard .
" We 're going to have to start building solar farms , wave farms , wind farms , all on a scale we 're not used to hundreds of square kilometers , far from population centres , " he said .
" Swarms could be ideal for that . "

What are these ?
I used to be a fruit picker .
Wearing braids and denim overalls , I passed balmy summer grade school breaks in Grandma 's street - side Royal Oak yard , harvesting heaps of ripe magenta raspberries , and boiling them down with sugar to make lickety - rich preserves .
In recent decades , however , I have n't been such a busy worker bee .
I did cultivate a spiky fountain of chives in my shady back yard , but sadly , after a season or so , my prolific crop was lost to flooding or neglect – not sure which came first .
For years afterward , thoughts of raising edibles lay buried in my mind ; at least until my recent talk with Mike Score , an agricultural innovation counselor at the Michigan State University ( MSU ) Product Center .
Score points out a general lack of awareness of ground - level economic development potential .
" It would be to Michigan 's advantage to take a closer look at agriculture as a sector in our economy , because in general , we take it for granted and we really do n't understand it as well as we should , given its size . "
Michigan 's agri -food industry , which includes agriculture , leather , floriculture , ornamentals , turf grass , and bio-energy industries , generates $ 60.1 billion in economic output and a little more than one million jobs , – about 24 % of the state 's employment – likely second in size only to the automotive industry , according to a 2006 Michigan State University study " The Economic Impact and Potential of Michigan 's Agri-Food System . "
With much fanfare , in 2005 the state launched the $ 1 billion 21st Century Jobs Fund to foster economic development by growing technologies in life science , alternative energy , advanced automotive technologies , and homeland security .
Sexy business sectors , no doubt .
But where 's the respect for an industry that literally affects the lives of everyone in Michigan ?
Mike Hamm , C.S. Mott professor of sustainable agriculture at MSU , says the field " can be a tool to help us solve public health issues …
It 's a way to protect our landscape for generations as they get older so that we do n't lose our farmland and become dependent on more and more distant sources for food at a time when global population is increasing and water stresses are becoming more severe around the world …
Historically , in the last 25 years or so we 've not really considered local agriculture as a viable strategy for economic development ... "
Where is it from ?
Indeed , it comes down to digging up our food 's roots .
Just 1 % of Michigan - grown food is sold locally , direct to consumers , says Score , who learned from a major food distribution executive that transportation makes up half of food costs .
For instance , Michigan is the third largest producer of apples in the nation , according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture .
But this sure is n't evident in area Costco stores , where you seldom find our state 's rosy Galas or Empires .
Their pallets brim with the bounty of Washington 's orchards , fresh from two thousand miles away .
And even apples can be a hard sell .
Hamm , who helps to develop community - based food systems , has observed a " public health gap " , where the average U.S. resident 's diet is deficient : we consume half the daily required fruits and vegetables , one - third of necessary dairy products , and we worship white bread .
Ubiquitous fast food and packaged snacks galore are not just to blame ; many lack the resources and access to obtain healthy fresh foods .
In a study to be released later this year , Hamm found that if the state 's public health gap could be bridged through consumption of more locally produced fresh food , an estimated 37,000 more farmland acres could go into production , putting $ 200 million more in the pockets of farmers and creating about 1,800 off - farm jobs .
A family can live off a good 20 - acre farm , so additional farm jobs could be in the three - to - four digit range .
Farming a fair share
The Ann Arbor - based Fair Food Foundation , whose slogan is " Grow the Good " , is concentrating on closing this gap by aiming to work with historically excluded urban communities to design food systems that provide healthy , fresh and sustainably - grown food ..
President and CEO Oran Hesterman says it 's the only foundation in the country , possibly even in the world , with a focus on an equitable and sustainable local food system .
A May 2007 Ann Arbor Business Review story put the foundation 's expected annual grants in the $ 12 to $ 20 million range .
Hesterman will not confirm specific numbers at this point , but does anticipate a " significant " program .
It commenced operations earlier this year , and personnel are preparing strategies and guidelines for reviewing grant applications this fall , he says .
" What I 'm especially interested in is … how we might be able to position both jobs and ownership opportunities in food production , processing , distribution , preparation , and retailing that can attract , especially , young entrepreneurs in the southeast Michigan area , " says Hesterman .
" We 're in an area that 's got really good natural conditions for farming and growing food .
We 've got good water , which is certainly not the case everywhere .
We 've got access to very vibrant markets and large population centers . …
I do n't think it 's unreasonable that at some point in time we'd have 20 % of our food system more localized than it is right now .
I do n’t think that 's out of bounds and we have the productive capacity to do it , for sure . "
The MSU Product Center also works to grow new and existing food , agricultural , and natural resources - based businesses by helping entrepreneurs to write business plans , create financial models , and identify customers .
Score has worked with 180 clients over the last three years , 40 of whom have implemented a variety of business plans , including : a purveyor of clean green soy - based fertilizer in Manchester ; horticultural products on the Goetz Farm in Monroe County ; a sheep cheese maker in Chelsea ; and Mercury Coffee Bar in Detroit .
And the shortest route to going local is right out the front or back door – urban and community gardening , which has spread its roots in Ann Arbor and Detroit .
Score sees a trend of consumers eating from home – literally .
And burning what they eat .
" It 's not hard labor , like breaking rocks at the state prison .
It 's pleasant aerobic exercise that gives you short - term gratification . …
I think urban gardening will become a significant source of produce in southeast Michigan . "
He believes that Ashley Atkinson , co-chair of the Detroit Agriculture Network , whose work was recently featured in O , The Oprah Magazine , runs one of the best urban gardening programs in the U.S. .
This ground - up focus addresses our most elementary regional development issues .
" When you look at nutrition and access to food , you 're looking at job creation and nutrition , which affects school performance , which affects life opportunities , " says Score , who notes that the inputs for food production are relatively simple and inexpensive .
" Young children can grow tomatoes and sell them at the roadside and learn how to start a small business . …
There 's a high demand from restaurants and grocery stores and institutional food buyers for high quality local food .
Food system economic development can be exciting for the full spectrum of Michigan residents . "
So , we can all buy what 's in store .
I even have a plot to produce in the yard again .
The tomato , basil , and , yes , chives , seeds are ready , and my pots are back in the sun .

OCZ Neural Impulse Actuator ( nia ) - The Log
Introduction
| Source : OCZ Price : £ 90.85 Author : James Napier
Introduction
Two months have passed since Overclock3D brought you news that OCZ 's greatly anticipated Neural Impulse Actuator ( nia ) was Two months have passed since Overclock3D brought you news that OCZ 's greatly anticipated Neural Impulse Actuator ( nia ) was ready for shipping .
Our forums along , with many others , became rife with excitement at the prospect of this groundbreaking device actually being available for purchase from retailers .
Did we speak too soon ?
Well yes , maybe , but as the saying goes , " a watched kettle never boils " and with so many people putting pressure on OCZ to deliver , the inevitable happened , and the release date slipped back ... and back ... and back .
However , just when members of our forum seemed to be giving up hope and comparing the nia to OCZ 's Cryo - Z cooler * cough cough* , OCZ have pulled a rabbit out of their hat and caught us totally off guard with an early morning delivery from DHL .
Yes , that 's right .... the nia is here at last !
For those of us who have absolutely no idea what the nia is , or why we 're jumping around like school kids at the beginning of the summer holidays , the nia is most probably the most advanced device to make its way onto retailers ' shelves in a LONG time .
Capable of reading neuronal discharges in the brain , muscular signals and retinal movements , OCZ have marketed the device at gamers , claiming that the device can be used as a kind of brain - powered - joystick to compliment , and possibly even replace , the traditional keyboard or mouse during gaming .
Not only this , but by cutting out a large portion of the time that the body would usually take to relay information from the eye down through the body to our hands and fingers , the nia is also reported to reduce reaction times by anything up to 60 % .
The nia is also extremely unique in that , unlike most products reviewed on Overclock3D , it can't simply be picked up , tested and put down again .
Our previous news post probably explains it best : " While the nia is clearly a breakthrough in technology , it 's certainly not going to make anybody a professional gamer over night .
In much the same way as it takes several years to learn how to touch - type without looking at the keyboard , the nia will similarly require significant ' brain training ' before a user can competently navigate around a map in a game " .
Not only this , but while most products are pretty consistent between each user , the nia can almost be compared to voice recognition software in that its success varies between users .

Not only this , but while most products are pretty consistent between each user , the nia can almost be compared to voice recognition software in that its success varies between users .
So how exactly do you review a device that takes months to learn and produces varied results depending on the user ?
Well , the only way that we could think of was to get as many of the OC3D review team down to HQ nice and early on Saturday morning and hand the unit around .
At the end of the day we'd each write a short report on what we thought , and then pass the unit on to the most active FPS gamer for a full month of testing with weekly updates .
So without further ado ... let 's get down to business ...

Spreadsheets seem like they are adequate tools for serious analysis .
And unfortunately , people are graduating from stats and OR programs without mastering any of the other alternatives .
But brother , I stand before you today to tell you that spreadsheets are the devil .
When you face a modeling problem , spreadsheets tempt you with the seemingly easy way out .
It all starts with how easy it is to import data .
Excel ’s import wizard is fast and pretty smart about automatically assigning column types .
Meanwhile , your hapless colleagues are going to spend a day reading manuals just to load in that same tab - delimited text file .
Now that you ’ve got the raw inputs loaded , you figure that within a few days you ’ll be done building your trendlines and you ’ll kill time choosing fonts for your pie charts .
But what happens — invariably — is that you think you are done and then you look at your number on your final worksheet and realize it ca n’t be right .
You must now find the error in any of the possibly hundreds of tiny formulas all chained together .
Welcome to cell HE11 .
Meanwhile , while you ’ve got numbers that are laughably wrong , your SAS friend after a few days at least has his PROC REPORT output to show the boss , even if he did have to print it on the basement mainframe dot-matrix printer .
So , despite all that , sometimes , I find that I just have to use a spreadsheet .
In that circumstance , I try to follow a set of rules .
Any time I deviate from these rules , I always get burned .
Put at the top of each sheet a few paragraphs that describe the model .
Ideally , this text should be so clear and specific that I can rebuild the spreadsheet just based on this information .
( This also helps make sure that you implemented the logic correctly . )
Indicate what are the cells that the user should play with , and what cells should not be tweaked .
Point out where the final answer pops out .
Establish a color scheme to distinguish between input data and formulas .
Emulate the IRS 1040 , where there is a column of text and just a few columns of numbers , and each row is as simple as possible .
There ’s a main column that gets summed at the bottom , and a secondary column where complex totals are broke down further .
Decompose those formulas and do n’t store literal data inside of formulas !
For example , in a mortgage calculator , break out the interest rate , the mortgage size , and the number of years in the mortgage into separate cells , and then show the result in another cell :
Do n’t be tempted to cram all those numbers inside a single cell like this :
Sure , you save a few rows and it compresses the size of your sheet , but in the end , you make your sheet much less flexible , and it will be more difficult to separate data - entry errors from formula errors .
Finally ,
Put everything in top - to - bottom order in each sheet and have a single flow .
Do n’t have lots of parallel panels side - by - side .
It becomes too confusing .
I am certain that there are even more rules that are better than these .
Enlighten me .
My colleague Felicity Barringer , who covers the environment for our National desk , has been tracking developments related to the White House fight with some Environmental Protection Agency officials over the need to restrict carbon dioxide .
You may recall her story last month about how the White House refused to open an e-mail carrying the E.P.A. “ finding ” supporting CO2 restrictions .
She sends this new dispatch :
More details are emerging about the maneuvers that blocked the Environmental Protection Agency ’s finding that greenhouse gases were a threat to public health and welfare and should be regulated .
White House officials initially blessed the agency ’s efforts to create a basis for restricting emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas produced by human activities , but reversed course after passage of an energy bill last December , a former agency official has told a Congressional committee .
He said the White House was won over by the argument , pushed by oil companies and others , that such regulation should not be part of the Bush legacy ,
The official , Jason K. Burnett , once a Bush appointee and now an Obama supporter , told the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming that the argument for putting off any carbon dioxide limits was made by “ individuals working for particular oil companies , Exxon Mobil , ” as well as oil industry trade associations .
He also told the committee that the electric power industry , particularly the Edison Electric Institute , “ thought their members would be better served by getting out in front and actively engaging ” regulators trying to shape future controls , “ rather than trying to fight what they judge to be inevitable . ”
A transcript of his statement will be made public by the committee Friday morning .
A copy was seen by The New York Times Thursday night .
In much of it , Mr. Burnett elaborated on information that has already been made public .
The E.P.A. ’s effort to create a framework for regulating greenhouse gases was begun in response to a Supreme Court decision in the spring of 2007 .
That decision required the agency either to regulate the pollutants or explain why it was not doing so .
The White House ’s wishes , Mr. Burnett said , were conveyed to Stephen Johnson , the E.P.A. administrator , by Joel Kaplan , the deputy chief of staff .
In mid-November , Mr. Kaplan gave a go - ahead for the E.P.A. to proceed with its plan to propose that greenhouse gases could and should be regulated ; on Dec. 5 , after the regulatory document doing that had been sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review , he told Mr. Johnson to retract it .
According to Mr. Burnett , Mr. Johnson refused .
The O.M.B. subsequently refused to open the e-mail to which the document was attached .

What is a DDoS attack ?
A Distributed Denial of Service attack is when someone attempts to bombard a target server with so many external communication requests that it floods the system and overloads it to such an extent that it can no longer function .
This means that any content that is hosted on the website is unavailable for the duration of the attack .
Put simply , it can be likened to everyone trying to withdraw their funds from a bank all at once .
There are simply not enough resources to accommodate all the people at one time , because the expected usage is that not everyone will show up at once ; and when they do , the system cannot cope .

Footage of French President Nicolas Sarkozy expressing irritation at a TV technician ahead of an interview has become an instant internet success .
The video shows the employee clipping a microphone to Mr Sarkozy 's tie , and not responding to a presidential " hello " .
" It 's a question of manners , " Mr Sarkozy is heard muttering .
" When you 're invited , you 're entitled to have people say ' hello ' to you " .
The video , posted on the Dailymotion website , has drawn about 500,000 hits .
It was recorded on Monday , as Mr Sarkozy was waiting to be interviewed on France 3 television and released to left - wing news blog , Rue89 .
Inquiry
Mr Sarkozy is seen winking while complaining about the manners of the technician who appears not to have returned his greeting .
At the end of the brief outburst , he appears to suggest the employee should not be working for state TV .
Asked about the video , a spokesman for the presidency declined to comment .
FR3 has condemned the " pirating " of the off - air footage and launched an inquiry .
Mr Sarkozy has been caught several times in off - the - record videos posted on the web .
One of them showed him at a farm show in February , swearing at a member of the public who refused to shake his hand .
JULY 8 -- Lured by $ 1 beer and the prospect of ' hot chicks ' and ' hardcore fights , ' thousands of Arkansans were duped last month into appearing as extras in comedian Sacha Baron Cohen 's latest staged mayhem .
Cohen and his confederates organized cage fighting programs on consecutive days in Texarkana and Fort Smith .
Both cards ended with two male grapplers ( one was identified as ' Straight Dave ' and wore camouflage ) tearing each other 's clothes off and , while in underwear , kissing down their opponent 's chest .
This man -on - man action triggered Fort Smith fans to throw chairs and beer at the ring , according to one cop present at the city 's Convention Center .
[ Click here and here to read bulletin board messages posted in early - June by miffed mixed martial arts fans who attended one of Cohen 's Arkansas productions . ]
Cohen is currently filming a follow - up , of sorts , to his smash 2006 film featuring Borat , his fictional Kazakh journalist .
The new film stars another of Cohen 's creations , Bruno , a gay Austrian journalist who favors mesh t- shirts and interviews subjects about fashion and entertainment .
The June 5 Texarkana promotion was adverstised as ' Red , White , and Blood . '
The June 6 matches in Fort Smith were dubbed ' Blue Collar Brawlin ' ' as seen in this poster .
Ads on Craigslist -- like this one -- noted that attendees had to be over 21 and suggested that fans arrive early ' for $ 1 BEERS !'
Cohen & Co. underwrote the cost of beer , which usually sells for $ 4 at the Fort Smith facility .
' Blue Collar Brawlin ' ' drew about 1500 fans , who were greeted by signs stating that the event was being filmed .

Home Partial vectorisation of Haskell programs Partial vectorisation of Haskell programs .
Manuel M. T. Chakravarty , Roman Leshchinskiy , Simon Peyton Jones , and Gabriele Keller , Proc ACM Workshop on Declarative Aspects of Multicore Programming , San Francisco , Jan 2008 .
Vectorisation for functional programs , also called the flattening transformation , relies on drastically reordering computations and restructuring the representation of data types .
As a result , it only applies to the purely functional core of a fully - fledged functional language , such as Haskell or ML .
A concrete implementation needs to apply vectorisation selectively and integrate vectorised with unvectorised code .
This is challenging , as vectorisation alters the data representation , which must be suitably converted between vectorised and unvectorised code .
In this paper , we present an approach to partial vectorisation that selectively vectorises sub-expressions and data types , and also , enables linking vectorised with unvectorised modules .
The idea is fairly simple , and utilizes conversion between vectorized and unvectorized representations of the datatypes .
A formal translation scheme is provided .
Data Parallel Haskell papers are here .
But , like the T - Rex , they seem intent on doing as much damage as they can until then .
Some technologies are like a Tyrannosaurus running down the highway ( without the awesome ) .
They made sense once and now they 're hideously out of place , carried only by momentum as they stumble toward their inevitable date with the sixteen - wheeler of Progress .
6 Phone Books
An incredible 615 million phone books were printed last year , most of which were used to replace missing legs on sofas or were ripped apart in Youtube videos .

About another million tons of these useless blocks will be shipped out to households and offices next year , where an increasing number will make a U Turn at the front porch and head to the landfill without ever being opened .
William Rathke , an anthropologist who studies garbage , says you can " dig a trench through a landfill and you will see layers of phone books like geographical strata or layers of cake . "
Rathke , who despite digging through trash for a living has his Ph.D. from Harvard , claims phone books account for about 10 - 30 % of the trash at your local dump .
In an era when you can fit many gigabytes onto a device small enough to be swallowed by a cat and even your local bait shop has a website , phone companies still want us to find phone numbers the same way we did 100 years ago : by dragging out a bulky , ten - pound list printed on dead trees .

Why are they still around ?
Since you 've probably never opened one , you may not realize that phone books are chock full of so many ads that they generated $ 13.9 billion last year .
That sort of makes sense when you realize these ads are being force fed to every single household in America , like giant bricks of spam just appearing on your porch once a year .
The only difference is you can click out of a pop up ad .
Phone books weigh 10 lbs and have to be disposed of in special ways , to avoid becoming even more than 30 % of your local landfill .
Yes , it would appear that Satan works in advertising , and he 's damn good at what he does .

But even though it reaches twice as many homes as the Super Bowl , does it get past the doorstep of those homes anymore ?
Are there really $ 13.9 billion worth of people using them ?
Well yes , if you believe the phone companies , and the people they 've paid to conduct surveys .
And in an industry with no sales figures ( because nobody asked for the damn things in the first place ) how else are you going to track who actually uses them ?
Well there is one way .
You could go hunting around in landfills to see if the phone books were thrown away all at once right when everyone got them , creating entire layers of phone book in the earth .
You know , like a cake ?
But who 's bat shit crazy enough to do something like that ?

An Appetite For Science
For Food Network host Alton Brown , science plays more than a cameo role
Alton Brown readily admits that he was an undistinguished science student .
“ I took physics , chemistry , and biology in college , and they were all boring beyond words , ” he says .
“ None of it mattered .
None of it applied .
It was taught mostly by people who wanted to get tenure and write grants .
It was only when I decided that the answer to most of my problems was science that I became interested . ”

WITH GAS Brown has fun with chemistry , incorporating science and food preparation on his show “ Good Eats . ”
Irony : it ’s what ’s for dinner .
His quest for answers to kitchen - related questions led Brown to create one of the best cooking with science shows on television .
“ Good Eats ” educates viewers about the science of food and cooking using historical references , pop culture , costumes , and props .
The science enhances the step - by - step cooking tutorial , yet the information is still highly relevant to the home chef .
For example , episodes titled “ Churn Baby Churn ” and “ I Pie ” explain , respectively , how sugar crystallization affects the texture of ice cream and what happens to a pie crust in the oven as it bakes .
These are the sort of processes that chemists and materials scientists address everyday .
The show also features experts such as Shirley O. Corriher , food scientist and author of “ CookWise : The Hows and Whys of Successful Cooking ” ( William Morrow , 1997 ) , and Deborah Duchon , a nutritional anthropologist .
In addition , fictional experts make appearances , such as “ W , ” a kitchen equipment specialist whose resemblance to James Bond ’s “ Q ” is no coincidence .
If the components that comprise a “ Good Eats ” episode are the spokes on a wheel , then Brown is the creative hub .
His presentation style , a combination of Julia Child , British comedy troupe Monty Python , and Mr. Wizard , has earned him a dedicated following among viewers of all ages , male and female .
Although he relies on analogies and metaphors to explain concepts , he does n’t condescend to his audience .
His talent for invention assures viewers that they do n’t need expensive single - purpose appliances , which he calls “ uni-taskers . ”
As demonstrated in the episode “ Good Milk Gone Bad , ” one does n’t need an expensive yogurt maker if a couple of containers and a heating pad are available at home .
Yogurt contains beneficial bacteria , such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus , that love lactose , the sugar found in milk .
Adding a starter culture of plain , store - bought yogurt to milk at 110 °F , Brown shows that the bacteria will convert the lactose into lactic acid .
The heating pad helps to maintain a steady temperature to allow the bacteria to incubate .
If the temperature of the milk is too low , the bacteria wo n’t grow to make yogurt .
If the temperature is too high , the bacteria will die .
Brown honed his cooking talent early , learning from his mother and his grandmother ( both of whom have appeared on “ Good Eats ” ) .
He later parlayed his talent as a way to get dates in college .
After graduating from the University of Georgia with a degree in theater , Brown worked as a cinematographer and video director for about a decade .
He spent his time between shoots watching cooking shows and concluded they were “ dull and uninformative . ”
Tired of hearing him complain , Brown 's wife , DeAnna , suggested that he do something about it .
They moved to Vermont so Brown could attend the New England Culinary Institute ( NECI ) , in Montpelier , where he graduated in 1997 .
Equipped with both the technical and culinary know - how , Brown wrote two scripts : “ Steak Your Claim ” and “ This Spud ’s For You . ”
The series was picked up by Food Network in 1999 .
The catalog of his accomplishments is fairly extensive ; most notably , Brown was named 2004 Cooking Teacher of the Year by Bon Appétit magazine and won a 2006 Peabody Award .
He ’s also the author of three books : “ I ’m Just Here for the Food , ” which won a James Beard Award in 2003 ; “ I ’m Just Here for More Food ” ; and “ Alton Brown ’s Gear for Your Kitchen , ” in which he pays tribute to his love of gadgets .
Brown has a sincere , enthusiastic appreciation for knowledge .
He says that learning the science behind cooking made him a better cook and “ a smarter person . ”
The science he learned at NECI was cursory .
He frustrated most of his instructors because he continually asked why specific processes had the effects they did .
A lot of times , he says , his instructors did n’t have the answers because they did n’t view them as relevant to the mission of becoming a cook .
In his search for answers , Brown says he read a lot of science journals and needed a dictionary just to understand what he was reading .
Some journals he would simply give up on because he did n’t have the math background to understand them .
“ It ’s certainly tough when you suddenly want to make science a very big part of your world late in life , ” he says .
“ I did n’t have a brilliant teacher to turn to or a really great academic library .
I had to chisel the information out of public libraries . ”
Brown considers cooking the ultimate applied science because everything relates to chemistry , biology , or physics .
“ Cooking is a switchboard to everything .
There is nothing about human existence that does n’t tap into food or that does n’t pass through food .
I ’ve gone into biology classes where we dissected a chicken instead of a fetal pig .
Why ?
Because you ’ll see it again .
Knowing how to cut up a chicken actually matters .
When will you see a fetal pig again ? ”
He ’s confident he could teach a high school or college science course with nothing but a kitchen .
For labs he could demonstrate how heat denatures protein by cooking an egg , how yeast cells execute gas - liberating reactions by baking a loaf of bread , or how fermentation occurs by making pickles .
As a bonus , the class would get to eat the experiments , enabling observation of cause and effect .
Asked to name a few of his science heroes , Brown mentions Albert Einstein , Carl Sagan ( “ The first science teacher I latched onto from TV land ” ) , and agricultural chemist George Washington Carver ( “ The kind of scientist that had n’t existed before his time ” ) ( C&EN , Feb. 14 , 2005 , page 57 ) .
Other influences , aside from Child and Monty Python , include science historian and essayist James Burke , best known for his documentary series “ Connections , ” which provided plenty of guidance to Brown during the days he was formulating “ Good Eats . ”
But “ if there ’s one person I owe it all to , it would be Harold McGee , ” he says .
“ By and large he was the first guy who took food seriously .
The one book that changed my life was the first edition of ‘ On Food and Cooking . ’
When I was at NECI asking these burning questions , my wife gave me a copy for my birthday and it was like the floodgates opening .
It was the one place where I could find an answer that I could understand .
You will never see any of my books on the ‘ Good Eats ’ set but there is always a copy of McGee ’s book . ”
A turning point in Brown ’s life was the several months he spent in Tuscany , Italy , performing summer stock theater .
At a restaurant in Cortona , the only menu item was pizza , and the kind of pizza depended on what the owner felt like making that day .
Yet it was a pizza unlike anything Brown had ever seen before , and he had a revelation .
“ It was the cultural significance of food , ” he recalls .
“ Its real power is connecting people to people .
I was 21 , watching a household with four generations living under one roof , and the way food was prepared tied it all together .
Food has a valuable place in culture and the importance that people put on even the simplest things .
If you want a cup of coffee in Paris , you ca n’t get it to go .
You sit at a café and have a cup of coffee .
Most Italians would starve to death in America because nothing would be worth buying . ”
He continues : “ We get so caught up in our food culture , especially in places like New York , when really , in the end , it ’s about hospitality , people sitting down and breaking bread together .
I believe in God so I temper everything through that lens .
The words ‘ communion ’ and ‘ communicate ’ come from the same root , so there ’s something deeply spiritual and naturally significant about it . ”
The importance of culture and socializing in experiencing food makes Brown wonder about molecular gastronomy , a trend that ’s generally defined as the application of scientific techniques and tools to cooking .
For example , chef Wylie Dufresne makes pasta noodles entirely out of shrimp meat , using the enzyme transglutaminase .
The enzyme “ glues ” pieces of meat or fish together to be shaped and cooked according to the chef ’s purpose .
Interestingly , some of the best - known chefs who use these techniques , such as Ferran Adrià and Heston Blumenthal , do n’t like the term and have distanced themselves from it ( C&EN , July 7 , page 26 ) .
Brown says one problem with molecular gastronomy is it moves diners away from what is on their plate and , in some cases , is used as a replacement for food .
“ If you ’re a good chef and you want to stretch yourself to find new and interesting things to do , it can have great results , ” he says .
“ However , it can get a little freaky sometimes .
The food is inedible because it ’s not food — it ’s a chemistry exam . ”
As inventive as molecular gastronomy can be , Brown says it does n’t offer him anything he actually craves : “ I do n’t have sodium alginate at home and I can’t remember the last time I reached for agar , but oddly enough I have xanthan gum because I use it for certain things .
Most of the chefs I know who are really good just do n’t care .
Yet it ’s an important movement that needs to happen because it says that we ’re still seeking . ”
He believes that the interest in molecular gastronomy detracts from a larger issue that ought to be addressed and one that he cares greatly about : the exposed weaknesses in our nation ’s food safety net .
“ One of the places where America has really damaged itself is food , ” he says .
“ When you look at the map of the Escherichia coli spinach outbreak [ in September 2006 ] , every one of those affected states can grow commercial spinach .
What business did California have feeding all those states spinach ?
If you ca n’t cook chili for yourself , you deserve cans that explode on your shelf . ”
Brown does n’t believe that food should be globalized .
“ You ca n’t have food systems on a global scale that do n’t break down .
[ The U.S. Department of Agriculture ] was established as a support organization for the agriculture industry — it ’s not a police force .
There is no way to keep a global food system safe .
It ca n’t be done and it should n’t be done .
It ’s bad for economies , bad for the planet , and bad for humans , ” he says .
He is a big fan of farmers ’ markets and having access to locally grown , seasonal foods .
As recently as two years ago , no farmers ’ markets existed in Brown ’s community in the Atlanta suburbs .
Now , 500 consumers come through because they ’re connecting fresh food with local farms , and buying food locally empowers them to ask questions about the food that is sold .
Brown says that of the many teachers he meets , science teachers are the most passionate about their subject .
“ I think most of the science teachers in this country are held back by the systems in which they work , ” he says .
“ The most powerful force in any education is curiosity .
You can teach chemistry without ever showing anybody a formula at first .
Get students curious until there ’s an interest , a need for the formula , and then give them the formula .
Once you start acquiring knowledge , it becomes associative .
The connections that were n’t there before start to happen . ”
“ Good Eats ” episodes are also distributed through Cable in the Classroom , an educational outreach effort to schools nationwide .
Students learn how science applies to cooking and hands - on activities connect the show ’s content to science , nutrition , health , and other subjects .
Brown is invited to speak to a lot of science and medical organizations , such as the Institute of Food Technologists , where he was the keynote speaker in 2006 .
“ My dream speaking gig is where I ’m the dumbest guy in the room , ” he says .
“ I do a lot of these because I ’m not scared of the language , and I really research my audience .
A few years ago , I gave a lecture at Los Alamos National Laboratory because they wanted to learn how to communicate better .
I gave a lecture to 250 Ph.D.s .
I was the dumbest guy in the room and we had a great time . ”
Brown believes that scientists do n’t communicate as well as they could because they fixate on one little corner of the big picture .
“ They get way too caught up in facts , ” he says .
“ When I ’m teaching a science point and a fact does n’t work for me , I get rid of it .
I ’m talking about concepts and gross understandings , and then people can sort things out from there .
Scientists get caught up way too often in delineations and definitions and what the spectrograph showed . ”
Aside from branching out to speak to various scientific communities , Brown ’s also been hired by industry as a consultant .
His first foray was with General Electric , which asked him to teach their engineers how food cooks because GE thought it would help workers build better appliances .
“ The industry guys began to realize that if they did understand what goes on inside a cookie when it bakes , maybe it would make a difference in how appliances are designed , ” he says .
Brown ’s advice contributed to GE ’s line of Trivection ovens that combine thermal , convection , and microwave energies to cook food faster .
He also appears in short videos on the GE appliance website ( www.geappliances.com).
In January , Food Network announced a three - year deal with Brown .
He ’ll be back for more episodes of “ Good Eats , ” “ Iron Chef , ” and the latest installment of his popular “ Feasting on Asphalt ” series called “ Feasting on Waves . ”
Even though he ’s nearing the 200th episode of “ Good Eats , ” Brown ’s not ready to stop .
The subject has n’t dried up , he says , because “ good teachers repeat themselves often in new ways . ”
Although he is modest about assessing his place in the world , Brown concedes that he has the credibility and visibility to devote more attention to serious food - related topics .
The choice , he says , is either to cash in or try to be responsible for the credibility the audience has given him .
When “ Good Eats ” first started , he and his wife , who is also his business partner , set up a simple decision tree through which they evaluate new ideas .
If the answer at any point is “ no , ” the idea is rejected , regardless of the money involved or how it may benefit his career .
“ In the end we have — I think more than anyone else on television — amassed a credibility that we would never betray , ” he says .
“ That ’s more valuable than anything else . ”
That ’s not to say that Brown does n’t have other projects in the works .
He ’s planning a feature - length documentary about people ’s relationship with the ocean , he ’s getting involved with the Monterey Bay Aquarium , in California , and he has just signed a deal to work with the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute to provide advice on purchasing seafood and cooking ideas .
An avid scuba diver , Brown says he ’s still looking for a way to put his childhood obsession with Jacques Cousteau together with food .
For all the contributions Brown has made to communicating science and cooking , he insists that he does not have a great scientific mind .
“ I tell stories and science is a tool that I use to tell stories , ” he says .
“ I ’m not a chef and I ’m not a scientist .
I ’m a storyteller who makes 30 - minute movies about food . ”
Wall Street shut down for the long July 4 weekend pondering a puzzler .
It emerged yesterday that Verisign CEO Bill Roper had suddenly quit the firm to be replaced by the firm 's founder and chairman , Jim Bidzos .
Roper took the helm at Verisign only last year .
The firm said in its statement to investors and the media that he had actually vacated the top job on June 30 .
The timing of the announcement raised eyebrows , and Wall Street sent Verisign shares down 1.3 per cent on the news .
No reason was given for Roper 's exit .
It seems all the more strange as his tenure saw the firm 's stock rise more than 45 per cent .
He was appointed in May last year after 12 - year CEO Stratton Sclavos quit equally suddenly and mysteriously .
In a canned quotation concentrating on business facts rather than the personal praise corporations usually lavish on departing executives , Bidzos said : " Over the last year , Bill Roper led the development and implementation of the company ’s strategy to focus the company on its core businesses .
" He 's also improved the company ’s capital structure with the repurchase of more than 28 per cent of the shares outstanding .
We appreciate Bill 's contributions in implementing this divestiture strategy , which the board and the company are fully committed to continuing . "
In a conference call , Bidzos would only say that Verisign had reached a " natural tipping point " in its ongoing reorganisation and that had prompted Roper 's resignation . ®

67 .
The priest must sprinkle the blood of the peace offerings .
7:14

Do n't eat fat or blood -- these are for God .
( And he does n't like to share ! )
7:18 - 27
69 .
God gives instructions for " wave offerings " and " heave offerings . "
He says these offerings are to be made perpetually " by a statute for ever . "
Have you made your heave offering today ?
7:30 - 36
70 .
Moses does it all for God .
First he kills an animal ; wipes the blood on Aaron 's ears , thumbs , and big toes .
Then he sprinkles blood round about and waves the guts before the Lord .
Finally he burns the whole mess for " a sweet savour before the Lord . "
8:14-32
71 . More killing , sprinkling of blood , waiving animal parts , and burning carcasses " before the Lord . "

10:6-9
74 . God 's treatment for leprosy :
Get two birds .
Kill one .
Dip the live bird in the blood of the dead one .
Sprinkle the blood on the leper seven times , and then let the blood - soaked bird fly off .
Next find a lamb and kill it .
Wipe some of its blood on the patient 's right ear , thumb , and big toe .
Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some of the oil on his right ear , thumb and big toe .
Repeat .
Finally kill a couple doves and offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering .
14:2-32
75 .
God explains the use of scapegoats .
It goes like this :
Get two goats .
Kill one .
Wipe , smear , and sprinkle the blood around seven times .
Then take the other goat , give it the sins of all the people , and send it off into the wilderness .
16:6-28
76 .
If you upset God , he 'll cause the land to vomit you out .

20:27
87 . A priest 's daughter who " plays the whore " is to be burned to death .
21:9
88 . God gives us more instructions on killing and burning animals .
I guess the first nine chapters of Leviticus was n't enough .
He says we must do this because he really likes the smell -- it is " a sweet savour unto the Lord . "
23:12-14 , 18
89 .
Do n't do any work on the day of atonement or God will destroy you .

The Israelites find a man picking up sticks on the sabbath .
God commands them to kill him by throwing rocks at him .

105 .
Because of a dispute between Korah and Moses , God makes the ground open up and it swallows Korah and his family .
And then , just for the hell of it , God has a fire burn 250 men ( friends of Korah ? ) to death .
16:20 -49
106 .
After God killed Korah , his family , and 250 innocent bystanders , the people complained saying , " ye have killed the people of the Lord . "
So God , who does n't take kindly to criticism , sends a plague on the people .
And " they that died in the plague were 14,700 . "

According to this verse , it is wise to stay away from holy things and places -- like churches .
God will kill you if you get too close .
18:3
109 .
God shows us how to make new friends by saying :
" The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death . "
18:7
110 .
God describes once again the procedure for ritualistic animal sacrifices .
such rituals must be extremely important to God , since he makes their performance a " statute " and " covenant " forever .
Why , then do n't Bible - believers perform these sacrifices anymore ?
Do n't they realize how God must miss the " sweet savour " of burning flesh ?
Do n't they believe God when he says " forever " ?
18:17-19
111 .
Do n't get near holy things or " pollute " them .
If you do , God will kill you .
18:22 , 32
112 . The purification of the unclean .
These absurd rituals , cruel sacrifices , and unjust punishments are vitally important to God .
He even insists that they are to be " a perpetual statute " to all humankind .
19:1-22
113 . " And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities . "
This verse demonstrates the power of prayer :
If you ask God , he will destroy entire cities for you .
21:3
114 .
God sends " fiery serpents " to bite his chosen people , and many of them die .
21:6
115 . God delivers the Amorites into Moses ' hands .
( You 're in God hands with Moses . )
So Moses does the usual thing , killing everyone " until their was none left alive . "
21:34-35
116 .
God 's people will kill like a lion and then " drink the blood of the slain . "
23:24
117 . God , who is as strong as a unicorn , will eat up the nations , break their bones , and then pierce them through with his arrows .
What a guy !
24:8
118 .
After the people " commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab , " Moses has them all killed .
Then God tells
Moses to hang their dead bodies up in front of him ;
God says that this will satisfy him .
25:1-5
119 .
When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman , " Phinehas ( Aaron 's grandson ) sees them and throws a spear " through the man .. and the woman through her belly . "
This act pleases
God so much that " the plague was stayed from the children of Israel . "
But not before 24,000 had died .
25:6-9
120 . God tells
Moses how to care for his neighbors by saying : " Vex the Midianites , and smite them . "
25:16-17
121 . The ground swallow Korah and his companions and a fire consumes 250 men .
26:10
122 . " And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord . "
When you go camping avoid making any unusual fires .
26:61
123 .
In these chapters , God provides ridiculously detailed instructions for the ritualistic sacrifice of animals .
The burning of their dead bodies smells great to God .
Eleven times in these two chapters
God says that they are to him a " sweet savour . "
124 . Under God 's direction , Moses ' army defeats the Midianites .
They kill all the adult males , but take the women and children captive .
When Moses learns that they left some live , he angrily says : " Have you saved all the women alive ?
Kill every male among the little ones , and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him .
But all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves . "
So they went back and did as Moses ( and presumably God ) instructed , killing everyone except for the virgins .
In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow !
[ Even God gets some of the booty -- including the virgins .
( 31:28 -29 ) ]
31:1-54 28-29
125 . God killed all the Egyptian firstborn .
33:4
126 . " The revenger of blood " must murder the murderer just as soon as he sees him .
35:19 , 21
127 .
When a murder is committed the blood pollutes the land .
The only way to cleanse it is to spill more blood by killing the killer .

Bigfoot Found in Georgia ( Photos )
A group called Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. says that they have found Bigfoot in the northern woods of Georgia .
A press conference will be held this Friday in Palo Alto , California .
DNA evidence and photos of the creature are going to be released at the press conference .
The group is saying that it is a male and over 7 feet tall with reddish hair , blackish green eyes and weighing in at over 500 pounds .
The dead animal reportedly has flat feet that are similar to human feet .
Matthew Whitton and Rick Byer , a pair of Bigfoot hunters from northern Georgia say not only have they discovered the furry carcass of a dead animal but have also seen several similar creatures that are still alive .
The chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University , Tom Nelson , said that if the discovery proves to be true it would certainly rock mammalogy and open up research grants to do further investigation .
He calls himself " pretty skeptical " but admits that " we always acknowledge the possibility of something new . "
The group 's website has the full press release .
View more photos of the creature stuffed in a freezer chest below .

Sorry again for not being more attentive .
With great sadness - really huge sadness as the time we spent in America will I think be the highlight of our family life - it is time to say goodbye .
We have arrived back in the UK to begin the rest of our lives .
Memo to other Brits who might think of coming home from the US : spend your final US holiday in ( fill in the name of your least favourite US place ) - do n't do what we do and fly home from northern California .
Granted I was unimpressed with San Francisco but for climate and lifestyle and gorgeous scenery there is nowhere better than the rest of the state .
But you already know this .
What I would like to do is thank people who have contributed to the blog - including those who find my views frustratingly jejune - and ask you to forgive my failure to reply to many many fascinating insights including ( rather shamefully ) several I nicked for my book .
Now back in the UK I find myself utterly at sea - I say hello to people I pass in the street .
They lunge on , muttering insults .
We 'll get used to it .
But we will never forget the kindness of America .
In Swindon buying a car the other day ( yes , life has changed ) the conversation turned to a familiar theme but one that endlessly fascinates me - the relative peaceableness of the American life , guns and all .
Too many Brits seriously think that America is violent .
It is n't .
Most America lives are free of violence and the threat of it in a way no life in Swindon can be .
Why that 's true is a subject all of its own ( religion , gun ownership , moral fibre , space , social cohesiveness ? ) and one worthy of a future study .
By the way , we bought a large second - hand American car and we will pay the extra costs with pride ...
Have a nice day !

Learning To Drive a Stick Shift
I ’ve always thought that programmers should know how to drive a stick shift .
Pop the clutch , wrestle it into 2nd , finesse the gas , let the acceleration plaster you into those plush , faux - leather seats .
This is driving .
Now , I do n’t have anything against automatic transmissions .
In fact , I love automatic transmissions :
C #
Java
VB.NET
PHP
Ruby
Python
But a programmer should know , or at least be familiar with , the low - level stuff .
C/C++
Assembler
That means : pointers .
Threads .
DLLs .
Import tables .
Memory allocation .
Nuts and bolts .
Stuff that ’s often abstracted away for us quite nicely by the .NET framework or the JVM .
In a recent Stackoverflow.com podcast , Joel Spolsky makes the point :
[ more ]
But , but , but , but , but you see the thing about C is it ’s not COBOL , which is the language that the old programmers used , it ’s the language that is closer to the machine .
And so , things like stacks , they ’re still going on there , and , and malloc and memory allocation in C , yeah it ’s a lot of manual work that ’s done for you automatically in modern languages , but it ’s done for you automatically - it ’s still getting done .
And so studying C , for example , is like learning how to drive a stick shift car .
It ’s learning how your car works , and what the connections are , and how the gears work , and basically the main parts of the drive shaft , and parts of your car .
And you do n’t have to know about them to drive an automatic , it ’s true , but to really be a person who designs cars , or is an expert at cars , or who ’s an auto mechanic , or who ’s just kind of a wizard at cars , you have to know that anatomical stuff .
So you ’re not really - I do n’t think C is an obsolete language , because it ’s just an expression of assembler .
It ’s just an easier to use expression of assembler language .
And it reflects what actually goes on at the chip
Joe , you stole my metaphor .
Or rather , my simile .
The typical attitude around the development water cooler is that “ you only need C++ for performance , and performance is a non-issue in most applications . ”
But this kind of either / or thinking misses the forest for the trees .
As Visual C++ team member Stephan T. Lavavej put it in The Future of C++:
Aside from the elevator controllers and supercomputers , does performance still matter for ordinary desktops and servers ?
Oh yes .
Processors have finally hit a brick wall , as our Herb Sutter explained in 2005 at http://gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm .
The hardware people , who do magical things with silicon , have encountered engineering limitations that have prevented consumer processors from steadily rising in frequency as they have since the beginning of time .
Although our processors are n’t getting any slower , they ’re also not getting massively faster anymore ( at least , barring some incredible breakthrough ) .
And anyways , there is n’t plenty of room at the bottom anymore .
Our circuits are incredibly close to the atomic level , and atoms are n’t getting any smaller .
The engineering limit to frequency has simply arrived before the physical limit to circuitry .
Caches will continue to get larger for the foreseeable future , which is nice , but having a cache that ’s twice as large is n’t as nice as running everything at twice the frequency .
But let ’s ignore the mythology that performance is n’t an issue .
Let ’s just admit the following truths , and hold them to be self - evident :
That C/C++ is the most performant language in the world , with the exception of assembler itself .
That C++ brings this performance to bear using a high - level syntax which is remarkably similar to the syntax of Java and C# — because Java and C# borrowed heavily from C ++.
That for some desktop applications , performance is n’t an issue .
But these truths have little or nothing to do with why every programmer should know C and C ++.
They have little or nothing to do with why I say : if you want to be a top - notch programmer , you can no more afford to ignore the C and C++ languages than a civil engineer can afford to ignore the difference between a plumb line and a snap line , a right angle and an oblique one .
By saying that , I ’m not implying that I consider myself to be a top - notch programmer .
And I ’m not recommending that you or your organization start or continue developing in C++ as a way of conducting business .
That ’s a considerably more complex question , and one nobody can really answer but you .
I ’m not starting or contributing to a language war here , of any kind .
Not even a minor skirmish .
No , I recommend learning C++ for the most selfless and utilitarian of reasons : learning C/C++ will make you a better programmer in your language of choice , whatever it may be .
Ruby .
Java . C#. VB.NET .
And yes , even Haskell .
Whatever you program in : C++ will make you better at it .
Take a typical high - level programmer and immerse him for just a few months in a pot of boiling oil native C++ project :
Processes and threads
Stacks and heaps
Pointers and references
Memory addresses
Why hexadecimal is your friend
How strings are represented in memory
He ’ll emerge leaner , tougher , and with renewed confidence in the language of the day , whether it ’s C# , C++ , or Ruby .
He ’ll know , for example , exactly what it means to push a variable onto the stack .
And he ’ll know why , when he tries to allocate and then start accessing an array with 2 million elements , the hard drive churns even though the machine has 4GB of memory .
And when the whole application crashes , and spits out some god - forsaken maintenance error code along with a 4 - byte or 8 - byte memory address : he ’ll have some clue what it means , or how to go about finding out what it means .
C++ informs and bolsters your software development skills across the board by acquainting you with the nuts and bolts that underlie every language in the world , almost without exception .
So the next time you have some spare time , pick up a good introductory or advanced C++ book , dust the cobwebs off of your C++ compiler , and point the nose of that lean , mean , muscle machine out your garage door , through the quaint byways of suburbia , and up into the mountains .
You ’ll thank yourself for it in the interview room .
Costco ( COST ) rebounded in July , thumping same - store sales expectations by posting a 10.0 % gain vs. the 7.8 % consensus .
In fact , the company blamed weak tobacco sales ( are n't cigarettes recession - proof ? ) and competition between Costco 's own stores for not sending the sales even higher .
While it's clear that COST 's cheap ( er ) gasoline lures in customers , we have another theory for their recent success : Consumers are buying in bulk to decrease the amount of shopping trips they take , thereby saving money on gas .

The Federal Opposition has called on the Government to officially recognise Morgan Tsvangirai as the President of Zimbabwe .
Coalition foreign affairs spokesman Andrew Robb says Robert Mugabe has been exposed as a brutal , illegitimate tyrant .
Mr Robb says all independent analysts believe Mr Tsvangirai won the necessary 50 per cent of the vote in the March election .
He says Mr Rudd should act decisively and recognise Mr Tsvangirai as the rightful president and encourage other nations to do the same .
Mr Robb says Australia is not doing enough .
" In Opposition , Mr Rudd talked about hauling Mugabe before the International Criminal Court , making Zimbabwe one of Australia 's top five policy priorities and he even warned the Chinese Government about propping up the Mugabe regime , " he said .
" So Mr Rudd could be urging all countries , including China , to recognise Mr Tsvangirai and in turn to see some real pressure on the UN to act . "
AU summit
Meanwhile Mr Mugabe has arrived at an African Union ( AU ) summit in Egypt where his fellow African leaders are expected to urge him to reach a power - sharing agreement with the opposition .
The summit in the resort of Sharm El - Sheikh is expected to be dominated by the question of how to respond to the discredited run-off election that returned Mr Mugabe to power .
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe says that rather than debating whether Mr Mugabe should be addressed as President , delegates will be focusing on how to help the Zimbabwean people .
" It 's not the matter of the titles of a person who determines security and is the built - in Africa .
It 's the way forward , " he said .
" We are in a serious business here .
The question is the people of Zimbabwe - what do we do for the suffering people of Zimbabwe ? "

The IOC and the Iraqi government have reached an agreement that will allow the war - torn country to send two athletes to the Beijing Games .
The deadline for competitors entering the Games has passed for most sports , but the IOC said it could allow Iraq to send two track and field competitors to Beijing .
Here is the story as told by the IOC press release :
In a productive meeting at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne , the IOC and the Government of Iraq agreed on a series of steps that will lead to a fully functioning , independent National Olympic Committee in Iraq .
The agreement re-establishes the independent NOC of Iraq which will be allowed to take part in the Beijing Games .
Iraqi athletes will compete in Beijing under the Iraqi flag , led by coaches and team leaders selected by the independent Iraqi National Olympic Committee .
Five government representatives will be invited by the IOC as observers to the Games in Beijing .
The agreement also calls for the transparent and fair election of a new , independent Iraqi National Olympic Committee , no later than the end of November 2008 .
This process will be overseen by the IOC and the Olympic Council of Asia and will be held in cooperation with the Government of Iraq , and in accordance with the Olympic Charter .
“ I commend the government of Iraq for reaching an agreement that serves the long - term interest of Iraqi athletes , ” IOC President Jacques Rogge said .
“ We have said all along that we want to see Iraqi athletes in Beijing . ”
The IOC had suspended Iraq from competing in the Games because of government interference with the country 's independent Olympic organizing committee .
Several of the original committee 's members were kidnapped and remain missing .
Associated Press reports that the Tuesday compromise came about after Germany and China became involved in the discussions .
Two track and field athletes will attend the Beijing Games , but athletes who'd hoped to compete in archery , judo , rowing and weightlifting lost out because the disagreement .

Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Imagine an Egyptologist 's surprise when the mummified pharaoh he found and unwrapped in 1898 bore the familiar scars of smallpox , a disease whose first successful vaccination had been discovered only 100 years earlier .
Today it 's a medical success story , but before it was eradicated , the smallpox virus spent more than 3,000 years decimating communities across the globe .
The extremely infectious disease was class - blind , killing rich and poor alike , and almost single - handedly wiped out the New World empires encountered by European explorers .
Smallpox was finally controlled by the development of the world 's first vaccine in the late 1700s , but fears linger that a few cells remaining in Petri dishes could be used as biological weaponry .
Empires fall
It is believed that smallpox first incubated 10,000 years ago in northern Africa , spreading slowly to the rest of the ancient world .
Repeat epidemics of the highly contagious virus — which caused a grotesque rash , fever and often blindness — began popping up a few millennia later .
Aside from speckling the face of Ramses V , the pharaoh who succumbed to smallpox in 1156 B.C. , the virus appears in contemporary texts from India and China .
Approximately 30 percent of those infected with smallpox died , and the statistics were even worse for children .
According to some ancient customs , newborn babies were often left unnamed until they , inevitably , contracted the disease and proved they could survive , historians say .
Smallpox continued to spread across Asia in the Middle Ages and reached Europe by A.D. 700 , killing indiscriminately .
Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations , but did n't spare royalty either : Queen Mary II of England , Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I , French King Louis XV and Tsar Peter II of Russia all died of the disease , the latter on the eve of his wedding .
Perhaps the most defenseless victims of smallpox were the Aztec and Inca Indians of the New World who , with no immunity to European diseases , were almost completely wiped out by the virus before Spanish conquistadors finished them off with weapons in the 16th and 17th centuries .
Dairymaids help create vaccines
By the beginning of the 18th century , 400,000 Europeans annually and one out of every seven Russian children were dying of smallpox , a disease that had now been killing unhindered for at least 2,800 years .
The only thing that tied its devastating case histories together was the observation that those who were lucky enough to survive smallpox never contracted it again .
The concept of inoculation — exposing an individual to small amounts of a disease in order to create immunity — was known in Africa , India and China by the 17th century and gained popularity in Europe in the early 1700s .
Smallpox was its first target there , and the risky procedure was fairly successful , killing just a small fraction of those injected .
In 1796 a new discovery was made by Edward Jenner , a British doctor .
Noting that dairymaids rarely contracted smallpox after bouts of cowpox , a similar but far less dangerous virus , Jenner injected a young boy with matter from a cowpox lesion and later inoculated him with smallpox .
The boy did not get sick — Jenner had performed the first " vaccination , " a word derived from the Latin vacca , meaning cow .
Further testing proved conclusively that the cowpox virus was able to build immunity against smallpox .
Using his theory , similar vaccines were later created for diseases such as yellow fever , mumps , rubella and tetanus .
Biological weapon concern
Smallpox epidemics continued through the 20th century until vaccination programs were regulated and implemented around the world .
In 1980 , the World Health Organization declared smallpox completely eradicated , but samples of the virus remain in two laboratories in the United States and Russia , prompting fears of biological warfare should the virus land in the wrong hands .
Revelations in 1992 by a Soviet defector that the USSR was developing a smallpox weapons program , plus the anthrax scare in 2001 , only heightened those fears .
There is " credible concern " that the virus may have been obtained by terrorists , according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Some thoughts for Document Freedom Day 2008 .
Back a few weeks ago in Geneva , OpenForum Europe hosted an evening of mini-talks and a discussion panel with various well - known personalities in our field : Vint Cerf , Bob Sutor , Andy Updegrove and Håkon Lie .
I was n’t able to comment on the event at the time , due to my self - imposed blog silence that week , but I ’d like to take the opportunity today to carry forward one of the topics discussed then .
I ’d like to take as my launching point the theme of Andy Updegrove ’s talk , which was “ Civil ICT Standards ” .
Andy treats this subject more fully on his blog , and also speaks to the topic in his taped interview with Groklaw ’s Sean Daly .
Thus spake Updegrove :
But as the world becomes more interconnected , more virtual , and more dependent on ICT , public policy relating to ICT will become as important , if not more , than existing policies that relate to freedom of travel ( often now being replaced by virtual experiences ) , freedom of speech ( increasingly expressed on line ) , freedom of access ( affordable broadband or otherwise ) , and freedom to create ( open versus closed systems , the ability to create mashups under Creative Commons licenses , and so on .
This is where standards enter the picture , because standards are where policy and technology touch at the most intimate level .
Much as a constitution establishes and balances the basic rights of an individual in civil society , standards codify the points where proprietary technologies touch each other , and where the passage of information is negotiated .
In this way , standards can protect – or not – the rights of the individual to fully participate in the highly technical environment into which the world is now evolving .
Among other rights , standards can guarantee :
That any citizen can use any product or service , proprietary or open , that she desires when interacting with her government .
That any citizen can use any product or service when interacting with any other citizen , and to exercise every civil right .
That any entrepreneur can have equal access to marketplace opportunities at the technical level , independent of the market power of existing incumbents .
That any person , advantaged or disadvantaged , and anywhere in the world , can have equal access to the Internet and the Web in the most available and inexpensive method possible .
That any owner of data can have the freedom to create , store , and move that data anywhere , any time , throughout her lifetime , without risk of capture , abandonment or loss due to dependence upon a single vendor .
Let us call these “ Civil ICT Rights , ” and pause a moment to ask : what will life be like in the future if Civil ICT Rights are not recognized and protected , as paper and other fixed media disappear , as information becomes available exclusively on line , and as history itself becomes hostage to technology ?
This rings true to me .
Technology , computer technology in particular , now permeates our lives .
We interact with it daily , from the moment the internet - radio alarm clock goes off , until days end , when we check our email “ one last time ” before going to bed .
Similarly , the standards that define the interfaces between these devices are also of increasing importance .
There was once a time when standards dealt only with the “ infrastructure ” , the stuff in the walls and under the panel floor , or in that funny little locked door off the hallway , with all the cables and flashing lights , where strange men with clipboards would occasionally emerge , accompanied by a poof of cold air and the buzzing of machines .
But today , the technology and the standards that mediate the technology are now directly in front of your face .
Think MP3 players .
Think DVD’s .
Think DRM .
Think cellular phones .
Think web pages .
Think encryption .
Think privacy .
Think documents .
Think documents - privacy - security - DRM , your data and what you are allowed to do with it , and what others are allowed to do with it , and whether you control any bit of this in this mad world of ours .
Between you and the tasks that want to do today stands technology and the standards that mediate that technology .
Standards are damn important .
Now , although the reach of technology and ICT standards has progressed over the years , the organizations and the processes that create these standards have not always kept up .
In many cases standardization remains the creature of big industry with little or no consumer input .
It is back - room discussions , where companies connive to see how many patents of their own portfolio they can encumber the standard with .
A successful standard is one where no major company is left hungry .
Consensus means everyone at the table has been fed .
That is the traditional world of technology standards .
It brings to mind the famous line from Adam Smith :
People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices —
The Wealth of Nations ( I.x.c.27 )
Luckily , there is some hope .
The proponents of “ open standards ” seek standards based on principles of open participation , consensus decision making , non-profit stewardship , royalty - free IP , and free access to standards .
The web itself , with the underlying network protocol stack , HTML family of formats with DOM and scripting API ’s is a shining example of what open standards can accomplish .
Tim Berners - Lee says it best , in his FAQ’s :
Q : Do you have had mixed emotions about “ cashing in ” on the Web ?
A : Not really .
It was simply that had the technology been proprietary , and in my total control , it would probably not have taken off .
The decision to make the Web an open system was necessary for it to be universal .
You ca n’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it .
But it is important to realize that “ control ” mechanisms in standards go well beyond IP and organization issues .
There are other important factors at play , and we need to address these as well .
Knut Blind discusses some of these issues a section called “ Anti-Competitive Effects of Standards ” from his The Economics of Standards ( 2004 ) .
The negative impact of standards for competition are mostly caused by a biased endowment with resources available for the standardization process itself .
Therefor , even when the consensus rule is applied , dominant large companies are able to manipulate the outcomes of the process , the specification of the standard , into a direction which leads to skewed distribution of benefits or costs in favor of their interests .
In other words , participation in standardization activities is time consuming and expensive , and large companies are much more able to make this kind of commitment than small companies , organizations or individuals .
So , large companies rule the world .
This is especially true with standardization at the international level , where decisions are often made at meetings in very expensive international locations .
JTC1 is still discussing what technologies would be required to allow participation in meetings without travel .
( Hint — its called a “ telephone ” )
To put this in perspective , my week in Geneva cost $ 3687.52 .
I flew coach , ate most of my meals on the cheap , often just grabbing hors d’oeuvres at receptions , and I received negotiated IBM corporate rates for air and hotel .
This is one JTC1 meeting .
What if I wanted to be really active ?
Add in two SC34 Plenary meeting ( Norway / Kyoto ) .
Add in JTC1 Plenary meetings .
Add in US NB meetings .
Add in US NB membership fees , consortium fees , conferences , etc .
This starts adding up , around $ 40,000 / year to participate actively in tech standards , and this does n’t include the cost of my time .
How many small companies are going to pay this amount ?
How many non-profit organizations ?
How many individuals ?
Not many .
But in spite of the expense , in spite of the large company bias of the international standardization system , I saw reason for hope at the Geneva BRM .
I saw younger participants , with fire in their bellies .
I saw FOSS supports from developing countries .
I saw Linux on laptops .
I saw participants from FOSSFA , SIUG , EFFI , ODF Alliance Brazil , COSS , etc .
They joined their NB ’s , participated in their NB debates and were appointed to represent their countries in the BRM .
Sure , it is only a foot in the door .
One in five BRM participants were Microsoft employees .
But it was a hopeful sign .
We ’ve planted the seed .
We must plant more .
And we must see that they grow .
Strength in standards participation comes with time , with participation , with networking , with learning the rules ( written and unwritten ) learning from others , etc .
Just as we have FOSS experts in the software engineering , in law , in business , in training / education , we also need experts in standardization .
Certainly the bread and butter participation will be from individual engineers , participating for the duration of a particular proposal or group of proposals .
But we also need the institutional linchpin participants , those who have taken on leadership positions within standards organizations , and whose influence is broad and deep .
FOSS also needs a standards agenda .
In a world of patent encumbered standards controlling the central networks , open source software dies , and dies quickly .
We must protect and grow the open standards , for without them we cease to exist .
What standards are important ?
Which demand FOSS representation ?
Remember just a few weeks ago , when there was a lot of concern about how the DIS 29500 BRM added explicit mention of the patent - encumbered MP3 standard , but failed to mention Ogg Vorbis at all ?
Although I sympathize with this concern , the fact is the BRM could not have added Ogg Vorbis at all , because it is not a standard .
Are we willing to do more than lament about this ?
I tell you that if Ogg Vorbis had been an ISO standard it would have been explicitly added to OOXML at the BRM .
Are we willing to do something about it ?
What are the standards critical to FOSS , and what are we doing about it ?
What standards , existing or potential , should we be focusing on ?
I suggest the following for a start :
Ogg Vorbis Ogg Theora PNG , ISO / IEC 15948 ODF , ISO / IEC 26300 PDF , ISO 3200 Linux Standard Base ( LSB ) , ISO / IEC 23360 Most of the W3C Recommendations Most of the IETF RFC’s
I ’m sure you can suggest many others .
Let ’s put it all together .
Some ICT standards directly impact what we can do with our data and our digital lives .
These are the Civil ICT Standards .
We need to ensure that these standards remain open standards , so anyone can implement them freely .
However , the standardization system , both at the national and international levels is biased in favor of those large corporations best able to afford dedicated staff to work within those organizations and develop personal effectiveness and influence in the process .
Showing up once a year is not going to work .
If FOSS is going to maintain any level of influence in formal standardization world , especially at the high - stakes international level , it needs to find a way to identify , nurture and support participation of “ Open Standards Activists ” .
The GNOME Foundation ’s joining of Ecma , or KDE ’s membership in OASIS are examples how this could work .
Umbrella organizations like Digistan also are critical and can be a nucleus for standards activists .
But what about taking this to the next level , to NB membership ?
Another example is the Linux Foundation ’s Travel Fund , designed to sponsor attendance of FOSS developers at technical conferences .
Imagine what could be done with a similar fund for attendance at standards meetings ?
So that is my challenge to you on this first Document Freedom Day .
We ’re near the end of what promises to be one of many battles .
The virtual networks of the future are just as lucrative as the railroad and telephone networks of the last century were .
These include the network of compatible audio formats , or the network of IM users using a compatible protocol , or the network of users using a single open document format .
If FOSS projects and organizations want to secure the value for their users that comes from being part of these networks , then FOSS projects must encourage the use of open standards , and must also encourage and nurture new talent for the next generation of open standards activists .
I ’m looking forward to the day , soon , when I can search Google for “ open standards activist ” and not find a paid Microsoft shill among the listings on the first page .

As you ’ve already guessed , Facebook and Facebook Messenger are two different applications .
The former allows you to upload photos , post them on your wall or on your friend ’s wall , like posts , comment to them and more .
However , today we will talk about the Facebook Messenger App , which allows you to send private messages , make voice and video calls , record voice messages , share your location with your Facebook friends and many more .
Facebook Messenger even allows you to create groups , which can hold up to 200 members , where you can invite your common friends and talk to all of them in a single chat room .
The application will also send you instant notifications when you receive a new message .
In other words , Facebook Messenger app almost works the same as the PC version .
Not many think that Facebook made a good thing by separating the Facebook App and Facebook Messenger , but there are days when you just want to join the Facebook Messenger and chat with your friends instead of being flooded by posts or comments notifications .
At the same time , it was quite hard for the developers to bring the Voice and Video call features to Facebook App and they were somehow forced to develop a separate application that ’s able to bring these two features .
Unfortunately , the new Facebook Messenger 114.0.0.21.71 does n’t come with any new features and options , but instead it solves some of the bugs that the developers have found in the previous version of the application .

Drivers have been feeling the pinch as gasoline prices rise US inflation accelerated at its fastest pace in 17 years in June , official figures have shown , driven higher by surging energy prices Consumer prices were 5 % higher than a year ago and rose 1.1 % on a monthly basis , the Labor Department said .
Federal Reserve boss Ben Bernanke has warned that the threat of rising inflation has intensified recently .
Minutes from the Fed 's latest meeting on interest rates indicated the next move in borrowing costs could be up .
It faces the dilemma of having to stem the rise in inflation while not further choking an economy under serious strain .
' Fed in a hole '
June 's annual inflation increase was the highest since 1991 while the monthly jump is the sharpest since September 2005 .
In his second day of congressional testimony on Wednesday , the Fed boss said inflation was too high and it was a key objective for the central bank to bring it down .
Many analysts now believe that the central bank may have to leave borrowing costs on hold , or even increase them , as it tries to steer a faltering economy through turbulent times .
This increases concern that the Fed is not going to be able to lower interest rates if the economy remains weak
Gary Thayer , from Wachovia Securities
At the same time as inflationary pressures are rising , the US faces a severe housing slump , a credit crunch and financial market turmoil stemming from the collapse of the sub - prime mortgage market .
According to minutes of the Fed 's interest rate meeting in June , policymakers believed " the next change in the stance of policy could well be an increase " due to " upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations " .
The impact of surging living costs in June " really puts the Fed in a hole , " said Alan Ruskin , an economist at RBS Greenwich .
Gary Thayer , from Wachovia Securities , agreed that the Fed was facing a tricky balancing act .
" This increases concern that the Fed is not going to be able to lower interest rates if the economy remains weak . "
But he added : " And as long as the economy remains weak , it will be hard for the Fed to raise rates to fight inflation . "
Energy surge Energy prices were the main driver of price growth , and were 6.6 % higher in June as the cost of petrol , natural gas and heating oil increased .
But expectations that that a slowing US economy will dampen demand for oil helped crude prices fall more than $ 4 to below $ 135 a barrel , their second sharp daily fall .
Annual core inflation , which strips out volatile fuel and food prices , touched 2.4 % .
The surge in living costs has dented the earning power of Americans .
Average weekly wages , after adjusting for inflation , fell by 0.9 % in June - the biggest monthly decline in 24 years , the Department said .

What are these ?
( Natural News )
The South American nation of Ecuador has said that it will refrain from drilling in a world biosphere reserve , but only if the international community compensates the country for the income it would otherwise have gained .
President Rafael Correa has made it clear that Ecuador is seeking money not as charity , but instead as a way for the international community to exercise its " shared responsibility " for protecting biological diversity .
Ecuador is asking for at least $ 350 million per year for 10 years , to approximate the income that the nation is expected to make from drilling in the Ishpingo - Tiputini - Tambococha oil fields Yasuni National Park , a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve .
According to Oil Minister Galo Chiriboga , the international community has until June 15 ( 2008 ? ) to deliver the money .
" Either the international support not to drill is obtained or we go ahead with the auction , " he said .
Bidding to drill in the oil fields is currently scheduled for June 16 .
State oil companies from Brazil , Chile and China have already expressed interest .
Ecuador is the fifth largest oil producer in South America , generating half a million barrels of crude oil per day .
Some First World environmentalists have praised Ecuador 's willingness to forego drilling .
" Ecuador is making a sacrifice to try to make this happen , " said Kevin Koenig of Amazon Watch .
But the Ecuadorian environmental group Cedenma remains unimpressed , especially in light of the government 's insistence on the June 15 deadline . " [ This ] demonstrates ... the government 's intentions to cede once again before the [ oil drilling interests ] who definitively threaten Ecuador 's natural ecosystems , " the group said .
Portions of Yasuni National Park are the traditional territory of the indigenous Waodani nation , whose autonomy in that area has been guaranteed by the Ecuadorian government .
But the government has explicitly retained subsurface mineral rights and proceeded with oil exploration and drilling , over the express opposition of the Waodani .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A revised reading on gross domestic product announced Thursday showed much better U.S. economic growth than previously reported for the second quarter .
GDP , the broadest measure of the nation 's economic activity , stood at an annual rate of 3.3 % in the quarter , adjusted for inflation , the Commerce Department said .
Economic growth between 2.5 % and 3.5 % is typically viewed as the norm for a healthy economy .
The revised result surpassed last month 's initial estimate of 1.9 % .
It also surprised economists surveyed by Briefing.com who expected a revision to 2.7 % .
Stimulus works :
The $ 90 billion in economic stimulus payments that reached taxpayers during the quarter helped boost GDP up from just 0.9 % growth in the previous quarter .
Personal spending helped add 1.2 % to the second - quarter preliminary GDP reading released Thursday , up from the advanced reading of 1 % for the quarter and just 0.6 % in the first quarter .
But many economists say the boost in consumer spending is a temporary factor attributed to the tax rebate checks , making the jump in the second quarter an anomaly .
" We got a decent boost from the stimulus , which hit the economy at a time when we really needed it , " said Wachovia senior economist Mark Vitner .
" It will have less of an impact going forward , though and we may even have a payback in the fourth quarter . "
Trade helps too :
The increase from the initial estimate was also partially due to June 's U.S. trade gap reading , which was not available until after the advanced GDP numbers were reported .
Much improved demand for U.S. exports added 3.1 % to GDP , compared to just 0.8 % in the advanced reading .
" We would have had growth even without the stimulus , as much of the rise in GDP had to do with the trade deficit , " Vitner added .
A pickup in government spending , particularly a 0.4 % rise in defense spending by the federal government , also boosted GDP .
But imports declined over the period , meaning lower inventory levels for retailers , which account for more than half of all GDP .
Changes in non-farm inventories subtracted nearly 1.3 % from overall growth .
Inflation :
The government report also showed mixed readings for inflation in the previous quarter .
The GDP price index , the so - called " price deflator , " which measures prices overall , rose at a 4.2 % annual rate .
But the core PCE deflator - a more closely watched inflation reading that measures prices that individuals pay excluding volatile food and energy prices - rose 2.1 % , the same as was reported in the first GDP report .
Inflation is still just barely above the perceived comfort zone of central bankers .
The Federal Reserve is generally believed to want to see the 12 - month change in core inflation readings remain between 1 % and 2 % .
" Without a price spiral , the Fed wo n't have to squeeze the life out the economy , which should help sustain modest economic growth , " Vitner said .
Breaching the boundaries in a juxtaposition of typography , art , and science , Oded Ezer writes his own rules as an experimentalist with works of letters transformed into bizarre , zany , and mesmerizing shapes and designs from insects to cloned human sperm cells injected with typographic information into its DNA .
Typoplastic Surgeries
Working from his studio in Israel , Oded does n’t consider himself as a scientist or an artist , merely a typographer who attempts to explore new fields as a pioneer for typography in a similar manner as Graffiti and Street Artists are carving their way to be deemed as a true and mainstream form of art and communication , with the world at large as an audience .
Typoplastic Surgeries
Oded became thoroughly keyed - up with Typoplastic Surgeries for its possibilities , and literally began attaching letters to his own body and face .
Self portrait with an ‘ Alef ’ – early sketches for “ The Typographer ’s Guide to the Galaxy ” poster .
“ The connection is between the letters to the face , kind of an evolution of both .
I began the process in a graphical manner , but then I tried to implement it physically .
So this augmentation , deformation of the body , the revelation of its typographical perspective is what turns me on . ” said Oded , in an interview with Eyal Fried .
“ I think about typographical means all the time , just because this is where I feel free and safe .
Sort of like my language and me are evolving together . ”
Typosperma
A bizarre and one of the more amazing concepts ever to hit typography is Oded ’s creation of Typosperma , the second experimental typo project in his ‘ Biotypography ’ series .
He defines it as “ any typographical application that uses biological systems , living organisms , or derivatives thereof , to create or modify typographical phenomena . ”
Using biotechnological methods ( think in the likes of Victor Frankenstein ) , Oded creates a form of new transgenic living creatures which are half - human sperm and half - letter by implanting typographic information into the DNA of cloned sperm cells .

Do women need to shave ?
Marie Carsson , by email
Absolutely , purely out of a sense of decency .
Not to onlookers - frankly , if onlookers find your sense of fashion or personal hygiene choices offensive , they should just stop looking at you and get a life .
No , out of a sense of decency to razor manufacturers .
Seriously !
Now I must confess , this consideration had never occurred to me before last week , when I read an article about the impressive lengths and hilarious depths to which a certain razor company is going before " unleashing " its women 's razor on the quivering and stubbly world at large .
The razor itself is called a Venus ( I 'm guessing - though I could be wrong , but I bet not - that it 's pink ) , so the adverts will feature a " leggy model running with a jogging stroller " .
She is , according to a spokesperson for the ad agency , " the goddess of trailblazing " .
Yes , any model who runs with a poncey three - wheeled baby stroller is right up there with Emmeline Pankhurst in the pantheon of female trailblazing .
Prompting a coo of " but ambassador , you are spoiling us " , the company is making another exciting advert for this new razor that shows a woman texting .
She is , apparently , " the goddess of communication " .
Boy , those Rollerblading Bodyform women will be well jealous .
Tragically , these adverts are currently only scheduled to air in the US , but I think we can all spot an international classic when we see one .
Truly , these adverts are the Esperanto of the advertising world , the way they speak to women across the planet .
Incidentally , though , would n't it be cool to see , just once , an advertiser of a " feminine hygiene " product say : " Look , what you 're going through - it ai n't fun .
No one 's breaking out the Rollerblades or text messages .
Just buy this .
It 'll make your life moderately easier , and we 're not going to treat you like a baby and pretend that it 's some special treat ... a special treat that you endure every sodding month . "
Just a crazy little thought there .
But the most intriguing thing about this much - vaunted new razor ( it 's got five blades !
Can there be any more hurdles on this planet to scale ? ) is the amount of guff - I mean research - the manufacturers spout about it .
Just listen to them dribble on about how women have different shaving needs because " their bodies are more topographically varied and also they tend to vary a lot in terms of the physiology of the skin and the hair " , in the words of Kevin Powell , director of Gillette Technology Centre in Reading .
Yuhdoansay , Kevin Powell .
Maybe that 's because we tend to shave in more areas than just our chin , hence the topographical variation .
It 's not some special biological gift , just a matter of geography .
And if Gillette has only just figured this out , I 'd be wary of using any of its products , quintuply , octuply or decahedrally bladed or not .
I have fallen in love with a designer handbag but my husband says the patent leather makes it look cheap .
Who 's right ?
C Dawson , London
Your husband is right - patent leather does look cheap .
And Vivienne 's fondness for the material in Pretty Woman has not helped its image in the long run .
But the real question here is , does that matter ?
For a start , you are the one who 's going to carry the bag , not your husband , and his expressed qualms seem not to have dampened your ardour .
Moreover , the intimation that " looking cheap " is bad suggests that " looking expensive " is good .
Is that really the point of forking out for a designer bag - to show off how much you 've spent ?
Judging by the number of logos and labels flashing around , yes , that does seem to be the raison d'etre for many a person 's purchase .
But C , I take you for a wise woman , and not just because you have written to me ( OK , that is entirely the basis of my judgment - heck , I do n't even know your name beyond the first letter .
What else do I have to go on ? ) .
I do n't think that is what you want .
What you 're really worrying about is whether you could get it cheaper somewhere else , and the answer is , probably .
But you can always get everything cheaper somewhere else .
Sometimes you just really want to treat yourself to the proper deal , whether it be a flash TV , a super - nice holiday or , in your case , a lovely handbag that will last you an age and that makes you happy every time you reach your hand into it , even if all you find are a load of old Kleenex .
So I say , go forth and work that Pretty Woman look , girlfriend .
Though perhaps restrict it just to the bag .
Oh , and the bit when she ordered the pizza in the store .
That was awesome .
An artist 's impression of what JAXA 's Space Solar Power System might look like if it used laser transmission to beam solar power down to Earth .
Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Placing solar panels in space above both night and clouds was first considered 40 years ago .
But the estimated cost was , in a word , astronomical .
The idea , however , has seen a resurgence , thanks to rising oil prices and advances in solar technology .
A report from U.S. Defense Department found that space - based solar is technically feasible and economically viable .
To help prove the point , the Air Force Academy recently announced plans for a small demonstration satellite that would beam down a meager , but still significant , 0.1 watts of solar power .
" Our vision is to build the world 's first - ever space - based solar power system to light a single bulb on Earth and in so doing light the path for business to follow , " said Col. Michael " Coyote " Smith of the Air Force .
The type of transmission beam is still not decided , but the project may benefit from separate research in Japan that has been studying the two most likely technologies : microwaves and lasers .
In the full light of space
The sun puts out more than 10 trillion times the energy currently being consumed by the whole world .
" We would only need to tap into a small fraction of that to get all our energy now and in many years to come , " said Mark Hopkins , senior vice president of the National Space Society , which recently formed an alliance with other non-profits to promote space - based solar .
The advantage of going to space is that sunlight is constant up there and three to 13 times stronger than the average down here on Earth , Smith said .
The first suggestion of a solar power satellite was in 1968 , but early estimates put the price tag around $ 1 trillion , largely because astronauts would have had to construct the facility back then .
Now robots can do the job , installing improved - efficiency solar cells in a modular fashion , for 100 times cheaper than before .
" If you decide to go now with today 's technology , you 're talking about the same cost as ground - based solar , " Hopkins said , which is around 30 cents per kilowatt - hour .
That 's still too high , according to Hopkins , but he thinks costs will continue to come down , especially if development dollars start coming in .
The Pentagon - sponsored report offered a roadmap for how to build a 10 - megawatt test satellite over the next 10 years for $ 10 billion .
But where that money will come from is hard to say .
According to Hopkins , NASA sees this as an energy application and the Department of Energy sees this as a space enterprise .
" There are bureaucratic problems finding a home for this project , " he said .
Japan plans ahead
The Japanese space agency , JAXA , has been providing steady support over the past decade for their Space Solar Power System ( SSPS ) .
The goal is to launch a geostationary satellite by 2030 that could supply 500,000 homes on Earth with a gigawatt of power .
Currently , JAXA researchers are looking at both microwaves and lasers as possible options for beaming the energy down .
" The technology for microwave transmission is more advanced , since it is based on current communication satellites , " said Susumu Sasaki , a manager at JAXA 's Advanced Mission Research Group .
But to transmit huge amounts of power in a focused beam , the transmitting antenna in space needs to be roughly 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) wide .
A receiving antenna of similar size or bigger must be built on Earth .
The alternative would be a laser .
Japanese scientists have been working on metal alloy plates that can absorb sunlight and directly convert it into an infrared laser beam .
The advantage is that the transmitting and receiving devices can be about 10 times smaller than for microwaves , Sasaki said .
Lasers also do not carry the risk of interfering with communication networks that use microwaves .
However , lasers cannot go through clouds like microwaves can , so about half of the beam energy is lost if lasers are used .
Another problem is that a laser - beaming satellite sounds like a weapon , even though Hopkins thinks there would be ways to ensure that it never gets used in such a way .
In contrast , microwave transmission is too low of intensity to be considered dangerous .
A person could safely walk across where the targeted beam hits the Earth , according to Hopkins .
" You would feel it as some extra warmth , like on a sunny day , " he said .
Sooner than later
Smith said that both microwaves or lasers were being considered for the Air Force project , which was announced earlier this month at the International Space Development Conference .
" Although our architecture is far from decided , we have adopted the mantra keep it cheap and simple and deliver it soon , " he said .
They plan to stay under $ 10 million with a 400 - pound ( 181 - kilogram ) satellite in low Earth orbit .
It may be able to piggyback on another mission and use inflatable solar arrays .
Smith hopes it will launch in 2010 .
" We want to get this rolling , " he said .
Just in time for the closing rush of the presidential election , MSNBC is shaking up its prime - time programming lineup , removing the long - time host –- and one - time general manager of the network — Dan Abrams from his 9 p.m. program and replacing him with Rachel Maddow , who has emerged as a favored political commentator for the all - news cable channel .
The moves , which were confirmed by MSNBC executives Tuesday , are expected to be finalized by Wednesday , with Mr. Abrams ’s last program on Thursday .
After MSNBC ’s extensive coverage of the two political conventions during the next two weeks , Ms. Maddow will begin her program on Sept. 8 .
MSNBC is highlighting the date , 9/8/08 , connecting it to the start of the Olympics on 8/8/08 , as a way to signal what the network ’s president , Phil Griffin , said “ will be the final leg of the political race this year . ”
He added , “ We making that Rachel ’s debut . ”
Mr. Abrams , who is well liked at MSNBC , is expected to remain at both that network and at NBC News , where he is the chief legal correspondent .
He will also serve as an anchor during some of MSNBC ’s daytime coverage , as well as a substitute host on NBC ’s “ Today ” show , Mr. Griffin said .
The addition of Ms. Maddow as prime - time host had been expected for some time .
Only a month ago , Mr. Griffin said she was at the top of the list to get a show at the network , and would likely get one soon .
MSNBC has put heavy emphasis this year on presidential election coverage ( it has given itself the tag line , “ The Place for Politics ” ) and has turned to Ms. Maddow frequently both as a guest and as a substitute for the network ’s most popular host , Keith Olbermann .
Mr. Olbermann ’s emergence as the signature personality on the network has led to an unofficial rebranding of MSNBC as the liberal alternative to Fox News , which is dominated by conservative hosts like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity .
MSNBC has been known to be seeking a way to capitalize to a greater degree on Mr. Olbermann ’s popularity .
A program hosted by Ms. Maddow will almost certainly be a closer ideological fit with Mr. Olbermann’s .
Mr. Abrams was not as overt a partisan .
His program , “ Verdict , ” was based more in legal than political issues .
He enjoyed some success , especially of late .
With NBC ’s Olympic coverage helping , Mr. Abrams beat Larry King ’s show on CNN twice last week among the viewers preferred by news advertisers , people between the ages of 25 and 54 .
Contacted by phone Tuesday , Mr. Abrams said “ Putting my general manager ’s hat back on , considering where the network is right now , it is actually the right call . ”
Mr. Griffin said of the selection of Ms. Maddow , “ This just completes our prime - time lineup .
Our lineup makes sense now . ”
Just over 40 % of the adult U.S. population has been screened at least once for HIV , but a quarter of a million people are infected and do n’t know it , government researchers said Thursday .
About 10 % of the population gets an HIV test each year -- a figure that has remained stable since 2000 despite efforts to increase testing -- according to a report from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The release of the data was timed to coincide with the International AIDS Conference being held this week in Mexico City .
About 56,300 Americans become infected with HIV each year , and 1 million to 1.1 million are thought to be living with the virus .

In September 2006 , the CDC recommended that all Americans be offered HIV testing as part of their routine medical care .
Last year , the agency allocated additional funds to 23 jurisdictions to test an extra 20 million people , primarily African Americans , in hopes of identifying 20,000 more HIV - positive people .
The goal of the increased testing is to identify infections at an earlier stage so people can begin receiving anti-AIDS drugs while the treatment can do more good .
Late diagnosis increases the likelihood that the infection will proceed to more serious illness .
In 2005 , 38 % of those newly diagnosed with HIV infections progressed to AIDS within a year , the report says .

In addition , an HIV - positive individual who is unaware of the infection is three times as likely to transmit the virus as one who knows his or her status , CDC officials said .
The new data , current through 2006 , were collected to serve as a baseline so that officials can judge the success of the accelerated testing program .
The results were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey , in which periodic face - to - face interviews are conducted with people ages 18 to 64 in a broad cross section of the population .
The cumulative data indicate that in 1987 , only 6 % of the population had ever been tested .
In the 1990s , as many as 15 % of Americans were tested each year , and the total who had ever been tested reached 38 % by 2000 .

Since then , the total has remained stable at about 40 % .

__UPDATE ( 8:35 AM Pacific ) : Tropical storm Gustav continues to track towards the Gulf 's energy infrastructure and with an intensity that suggests it will become a category - 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 115 miles per hour , according to a National Hurricane Center update issued this morning .
The storm 's most likely path is now slightly to the west of New Orleans as seen in the updated picture above .
__
Three days before the three - year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina 's landfall , the Gulf of Mexico is bracing for another hurricane that could hit the energy industry particularly hard .
Tropical storm Gustav is headed straight for the heart of the Gulf 's oil - producing infrastructure , according to early government forecasts , and it could become a very strong hurricane .
As seen in the map above , if the storm continues along its currently predicted path , it will slam straight into the oil rigs that dot the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana .
If there is a major supply disruption , it could could send gas prices rocketing back up .
" That whole area is just so vulnerable to an intense storm .
It 's like rolling a bowling ball down an alley .
If it hits , it 's going to knock some pins down , " said Chuck Watson , founder of KAC , a disaster risk management company which does work for world governments and private enterprises .
" You really hope for a gutter ball . "
Kinetic Analysis Corporation estimates that there is a one in three chance that Gustav will hit with sufficient force to shut down 10 percent or more of total U.S. oil production this year .
" In a tight market , that 's a big hit , " Watson said .
In 2005 , hurricanes including Katrina , Rita and Wilma caused major supply disruptions , reducing American oil output by a quarter .
Production has only recently returned to pre-2005 levels .
The Gulf of Mexico region supplies about a tenth of the 21 million barrels of oil that the United States consumes each day .
But Watson said that losing a big chunk of Gulf oil facilities would have an impact on gas prices larger than its share of world oil production .
" When you start looking at the details , [ the Gulf ] has an impact out of proportion to the percentages because it 's close , it 's cheap and it's always there , " said Watson .
That could mean substantially higher gasoline prices in the United States just as prices have finally crept below four dollars a gallon .
The possibility also exists that one or more refineries could be hit , which would create much longer - term supply problems .
" If it goes into Galveston , Texas , and Beaumont , where the big refineries are , it could be catastrophic , " Watson said .
" There 's limited capacity to absorb damage and repair it quickly . "
Right now , how much trouble Gustav could cause is still unclear .
The storm is n't expected to make landfall until late this weekend , and Watson said that all hurricane models are far from accurate until a few days before landfall .
" We have a 64 - processor Beowulf cluster that does the modeling .
We can do differential equations and look at satellite imagery , " Watson said .
" But these longer - range forecasts — meh – we 're not that smart . "
Nonetheless , fear of supply disruption could be enough to restart the rally in oil prices that had abated since a peak at over $ 140 a barrel earlier this summer .
Apparently spurred by fears of Gustav , crude oil prices pushed higher today to over $ 118 a barrel .

Comcast is poised for legal showdown with the Federal Communications Commission as the agency moves to fine the cable giant for blocking file - sharing traffic on its Web network .
Two commissioners , Democrats Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein , late last week joined Chairman Kevin Martin to vote in favor of sanctioning Comcast , giving the commission a majority in favor of punishing the cable giant .
A formal vote is set for Friday .
The F.C.C.'s ruling could represent a landmark victory for " network neutrality " advocates and set a precedent for the rules governing how internet service providers are allowed to manage their Web traffic .
Network neutrality , the principle that all Web traffic should be treated equally , was enshrined in the F.C.C.'s 2005 Internet Policy Statement , which established four principles intended to guarantee consumers open access to all legal internet content .
Comcast argues , however , that the commission lacks the authority to enforce those principles .
" In order to enforce something , an agency must be enforcing a rule that has force of law , " Comcast spokesperson Sena Fitzmaurice told Portfolio.com .
The F.C.C.'s internet policy statement does not meet that test , the company believes .
F.C.C. Chairman Kevin Martin , however , believes the enforcement of the internet policy is within the agency 's purview .
" I am pleased that a majority has agreed that the Commission both has the authority to , and in fact will , stop broadband service providers when they block or interfere with subscribers ' access , " Martin said in a statement Saturday .
The battle over whether the F.C.C. can fine Comcast for violations of the internet policy could land in federal court if the company decides to challenge the ruling .
Last year , a consortium of consumer - rights groups led by Free Press filed a complaint after Comcast was found to be interfering with peer - to - peer Web traffic .
Comcast initially denied the charge before admitting that it had been practicing what the company called " reasonable network management , " as allowed by the F.C.C.'s policy statement , in an effort to prevent Web traffic bottlenecks .
But three out five F.C.C. commissioners now disagree with the company 's position , giving the panel a majority vote to punish the company .
In a statement , Comcast continued to defend what is called its " reasonable network management " practices .
" We continue to assert that our network management practices were reasonable , wholly consistent with industry practices , and that we did not block access to websites or online applications , including peer - to - peer services , " Comcast said .
" We do not believe the record supports any other conclusion . "
Network neutrality advocates hailed the news of the F.C.C.'s ruling .
" This vote reflects the bipartisan support for protecting consumers ' access to the free and open internet , " said Marvin Ammori , general counsel of Free Press and author of the original complaint .
" Comcast 's blocking is a flagrant violation of the online rights established by the F.C.C .
If adopted , this order would send a strong signal to the marketplace that arbitrarily interfering with users ' online choices is not acceptable . "
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
A mother and her 6 - month old girl escaped unhurt after she calmed down a knife - wielding robber with a glass of iced tea and a chat , Tokyo police said Wednesday .
The 30 - year - old housewife was in the hallway of her apartment building Monday when a man pressed a knife to her back and demanded money , police said .
When the woman said she did not have any cash on her , the man pushed her and her baby into her apartment .
To buy herself time to escape , the woman gave the robber a cup of iced wheat tea to calm him down on what was a hot summer day , police said .
The 43 - year - old man put away his knife and began to tell her how he lost money gambling and its effect on his life and family .
The housewife handed the man about $ 100 ( 10,000 yen ) , ran outside , and called for help .
The man ran off with the cash , but officers caught him the next day .
As officers whisked him away to jail , the man told them he was sorry for what he did to the housewife , police said .
April 23 , 2008  -- Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , has won the Pennsylvania primary vote as expected with a decisive 10 - point win .
The victory was " very big and very sweet , " Clinton said today on ABC's " Good Morning America . "
" Some people counted me out and said to drop out but the American people do n't quit , and they deserve a president who does n't quit , either , " Clinton told supporters at a victory rally Tuesday night after walking out to Tom Petty 's song " I Wo n't Back Down . "
" We were up against a formidable opponent who outspent us 3 - 1... trying to knock us out of the race , " Clinton said of Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill .
" Well the people of Pennsylvania had other ideas today . "
Clinton told " GMA 's " Diane Sawyer that the win should send a message to unpledged superdelegates .
" The road to the White House does go through Pennsylvania , " she said , adding that Tuesday 's win proves that she can win the large and swing states , crucial to a November victory .
But Clinton declined to endorse a call to let undecided superdelgates pledge to whoever wins the popular vote , where Obama still enjoys a half - million vote lead .
The pressure was on Clinton to win by a large margin and she delivered .
With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , she won 55 percent of the vote , to Obama 's 45 percent
Obama briefly congratulated Clinton in a speech in Evansville , Ind. , but then turned to his common theme of the need for change in American politics and to attacks on Republican John McCain .
" After 14 long months , it 's easy to forget this from time to time -- to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment , " he said .
" It 's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit - for - tat that consumes our politics ; the bickering that none of us are immune to , and that trivializes the profound issues -- two wars , an economy in recession , a planet in peril -- issues that confront our nation . "
Clinton 's Pennsylvania victory fuels questions about why Obama has n't been able to sew up the nomination , despite having more money , having won more states and having a lead in the popular vote and pledged delegates , according to ABC News ' delegate scorecard .
With neither candidate able to get the 2,025 delegates needed to win the party 's nomination , tonight 's win in Pennsylvania will bolster Clinton 's argument to superdelegates — the 795 Democratic party officials and members of Congress who may ultimately decide the nomination .
' Clear and Convincing Victory '
As the results pour in , pundits , Democratic superdelegates , and the media will characterize whether Clinton won by a large enough margin of victory .
Devine and other Democrats have long argued the New York senator needed to win the Keystone State over Obama by double digits , and dig into Obama 's delegate lead .
" If she wins by 10 points or more , it will be viewed as a clear and convincing victory , but if it 's closer than that , it will be less than a clear and convincing victory , " Democratic strategist Tad Devine said .
Speaking to reporters in Conshohocken , Pa. , Tuesday , Clinton rejected that common argument , saying " a win is a win . "
" But maybe I 'm old fashioned about that .
But you run a very competitive race at a considerable financial disadvantage .
I think maybe the question ought to be why can't he close the deal ? " she said .
" Why ca n't he win a state like this one , if that is the way it turns out ? "
Older , Blue - Collar Workers Key for Clinton
During the course of the Pennsylvania primary battle , the candidates went bowling and drank beer , with Clinton going one step further and downing shots of whiskey and appearing more comfortable at times than her opponent .
Obama garnered unwanted headlines after suggesting economic realities have left people in the state " bitter " and clinging to guns and religion .
Obama later admitted he should have worded his thoughts better .
Clinton was expected to win in Pennsylvania in part because of her edge in past primaries among blue - collar workers , those without a college degree , and older voters — all demographics representative of the Keystone State .
Obama , meanwhile , had hoped his hold on younger voters and high interest in this primary from a record 218,000 newly registered first - time voters would erode some of her support .
Clinton 's Advantage in PA
" The state of Pennsylvania , on its face , given the nature of its voting population — older , white , Catholic , working class — for the most part , these are all demographic groups that Hillary Clinton has done well with throughout the course of this nominating process , " Devine said .
Preliminary exit poll results indicate that nearly six in 10 Pennsylvania voters are women ; under 50 percent of Pennsylvania Democratic voters have a college degree ; three in 10 Democratic voters are Catholic ; and almost half are liberals .
" To win this decisive , one candidate or the other , either Clinton or Obama , needs to break into the other candidate 's base , " Devine said .
If Obama bests Clinton in a state like Indiana or North Carolina where she is thought to have a strong base of support , Devine said , the race could shift in the Illinois senator 's favor .
" If it does n't , I think the race will continue the way it has since Super Tuesday , really , since Iowa and New Hampshire , just more of a see - saw than anything else , but one where Obama has been able to hold an advantage , " Devine said .
Race To The End
Over a pancake breakfast at Pamela 's Diner with his wife , Michelle , and owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers Dan Rooney , Obama said he does n't expect the Democratic race to end until the last primary votes in June .
" I have come to the conclusion that this race will continue until the last primary or caucus vote is cast , " Obama said .
" And that 's not far away . "
Throughout the nominating process , Obama has done better than Clinton among young voters , urban voters , black voters and Democrats with college degrees .
Last - Minute Jabs
As the polls opened in the Keystone State , both candidates got some last - minute jabs in on network and cable television interviews .
" I think there 's a big burden on Sen. Obama ... to prove that he can win a big state , because he has n't really up until now , " Clinton said in a pretaped interview with ABC's Chris Cuomo that aired on Tuesday 's " GMA . "
Clinton also decried Obama 's fundraising advantage going into the state 's primary .
Obama outspent Clinton on TV in Pennsylvania by 2 - 1 .
" I know very well that I 'm in a real fight here , " Clinton said .
" Every time I turn around there are posters at bus stops and train trips and he 's got an enormous cash advantage . "
Obama had $ 42 million cash on hand in primary money by the end of March , according to his latest Federal Election Commission report .
In comparison , Clinton had $ 9 million , but was carrying $ 10 million of debt .
But Clinton told " GMA " today her campaign recieved $ 3 million in donations in the wake of Tuesday 's win .
Early on Tuesday morning , Obama sought to manage expectations for any Clinton victory .
" Sen. Clinton started off with a big lead here .
She had a 20 - point lead , " Obama told ABC 's Robin Roberts on " GMA , " " But we feel good about how we 've chipped away at that lead . "
A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found Clinton with a seven - point edge on Obama in Pennsylvania .
In mid-February , Clinton boasted a 14 - point lead over Obama in Pennsylvania .
Negative TV Ads
The bitter Democratic battle turned even uglier in the lead up to the Pennsylvania primary , with the candidates launching negative ads and robotic calls against one another .
On Monday , Clinton launched an ad in Pennsylvania that questioned whether Obama is up to the task of being president in a time of crisis .
" Who do you think has what it takes ? " the narrator asks over images of Osama bin Laden , headlines about the stock market crash of 1929 , long gas lines from the 1970s oil - shocks and images of the Cold War , Hurricane Katrina and U.S. soldiers .
The ad quotes President Truman 's famous line : " If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen " — to cast Obama as complaining about last week 's ABC News presidential debate .
The Obama campaign accused Clinton of using " scare tactics " in the ad .
The Illinois senator 's latest ad says : " Sen. Clinton has internalized a lot of the strategies , the tactics that have made Washington such a miserable place . "
Defending his campaign 's harsher tone , Obama told ABC News ' Robin Roberts Tuesday : " You 've always got to measure if somebody throws an elbow at you , and after three or four times of gettin ' elbows in the ribs , you know , at what point do you sort of say , ' OK , you know , we , we , we 've gotta put a stop to that ? ' "
Obama said .
Both campaigns launched automated calls to Pennsylvania voters in a last - minute effort to question the credibility of their opponent , with Obama questioning Clinton 's record on gun control and Clinton questioning Obama 's record on energy .
Making headlines as voters go to the polls , former President Clinton told a Philadelphia radio station Monday that the Obama campaign took his Jesse Jackson comment and " twisted it for political purposes " and accused Obama 's campaign of " playing the race card on me . "
At the end of the interview , Clinton turned to an associate and said , " I do n't think I should take any s-- from anybody on that , do you ? "
Today Bill Clinton verbally attacked a reporter who asked him about the comments .
" No , no , no , that 's not what I said , " Clinton told an NBC reporter .
" You always follow me around and play these little games .
And I am not going to play your games today .
This is a day about election day , go back and see what the question was and what my answer was .
You have mischaracterized it just to get a another cheap story to divert the American people from the real urgent issues before us , and I choose not to play your game today . "
Taking on the GOP
Pennsylvania voters today chose between two bruised candidates after a grueling and nasty election fight .
Many Pennsylvania voters acknowledged the negative tone in the campaign , according to preliminary exit poll results .
However Clinton is bearing the blame — two - thirds of Pennsylvania voters in preliminary exit poll results say Clinton attacked Obama unfairly ; fewer , but still about half , also say Obama unfairly attacked Clinton .
While some party officials are wringing their hands about the bitter tone of the Democratic campaign , worried it will turn off independents and undecided voters and damage their chances against Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz. , in the fall , others say despite the tone , voters mobilized to overturn eight years of the Bush administration and will rally behind either candidate if they win the nomination .
" A majority of Americans believe this country is headed off in the wrong direction , " Devine said .
" As long as [ those ] issues tend to dominate the electoral landscape , Democrats will have a real advantage . "
ABC News ' deputy political director Teddy Davis , Gary Langer , Nicole Gallagher , Sunlen Miller , Eloise Harper , Sarah Amos and Nitya Venkataraman contributed to this report .
Iran launched a series of missile tests in the desert this week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said the results of Iran 's missile tests prove that US plans for a defence shield in Europe are unnecessary .
Mr Lavrov said the tests confirmed Tehran had missiles with a limited range of up to 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) .
The US says it wants shield sites in Poland and the Czech Republic to defend it and its allies from rogue states .
Meanwhile , Iraqi and Israeli officials denied media reports that Israeli air force jets trained in Iraqi airspace .
The reports said Israeli aircraft had used Iraqi airspace - and US bases in Iraq - to practice for a potential strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Iran has denied Western assertions that it is developing nuclear weapons and insisted its nuclear programme is intended for peaceful purposes .
Following widespread condemnation over the recent ballistic missile tests , Iran said it was open to talks about its nuclear programme .
See footage of Iran 's missile tests
The official news agency , Irna , said the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , would meet the European Union 's envoy , Javier Solana , on 19 July in Geneva - although this has not yet been confirmed by Mr Solana 's office .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says that although Iran seems willing to talk , it is unclear whether it is willing to give any ground .
A missile defence shield with these parameters is not needed to monitor or react to such threats
Sergei Lavrov
Russian Foreign Minister
Q&A : US missile defence Iran denies Western assertions that it is developing nuclear weapons and insists its nuclear programme is intended for peaceful purposes .
Some analysts saw this week 's missile tests as an attempt by hardliners to discourage compromise .
The EU urged Iran to suspend uranium enrichment within its nuclear programme , saying that the missile tests " can only reinforce the international community 's concerns " .
" The EU calls on Iran to respond to the demands of the entire international community ... and achieve a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue , " a statement issued in Paris said .
The tests are said to have included the Shahab - 3 missile , which is capable of reaching Israel and a number of US allies in the region , but not the proposed US shield bases in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Earlier this week , the US signed an agreement with the Czech Republic which would allow the Americans to build a tracking radar station there as part of the system they hope will be operational by 2012 .
Washington also hopes to place 10 interceptor missiles in Poland but has yet to reach agreement with the government there .
' Imagined ' threat The BBC's James Rodgers , in Moscow , says repeated assurances from senior figures in Washington have failed to convince Moscow that the proposed shield represents no danger to Russia .
Mr Lavrov told reporters on Friday the tests showed that " a missile defence shield with these parameters is not needed to monitor or react to such threats " .
He said Moscow was convinced that what he called the imagined nature of the Iranian missile threat was a pretext for the missile shield .
" We believe that any issue related to Iran should be resolved through negotiation , through political - diplomatic means ... and not through threats , " he said .
Moscow fears locating the system near its borders could weaken its own defences or be used to spy on Russia .
It has previously threatened to aim its own missiles at any eventual base in Poland or the Czech Republic .

What are these ?
The police state has not arrived quite yet but it may feel like it to the residents of some American cities , where a handful of embattled mayors and police chiefs are imposing strict and sometimes sweeping curfews as a last resort to quell new waves of gun violence this summer .
" We must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people , especially children , to be victims , " insists Eddie Perez , the Mayor of Hartford , the capital of Connecticut , where a night - time curfew was introduced last week and will remain in effect for a month for those under 18 years old .
Nor are there any apologies from the authorities in Helena - West Helena on the banks of the Mississippi in Arkansas , small pockets of which are under a 24 - hour curfew that all ages must respect .
Police are enforcing it , moreover , with night - vision goggles and M16 military rifles .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In Hartford , the centre of America 's insurance industry , the approach is not quite as militaristic .
Children found on the streets between 9 pm and 5 am are approached and escorted by officers to their homes .
Most nights since the curfew came into effect last Thursday have seen only a dozen or so picked up .
But there was nothing softly - softly about the violence that prompted Hartford to take such action .
Two weekends ago , 11 people were shot in three different attacks , the worst at the annual West Indian Parade in the city 's North End , which left one man dead and two children hurt .
A toddler in a pushchair was grazed by bullet on her leg .
A seven - year - old boy remains in hospital with serious head wounds .
" I am still traumatised , " says Darlene Johnson , 44 , who had a food stall at the parade with her husband and father .
" I see this man pulling this long gun from under his shirt and he started shooting .
I just could n't believe it .
Some people thought it was firecrackers but I knew different .
I saw the little girl rubbing her leg and the boy with blood coming out of his head . "
Much of the city cannot believe it either , yet 150 shootings have been recorded this year
In summer , bored teenagers have little to do but wander the streets .
Gangs mark out turf .
Insults are traded and revenge is taken .
The man killed at the parade , Ezekial Roberts , had been running with gangs .
While curfews sound like they belong in war zones or natural disaster areas , they have long been a popular tool of US police departments .
And it is in the dog days of summer , when humidity and violence seem to join hands , that they most often come into vogue .
For the duration of the school holidays this year , for instance , Baltimore has an 11 pm curfew ( midnight on Fridays and Saturdays ) for children under 17 .
Those who violate it are taken to a school until a parent or guardian picks them up .
It is a trend the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , does not welcome .
The group " opposes juvenile curfews because they 're essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people , " said David McGuire of the Connecticut ACLU .
" Curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic , in this case , youth , under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few . "
Residents of Connecticut 's north end , however , tired of the shootings , seem mostly to support the curfew , though few believe it alone will solve the larger problems of young people with little to do , attracted by gangs and lacking discipline .
" We need to keep the young people off the streets , " says Ms Johnson on the front steps of her home .
" And the parents need help .
The law is the law . "
Taquana Quan , 18 , standing outside Burger and Pizza Land on Barbour Avenue , where two other men were shot on the same weekend , also supports the Mayor 's decision .
So does his cousin , Shantay Taytay , who is 21 .
They have had enough .
" This dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike .
We are moving to Atlanta , the whole family . "

" We 'll see if it works , " says Barbara Shannon , who lives across from the restaurant and said she starting praying when she heard the shots .
But it will not be enough .
The problem lies in the upbringing of the teenagers , she says , mostly by single mothers .
Indeed , of all the households with children in Hartford , almost 70 per cent are headed by single parents .
And nearly always they are the mothers .
" Babies are having babies and kids are having kids , " she asserts confidently .
" And the mothers are always looking to have fun .
They do n't make time to look after their young ones . "
Valencia Coleman , 68 , who has a dance studio in the north end and witnessed the shooting at the parade , is more blunt .
" The children can't stay in their homes because of what their mothers are doing behind the bedroom door .
They are having sex .
The boys especially have a big problem with that .
Every kid I know who is in trouble , it 's always the same story .
They can't handle their mothers ' boyfriends . "
More dubious still is Alisha Jackson , whose oldest child is 12 .
She thinks the curfew is a " band- aid " that will only deepen tensions between young people and the police .
" I hope it works .
But I think it 's going to cause a lot of trouble .
A lot of kids are going to end up being locked up , I bet you . "
And what of the young targets of the curfew , such as Rackwon Hicks , who is hanging out with a cousin and two friends on the front steps of another dour brick apartment building on Barbour Street ?
( Never mind the metal sign by the door prohibiting the " Peddleing of drugs " ( sic ) as well as sitting on the entryway steps " . )
He is 10 years old and says staying at home after 9 pm is not an option .
His mother is there .
" I just can't be there , that 's all .
They can't coop us up like that , it 's not right "
One of the friends , Rashad Hassan , a burly 16 - year - old , is cocky .

DNA AND KNOT THEORY
Introduction : DNA is the genetic material of all cells , containing coded information about cellular molecules and processes .
DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands twisted around each other in a double helix .
The first step in cellular division is to replicate DNA so that copies can be distributed to daughter cells .
Additionally , DNA is involved in transcribing proteins that direct cell growth and activities .
However , DNA is tightly packed into genes and chromosomes .
In order for replication or transcription to take place , DNA must first unpack itself so that it can interact with enzymes .
DNA packing can be visualized as two very long strands that have been intertwined millions of times , tied into knots , and subjected to successive coiling .
However , replication and transcription are much easier to accomplish if the DNA is neatly arranged rather than tangled up in knots .
Enzymes are essential to unpacking DNA .
Enzymes act to slice through individual knots and reconnect strands in a more orderly way .
Importance :
We can gain insight into the unknotting of DNA by using principles of topology .
Topologists study the invariant properties of geometric objects , such as knots .
Tightly packed DNA in the genes must quickly unknot itself in order for replication or transcription to occur .
This is a topological problem .
Question :
How can knot theory help us understand DNA packing ?
How can we estimate the rates at which enzymes unknot DNA ?
Methods : DNA can be visualized as a complicated knot that must be unknotted by enzymes in order for replication or transcription to occur .
It is perhaps not surprising then that connections between mathematical knot theory and biology have been discovered .
By thinking of DNA as a knot , we can use knot theory to estimate how hard DNA is to unknot .
This can help us estimate properties of the enzymes that unknot DNA .
A mathematical knot is a closed curve .
This can be visualized as a closed loop of string .
If the string had a knot in it , it would be impossible to unknot without slicing throught the knot .
Look at the pictures below .
The first knot is merely a loop of string that has been twisted , an " unknot " .
It could easily be unknotted by pulling on the string to form a single loop .
The 2nd knot , however , is clearly a knot .
The only way to get rid of the knot would be to cut through it and retie the string .
The 3rd knot is even more complicated .
To understand this more rigorously , we will explore some topological definitions .
A knot is a closed curve in three - dimensional space .
Two knots are considered the same if one can be moved smoothly through space , without any cutting , so that it is identical to the second .
Mathematical knots are represented by two - dimensional diagrams that can be thought of as the shadow cast by a three - dimensional knot .
At points in the diagram , the curve will cross over or under itself .
The crossing points are called doublepoints .
Each double point is assigned a + or - sign , depending on the orientation of the crossing point .
If the strand passing over a doublepoint can be turned clockwise less than 180 to match the direction of the strand underneath , then the sign is positive (+ ) ; if the strand on top must be rotated counter - clockwise , it is negative ( - ) .
The writhe of a knot is the sum of all signs of its doublepoints .
The knots below are +3 and - 3 , respectively .
The only way to untie a mathematical knot is to cut through the knot so that the strand that was lying on top is now underneath .
This is equivalent to changing the sign of a doublepoint .
The number of times on must allow one strand of a knot to pass through another ( in order to unknot it ) , is called the unknotting number .
If a knot can be moved smoothly through three - dimensional space to remove the doublepoint , then that doublepoint does not count toward the unknotting number .
Consequently , in the figure below , knot a ) has an unknotting number of zero , despite having one crossing point .
Knot b ) has an unknotting number of 1 , despite having 3 crossing points .
A knot is in its ideal form if it has been moved smoothly through space so that all excess doublepoints are removed .
Knots are generally described by two numbers , C U , the ideal crossing number ( C ) and the unknotting number ( U ) .
In the figure above , the knots would be 0 0 and 3 1 , respectively .
Mathematical knots may have values for writhe and crossing number that are much higher than the ideal number if they have been moved smoothly through space to a more complicated form .
Interpretation : We can extend the principles of topology to DNA .
The value of this method is that it gives researchers a quantitative measure for DNA packing , rather than a subjective description .
In DNA packing and unpacking , an enzymatic reaction converts DNA strands to knots , linked strands , or a more orderly form .
Knot theory can help scientists discover the mechanisms by which these enzymes work .

Lifting the curtain : Using topology to probe the hidden action of enzymes .
Notices of the AMS 42:528-537 .
Scientists use electron microscopes to take pictures of DNA .
Underlying and overlying segments are distinguished by using a protein coating .
The flattened DNA is then visualized as a knot .
The unknotting number and ideal crossing number can then be estimated .
For several DNA fragments with the same knot number , C U , there may be a variety of different forms as the DNA is twisted and distorted .
However , the average writhe and crossing number can be estimated for a particular ideal knot number .
A more convenient procedure for determining the crossing number of DNA knots involves using gel electophoresis .
The distance DNA fragments move on an electrophoretic gel is highly correlated with the average crossing number ( see graph ) .
The ideal knot number is given on the graph ( reproduced from Stasiak et al 1996 ) .
Using topological methods helps scientists gain insight into properties of DNA replication , transcription , and recombination .
Enzymes called topoisomerases are important in DNA unpacking and packing .
In addition to its double - helix structure , DNA has a number of twists in it as it coils around itself called supercoiling .
Brown and Cozzarelli ( 1979 ) used topological methods to determine how the topoisomerase , gyrase , works in E. coli to supercoil DNA .
If we represent this as a 2 - D drawing , we can count the number of doublepoints and determine their signs .
Brown and Cozzarelli found that the writhe decreased in a stepwise fashion as gyrase acted .
A stepwise decrease in writhe would occur as the sign of each doublepoint changes from positive to negative .
They concluded that topoisomerases act by slicing through each double point and reconnecting the strands on the reverse side .
Topological methods also distinguished two classes of topoisomerases .
Brown and Cozzarelli found that the stepwise decrease in crossing number consisted of two steps .
This indicated that gyrase was a type 2 topoisomerase that acted by nicking both strands of the double helix , and reconnecting them underneath .
In contrast , type 1 topoisemerases unpack DNA by nicking a single strand , rotating the free ends to relieve the supercoiling , and reconnecting the ends .
In this case , the stepwise decrease in crossing number would consist of a single step .
Topoiserases act locally , breaking apart a single doublepoint before they are free to move to another one .
Computing the unknotting number for twisted DNA gives cell biologists an estimate of the number of times a topoisomerase must act in order to unpack the DNA .
We can measures the reaction rates ( number of strand crossings per minute per mole of enzyme ) for particular enzymes ( See Enzymes and the Rates of Chemical Reactions . ) .
In this case , the crossing points of the DNA or DNA of a particular knot type would be the substrate .
An enzyme solution is added to the DNA solution .
Product is formed as the enzymes change the signs of doublepoints or create different knot types .
Measuring changes in topology to estimate reaction rates gives us a quantitative measure for comparing different enzymes or a single enzyme under different conditions .
Conclusions : Principles of topology give cell biologists a quantitative , powerful , and invariant way to measure properties of DNA .
Principles of knot theory have helped elucidate the mechanisms by which enzymes unpack DNA .
Additionally , topological methods have been influential in determining the left handed winding of DNA around histones .
Measuring changes in crossing number have also been instrumental in understanding the termination of DNA replication and the role of enzymes in recombination .

I ’m not attending WWDC this year ( sorry ! ) , but I did attend last year , so I have some advice for those of you attending for the first time ( and I hear there are a lot of you ) .
Walk .
San Francisco is n’t designed to handle car traffic — it ’s optimized for pedestrians , in several ways :
Most streets are one - way , meaning that a car must take a longer route than a pedestrian can .
The walk / do n’t walk signals do n’t have buttons , because you do n’t need them .
When drivers get the green light , pedestrians get the walk signal — every time .
Almost all parking costs money per hour .
Walking is free .
Parking is so sparse that you ’ll walk one or more blocks anyway .
So , if you can walk from your hotel to Moscone and back , do so .
You ’ll get there faster and more cheaply .
Do n’t eat the lunch .
The objects that Moscone serves as lunch are not food .
Food , by definition , is edible .
Eat out .
Note that I ’m only talking about lunch .
Moscone serves food at other times of day : a mid-afternoon snack , and dinner .
These are OK , and sometimes even pretty good .
Only the lunch is inedible .
Attend parties , or make your own .
If you ’re at WWDC with some friends or colleagues , you may be able to work on some code with them at the conference .
This is a lot of fun , especially if you can get together around a power strip .
Either way , you may want to attend other parties .
Some parties are listed on Upcoming .
Additionally , there ’s CocoaHeads meeting at the Apple Store on Stockton St on Tuesday .
If you know any others , please post a comment here and I ’ll link to them .
( However , I ’d stay away from the Thirsty Bear pub .
The acoustics in that place are terrible .
Forget conversation . )
Bring your ( US ) AC adapter .
They have charging stations at the conference , but the week I was there , the MBP chargers were broken .
They never did get them fixed .
I ended up buying a second AC adapter at the Apple Store .
Additionally , Tim Burks recommends bringing a power strip — a good idea if you and your friends / colleagues intend to hack code together at the conference .
More specifically , Mark Boszko recommends Monster Cable ’s ( yes , them ) Outlets to Go . He also notes the existence of 3 - and 6 - outlet versions , which you may prefer , depending on how much space you have in your bag .

Beth Fouhy ’s dispatch on her feelings about the end of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign began , ' I miss Hillary . '
Is Fournier saving or destroying the AP ?
Ron Fournier says he regards Sandy Johnson , his predecessor as head of The Associated Press ’s Washington bureau , as “ a mentor . ”
Johnson , though , regards Fournier , who replaced her in a hard - feelings shake - up in May , as a threat to one of the most influential institutions in American journalism .
Advertisement
“ I loved the Washington bureau , ” said Johnson , who left the AP after losing the prestigious position .
“ I just hope he does n’t destroy it . ”
There ’s more to her vinegary remark than just the aftertaste of a sour parting .
Fournier is a main engine in a high - stakes experiment at the 162 - year old wire to move from its signature neutral and detached tone to an aggressive , plain - spoken style of writing that Fournier often describes as “ cutting through the clutter . ”
In the stories the new boss is encouraging , first - person writing and emotive language are okay .
So is scrapping the stonefaced approach to journalism that accepts politicians ’ statements at face value and offers equal treatment to all sides of an argument .
Instead , reporters are encouraged to throw away the weasel words and call it like they see it when they think public officials have revealed themselves as phonies or flip - floppers .
The new approach was on display in a Liz Sidoti news analysis written earlier this month with the lead , “ John McCain calls himself an underdog .
That may be an understatement . ”
Last week Beth Fouhy ’s dispatch on her feelings about the end of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign began , “ I miss Hillary . ”
Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said on Friday that she “ loved ” Fouhy ’s column , and stressed that she saw it not as an opinion piece but as political analysis from a reporter who spent 18 months covering the Clinton campaign — despite the fact that it ’s written in the first person .
Fournier himself , shortly before taking the job as bureau chief , wrote several models for what he ’s called “ accountability journalism . ”
A January lead declared that “ Obama is bordering on arrogance . ”
A month later , he began a column with “ The Democratic nomination is now Barack Obama 's to lose . ”
Fournier and other critics of the conventional press model , especially those on the left , have said that being released from the tired conventions of news writing is exactly what journalism needs .
By these lights , the mentality that presumes both sides of an argument are entitled to equal weight is what prevented the media from challenging the Bush administration more aggressively on the Iraq war and other issues .
Others warn that what Fournier and other proponents see as truth - telling can easily bleed into opinionizing — exactly the opposite of the AP ’s mission of “ delivering fast , unbiased news . ”
“ The problem , ” says James Taranto , the Wall Street Journal ’s Best of the Web columnist and a frequent critic of what he sees as the AP ’s liberal bias , “ is that while you can do opinion journalism and incorporate reporting into it , you ca n’t say you ’re doing straight reporting , and then add opinion to that . ”
A dispatch Fournier filed in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina began : “ The Iraqi insurgency is in its last throes .
The economy is booming .
Anybody who leaks a CIA agent 's identity will be fired .
Add another piece of White House rhetoric that does n't match the public 's view of reality :
Help is on the way , Gulf Coast . ”
Fournier cited the article in an essay titled “ Accountability Journalism : Liberating reporters and the truth ” he wrote for the June 1 issue of the AP ’s internal newsletter , The Essentials , as an example of how to be “ provocative without being partisan … truth - tellers without being editorial writers . ”
The essay was preceded by an unsigned note declaring that “ It 's AP 's goal this year ( and henceforth ) to make this accountability journalism a consistent theme in our coverage of public affairs , politics and government .
We have unmatched resources and expertise in every state to report whether government officials are doing the job for which they were elected and keeping the promises they make . ”
“ Katrina was a good example of when the journalism community got it right , because it was staring us in the face , ” Fournier , seated in the AP ’s Washington bureau , told Politico .
“ When George Bush stood up there and said that things were going fine in Katrina , I was able to write , ‘ The president is wrong . ’
That was pretty liberating .
It was also a fact . ”
“ It seems to me there ’s a conscious effort to inject bias in the story , though obviously Fournier would see it differently , ” Taranto told Politico .
“ It ’s a conscious move in the direction of advocacy journalism . ”
However it ’s described , it ’s clear Fournier ’s voice has drawn favorable treatment from the Drudge Report , which has linked to eight of his articles already this year , each in a standout format with his name in all caps and no mention of the AP as , for example , “ FOURNIER : She may pay high price for selfishness … ”
At first blush , Fournier is an unlikely brand - name byline , let alone a proponent for a new brand of journalism .
He joined the wire ’s Little Rock bureau in 1989 , moved to Washington with President Bill Clinton in 1993 and remained there though the 2004 election .
For years , he was well known in Washington political circles — if virtually unknown beyond — as a classic AP reporter .
He was smart , obsessed with being first on breaking news and wrote in the classic Joe Friday “ just the facts , ma’am ” style .
But over recent years , Fournier pushed up against his own boundaries .
He left the AP in 2004 to take a Harvard Institute of Politics fellowship that he he said let him look at the journalism world from “ five miles off the ground , ” rather than “ five feet off the ground like you are as a wire reporter . ”
He then co-wrote the book “ Applebee ’s America ” and went to work as editor in chief of the political social networking startup Hotsoup.com , which went under in March 2007 when he returned to the AP as online political editor with a new and decidedly un -AP - like philosophy .
“ The only thing he ever managed is a startup that he ran into the ground , ” cracked Johnson when asked how her former protégé would handle overseeing the Washington bureau .
“ I think there ’s mixed feelings — there ’s reluctance , ” said an AP staffer .
“ The AP has always been a just - the - facts type of organization , ” the staffer added , where even star political reporters typically play a more behind - the - scenes role than those at other papers .
And it was Johnson who hired the majority of reporters in Washington , meaning they ’re now following not just a new leader but a new agenda .
While Johnson frequently clashed with AP ’s New York headquarters , it ’s clear Fournier has their support to continue the transformation of what Carroll described to Politico in January as “ not your father ’s Oldsmobile . ”
“ We probably were n’t as boring as you thought we were , ” Carroll said when asked about the new style , adding that the AP has made “ enormous changes ” since she became editor in 2002 .
“ Do n’t make us decrepit or dull when we ’re not . ”
“ Ron is a fully empowered acting bureau chief , and is doing a number of structural things , ” said Carroll , who added there is no “ asterisk ” next to his name , even though the move has n’t been made permanent .
Fournier ’s accountability journalism is at least in part a reaction to how the Web has reshaped the news business since the 2000 election , significantly reducing the barrier to entry for outside voices even as it has eroded newspapers ’ advertising revenue , which in turn has meant staff and bureau cuts — all of which have left the AP in an even more critical role as the last bureau standing , as it were .
It also makes the shift to more assertive reportage a risky one for the world ’s oldest media organization , which relies on a base of subscribing news outlets from across the ideological spectrum that for decades have expected to receive clean , well - structured copy that addresses opposing views on equal terms and can easily be cut to length .
Until now , the AP has in effect served two roles : breaking news and serving as the last — and definitive — word .
Outside editors who rely on the wire are excited about the change , but also concerned that Fournier ’s new brand of journalism could cut against both those traditional roles .
Craig Klugman , editor of the Ft. Wayne ( Ind. ) Journal Gazette , called Fournier a “ true heavy - hitter in this business , ” but said his newsroom has been split on the new format for AP stories , which some staffers consider “ innovative , ” while others do n’t believe it ’s “ as cutting edge as the AP thinks it is . ”
The day he was interviewed , the paper was running a piece of the AP ’s accountability journalism — which seemed to Klugman a lot like enterprise journalism — on the front page .
The article , by Sharon Theimer , began with the Fournier - esque lead : “ Nuclear weapons ?
No way . ”
David Bailey , managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette ( where Fournier worked as a reporter in the 1980s ) , said that since the departure of former AP chief executive Louis Boccardi five years ago , he ’s noticed “ a new philosophy ” as the AP tries “ to do more with dazzle and footwork these days than [ stories ] with real substance , ” which is why he said it ’s important the paper maintains an active wire desk to vet and edit the copy .
“ We almost never run an AP story as we get it on the front of the paper , ” he said .
Still , he said , “ if the AP is smart enough to listen to what Ron will say , the AP will improve dramatically . ”
“ Washington bureaus are cutting back and newspapers in general are cutting back on their staffs , ” said Fournier , who warned that the result would be fewer “ really good investigative pieces that stick it to somebody who deserves it ” and fewer “ sharp , edgy analysis when somebody is breaking their promise , or when they are lying or spinning . ”
Since there ’s an opening in the marketplace for such reporting , he added , AP reporters have a responsibility not only as journalists and citizens , but also as business people seizing a market opportunity to keep the organization going .
Implicit in that argument is the idea that a Web - driven news environment has diminished the value of traditional commodity - style news .
The new approach , though , opens up the wire to the accusations of ideological bias often directed at other large outlets like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal .
In a critique on Best of the Web of Fournier ’s Katrina coverage , Taranto argued that “ The AP 's embrace of ‘ accountability journalism ’ would seem to be a response to the proliferation of opinion , especially on the radio and online .
You would think that given the glut of opinion , ‘ mainstream media ’ organizations like the AP would emphasize what they are particularly good at , namely impartial reporting . ”
While editors still rely on the AP for “ Breaking News ” ( the title of last year ’s coffee - table book on the organization ) , Fournier prefers to move the conversation toward multimedia and muckraking journalism .
“ There ’s a bigger need for this kind of journalism than ever , ” he said .
“ The public is losing faith . ”
Fournier rattled off a list of institutions , including organized religion , government , media , the military , big business and the courts , in which recent Pew polls show public confidence at all - time lows .
“ It ’s our responsibility , ” he said , “ to step into that breach and say , ‘ Hey , what the hell is going on here ? ’ ”
In April , Fouhy wrote a 225 - word dispatch from South Bend , Ind. that called out the Clinton campaign for an event in which the candidate , with the press in tow , rode with a commuter to a gas station to fill up .
The lead : “ Hillary Rodham Clinton , a former first lady who has n’t driven a car or pumped gas in many years because of Secret Service restrictions , joined a blue - collar worker at a filling station Wednesday to illustrate how the high price of gasoline is squeezing consumers . ”
“ It was a totally camera - driven political stunt that was one for the record books , ” Fouhy said , adding that she was “ taking Ron ’s philosophy ” in calling it as she sees it .
At times , Fournier has pulled back .
He wanted to open a news analysis written by Fouhy and Nedra Pickler in May with , “ The Democratic presidential race is over . ”
The lead itself would have been newsworthy coming from the wire that , under Johnson ’s direction during the 2000 presidential election , insisted Florida was too close to call even as the networks all called it incorrectly — twice , as it turned out .
After some back and forth , the reporters won out with “ The Democratic presidential race is all but over . ”
Another AP staffer , though , said that while some top reporters may be able to stand up to the boss , others are less likely to do so .
Since becoming acting bureau chief , Fournier ’s written only one piece , but he intends to take on a more of a player - coach role , penning one or two pieces a week , and even occasionally hitting the campaign trail .
Even absent his byline , his influence has been evident , as it is in the lead to reporter Liz Sidoti ’s June 19 news analysis on the Democratic nominee ’s decision to reverse course on public financing : “ Barack Obama chose winning over his word . ”
In Fournier ’s view , the average reader is “ having a hard time figuring out the right from the wrong , the black from the white ” in politics , where gray often prevails .
“ But boy , when we can cut through the clutter , and we can say ‘ Barack Obama put politics over his word , ’ which he did — that ’s a fact , ” Fournier said .
“ He did .
He may not like the way Liz wrote it , but it is a statement of fact . ”
WELLINGTON , New Zealand –
An eight - year - old girl was ejected from a junior tennis tournament at Christchurch on New Zealand 's South Island when officials discovered she was wearing a radio earpiece to receive instructions from her father .
Tournament referee Rob Wilkinson said officials became suspicious because the match involving Ukrainian - born Anastasiya Korzh featured a " heightened number of questioned calls . "
Officials found the earpiece hidden under the girl 's headband , linked by a cord to a receiver under her shirt , The Press newspaper reported Thursday .
Korzh 's father said the earpiece was only being used to help the girl keep score in the under - 10 tournament .
She was playing in her first tournament .
About The Film
MAN ON WIRE On August 7th , 1974 , a young Frenchman named Philippe Petit stepped out on a wire illegally rigged between the New York World Trade Center ’s twin towers .
After dancing for nearly an hour on the wire , he was arrested , taken for psychological evaluation , and brought to jail before he was finally released .
This extraordinary documentary incorporates Petit ’s personal footage to show how he overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges to achieve the artistic crime of the century .
Senator Barack Obama ’s resounding victory in Wisconsin on Tuesday echoed in New Jersey today , where he won the backing of two additional superdelegates , including one who had previously declared for his opponent , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
One of the superdelegates , State Senator Dana Redd , who had backed Mrs. Clinton , said she switched because Mr. Obama ’s growing support had convinced her that he was the best choice to win the general election and lead effectively as president .
The other Democratic superdelegate , Donald Norcross , a labor leader and co-chairman of the powerful Camden County Democratic organization , had been uncommitted .
But he said that Mr. Obama ’s strong campaign and ability to attract voters from a wide array of demographic groups provided evidence that he could assemble the kind of coalition needed to change the tone in Washington .
“ We need to seize this momentum , attract a new generation of leaders to our party , while rallying behind the candidate who can best unite the country during these uncertain economic times , ” Mr. Norcross said .
“ That candidate is Senator Barack Obama . ”
As a prominent senator from neighboring New York , Mrs. Clinton had the backing of most of New Jersey ’s Democratic establishment , and she handily won New Jersey ’s primary on Feb. 5th .
The week before the vote , Mr. Norcross and the county organization played host to an appearance by former President Bill Clinton , who was campaigning for his wife .
Since then , however , Mr. Obama has won 10 consecutive primaries , and shaken loose the support of an assortment of prominent Democrats .
In addition to the two superdelegates , eight other South Jersey Democrats announced their endorsement of Mr. Obama on Wednesday , including Mr. Norcross ’s brother , George E. Norcross III , who is a former head of the Camden County Democrats and one of the party ’s most powerful political leaders .

Community Fabrication
Far McKon

In the 1970s , computers were still the foray of big business and government .
They were known to be powerful tools , but they were beyond the reach of individuals .
Though several other home computers came out in the early 70s , the MITS Altair 8800 is generally credited as sparking the home computer revolution , which in turn sparked computers everywhere .
The base of another revolution in fabrication powered by hobbyists will be revealed here .
The Fab@home , RepRap , and other projects will ( hopefully ) do the same thing for fabrication .
This talk will cover community based fabrication , why it 's so cool , and how it could fundamentally alter the global economy for the better .
A Convergence of Communities
John Strauchs

Most people in either industry already know something about the relatively recent convergence of computer technology ( CT ) and physical security .
But they probably are n’t aware that computer professionals are increasingly assuming a leadership role in the process , as well as the management of the process .
Moreover , the physical security and computer technology ( CT ) and information technology ( IT ) communities have traditionally been at odds .
Computer professionals do n’t know as much about physical security electronic systems and devices as they think they do .
Conversely , physical security senior managers know virtually nothing about CT and some do n’t want to !
This session will examine the convergence phenomenon from both perspectives .
It will review what is occurring , how it is happening , and what effects it has on both security and CT / IT .
The effects upon , and from , the Department of Homeland Security will be discussed .
The session will conclude with an in - depth analysis of Homeland Security ’s shortcomings and unmet needs and the role of CT / IT in protecting the nation .
The critical need to triage security resources will be examined , along with a look at how it should be done , as well as an attempt to understand why it is n’t already happening .

In May 2008 , a weakness in Debian was discovered which makes cryptographic keys predictable .
A Debian - specific patch to OpenSSL broke the pseudo - random number generator two years ago , which led to guessable SSL and SSH keys .
The vulnerability allows for impersonation of secure servers , as well as the potential to login to SSH secured systems .
Since many popular derivatives like Ubuntu and Xandros are affected , the weak keys are found all over the Internet .
The panel will present their approach to generating lists of weak keys using cloud computing and explain how they collected large numbers of SSL certificates of which several thousand are weak .

Virtualized technologies are being lapped up left , right , and center by corporates committed to the cash savings they promise .
Sadly , the savings that can be gleaned are not without the attendant risk .
Instead of nice normal networks that people can understand , many vendors are offering networks in a box .
As well as being lovely single points of failure , they have a number of risks that remain largely unexplored .
Research has already been conducted around platform virtualization technologies such as VMWare , but there still exists a fundamental flaw within virtualized resource technologies that no one seems to have spotted .
This talk will illustrate why and how virtualization works , what the difference is between what the vendors say and how it is being implemented in RL , and will discuss a theoretical vulnerability that if it can be exploited can bring down the house of cards .

A talk by Grand Theft Auto IV cowriter and coproducer Lazlow focusing on that phenomenal project as well as what ’s been going on in media in the last decade .
Beginning in 1996 , corporations began gobbling up every newspaper , billboard , radio and TV station in the United States .
Ironically , since then , readership and ratings have plummeted , resulting in entertainment executives and editors programming even more sensationalist and desperate content .
Lazlow discusses how parody of the media in video games , on TV , and online can often garner a larger audience reaction than the media establishment itself .
He will describe why the mainstream media invents crises , and the reaction by the media and Hollywood establishment to the growing popularity of interactive worlds where players are celebrities rather than smug starlets tittering for TMZ .
How can you hack the media ?
In this interactive talk Lazlow talks about his work in radio , video games , and the future of the media , democracy , and the role of comedy in it .

Last Fall , Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner commissioned Project EVEREST , a comprehensive security review of the electronic voting technology used in her state .
The project contracted several academic teams and others to examine the election procedures , equipment , and source code used in that state , with the aim of identifying any problems that might render elections vulnerable to tampering under operational conditions .
The ten - week project examined in detail the touch - screen , optical scan , and election management technology from e-voting vendors ES&S , Hart InterCivic , and Premier Election Systems ( formerly Diebold ) .
Penn led the analysis of the ES&S system source code , which is also used by voters in 42 other U.S. states besides Ohio .
This talk will outline the U .
Penn team 's findings , which included the discovery of exploitable security vulnerabilities in almost every hardware and software component of the ES&S touch - screen and optical scan systems .
Some of these flaws could allow a single malicious voter or poll worker to alter countywide election results , possibly without detection .
The team will discuss their findings and will also describe more generally the process of analyzing 700,000 lines of unfamiliar source code in less than ten weeks under highly constrained conditions .
The full 334 page report ( which also includes analysis of the Hart and Premier systems done at Penn State and WebWise Security ) can be downloaded from the Ohio Secretary of State 's web site at http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/info/EVEREST/14-AcademicFinalEVERESTReport.pdf
Hacking International Networks and System(s ) using VoIP
Da Beave , Jfalcon

There is an entire world of PSTNs out there that most people never bother to look into .
People have a tendency to call within their area ( country ) and never stray or " wander " outside .
This talk hopes to change that perception .
With VoIP , we have the ability to call worldwide for fractions of a penny .
Why not call that X.25 network in Russia ?
Or India ?
Why not explore foreign data networks and find new and old things still out there ?
Think war dialing in the U.S. is washed up ?
Why not try a country where computers and technology are built on the hardware we 've thrown out ?
In many parts of the world , phone networks and data networks are built using the existing PSTN infrastructure .
They simply can't afford to purchase modern SONET / DS hardware .
Nor can they afford to run fiber optics or coax to every neighborhood .
The legal ramifications in hacking such systems are significantly less than hacking U.S. computer networks .
The media is filled with reports of Chinese hackers infiltrating U.S. networks .
That being said , does n't it make sense to return the favor ?

With the global price of food rising dramatically around the world , the number of people at risk of starvation and malnutrition will also increase .
The United Nations Food Program announced earlier this year that it would not have enough money or food to meet its targets due to the cost of food .
In Egypt and other parts of the world , people have been rioting in the face of food shortages and sharp increases in prices .
In places like Thailand that are famous for exporting rice throughout the world , the government has announced cutbacks in exports because of shortages .
A grim picture , to say the least .
Yet while this crisis seems to be unfolding , another rise has come to pass - the return of urban and community farms .
How do these farms manage to exist , seemingly , outside the global game ?
Is their business model sustainable and is this truly a renaissance of growing and thinking locally ?
Through a series of podcast interviews and reports , the case is presented of how some farmers are hacking the price of food .

A presentation on the subject of corporate legal jurisdictions and related topics .
While this sounds boring on the surface , it 's actually not - and is more and more relevant every year for those in the tech game .
As physical human beings , we do in fact have a " home jurisdiction " in the legal sense , which is wherever we are living at present .
However , corporations are also " people " in the legal sense but have a flexibility of where they call home .
This ties into areas of international legal issues , corporate governance , privacy of company information , financial systems / banking , personal versus corporate liability , and so on .
Basically , for anyone from a coder who wants " a company " to bill his clients through , all the way up to major tech projects that span multiple jurisdictions in a sophisticated way , few of us who play the tech game are not directly impacted by the question of where a company lives , where it calls home .

This talk will discuss several different approaches to reverse engineering proprietary algorithms from hardware .
It will focus on our mostly automated approach to reconstructing functionality by using a combination of analyzing photos of chip structures and protocol analysis .
Using these techniques , the Mifare RFID tags were hacked , which caused quite a bit of public discussion about proprietary cryptography and " security by obscurity " .
The cryptography of the Mifare tags has several vulnerabilities including weaknesses in the random number generator and low resistance against brute force attacks .
Furthermore , statistical flaws of the cipher enable very practical key - recovering attacks .
This presentation will show the whole range of attacks as well as some general techniques to improve cryptographic protocols so they are more resistant .

Over the past nearly 20 years , the Internet has proved to be fertile ground for projects that raise awareness , question authority , and inspire social cohesion .
Culture jamming , hacking , and hacktivism have helped provoke changes in the technical , cultural , and political aspects of our society .
This panel aims to provide an overview of these techniques through examples of some of the more memorable projects .
Starting with the manipulation of voicemail services and leading up to denial of service attacks on government web servers , the panel will cover how these projects were organized and executed as well as the reaction that they inspired .
This 90 minute panel will also include a discussion section ( with audience participation encouraged ) where they will contemplate what use these techniques have in light of the quickly changing Internet and digital media landscapes .

IPv6 , the Next Generation Network Playground - How to Connect and Explore
Joe Klein

A replacement for IP v4 was first imagined after the 1990 report warning of IP address exhaustion was released .
It took another five years until the RFC for IPv6 was released and another year before it was implemented in an operating system ( BSD ) and a network ( 6BONE ) .
During that time RFCs meant to extend the useful life of IP v4 were killing the end - to - end connections .
This includes RFC 1518 - Classless Inter - Domain Routing ( CIDR ) , RFC 1631 - Network Address Translation ( NAT ) , and RFC 1918 - Address Allocation for Private Internets .
From that point on , many protocols required workarounds , patches , and hacks just to continue to communicate .
Worse yet , each change reduced the usefulness of firewall and increased the attack surface .
Now , 18 years later , we have the opportunity to test and explore this replacement for IPv4 .
This presentation will discuss the basics of IPv6 including features , benefits , and addressing .
There will also be a review of how to connect to the IP v6 network - even if your ISP is clueless .
Discussion will include a review of tools needed to test and explore IP v6 as well as a look at the most common IP v6 vulnerabilities .

The best way to describe this talk is to simply quote some of what we received from its presenter :
“ I'm Johnny .
I hack stuff .
I 've been at it for quite a while now , and I 've picked up a few tricks along the way .
I get asked about my tricks all the time , mostly by kids who saw that movie .
You know the one .
But I 've always said no .
I 've held onto my secrets as part of the pact I made with the hacker underground .
I mean , I 'm allowed to give talks and presentations about hacking stuff , but the secrets ... the real super - cool secrets I 've had to keep to myself .
The head of the underground said so .
But I got this email the other day that says I 'm THIS close to getting kicked out of the underground .
Seems the glare of the public eye has been on me for far too long and I 've become a liability .
So , I 'm going to be proactive .
I 'm going to quit before they can fire me ....

On January 1st , 2002 , Arjen tried to access the website of the Dutch national railway ( www.ns.nl) using Linux .
The site refused him access , saying it was IE - only .
This sparked a conversation with members of parliament about the need for open standards .
Over a five year period , he progressed from talking to opposition MPs to meeting the economics minister directly and was able to significantly influence national policy despite total lack of funding or any specific mandate .
As a result , the Dutch public sector will move to standardize on Open Documents Format and use open source where comparable functionality is available in all new procurements as of 2008 .
Use of ODF as a public sector document standard will be mandatory in 2009 .
This talk will tell the tale of why this was accomplished , how it was done , and how others can do it too in other countries around the world .
You ’ll learn how to get access to the powers - that - be , how to get non-technical people interested in the subject , and how to align your policy proposals with existing policies .
While some of the political reasons for wanting open standards and open source in government IT will be touched upon , the focus of the talk will be mainly on how to get results .

Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) is a practical and useful technology for locating items without the requisite close proximity as needed with older technology , such as bar codes .
However , new technologies such as RFID “ powder , ” internal and external pre-crime detectors , and insertion into children ’s clothing and other personal items have pros and cons associated with the practicality of its use .
In addition , RFID use in access control , identification documents , and banking cards , while convenient and illegal to jam , may lack important security features to prevent unauthorized scanning and usage of the data contained .
The REAL ID Act mandates using RFID in ID cards that most Americans should carry for domestic airline travel and must carry for international travel .
This discussion will examine current RFID technology and security concerns as well as how the RFID technology implemented in REAL ID Act cards and passports may pose privacy and security risks .

Prometheus Radio Project , based in West Philly , builds radio stations with farmworkers ’ unions , civil rights groups , neighborhood associations , and others who want to free the media from corporate control .
They have built radio stations in Guatemala , Kenya , Mexico , and Tanzania , as well as all over the United States .
In Greek mythology , Prometheus was the one who stole fire from the gods , who had been hoarding this powerful technology , and taught humanity to use it .
Representatives from Prometheus Radio will discuss their work building radio stations and fighting to change the laws so that more groups can have access to the airwaves .
In this talk , they will particularly focus on their practices in demystifying technology with groups that lack prior technical training .
Prometheus has built 11 stations in " radio barnraisings , " where over 200 volunteers converge to build a full operating radio station over a three day weekend , with most participants having never touched a soldering iron before in their lives .
While focusing on Prometheus ' experience with radio , this presentation can be helpful to any nerd who has tried to explain a technical subject to people who lacked technical knowledge or skills .
Are there things that geeks can do that can help normal people share our fascination with technology ?
It 's magical when someone who thinks they know nothing about a technology suddenly realizes that they understand it and can use it just as well as the rich and powerful can !
Prometheus will share the tricks of popular technical education they 've learned over the years .

Today we should consider ourselves lucky to be sitting in the front row for the birth of the robotics industry .
Nearly 40 years after the birth of the computing industry , our lives are merged with the Internet .
Similar to the 1970s computing industry , early robotic developments are complex and their practical applications are rare .
Less than 40 years from now , our bodies and minds will be merged with the robotics and technologies we are creating today .
In our lifetime , we will see software merged with robotics that mimic humans , surpass them , and proceed to yield creations of their own .
There will be no distinction between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality .
AI , robotics , and other emerging technologies will result in the Singularity ; a fundamental paradigm shift for human kind .
This presentation will dive into the Singularity , current and emerging robotics , and discuss where hackers fit into all this .
Various robotic platforms will be on display as well .

Anonymous is an anti-group which takes nothing too seriously and values free speech in the extreme .
The self - styled Anonymous ( used as a mass noun ) is a label and Internet meme adopted within Internet culture to represent the actions of Internet users acting anonymously toward a given agenda .
In this sense , Anonymous is " all of us , yet none of us . "
The term is used in phrases such as " We are Anonymous .
We do not forgive .
We do not forget . "
More recently , in 2008 specific actions were undertaken by specific group , groups , or organizations , also self - named as " Anonymous , " and often associated with websites and chat systems on the Internet .
The general public 's introduction to the group began with Project Chanology , a protest against the Church of Scientology .
The most visible element of the protest was mass protests of many Church sites worldwide , the first being held on February 10 , 2008 .
Anonymous , as a protest group , lacks a visible hierarchical structure or leaders , instead relying on individuals to contribute to the group on their own .

YouTomb ( youtomb.mit.edu ) scans sections of sites where popular videos pop up ( Digg , Technorati , YouTube , etc. ) and adds these videos to a database .
This growing database is continually re-scanned and all the metadata is logged .
When a video from the YouTomb database ( about a quarter million right now ) goes down , it is featured on the YouTomb website .
The future of YouTomb may include : tracking geographic blocking , caching the videos themselves , tools for bloggers and people embedding YouTube clips , a search function ( ! ) , and more .
YouTomb was born at Free Culture MIT .
This session will begin as a presentation , but should quickly become an interactive discussion .
The Zen of the Hacker

An inquiry into the conditions under which hacker culture thrives , the curiously American quality of hacker culture , and the evolving challenges for preservation of the hacker ecosystem .
Few observers believed that Obama genuinely intended to break new ground with his response — his campaign had never articulated any such policy before , and seemed ill - prepared to defend it on the spot .
The Clinton campaign dutifully pressed the attack the next day , calling Obama ’s statement “ irresponsible and frankly naive . ”
But then a funny thing happened .
Obama ’s team did not try to qualify ( or , in political parlance , “ clarify ” ) his remark , and no one said he misspoke .
Instead , the campaign fought back , with memos to reporters and with a speech by the candidate himself , aimed squarely at the sort of “ conventional wisdom ” that had , in the words of his then - foreign - policy adviser , Samantha Power , “ led us into the worst strategic blunder in the history of U.S. foreign policy . ”
It was only mid-summer , ages before the Iowa caucuses in campaign time , so it was a good moment to experiment .
And it worked : polling suggested that Americans were largely on board with Obama ’s position .
Soon , on the stump , he was regularly referring to his willingness to meet with foreign leaders , unlike other top presidential candidates .
This position really was a departure for Obama .
Despite his stand against the war in 2002 , he had since hewed closely to the party line on foreign affairs .
The only substantive thing he had to say about Iraq policy during his famous 2004 convention speech was : “ When we send our young men and women into harm ’s way , we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they are going ; to care for their families while they ’re gone ; to tend to the soldiers upon their return ; and to never , ever go to war without enough troops to win the war , secure the peace , and earn the respect of the world . ”
This merely echoed the bland competence - and - execution argument of mainstream party thinking .
And as Clinton ’s campaign has been at pains to point out , Obama ’s Senate voting record on Iraq - related issues is nearly identical to hers .
Before the YouTube debate , the higher Obama ’s political ambitions had reached , the more cautious his foreign policy had become .
If Obama had followed up his win in Iowa with a victory in New Hampshire , as once looked likely , and then wrapped up the nomination in February , the YouTube skirmish might have remained a curiosity , a small outlier in an otherwise conventional foreign - policy agenda .
A “ bring home the troops ” pitch would have created more than enough contrast with John McCain ’s foreign policy , and a strong focal point for debate .
With the entire electorate as an audience , it would have been in Obama ’s interest to minimize their other foreign - policy differences .
But “ bring home the troops ” offered no differentiation from Hillary Clinton , who had more or less successfully pivoted away from her earlier support of the war .
As the campaign stretched on and Clinton sharpened her attacks on Obama ’s commander - in - chief credentials , he began to counter by questioning her whole approach to foreign policy — the establishment approach .
Today , Obama calls not only for direct negotiations with leaders of rogue states , but also for an American commitment to eventual global nuclear disarmament ( in part to reinvigorate nonproliferation efforts ) ; a substantial rebalancing of American military priorities toward Afghanistan ( and away from Iraq ) ; a softening of the embargo on Cuba ; and a widening of the current , single - minded focus on democracy promotion to include other development goals that might more effectively prevent terrorist recruitment .
Many think that there ’s little difference between the Democrats on policy grounds .
That may once have been true , but over time — and largely in response to Clinton ’s barbs — Obama ’s foreign - policy approach has evolved into something substantially different from either Clinton ’s or McCain’s .
Click to viewWe may have liked the remake of Journey To The Center Of The Earth more than we expected , but here 's something we do n't like so much : 130 special effects artists who worked on the movie have been forced to take the producers to court - and worse yet , involve star Brendan Fraser - to try and get the $ 1 million they 're still owed for their work on the underground adventure flick .

The Montreal Gazette reports that around 130 special effects artists who worked on the movie have been owed payment since November of last year , when Meteor Studios - the producers of the film , who have since filed for bankruptcy - closed their effects studio upon completion of their work .
After months of unsuccessfully trying to get paid by Meteor 's parent companies , Evergreen Digital LLC and Discovery Trademark Holding Co. , the artists have resorted to the lawsuit and even more desperate measures :
Brendan Fraser , star of the 3D action film that has grossed more than $ 102 million U.S. worldwide to date , has even gone to bat for the former Meteor Studios Inc. workers by making personal calls to the shareholders of the local company , which filed for bankruptcy in March .

Meteor 's bankruptcy papers blamed the WGA strike as the main source of financial losses .
Both parent companies are n't commenting on the case :
" Discovery Communications held a passive non-controlling shareholder interest in Meteor Studios , an independent company incorporated under the Quebec Companies Act , " Katie Wolfgang , vice - president of international communications at Discovery , said in an email from her Maryland office yesterday .
" All matters related to the management of Meteor Studios , its employees and operations have been handled directly by Meteor Studios principals since the inception of the company . "
Evergreen spokesman John Hernandez was n't available for comment at the company 's Denver headquarters .

The study goes on to note that human exposure to oxybenzone “ has not been associated with adverse health effects ” and that sunscreen is an important tool to protect against sunburn and skin cancer .
But the researchers said further study was needed to determine whether the chemical had any meaningful effect on the body .
Image Credit ... Stuart Bradford
“ What ’s the meaning of it ? ” said Dr. Rigel , who has consulted for sunscreen makers .
“ Nobody ’s seen any problems from years of these agents being used .
To call it dangerous is misleading . ”
A few animal studies have raised concerns that oxybenzone could disrupt endocrine functions .
Several researchers say that this is a theoretical concern and that no such effect has been shown in humans .
Another study , published two years ago in Free Radical Biology and Medicine , raised troubling concerns about what happens when sunscreen is absorbed into the skin and reacts with the sun .
The report suggested that under certain conditions , sunscreens with oxybenzone and other ultraviolet filters could lead to free - radical damage to the skin , a process that in theory could lead to skin cancer .
The study used laboratory models of skin , so some researchers say it is not a reliable indicator of what happens in people .
But the authors noted that the damage occurred only when ultraviolet light reached sunscreen that had penetrated the skin .
The solution , they say , is to keep applying sunscreen to block out the UV rays .
“ It may seem counterintuitive , but by reapplying sunscreen we protect ourselves from the UV light reaching any of the UV - filters that may have penetrated to the skin , ” said Kerry M. Hanson , the lead author of the report and a senior research scientist at the University of California , Riverside .
“ At this point , I do n’t think there ’s enough evidence to firmly claim that sunscreens containing oxybenzone are unsafe . ”
Number 10 ’s new website , from our beloved government who are such strong users and supporters of Open Source Software [ NOT ] , is running on WordPress .
This is n’t actually big news now .
There ’s plenty of comment about that on the web via Google .
Well , that ’s OK I guess .
At last they are starting to grok OSS perhaps , although I ’m rather inclined to actually surmise that they [ # 10 ] do n’t even know what WordPress is .
They just bought a website …
Anyway , quite a nice site layout do n’t you think ?
I wonder who designed their site ?
Looking at the html source , we see that the stylesheets are in a directory called networker - 10 / and many of the images are in a subdirectory called images / .
Firstly , see the bit above where it says ?
Usually , in there , that line reads : where the X.X.X is the version of WordPress the site is running .
So they ’ve removed changed that then .
I wonder if they are trying to conceal the fact they are using WP ?
Not a very useful trick though is it ?
Having a directory tree called / wp - content / themes /... is a bit of a giveaway if you ask me .
Now then , if you visit Antbag.com and look at some of the themes they have created , there ’s one on there called “ Networker ” .
Here ’s the demo page http://antbag.com/demo/index.php?wptheme=NetWorker
Let ’s look at the top few lines of the html source for this theme :
They look quite similar do n’t they ?
The directory structure is identical and the top - level theme directory is called networker - 10 .
Amazing …
The Networker theme is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike 3.0 License .
Which you can read all about here : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
I can only assume that Number 10 have requested , and received , permission of the author to remove all traces of this license and attribution from their WordPress site .
I have left a “ contact us message ” at the author ’s website to see if this is the case …
[ Update ] Anthony Baggett , the theme ’s author , has just confirmed that No 10 have not requested that the attribution be removed .
That ’s not playing fair by my book .
[ Update 2 ]
Seems like I am not the only one to have noticed this .
A bit more digging has thrown up the following sites also commenting on # 10 ’s cock - up .
One is also suggesting it cost Â£ 100k .
Not bad for a ripped off theme running on an Open Source blogging engine …

( CNN ) --
An evangelical preacher killed his wife several years ago and stuffed her body in a freezer after she caught him abusing their daughter , according to police and court documents .
Anthony Hopkins appeared in court Thursday to face murder , rape and incest charges .
Anthony Hopkins , 37 , was arrested Monday night at the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ in Jackson , Alabama , just after he had delivered a sermon to a congregation that included his seven other children , officials said .
He faces charges including murder , rape , sodomy , sexual abuse and incest .
Hopkins was denied bail Thursday when he appeared before Mobile County District Judge George Hardesty .
The case is set for arraignment next week , Hardesty 's clerk said .
The case began Monday , when the daughter , now 19 , went to the Mobile Police Department 's Child Advocacy Center and reported that she had been sexually abused by Hopkins since she was 11 years old , according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant of the preacher 's home in Mobile .
The affidavit related the daughter 's story as follows :
Her mother , Arletha Hopkins , 36 , caught her father abusing her in a bathroom in November 2004 .
Afterward , her parents argued , and her mother locked her father out of the house .
The father came to the daughter 's window and asked her to let him in , and she did so .
The next morning , her father asked her to help him hide her mother 's body in the freezer in the laundry room of the home .
The girl said she moved out of the home about two weeks ago and was living with a neighbor .
She told police that her mother 's body was still in the freezer .
When authorities went to the home , no one was there , as Hopkins and the other children were at the church .
A body was found in the freezer , the affidavit says .
Although police think the body is that of Arletha Hopkins , an identification is not expected until early next week , Mobile Police spokesman Officer Eric Gallichant said Thursday .
Watch Nancy Grace 's report »
Mobile Police Chief Phillip Garrett had said that an identification and autopsy results would take a few days : " obviously , the body was in a freezer . "
He said he was not sure of the body 's condition or whether it was intact , as upon seeing the body , authorities immediately sealed the chest - type freezer .
The body had been covered in the unit , he said , and the entire appliance was taken to the state Department of Forensic Science .
At the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ , Hopkins was preaching at a revival , pastor Beverly Jackson told CNN affiliate WKRG .
His message , she said , was about forgiveness and not passing judgment -- and at one point , he turned to his seven children and asked them to forgive him his past , present and future .
Police allowed Hopkins to finish his sermon before arresting him , Jackson said .
She said she asked police why they were arresting him and was told , " he murdered his wife . "
She said Hopkins had told her his wife died four years ago while giving birth to their youngest son .
Attempts to reach Jackson on Thursday were unsuccessful .
Authorities moved quickly on the daughter 's accusations to make sure the children still in the household were OK , Garrett said .
They were placed in the custody of child welfare authorities .
The next - oldest child is a 17 - year - old female , he said .
All eight were the children of Arletha Hopkins , and Anthony Hopkins fathered six of them , he said .
An investigation has not found any record of Arletha Hopkins ' existence since 2004 , according to the affidavit .
Asked how long police think the body had been in the freezer , Garrett said , " I 'm thinking that she 's probably been there for a number of years . "
He said Anthony Hopkins did not have a regular church but apparently preached in various areas around the South .
" Part of the mystery here is that , apparently , none of these children were in school " but were being home - schooled , Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson said .
" Home schooling , under this situation , removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe . "
Pastor Jerry Porter said he used to preach with Hopkins at his church , the Williams Street Holiness Church , and knew the family .
Arletha Hopkins " was very quiet , " he told Mobile television station and CNN affiliate WPMI .
" She was kind of secluded .
She 'd talk , but not much . "
Anthony Hopkins , he said , made statements that led him to believe all was not well at home .
" He always used to tell me ... ' You 're blessed in the fact that you have a wife that supports you and what you 're trying to do for God , ' " Porter said .
He said Arletha Hopkins disappeared shortly after the couple 's youngest child was born .
As rumors swirled , Porter said , he confronted Hopkins and asked whether his wife was dead .
Hopkins " would n't give me an answer , " he said .
After that , Porter said , he banned him from the church but remained on good terms with him .
He said he visited the family a few years ago , and their home was clean and well - kept .
" It was the ideal family .
I mean , the children were so respectful , just so easygoing , " Porter said .
" Did n't seem to be no stress at all .
Never got that impression , never . "
The children , he said , " loved their dad .
They were very close to him . "
Of Hopkins ' preaching ability , Porter said , " he was a bulls - eye prophet .
If he told you something , you could pretty much bank on it . "

j Query UI v1.5 Released , Focus on Consistent API and Effects
Posted on by
We recently discovered an issue with the download builder which caused it to serve cached 1.5r c1 files instead of the final package .
We sincerely apologize for the inconvienience caused by this and strongly suggest to download jQuery UI 1.5 again if you downloaded it as a configured package .
Additionally , an issue has been found in ThemeRoller that causes the downloaded images to be default images in most cases .
The issue was fixed now , and we also suggest you to try out downloading your theme again .
j Query UI 1.5 : Rethinking Our Approach to UI
When we first started with the UI project , we set out to build a generic , basic , and simple way of adding and extending core interaction to DOM elements .
However , we soon found that our approach was n’t working for UI .
Using the “ simple ” approach , we were only able to serve simple interaction modules , but not full featured UI widgets .
The second problem was that some plugins came from external sources making the UI suite seem disjointed and inconsistent .
All of this occurred right after we released 1.0 and we immediately realized it was time to reconsider our path .
We had to find a approach that kept the simplicity of jQuery while making it possible to add full featured widgets to UI .
We also already knew that something very simple to use is very challenging to develop .
The first task was to build a generic API that allowed for maximum flexibility while being amazingly simple .
The next task was making it similarly simple to develop plugins for that API .
One API to Rule Them All
What we came up with , was an API that removed 95 % of our exposed methods , and kept only one single overloaded method per plugin .
For example :
$ ( “ div ” ) .draggable ( ) creates a draggable
$ ( “ div ” ) .draggable ( “ destroy ” ) destroys it
$ ( “ div ” ) .draggable ( “ method ” ) calls another method on the plugin .
The new API also makes all callbacks behave similarly , exposes the default options for each plugin and intelligently cleans up plugins using remove ( ) .
We also made it possible to update plugin options on the fly , and added smaller updates that make UI feel like one suite .
In order to make this happen , we removed the jquery.dimensions.js ( which can now be found in jQuery core ) , the ui.mouse.js and the *.ext. js dependancies , introduced a ui.core.js ( which includes many useful helpers ) and created the jQuery UI widget factory which makes creating a new plugin for UI amazingly simple while making it very difficult to break the API .
Stability , Debugging , Testing and jquery .
simulate
It was extremely important that jQuery UI v1.5 was not only feature - rich but also stable .
We took several steps to greatly improve our debugging and testing including the setup of our own dedicated bugtracker with jQuery UI specific version and milestone targeting .
We also invested a lot of time into new unit tests that make use of the jQuery test suite Qunit .
Finally , we created jquery .simulate.js , a plugin specifically designed to fire true browser events .
This means , you can actually tell the plugin to pick up your draggable , move it to a certain position and release it again , just if you ’d be talking to a real testing person .
The Need for Effects : Enter Enchant
One of the great things in being able to take a step back is that it offers a totally different perspective on what a full - featured UI solution should offer .
While jQuery UI v1.0 was currently offering a nice suite of UI controls , users were in need of solid effects like those offered in libraries such as script.aculo.us and jQuery UI ’s former inspiration , Interface .
Unfortunately , Interface was no longer being updated which left a bit of a hole in terms of effects ; hence a new project called “ Enchant ” was born .
Originally planned to be released as a complementary library to jQuery and jQuery UI , we realized that it made perfect sense to merge Enchant with jQuery UI allowing users easy access to advanced effects and UI controls from one solution .
We ’re proud to announce that Enchant is now a part of jQuery UI and jQuery users now have a unified solution for their effects and UI needs .
The jQuery UI effects can be used standalone or together with UI and have a separate core which extends the jQuery core to introduce advanced easing , class transitions ( morphing ) and color animations .
All effects are tightly integrated into the main API and can be used as standalone ( $ (..) .effect ( ) ) or directly from within jQuery methods you already know ( hide ( ) / show ( ) ) .
Overall , we already have more than 15 ready - to - use effects for you to use in your projects , not only those provided by script.aculo.us ( blind , bounce , drop , fold , slide … ) , but also fresh , new effects ( transfer , explode .
clip , scale ) that make jQuery UI a great library enhancing your applications !
As promised in one of the last blog posts , it comes with a complete documentation and a combined demo page to let you see them in action .
Roll Your Own Themes : ThemeRoller !
One of the first things that a user typically wants to do when using new UI controls is “ skin ” them to match their site ’s color schemes .
Obviously , when you have UI controls from varying sources , the ability to provide a consistent “ theme ” across all controls becomes much more difficult since most component authors have their own method of skinning their controls .
We took a serious look at this and made it a priority to have a consistent default theme that users could use as a template for customizing jQuery UI ’s set of widgets .
We reached out to Boston - based Filament Group for some help in this and they were all for it .
Being very invested in jQuery , they saw this as a great opportunity to further help the project .
Well , what went from an discussion outlining a single default theme quickly blossomed into jQuery UI ’s killer app ; ThemeRoller .
ThemeRoller offers a unique approach to theming UI components specifically built for jQuery UI .
With ThemeRoller , you can create your very own theme for your project within minutes .
It ’s completely intuitive , comes wich rich controls to change the color and design of each state , and then previews your theme with the actual UI components as you work !
You now have literally millions of combinations to chose from .
Any theme you create can be reached by copying the URL at any point in your progress ; and after you ’ve played with it enough , you can click the download button and a ZIP package is generated with the css file , the images and a demo page .
In addition , ThemeRoller also includes a theme gallery to browse for downloads and inspiration .
Creating a theme for your application does n’t get any easier than this ; it ’s simply that amazing .
We really want to extend our deepest gratitude to the amazingly talented folks at the Filament Group for creating this amazing application .
Oh and by the way , you can also reach ThemeRoller by direct URL at : ThemeRoller.com .
If you want to know more about this great app and how it ’s done , visit the excellent blog writeup by Filament Group !
Plugin Stabilization and Enhancements
The biggest improvements and changes were done on individual plugin code .
Almost every plugin has been completely rewritten from scratch to optimize stability and performance and every plugin now comes with a bug changelog .
We also focused heavily on enhancing options and increasing flexibility ( e.g. connecting sortables to draggables ) to allow our plugins to be used in almost every environment .
The best way to get a full feel for every enhancement to jQuery UI ’s components is to review the changelog .
It ’s fairly extensive and gives an indication of the incredible effort put in by the UI team .
In the near future , we ’ll be creating postings and articles which outline the newest features of UI ’s components .
In the meantime , we suggest you read our blog post about jQuery UI 1.5b , which explains many of the mouse interaction changes ( sortables , draggables , slider ) , and dig through the documentation and the changelog yourself .
Downloading
j Query UI v1.5 :
Final Release : http://ui.jquery.com/download
You can also checkout the full release of jQuery UI v1.5 from the Subversion repository .
There ’s more to come !
This has truly been an amazing effort and we ’re very proud to be able to offer a comprehensive UI solution to the jQuery community .
We ’re already planning the next release and have a huge roadmap that contains plugins like grid , tooltips , menus , colorpickers , autocompletes and much more .
Many of them are already done and commited code - wise .
We ’ve also planned plugins using new technologies like Webkit ’s css transforms ( see the recent coverflow plugin ) , so stay tuned .
None of this would ’ve been possible if not for the amazing efforts and dedication the jQuery UI team .
They ’ve dedicated so much of their personal and professional time to create this amazing library and they deserve so much credit for their hard work .
We also want to thank the jQuery core team , with whom we worked closely together to integrate many needed features into the jQuery core itself .
Last but certainly not least , we want to give a VERY special thanks the Liferay staff , who invested countless hours into the development of the new UI website , and with whom we worked closely together to stabilize jQuery UI for all kinds of enterprise situations .
Thank you for all of your support ,
Paul Bakaus & the jQuery UI Team

Existentialist Cowboy | June 30 , 2008
Calling a Republican a liar is redundant .
It ’s known by definition .
As Will Rogers said of a New Deal plan to ‘ teach hogs birth control ’ , it ’s become a habit with them .
McCain ’s pathology is different .
He ’s thin - skinned , hot - tempered and out of control .
McCain cannot be trusted with nukes .
In an infantile temper - tantrum , McCain can be trusted to inflame the world at the end of a macho show of penis power !
McCain ca n’t get his stories straight .
He is quoted on Huffington as favoring letting Wall Street enrich itself with the moneie ’s that you pay into Social Security .
Without privitization , I do n’t see how you can possibly , over time , make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits .
But for another audience , he told a completely different story :
I ’m not for , quote , privatize Social Security .
I never have been .
I never will be .
– Huffington Post
His careless remarks of political expedience with regard to Social Security reveal him to be a typical ‘ authoritarian ’ conservative –a psychopath , utterly without empathy , a Republican , in other words .
He does n’t really care about how the government misappropriates monies paid into SS or whether or not that money will be there when you are ready to retire .
He will have enriched his cronies in the meantime at your expense .
That ’s what ‘ privatization ’ is all about .
Among his biggest whoppers are those he told about Iraq :
The picture “ straight talk ” John McCain has been painting of Iraq is one of success and harmony .
A place where westerners can walk the streets safely and the commander of the Multinational Force in Iraq can travel around in an unarmed Humvee .
Sounds like “ Mission Accomplished ” , right ?
The only problem with that scenario is that John McCain ’s claims about Iraq are completely false .
The Republican Senator from Arizona who wants to be President in 2008 is carrying such a large load of lies that one has to be surprised that the wheels on the “ Strait Talk Express ” have not blown out as a consequence .
It started on Monday when McCain claimed to radio host Bill Bennett “ There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods , today , ”
The lie continued on Tuesday when McCain spewed out on CNN that “ General Petraeus goes out there almost every day in an unarmed Humvee . ”
McCain then claimed that those who said it was unsafe for Americans to leave the heavily fortified “ Green Zone ” were “ giving the old line of three months ago . ”
— McCain Lies To Media , Calls Media “ Jerks ” After Lies Are Exposed
McCain reminds one of Nixon who always liked to portray himself has having been abused by the mean ol ’ media .
I have news for McCain and address the following observation to him personally : no one asked you to get into politics , John , unless , of course , it was a lobby group who wanted to own you !
No one owes you !
No one is obligated to you in any way .
No one I know has a reason not to call you a lyin ’ asshole .
There are , in fact , so many instances in which the shoe fits .
Wear it , John .
It fits you whether you like it or not !
You earned it and paid for with bullshit .
During an interview yesterday , Fox News ’s Carl Cameron asked Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) if it was a “ mistake ” for McCain to say he knows little about the economy .
But McCain denied that he had made any such suggestion , arguing that his past comments were taken “ out of context ” :
CAMERON : Realistically , was it a mistake for you to suggest that overall your attentiveness to the economy is subordinated by national security ?
MCCAIN : As briefly as possible , when you ’re on the back of the bus for hours with the media if they want to take a phrase out of context thats fine , thats one of the penalties you pay .
Watch it ( beginning at 1:52 ) : Aside from the fact that when viewed at face value , his comments speak for themselves , McCain has said he knows little about the economy on numerous occasions , as recently as last December :
– Seeking to explain his shift to the left on economic issues , McCain claimed : “ I did n’t pay nearly the attention to those issues in the past .
I was probably a ’ supply - sider ’ based on the fact that I really did n’t jump into the issue . ” [ Jan. 2000 ]
– “ I ’m going to be honest : I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues .
I still need to be educated . ” [ Nov. 2005 ]
– “ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should , ” but “ I ’ve got Greenspan ’s book . ” [ Dec. 2007 ]
In fact , McCain ’s interview with Cameron was n’t the first time he has denied claiming his economic knowledge is sub-par .
NBC ’s Tim Russert asked him about his “ I still need to be educated ” on economics claim last January but McCain dodged , saying “ I do n’t know where you got that quote . ”
When Russert asked McCain about the same quote three days later , McCain acknowledged he said it , but never claimed he was taken out of context .
McCain simply replied , “ Am I , am I smart on economics ?
Yes . ”
— McCain Claims Lack Of Economics Knowledge Comments Were Taken ‘ Out Of Context ’
Taken “ out of context ? ”
How many times can McCain be taken out of context ?
His lies have become the ‘ context ’ within which he operates .
He is delusional .
No one ever called McCain an intellectual .
Nevertheless , McCain must feel obliged to subscribe to GOP orthodoxy –‘ supply side economics ’ .
The GOP and thus GOP Presidential aspirants are always in need of any ideology that will justify the state theft of your money via unfair taxation , most prominently tax cuts benefiting only about ten percent of the population or even less .
‘ Supply - side ’ economics is like a vampire .
It shows up on the GOP dark side whenever a gopper is desperate to justify transferring your money to rich folk .
Supply - side economics , otherwise known as ‘ trickle down theory ’ , is awaiting someone with a sharp wooden stake who will drive it deep into the very heart of Republican orthodoxy .
Thus far , I am reminded of the lyrics from “ Hotel California ” by the Eagles : “ They stab it with their steely knives , but they just ca n’t kill the beast ! ”
John McCain is a recent convert to supply - side economics and still working on getting the talking points down .
Speaking yesterday in South Carolina , the straight talker :
proclaimed himself a believer in the notion that cutting taxes increases revenue for the government by spurring economic growth .
“ Do n’t listen to this siren song about cutting taxes , ” Mr. McCain told supporters gathered here under a tent in a driving rain .
“ Every time in history we have raised taxes it has cut revenues . ”
What ?
Every time ?
Okay , how about we go back and look at the last time taxes were raised — 1993 .
It ’s true that conservatives predicted revenue would fall as a result of the tax hike .
( Typical quote : “ Higher taxes will shrink the tax base and reduce tax revenues ” — Newt Gingrich . )
But it did n’t exactly work out that way …
The amazing thing is that New York Times , which printed McCain ’s quote , made no effort whatsoever to ascertain the truth of his point .
Just the typical , “ McCain says earth is flat , and meanwhile in other news … ” stuff .
I realize that campaign reporting is hard , and reporters do n’t usually have time to check on the truth of candidate ’s statements .
( And yes , this is a huge flaw with reporting , but that ’s another story . )
But this claim is so obviously false it could have been refuted after maybe thirty seconds of research .
Did n’t the author ( Michael Cooper ) realize that tax hikes do n’t always , or even usually , lead to reduced revenue ?
Does he remember the 1990s ?
Is he aware that the federal government raised taxes and started collecting dramatically higher revenues during World War II ?
( Taxes were raised and revenues quintipled . )
— The New Republic
The typical GOPPER will believe that tax cuts raise revenue because it makes them ‘ feel better ’ about themselves , phrase heard from the floor of the 1992 GOP National Convention in Houston , TX .
Of course , it ’s not true .
The opposite almost always happens ; that misses the point .
The point is not that ideology is believed because it ’s true .
It almost always is n’t .
Ideology is but a toll for GOPPERS .
They ‘ believe ’ it and spread it because : 1 ) it gives the elite base the cover it needs to escape taxation ; 2 ) it makes crooks and liars feel better about being crooks and liars ; 3 ) it enriches the elite one percent with pretensions of ‘ intellectualism ’ in a party that , in general , disdains the intellectual but is in need of one to quote during a debate !
Faux ‘ intellectuals ’ thus slanting , compromising their work for political ends are called ‘ party whores ! ’
You will find lots of them throughout the media .
Tax revenues will rise over time anyway due to inflation and economic growth .
There is no guarantee , of course , that ‘ economic growth ’ is , or ever has been , egalitarian .
Certainly , when policy favors the nation ’s elite , the elite alone will benefit .
That ’s tautological by design .
The record proves that the transfer of wealth and income upward began with the infamous tax cut of Ronald Reagan in 1982 .
It continues to this day , made worse , aggravated by Bush ’s bone - headed ‘ Presidency ’ .

The authors show variance ratios of 1.11 to 1.21 , I take a VR of 1.16 .
If we set the female variance to 1 this implies the standard deviation for female ability is 1 and for male ability 1.077 .
Using an online calculator for the Normal distribution you can find that given their standard deviation .0102 % of males have ability of 4 or greater ( 4 female sds ) but given their sd only .0032 % of females can be expected to have the same level of ability , thus a gender ratio of 3.18 .
Note that we are assuming that mathematical ability is normally distributed – we know the data fit this distribution around the mean but we do n’t know much about what happens at the very top .
SHANGHAI 
Ten central government departments , including the powerful Ministry of Finance , “ misused or embezzled ” more than $ 660 million last year , according to the latest report from China ’s top auditor .
The report , part of a long - running crackdown on government fraud , said 88 people had been arrested , 14 officials had been referred for prosecution and an additional 104 government employees had been punished for their roles in mismanaging or embezzling government funds , state media reported Thursday .
Liu Jiayi , the nation ’s top auditor , said in the report that a further $ 6 billion in government funds had been “ mismanaged ” last year , and that fraud had been detected in dozens of government bureaus , including the Ministry of Education , the National Bureau of Statistics , the Ministry of Health , the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television .
Even the State Administration of Taxation was accused of fraud .
Since 1999 , rolling audits of various government departments , agencies and government - owned companies , dubbed the “ audit storm , ” have resulted in the discovery of billions of dollars worth of fraud and mismanagement in everything from state - owned banks to the country ’s social security fund .
John wrote this in March of 2007 :
If you or I knowingly funneled $ 1.7 million to one of the worst , and best known , terrorist organizations in the world , we ’d be sent to Guantanamo permanently .
But when it ’s the senior management of Chiquita Banana , the Bush administration gives them a fine .
It probably also helps that one of those senior managers is a major fundraiser for the GOP — and John McCain .
So , while John McCain is in Colombia today ( with Joe Lieberman ) to burnish his foreign policy cred , maybe he can take a minute to explain why one of his top supporters was funding a terror group in that country .
Now , we all know that the traditional media types would never ask John McCain hard questions about a subject like this .
They might not get the cool seats on the new plane .
But , Huffington Post ’s Nico Pitney will :
It ’s a good thing Osama was n’t walking through SoHo yesterday morning .
Two sets of confidential blueprints for the planned Freedom Tower , which is set to rise at Ground Zero , were carelessly dumped in a city garbage can on the corner of West Houston and Sullivan streets , The Post has learned .
PHOTOS : WTC Blueprints Found In Trash
Port Authority ’s News Blackout Is Sinister
Experts said the detailed , floor - by - floor schematics contain enough detail for terrorists to plot a devastating attack .
“ Secure Document – Confidential , ” warns the title page on each of the two copies of the 150 - page schematic that a homeless , recovering drug addict discovered in the public trash can .
“ Any time a sensitive document is unintentionally left behind , it ’s a treasure trove for a potential adversary , ” aid Robert Strang , CEO of Investigative Management Group , a global security firm .
“ It enables them to look for vulnerabilities in design that they can target – an age - old military tactic . ”
Informed of what the homeless man , Mike Fleming , had found , shocked Port Authority officials called it an egregious security lapse .
“ Violating these protocols is cause for serious disciplinary action – up to termination for employees and breach of contract and legal action for contractors , ” said Candace McAdams , PA director of media relations .
One of the identical sets was missing the first 14 pages , which is particularly alarming .
Besides the PA , there are 11 entities listed on each page of the blueprints , including the builder , Tishman Construction , and architects Skidmore Owings and Merrill .
Although the documents , dated Oct. 5 , 2007 , are not a complete set of blueprints , they do contain details such as plans for each floor , the thickness of the concrete - core wall and the location of air ducts , elevators , electrical systems and support columns .
“ Certainly , if you know the thickness of concrete , someone with an explosive background can develop and plot an attack , ” Strang said .
That was exactly the thought that ran through Fleming ’s mind when he found the documents and alerted The Post .
Fleming , 28 , originally from Ohio , said he was rummaging through the garbage in search of cardboard , “ because the concrete is so cold to sleep on , ” when he noticed the documents and the warning to “ properly destroy if discarded . ”
“ They were right on top , and the garbage truck came along 10 minutes later , ” he said .
“ I was outraged , because this is priceless and it could gets into the wrong hands .
“ I am an honest guy .
This could have ended up on eBay or gotten to al Qaeda . ”
The schematics were distributed to PA officials , architects and contractors , and the state ’s inspector general will be investigating who improperly disposed of the sensitive materials , which the agency had no intention of making public , McAdams said .
“ We do n’t tolerate carelessness and stupidity , which is why we have these strict protocols in place , ” she said .
According to McAdams , the plans are several versions old , “ not very detailed ” bidding documents that are given to anyone bidding on contracts .
But Steve Yang , an architect who reviewed the schematics for The Post , said that even though they do not contain every detail , it would be easy to fill in the blanks .
“ An expert in explosives , demolition or biological weapons certainly could glean enough here to develop a game plan , ” he said .
“ You can see where all the concrete walls are , where the emergency stairwells are , and the electrical and HVAC systems . ”
The air - intake and ventilation systems in most modern office buildings would make it extremely difficult to cause widespread damage with a gas or anthrax attack , thanks to the filtration systems , a security source said .
Security sources say that such breaches tend to be inside jobs and that the garbage - can drop might have been intentional .
“ The insider threat is always a corporation ’s biggest threat , and a terrorist adversary will try to locate disgruntled employees , ” a security - industry source said .
Relatives of 9/11 victims say that lapses in security over Ground Zero have ceased to be surprising .
“ I ’d certainly be pretty leery going to work in the building knowing that security on the plans was so lax that even a vagabond could find them , ” said Bill Doyle , whose son , Joseph , was killed in the Twin Towers .
“ The whole thing is kind of frightening , but at the same time totally expected , because we have been failed time and again . ”
As shocking as such dangerous lapses in security are , experts contend that they are bound to happen again .
“ Outrageous security breeches like this amplify how vulnerable New Yorkers are , ” said Nicholas Casale , former head of security for the MTA .

Jennifer Hudson Wardrobe Malfunction Photos
graced the BET Awards red carpet earlier this week at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles .
Her shimmery copper tube dress might be considered a fashion miss by some but the real issue is the fact that her cleavage seems to be oozing out of her garment .
Hudson , 26 , first gained fame as a finalist on season three of American Idol .
She went on to star as Effie White in the movie Dreamgirls , where she won an Academy Award , Golden Globe , SAG Award and BAFTA Award .
The talented singer is not the first to suffer a wardrobe malfunction of this type .
Paris Hilton and Fergie have both fallen victim to the dreaded syndrome .
Victoria Beckham 's malfunction is nearly a mirror image of Hudson's .

Jimmy Carter was cheered when he visited Newcastle with Jim Callaghan .
Bill Clinton was lauded in Northern Ireland .
But it is more usual , at least with more consequential holders of the office , for American presidents to be told by European demonstrators to go home .
The postwar history of our continent would be different and less benign if the United States had heeded that message .
His office , and the system of collective security from which we benefit , would be justification enough to welcome President Bush 's visit to London this week .
But there is an additional reason peculiar to the Bush presidency .
For all Bush 's verbal infelicity , diplomatic brusqueness , negligence in planning for post - Saddam Iraq , and insouciance regarding standards of due process when prosecuting the war on terror , the world is a safer place for the influence he has exercised .
When Bush ran for president in 2000 he was an isolationist advocate of scaling back America 's overseas commitments .
But after 9/11 , he was right in not interpreting the attack as confirmation that America was stirring up trouble for itself .
The theocratic barbarism responsible for the attack on the Twin Towers was driven not by what America and its allies had done , but by what we represented .
In the words of Osama bin Laden , illegitimately appropriating for himself the mantel of Islam , " every Muslim , the minute he can start differentiating , carries hate toward Americans , Jew , and Christians " .
The most fundamental decision in western security policy in the past seven years has not been the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
It has been the recognition that the most voluble adversaries of western society are not merely a criminal subculture , and still less an incipient liberation movement .
Rather , they are a reactionary , millenarian and atavistic force with whom accommodation is impossible as well as intensely undesirable .
The grand strategy pursued by the US under Bush has overestimated the plasticity of the international order , but it has got one big thing right .
There is an integral connection between the terrorism that targets western societies and the autocratic states in which Islamist fanaticism is incubated .
Bush is culpable for much that went wrong after the overthrow of Saddam , but the outlook for Iraq has changed fundamentally owing to his decision to appoint General David Petraeus and pursue a confrontational strategy with al - Qaida in Iraq .
Bush was wrong , in his 2002 state of the union speech , to speak of an " axis of evil " connecting Saddam , Iran and North Korea – not because he overstated these actors ' malevolence but because they were not a homogeneous threat .
Two of them remain potent and unresolved problems .
But little can be accomplished in restraining North Korea 's bellicosity without the active support of China , and at least the Iranian regime has faced a united international front in constraining its nuclear ambitions .
Whoever succeeds
Bush as president will benefit from some decisions well conceived if often badly executed .
So will America 's allies .
Dog 's Death Dogs Traffic Cop
Officer faces heat after ignoring motorist 's pleas about dog dying in car .
Aug. 17 , 2008  -- A San Marcos ,
Texas , police officer has been accused of inappropriate behavior during a traffic stop which may have lead to a dog 's death .
Officer Paul Stephens spotted driver Michael Gonzalez speeding down Interstate 35 and pulled him over for clocking 100 miles per hour .
After a brief pursuit , Gonzalez pulled alongside the highway and emerged from his car , saying , " He 's dying . "
Tune into " GMA " Monday , Aug. 18 to catch an interview with Michael Gonzalez .
" Who 's dying ?
Relax , " Stephens said as his cruiser 's dashboard camera captured the interaction .
" My dog , " Gonzalez said during the Aug. 5 traffic stop .
Gonzalez and his girlfriend said they were speeding because they were rushing their choking teacup poodle Missy to an emergency veterinary clinic for treatment .
But on the video , Stephens sounded less than empathetic as he berated the driver for putting others ' lives at risk as he sped down the highway .
" You 're driving down the highway at 100 per hour , " he said sternly .
" It 's a dog , it 's OK .
You can get another one .
Relax . "
For 15 minutes , Stephens kept Gonzalez on the roadside .
" He said , ' You need to chill out .
It 's just a dog . '
And I said , ' It 's not just a dog ; it 's my family , ' " Gonzalez said .
Missy died as Gonzalez waited for the Stephens to issue a citation .
Though Stephens ' supervisors found him not guilty of misconduct , they did agree he handled the situation poorly .
" His world was collapsing .
And what the officer says to him , basically , is , ' I do n't care , ' " said San Marcos police department chief Howard Williams .

There ’s a lot of fluff floating around in the personal development blog - o - sphere .
I think there are certain things that people tend to shy away from writing about when it comes to personal development .
Here ’s 10 of what I believe are the most uncommon things you ’ll never learn from a personal development blog , but should .
1 . There is is no personal development ceiling
There will never be a time in your personal growth where you can say “ okay , I ’m done . ”
You ca n’t grow so much that you will ever reach a ceiling .
The beauty of personal development is that you ’ll find whenever you grow , achieve goals or find more personal freedom , your context changes .
The more you grow , the more your life will take on an upward spiral of personal growth .
The more things get better , the more you realize what you thought was a 10 was really a 7 .
A lot of people tend to think if you “ fix ” certain parts of your life , you ’ll reach some kind of ever - lasting contentment .
True growth , however , is n’t linear .
2 . Re-framing just does n’t always work
A lot of personal development blogs will give you advice on how to be more happy .
They ’ll also try to tell you how to re-frame negative situations and see the positive side of it .
This is n’t necessarily a bad thing , for every negative there is obviously a positive .
It ’s just the way the universe works .
But sometimes negative situations just plain suck .
If I got hit by a car , I ’m not going to be thinking about how I can re-frame this experience .
I ’m probably going to be more concerned with whether or not I ’ll be able to walk again .
3 . Acceptance is more important than happiness
Many people when pursuing personal development go on a happiness mono - diet .
They want to be happy all the time and will do whatever it takes to make this happen .
They have a realization that their life sucked because they were focusing only on the negative parts of their life .
While this is a huge breakthrough for most people , many people do n’t really “ get it . ”
They go from one extreme to the other ; instead of embracing both equally important sides of life ( the good and the bad ) and learning from them , they become Mary Poppins delusional .
Denying your negative feelings is n’t the path to greater happiness .
Ignoring all the shitty parts of your life wo n’t make them go away .
As important as it is to appreciate the positive , we have to acknowledge and accept the negative .
After all , if white wins over black , all we have left is empty space .
4 . The outside is just as important as the inside
Ninety five percent of all personal development blogs will tell you in order to change your life , you need to change the inside .
You need to change your beliefs and agreements that you have with yourself .
Drop dis-empowering contexts and embrace empowering ones .
Makes sense right ?
When learning this new - fangled concept people can get pretty crazy .
They ’ve been searching for happiness from the outside in and this seems to be pretty enlightening .
They ’ve been looking for fancy products , an exciting job , new cars , and Armani shades to make them happy .
They ’ve realized that no matter how much of these things they acquire , their drug like bliss is fleeting at best .
So we wisely start searching for happiness within .
But internal happiness will not make you fall in love with a dead end job you hate , it will not make you “ come to terms ” with your abusive relationship and it will not put food on your table .
Just as we go from focusing on the negative to solely on the positive , we become extremists on the other side of the fence .
In truth , there is no competition .
Integrated and learning from the positive and negative are equally important .
5 . Happiness creates productivity , not the other way around
Increased productivity is the result of increased happiness .
Placing a complex productivity system on top of work you dread will be a short lived fix at best .
We ’re also often the most productive when what we ’re doing has no purpose whatsoever .
6 . Simply reading a bunch of productivity blogs will not improve your life
Reading seven thousand ways to hack your motivation and the ultimate guide to be a productivity samurai will not improve your life alone .
Reading a list about 100 things to be happy about will not make you a happier person .
Passively absorbing information will not revolutionize your life .
An inner coup against doing things that make you feel dead and liberating yourself requires hard work , introspection and action .
While getting ideas and advice from other people can inspire you , what matters most is how you feel about your life and what you want .
The only person that can figure that out is you .
7 . Doing less of what you hate is as powerful as doing more of what you love
Sometimes quitting and dropping out of society and others expectations is just as powerful as doing more of what you love .
In fact , I think you ’ll find in order to really pursue your dreams , you ’ll have to quit a lot of things and forget unwanted expectations ; ones that other people would find normal and unnegotiable .
They ’ll probably find you absurd and completely insane .
Doing more of what you love will always involve quitting things that are really negotiable ( but seem like they ’re not ) and dealing with some major critics .
Do n’t worry , your courage to live authentically just scares them .
Who knows , maybe you ’ll inspire them to come to terms with the fact that they ’re living in drudgery and denial too .
8 . The “ Golden Rule ” is flawed
Everyone knows the golden rule , do to others what you would have done to you .
While this obviously has good intentions , it does n’t work in all situations .
Particularly , in relationships .
If you do to your partner what you would have done to you , you ’ll probably annoy them , piss them off and leave them feeling neglected .
Real meaningful relationships are built on trust and interdependency .
If you really care about someone , you ’ll do everything you can to find out how they would like to be treated .
9 . Your search for happiness , can often make you miserable
Searching for happiness will often mean that you have to face a lot negative aspects of your life you ’d rather ignore .
You ’ll have to deal with all the negative experiences you ’ve had in your past and try to find ways to learn from them .
Moving forward sometimes means taking two steps back in order to take a step forward .
10 . Addiction to self - improvement can ruin your life
You would think if you ’re all gung - ho about self improvement , there ’s no chance your enthusiasm can back - fire .
Unfortunately , addiction to seemingly positive pursuits can be just as detrimental to negative ones .
Addiction to self improvement can cause you to spend all your time trying to improve , but never actually living .
The goal of self improvement is to learn and grow , not to get sucked into a vacuum of obsession .
There are many ways self improvement can ruin your life .
We just need to keep in mind that self improvement is a means to an end , not an end in itself .
This list is obviously not exhaustive .
What do you think people tend to shy away from talking about ?
Let ’s start a discussion . =)

Niki Ghazian : FHM Model Dishes About Hookup with Cristiano Ronaldo

The 26 - year - old Los Angeles native kisses and tells in an interview with thedirty.com , confirming that she did indeed sleep with soccer 's # 1 hottie .
Niki also confirms reports that Paris Hilton was snubbed by Ronaldo , claiming the soccer stud likes " curvy girls with tone " and thinks Paris is " gross . "
Check out the super hot photos and video of Niki below and it's easy to see why Ronaldo kicked Paris to the curb .
Oh , and someone might want to remind Hilton that she has a boyfriend .
Russia has changed beyond recognition from the dull times of the years after the fall of the Soviet Union , when I heard it described by an American acquaintance as " the most foreign country I know " .
At that time , Moscow was a grey city covered in dirty snow .
It had no shop windows , few lights , no restaurants outside those of the hotels .
Walking along the streets , you would see people dressed in black , looking like they had nothing to do .
There were plenty of beggars and of drunken men staggering along .
Things have been gradually changing .
This July , I have been back to Moscow for a week and I found a city full of flowers and with shops , restaurants , malls , and everything that you expect to see in European cities .
The traffic is heavy ; the old Ladas are still there , but there are plenty of new cars , including SUVs .
Beggars have disappeared , a few drunkards can still be seen , but the city is full of young people evidently in good health , well dressed , and looking happy .
The cities around Moscow that I saw during my trip do n't look so shiny , but it is clear that the wealth that has concentrated in Moscow is gradually spilling out to the rest of Russia .
According to Wikipedia , Russia is now the 7th country in the world in terms of GDP adjusted for parity purchasing power .
In 2006 the average monthly Russian salary was equivalent to $ 640 and by now it is surely much more than that .
It would be still hard to define Russia a rich country , but the trends are unmistakable .
The standard explanation for the present wealth of Russia is that it has embraced capitalism , leaving behind the obsolete and inefficient ways of Soviet communism .
It may be , but the real explanation may have to do with oil .
On this point , a common legend says that the West engineered the fall of the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s , when Saudi Arabia could be convinced to inundate the market with cheap oil and cause the oil price to crash .
That badly hit the profits that the Soviets were making by exporting their oil to the West .
As for many legends , also this one has a basis of truth .
After the first world oil crisis that had peaked in the late 1970s , Saudi Arabia and the European countries facing the North Sea world had invested enormous sums in developing new fields .
In the mid 1980s .
these fields had started producing and nothing could prevent oil prices to fall down as the result .
The price crash was n't engineering on purpose against the Soviet Union , but the effect was the same .
The Soviet Union , at that time , was engaged in a costly war in Afghanistan and also needed to import grain from the West ; and pay for it in dollars .
Short of cash and on the brink of starvation , the Soviet Union simply could n't survive .
It went bankrupt and disappeared .
But the fall of the world oil prices was not the only problem that the Soviets were facing .
Also their internal oil production was in troubles .
As we can see in the following graph , a first oil production peak for the Soviet Union took place in 1987 ( figure from ASPO , www.peakoil.net).
The Soviet Union experienced peak oil first hand — a 43 % decline in domestic oil production between 1987 and 1996 .
This crisis caused Soviet society to fall into devastating economic impoverishment .
Can this be proven ?
Yes .
Here is the quick story :
The oil decline in the Soviet Union preceded the GDP decline .
A statistical test , Granger causality , shows this .
Oil decline did not follow the GDP decline , it was ahead of it , and therefore it caused it .
Again , the standard explanation here is that oil production declined because of the fall of the Soviet Union .
However , we may also argue that the opposite is true ; that it was the peak that brought down the Soviet Union .
This view has been convincingly argued by Douglas Reynolds and Marek Kolodziej .
For instance , see this statement by Reynolds at the energy bulletin
For more details on this interpretation , see the two papers by Douglas Reynolds and Marek Kolodziej listed at the end of this post .
In short , the Soviet Union was a victim of its internal peak oil , whose effects were amplified by other factors , such as the Afghan war , the drop in international oil prices , and the need for Soviet countries of importing food from abroad .
If this explanation is correct , and I believe it is , Russia has pulled off a major feat in recovering from peak oil .
A feat comparable to that of turning back the German invasion during the second world war , or that of Napoleon in 19th century .
Indeed , everyone knows that invading Russia , especially in winter , is never a good idea .
Peak oil , however , was a different kind of enemy , one that could not be beaten using armies and enlisting " General Winter " to help .
How did the Russians manage to find life after peak oil ?
There are various explanations for the rebounding of the Russian oil production .
Some have to do with factors such as the poor management of wells in Soviet times or the higher willingness of Russian entrepreneurs to take risks in a free market situation .
Personally , I favour the interpretation that the recovery was possible because the Russian society was able to cut deeply in the bloated government expenses of Soviet times ; mainly the army and the hypertrophic bureaucracy .
The resources saved from these sectors could be invested in more exploration and in upgrading existing wells .
With more effort , more equipment , and more drilling , oil could again flow out in increasing amounts .
If this is the case , victory against peak oil needed tremendous sacrifices from the Russian people , just as it was the case for the victories against Napoleon 's and Hitler 's armies .
Indeed , the misery of the post peak times is well told by Dimitri Orlov in his book " Reinventing Collapse " and in his blog cluborlov .
We learn from Orlov of the nearly complete collapse of most of the sectors of the Russian society .
Government employees , most of the population , suddenly found their saving worthless , their salaries reduced to nearly zero , or to actually zero .
For years , survival was possible mainly because of the food produced in small , private vegetable gardens , a heritage of the mismanaged food distribution system of Soviet times .
My personal experience in Russia in those years is in complete agreement with Orlov 's report .
I came to know very well the situation of my colleagues working in universities and research institutes .
During my visit , I was told that the number of researchers in Russia has been approximately halved since the times of the Soviet Union , from about 200,000 to 100,000 , you can have some idea of what kind of " creative destruction " the Russian society went through .
Except that it was n't so creative .
Entire research institutes were abandoned and later transformed into office buildings or shopping malls .
Researchers had to be creative in order to survive .
Those who could , moved to Western Europe or to the US ; others turned janitors or bodyguards .
Others clung to their jobs trying to do the best they could with the limited - or non existing - resources available .
This experience , incidentally , has made me perfectly aware of what is in store for me as a scientific researcher in a not too far future .
The difference is that I wo n't have a West to move to .
Now , with market prices going up again , Russian oil has become immensely more valuable than it used to be at the time of the fall of the Soviet Union .
The revenues in foreign currency could be used to rebuild the Russian economic infrastructure .
The salaries of scientific researchers are back and even the Russian army has regained its former status of world power , as the recent events in Georgia show .
But , no matter how much effort is placed in revitalizing old wells , the amount of oil available remains physically limited .
Russia 's oil production may have peaked a second time in 2008 , as reported in the Financial Times .
Even with the second peak arriving , Russia may not be facing a second collapse .
The first peak combined all the possible problems : decline of world prices , expensive wars ongoing , and the need of importing food from the West .
Now , these conditions are reversed or much less important .
For instance , Russia , a top grain importer at the times of the Soviet Union , seems to be now self sufficient in terms of cereal production .
So , if Russia can avoid a drastic fall in oil production , for the coming years it can have sufficient oil for its internal needs and still obtain a good revenue from exports in a market that is likely to become more and more desperate for oil supplies .
Short term perspectives look bright for Russia .
And in the long run ?
The second oil peak is likely to be the final one .
This time , another economic contraction such as the one of the 1990s would n't be enough to revitalize the old wells once again .
Russia has also to worry about climate change : while it might mean that Russians can save on fur coats and hats , global warming may spell disaster for those Russian cities built mostly on permafrost .
But Russia in the coming years has a window of opportunity to invest in an energy infrastructure that is not based on fossil fuels , a window that is probably closing or already closed for most Western countries .
The Russians have a still functioning nuclear industry .
Russia has mineral uranium resources and a good number of nuclear warheads that could be reprocessed for nuclear fuel .
It also has the only functioning fast neutron reactor in the world , at Beloyarsk , and has claimed to have solved the problem of building a " closed fuel cycle " reactor .
That would be a major advance and would solve the problem of uranium shortage that may affect the present generation of reactors in the near future .
I have no direct knowledge of the Russian nuclear situation but , from what I can say of other fields , Russia still has plenty of top class scientists and engineers , despite the non-creative destruction of the 1990s .
Considering also the financial resources available , I would think that the Russian plans of boosting nuclear energy are serious .
As for renewables , Moscow is not the right place for solar panels but the Russian territory is immense and there must be plenty of places suitable for solar and wind energy .
Probably there are also good possibilities for geothermal energy and Russia is so vast that it would also be the ideal place for high altitude wind power .
Some good research work is being done in some areas of renewable energy , such as photovoltaics ( this is the reason I went to Russia this July ) .
It is too bad that it seems that renewable technologies do n't seem to be a priority for the present government .
But that can surely be improved , Russia should never be underestimated ( nor invaded in winter , of course ) .
Several years ago , at what seemed to be one of the darkest moments of the Russian collapse , I was walking in one of the avenues of Moscow .
I noticed a series of large signs hanging from lampposts , showing traditional Russian buildings and landscapes .
One of my Russian colleagues translated the text of the signs for me as saying , " Nobody will help Russia , so Russia will have to help herself " .
Government propaganda ?
Sure , but that is what the Russian did .
Never underestimate a country that has survived peak oil .

Nerdgassing : I Coin This Word In the Name of Humanity
The word : “ Nerdgassing ”
Definition :
The venting nerds emit when some ( often minor ) detail of a book / movie / TV show / comic book / etc either conflicts with canon and / or handwaves through some some suspect science .
Example One : “ In the third show of the second season of Star Trek : The Next Generation , Data clearly says that the Glorithian flagship was constructed in orbit around that planet Norgar , but then in the fifteenth show of the sixth season , it ’s said it was constructed in the Buterian space docks !
How do you explain that , hmmm ? ” *
Example Two : “ Ringworld is unstable !
Ringworld is unstable ! ”
Secondary definition : What happens after too many Cheetos and Mountain Dew .
I checked in Google — apparently “ nerdgassing ” appears nowhere on the Internet .
Thus : I coin it !
I claim it !
Me !
Bwa ha ha ha ha !
Feel free to share an example of nerdgassing that you ’ve experienced — or even one you ’ve instigated — in the comment thread below .
* To ward off any ironic nerdgassing , this first example is fictional and meant to merely show the form of nerdgassing .
In neither the third show of the second season of ST : TNG nor in the fifteenth show of the sixth season does Data ( or any other character ) make mention of the Glorithian flagship , nor to the best of my knowledge is there a Glorithian species in any Star Trek series .
A growing body of research suggests that there is a potent way to fight symptoms of depression that does n’t involve getting a prescription .
This potent weapon ?
Hope .
“ We ’re finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression .
And the good news is that hope is something that can be taught , and can be developed in many of the people who need it , ” said Jennifer Cheavens , assistant professor of psychology at Ohio State University .
Cheavens and Laura Dreer of the University of Alabama at Birmingham discussed some of the latest research on how hope can battle depression during a symposium Saturday Aug. 16 in Boston at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Boston .
Cheavens measures hope in people using a 12 - item questionnaire developed by her mentor , the late C.R. Snyder of the University of Kansas .
In this measure , hope has two components : a map or pathway to get what you want , and the motivation and strength to follow that path .
“ If you feel you know how to get what you want out of life , and you have that desire to make that happen , then you have hope , ” Cheavens said .

Hope is different from optimism , which is a generalized expectancy that good things will happen , she said .
Hope involves having goals , along with the desire and plan to achieve them .
The potential of hope as a way to fight depression is apparent in a recent study of patients and caregivers that Cheavens discussed in her APA presentation .
In this study , Cheavens and Dreer examined 97 adults , most over age 60 , who had been diagnosed with macular degeneration or other conditions that would cause them to lose their sight .
The researchers looked at measures of hope and depression in these people with low vision , along with their caregivers .
As expected , the researchers found that , in general , caregivers were more likely to have significant depressive symptoms if the patients themselves had symptoms of depression .

But caregivers who scored higher on measures of hope showed fewer depressive symptoms , even if the people they care for were depressed .
Higher - hope caregivers also showed higher satisfaction with life , and felt less of a sense of burden .
“ Hope seems to be protective for caregivers , ” Cheavens said .
The good news is that hope is something that can be developed in people , she said .
In a study published in the journal Social Indicators Research , Cheavens and her colleagues tested a hope therapy treatment with a sample of 32 people recruited through newspaper ads and flyers .
The ads asked for participants willing to attend weekly group meetings designed to increase participants ’ abilities to reach goals .
The researchers specifically looked for people who were not diagnosed with depression or other mental illnesses , but who felt dissatisfied with where they were in life .
“ Many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill – they do n’t meet criteria for depression or other illnesses , ” Cheavens said .
“ So if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them , there may not be much progress . ”
“ Hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have , or teach them how to develop those strengths .
We focus not on what is wrong , but on ways to help people live up to their potential . ”
In this study , about half the participants took part in eight , two - hour group sessions led by trained leaders .
As part of these sessions , they were taught new hope - related skills , including identifying goals , ways to achieve them , and how to motivate themselves .
Results showed that those who participated in the hope therapy had reduced depressive symptoms compared to the control group that did not participate .
“ We ’re finding that people can learn to be more hopeful , and that will help them in many ways , ” Cheavens said .
“ What I think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well .
We have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right , and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well , ” Cheavens said .
“ And the great news is that it seems to work – we can teach people how to be more hopeful . ”
An astronomical calculator , considered a technological marvel of antiquity , was also used to track dates of the ancient Olympic games , researchers have found .
A fragment , left , and a model replica of the 2,100 - year - old Antikythera Mechanism are seen at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens .
( Associated Press )
Experts from Britain , Greece and the United States said they have detected the word " Olympia " on a bronze dial , as well as the names of other games in ancient Greece on the device known as the Antikythera mechanism .
Their findings will be reported Thursday in the British science journal Nature .
The 2,100 - year - old Antikythera mechanism was recovered from an ancient shipwreck in 1901 near Antikythera , a small island off Greece 's south coast .
Its insides look like a clock .
About 30 bronze gears were cranked to calculate phases of the moon , eclipses and other celestial information specific to a certain date .
Results were displayed on dials on the front and back of the mechanism .
Most workings of the device only came to light with recent advances in scanning technology and computer processing power .
In 2005 , an X - ray tomography machine was brought from Britain to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens , which houses the device 's corroded and sediment - encrusted remains .
Researchers soon found the gear structure — including the number of teeth cut into the wheels — corresponded to known theories of celestial cycles .
" It 's like a medical scanner , but instead of putting people in it , we put the Antikythera mechanism , " Yanis Bitsakis , a co-author of the Nature report , told the Associated Press of the technology used to study the device .
Olympian cycle
Bitsakis , of Athens University 's centre for history and paleography , said finding the Olympian dial on the device was a surprise .
Greece 's ancient games had important religious significance and were commonly used dates for historical reference .
" We were astonished because this is not an astronomic cycle but an Olympian cycle , one of social events …
One does not need a piece of high technology to keep track of a simple four - year cycle , " he said .
" It is perhaps not extravagant to see the mechanism as a microcosm illustrating the temporal harmonization of human and divine order . "
In a second new find , also reported in Nature on Thursday , Bitsakis and fellow researchers found that month names etched onto the Antikythera mechanism were consistent with ones used in Corinthian colonies in Sicily .
This provides the first possible link with the Greek mathematician Archimedes , who died there about 100 years before the device was built , Bitsakis said .
" This is an interesting — not direct link but possible link — with the town where Archimedes used to work .
It is the first link of this kind , " he said .
With the powerful 3 - D scanner , built by the British - based X - Tek Systems , scientists can peer into razor - thin sections of the device 's 80 - odd surviving fragments to understand its mechanics and read hundreds of tiny Greek inscriptions etched onto its bronze components .
Information was also gleaned from a technique developed by U.S. - based Hewlett - Packard Co. which made composite images of high - resolution digital photographs taken of the mechanism fragments under varied lighting conditions .
Bitsakis said improved computing power , used to analyze existing scans and images , made the latest discovery possible .
" The inscriptions are in very faint layers , like one - tenth of a millimetre in depth , and the letters are one millimeter high , so it 's almost nothing , " he said .
" [ We had better ] memory processing power and more powerful graphic cards …
Without this we could n't see the inscription because you have to increase the resolution and the result is a very big file , " he said .
The research project into the Antikythera mechanism is being led by Mike Edmunds , professor of astrophysics , and his colleagues at Cardiff University in Britain .
A recent study in JAMA reported that patients treated for type 2 diabetes are at risk for developing depression .
The study also reported that patients with depression are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes .
The study confirmed what other studies have reported , and clinicians have seen in practice , that symptoms of depression place patients at an increased risk for developing diabetes .
Depressive symptoms including being overweight , poor eating habits , smoking , and a sedentary lifestyle are all known risk factors for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes .
However , lifestyle factors only partly explain the association between depression and diabetes .
Another study published in Diabetes Care found an association between antidepressant medication use and the development of type 2 diabetes .
This study concluded that individuals already at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes who took antidepressant medications did develop diabetes at an increased rate .
However , individuals with depressive symptoms , but not treated with an antidepressant medication , did not experience an increased risk of type 2 diabetes .
These findings built on yet another study that found that the concurrent use of two distinct antidepressant medications — a tricyclic antidepressant ( TCA ) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) — had a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than patients who took only a TCA to treat their depression .
However , some antidepressant medications have common side effects that duplicate risk factors for type 2 diabetes .
TCA ’s , for example , are associated with weight gain and may increase blood glucose levels .
( SSRI ’s , on the other hand , are not associated with weight gain and may actually improve insulin sensitivity . )
No study has been able to explain the mechanism by which antidepressant medications may influence the onset of type 2 diabetes .
Some researchers suggest that antidepressant use may just be a marker for a history of recurrent or severe depression , which may have physiologic and biochemical effects on the body that leads to impaired glucose tolerance .
To confound the proverbial chicken - and - egg debate , the study published in JAMA demonstrated that patients treated for type 2 diabetes were at risk for developing depressive symptoms .
These patients were also more likely to have high blood pressure and protein in their urine , suggestive of kidney damage .
Interestingly , patients with pre-diabetes , or impaired fasting glucose , and patients with type 2 diabetes who were not being treated were less likely to experience depression .
Many studies have reported that patients with diabetes are nearly twice as likely to experience depression , compared to non-diabetics .
The psychological stress associated with intense management of a chronic disease such as diabetes is thought to contribute to depressive symptoms .
More research is needed to confirm these findings , but many clinicians suggest screening patients with diabetes for depression .
Lifestyle modification , including diet , exercise , and stress management , is crucial in mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with both diabetes and depression .
The use of antidepressant medications and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes are rising rapidly in the United States .
Currently , at least 4 million people with pre-diabetes are taking antidepressants .
Healthcare providers must be aware of the association and potential risk factors among diabetes , depression , and antidepressant medications and take appropriate measures to educate and inform patients of the risks , benefits , and screening tools related to treatment options .
Patients should not change their current treatment regimens based on current findings , but should discuss any concerns with their healthcare provider .

Up to 1,000 prisoners , including 400 Taliban militants , were on the run in Kandahar last night after a dramatic Taliban assault on the southern Afghan city 's main prison .
The militants blew the prison gates open with a massive truck bomb and flooded inside , attacking the guards and freeing the inmates .
A jubilant Taliban spokesman said the group had deployed 30 motorcycle mounted attackers and two suicide bombers .
Ahmed Wali Karzai , brother of the president Hamid Karzai and head of Kandahar 's provincial council , said that " all " the prisoners had escaped .
Authorities in Kandahar declared a state of emergency as police and soldiers swarmed across the city in an attempt to round up the fugitives .
The Taliban said the attack on the prison , the biggest in southern Afghanistan , had been in preparation for two months .
" Today we succeeded , " Qari Yousaf Ahmadi told the Associated Press , adding that the escapees were " are safe in town and they are going to their homes " .
The first explosions were heard at 9.30 pm local time when insurgents rammed a tanker truck filled with explosives into the front gate of Sarposa prison , killing several guards , said director Abdul Qadir .
" All of the guards at the gate have been killed and they are under the rubble , " he told Reuters a few hours later .
Gunfire could be heard in the background as he spoke .
Moments later the militants launched a multi-pronged assault on the facility .
Qadir said a suicide bomber blasted a hole in the rear wall .
There were also reports of rocket - propelled grenades hitting the perimeter from several directions .
Several Taliban fighters entered the prison , sparking gunfights with guards .
Several militants were reportedly killed .
Accounts differed about exactly how many prisoners escaped under cover of darkness but all agreed that the jailbreak was substantial .
Reuters quoted unnamed local officials who said nearly all of the 1,150 prisoners fled , including 400 Taliban fighters .
The prison director could not say how many guards had been killed or injured .
Local traders reported seeing prisoners fleeing into nearby pomegranate orchards .
Ahmed Wali Karzai said the orchards offered good cover .
The escapees included many " important " Taliban including several intended suicide bombers who were captured before they could detonate their vests , he said .
Hours later , several rockets slammed into a base used by foreign troops elsewhere in Kandahar , triggering the sound of sirens from inside the base .
No further details were immediately available .
Officials with Nato's International Security Assistance Force said they were aware of the attack but could n't immediately provide any details .
Last month about 50 prisoners went on hunger strike at Sarposa , sewing their mouths shut in protest .
Conditions are extremely poor in Afghan jails with prisoners often held for months or years without their case being heard in court .
The hunger strikers ended the weeklong protest after a parliamentary delegation promised their cases would be reviewed .
The US military has captured hundreds of people since its forces helped to topple the Taliban regime in late 2001 .
It handed some Taliban prisoners to the Afghan authorities last year as part of a programme to transfer detainees into Afghan custody .
Kandahar city was the headquarters of the Taliban 's five - year rule in Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 .
After being initially written off as a spent force by Nato and Afghan commanders , the militants have staged a resurgence in recent years .
The renewed insurgency is concentrated in the south and east of the country .
Kandahar , where mostly Canadian troops are stationed , and Helmand , where more than 7,000 British soldiers are deployed , have borne the brunt of the recent fighting .
The militants have been strengthened partly by the failures of western military tactics and reconstruction in Afghanistan , and partly thanks to their rear bases in neighbouring Pakistan .
Tensions along the border area are increasingly .
This week the Pakistani military accused the US of bombing one of its border positions , killing 11 Pakistani soldiers .
The jailbreak will further dent international confidence in the Karzai government , which suffers rampant corruption , much of it related to the drug trade .
On Thursday in Paris international donors pledged another $ 20bn for Afghan reconstruction over the next five years .
A glitch in PayPal 's payment verification system is wreaking havoc on some ecommerce sites that depend on the service .
For more than 48 hours , the bug in PayPal 's instant payment notification has made it impossible for them to process orders , owners of these businesses complain .
Making matters worse , the glitch causes credit card holders who place orders to be billed even though they are unable to take delivery of the goods or services they 've just purchased .
PayPal customers began reporting the difficulty on Thursday morning and at time of publication - more than two days later - PayPal owner eBay was still struggling to fix the problem .
" We can't accept payments done with PayPal which is a really large share of our payments since most of our customers are from America and PayPal is almost a de facto standard or means for online payment there , " Rikard Froberg , technical director of eClassical.com wrote in an email .
" The customer knows nothing about this , orders and pays but never gets the goods he paid for , or gets them very late ( for instant delivery , the patience is very short ) so it looks like the store ripping the customer off . "
Others are fuming , too .
Denizens of this forum , among others , are calling for the head of PayPal admins , who are said to have caused the outage when updating the instant payment notification ( IPN ) system .
They also complain that PayPal was slow to acknowledge the problem .
The company did n't inform users of the glitch until Friday afternoon , more than 24 hours after complaints began rolling in .
PayPal spokeswoman Amanda Pires said Saturday that a " percentage of merchants a percentage of the time " do n't receive an IPN .
Company developers are scrambling to fix the problem .
" We are looking at this as a high priority fix , " she said .
" We 've been working around the clock .
We 're hoping to have a fix as soon as possible . "
Asked to estimate that percentage of customers or the percentage of times they receive failures , Pires said it 's " much less than the majority of the time . "
For his part , Froberg says all IPNs to eClassical.com are broken .
The Sweden - based website sells DRM - free classical music in real time , so the glitch means that it 's customers have paid for files they are unable to download .
Many eCommerce websites run on scripts that do n't complete a transaction until an IPN is received from PayPal .
eClassical.com also accepts credit card payments .
The meltdown comes as eBay is requiring some customers to use PayPal if they want to continue using the service .
It also comes on the heels of Friday 's discovery of serious scripting error on the PayPal site that could have enabled attackers to create convincing spoof pages that stole users ' authentication credentials .
It took PayPal several hours , but the company 's security pros eventually squashed the security bug . ®

If not for the wind , it would be another hot day in Antarctica .
But the 20 knots blasting around the shoulders of Penguin Island are stripping us of sweat and what feels like our clothes .
I ’m shivering hard , and working hard to keep up with Heather Lynch , 5 feet 4 inches of science dynamo , robin ’s - egg - blue rubber boots pistoning through knee - deep snow with manic determination .
She turns 30 this July and is training for a 19 - mile wilderness run in Vermont billed as the hardest for its distance anywhere .
We ’re in the Antarctic Peninsula , that Sistine Chapel of the geologic world , with its godlike finger of mountains reaching across the Drake Passage toward South America ’s mountains of men .
Training helps .
We have only a couple of hours ashore to count an expected two or three thousand penguins , with a few cross-country miles to hike to and from the rookery across unknown terrain , orienteering via a hand - drawn map that might as well say here be dragons for all it ’s worth .
Ordinarily , penguin rookeries are n’t cryptic places .
They advertise through a landscape of jittery , methlike overactivity , a soundscape of braying , buzzing , and honking , and a scentscape reeking of guano and treacly dead things .
Except we can’t find this one , and resort to sniffing over sea cliffs 150 feet high .
Below , icebergs rear like Mormon temples from the battleship - gray waters of the Bransfield Strait .
A few weeks back , a smaller version of one of these white behemoths sank the venerable Antarctic tour ship the Explorer in view from here , stranding 154 passengers and crew in lifeboats for four hours .
The first ship to the rescue was the National Geographic Endeavour — Lynch ’s and my ride , anchored offshore now .
We power hike until the snowfields give way to desolate , burnt slopes of ejected volcanic boulders .
The island has the feel of a tensed muscle overdue for another tectonic release .
The last eruption here was estimated by the dating of lichens as 1905 — the same year French polar explorer Jean - Baptiste Charcot began to amass 32 - plus volumes of observations on the Antarctic Peninsula , a treasure chest of data that Lynch and her colleagues still mine today .
In the lee of the island ’s summit we finally spy a scattering of a few hundred Adélie and chinstrap penguins where we were expecting thousands .
They ’re subdued , with nary an ecstatic display to be seen , that head - craning , chest - pumping , flipper - flapping performance complete with hee - hawing calls .
The Adélies are clustered on empty nests , with only 11 chicks among them .
A pitiful tally for an entire year ’s breeding effort .
Hiking back into radio range , we hear from Ron Naveen , counting southern giant petrel nests on the other side of the island .
It ’s terrible here , he reports , just awful .
At first I picture him befouled by stomach - oil spit from the bellies of the huge albatrosslike birds the whalers called stinkers .
But his concern is that he ’s found only 75 nests in a colony that once housed more than 600 .
Worse , it appears all the petrels are sitting on eggs , far too late in the season for the chicks to survive .
The whole island is a bust .
Breeding success in Antarctica is highly variable .
Local events — rain , heat , snowfall — can crash an entire season .
In East Antarctica , southern giant petrels have been found dead on their nests , a single egg nestled in the brood patch , the birds having succumbed to enormous , burying snows .
Yet what ’s happening now is indicative of a larger meteorological reality .
The western Antarctic Peninsula is warming faster than any place on Earth .
Wintertime temperatures have risen a staggering 9 degrees Fahrenheit in 50 years .
What was once a cold , dry place has become a warm , wet place .
The wildlife is reeling from the chaos , some finding opportunity , others catastrophe .
On Penguin Island , Adélie populations have plummeted 75 percent since 1980 .
Returning across the high flanks of the island , Lynch and I pass a pair of chinstraps — chinnies , as they ’re affectionately known — waddling toward the distant colony , wings cranked open for balance , lurching from one webbed foot to the other , climbing hard .
It ’s an impressive feat of penguin mountaineering .
The pair rests , facing each other , as if conferring on their own adventurous conundrum .
We chuckle , though we ’re puzzled as to why they do n’t just swim to their front doorstep on the far side of the island .
Of course , there ’s no telling why penguins make one decision versus another , why they elect a long and difficult path when an easier way is obvious .
Any more than we can figure the bizarrely perilous choices of our own kind .
polar peril
It ’s not just penguins and other Antarctic animals that are in trouble .
A sampling of Arctic species reeling from climate change .
— J.W. Lemming
Reports of mass suicide are erroneous , but some species of these rodents are in danger of extinction from climate change and habitat loss .
Many Arctic land species — from flowering plants to insects to birds — are now forced to cope with springtime arriving 30 days earlier than 10 years ago .
Arctic Fox
A seminal study of Arctic fox dna upends the presumption that animals are able to chase after their range when it dwindles or moves .
In fact , Arctic foxes in Europe failed to track northward with the ice melt at the end of the last ice age , dooming their genetics to oblivion .
Siberian foxes likely moved east and now largely depend on lemmings for food .
Polar Bear
Among the most ice dependent of all marine mammals .
A 23 - year study recently found that Hudson Bay polar bears have declined — along with the ice — more than 20 percent in 20 years .
Desperate for food , bears are drowning and turning to cannibalism .
In 2006 the world ’s foremost conservation scientists rated the bears as “ vulnerable , ” noting , “ It seems unlikely that polar bears will be able to adapt to the current warming trend in the Arctic . ”
Walrus
To rest , walruses need to haul out on ice , yet they found so little in 2007 they were forced ashore in record numbers — 40,000 on Russia ’s Arctic coast , where up to 4,000 died in stampedes .
Experts worry that as walruses become more land based , they ’ll strip coastal waters of food , dooming themselves to starvation .
Ribbon Seal
A species that needs sea ice because they almost never come ashore .
Their future is of such concern due to global warming that in 2007 the Center for Biological Diversity requested federal protection under the Endangered Species Act.
Narwhal
The most specialized of all Arctic whales and dolphins , narwhals are believed to fast most of the summer and feed all winter on halibut living beneath the ice .
A recent assessment found narwhals more sensitive to climate change than polar bears .
Hooded Seal
Completely dependent on sea ice for whelping , molting , and mating .
A small worldwide population and limited range make this species as vulnerable as polar bears .
Beluga Whale
Like narwhals , belugas are being infected by diseases such as brucellosis that are traveling north in warming waters .
Musk Ox
Four years ago , 20,000 starved in Canada , victims of a likely climate - change - related , late - autumn rainfall that froze the ground solid and prevented the herd from feeding all winter .
In 1774 , after enduring tempests , gales , and fogs , Captain James Cook came up hard against the Antarctic ice sheet and turned back .
He never saw the land beyond , land he thought “ doomed by nature to everlasting frigidness … whose horrible and savage aspect I have no words to describe . ”
He predicted another explorer would , though “ I shall not envy him the honour of the discovery but I will be bold to say that the world will not be benefited by it . ”
It ’s still a hard sell , the notion that this frozen continent and its frozen - ocean partner to the north have much relevance to our temperate world .
Naveen and Lynch are here to count dwindling numbers of penguins — because , Naveen says , doing so is like looking into a crystal ball and seeing our own future beset by climate change .
They ’re censusing three species ( Adélies , chinstraps , gentoos ) , plus two seabirds ( blue - eyed shags , southern giant petrels ) , at 123 sites in a long - term research project known as the Antarctic Site Inventory .
It ’s a daunting undertaking , facilitated in part by Lindblad Expeditions , which donates one cabin , two bunks , and all meals for two researchers aboard the Endeavour for the entirety of the Antarctic season — a contribution worth a minimum of $ 200,000 a year .
Naveen and Lynch have no control of the ship ’s itinerary , but are grateful to piggyback on the travels of the tourists .
Ron Naveen ’s history as a Lindblad lecturer dates back a quarter century .
He ’s also the founder and president of Oceanites ( OH - shun - AYE - tees ) , the nonprofit funding organ for the Antarctic Site Inventory .
Heather Lynch , who looks , in her own words , to be 17 years old , is a newcomer to the project , with two Antarctic seasons under her belt .
She brings 21st - century science to the table , introducing überstatistics to often - incomplete datasets as a way to fast - forward to results .
I ’m hitchhiking on their ride , sharing their tiny , two - bunk cabin , sleeping on a ledge below the porthole .
My goal is to report on the International Polar Year , a 63 - nation enterprise launched because the poles “ are presently changing faster than any other regions of the Earth , with regional and global implications for societies , economies and ecosystems . ”
Written between the lines of the mission statement is the understanding that the frozen poles are Earth ’s own doomsday vault , our last nest egg of vitals : freshwater , minerals , oil , oceanic currents , climate control , and who knows what else .
Vaults we do n’t want to open .
Naveen , Lynch , and I join 110 passengers aboard the 294 - foot Endeavour on their vacation of a lifetime .
Fifty years ago there was no infrastructure for tourists in Antarctica .
This year , 40,000 will visit aboard more than 58 vessels , with the number predicted to rise to more than 80,000 tourists by 2010 .
The only obstacles to visitation these days are financial — Lindblad ’s cheapest berths aboard the Endeavour cost $ 10,250 , plus hefty airfares — though clearly it ’s worth it .
After all , we ’re all here , tourists , explorers , researchers , writers , sharing similar concerns about a frozen world necessary for our well - being .
We all know how the febrile Arctic is melting toward an ice - free state — while the Antarctic , that mother lode of ice that as recently as 2001 was thought invulnerable in the 21st century , is leaking at the seams .
We know that since 2000 atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased 35 percent faster than expected , despite the pledges of 180 nations to rein them in .
We ’re aware that polar seas are defying the laws of expectation , warming , in places , a staggering 9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1995 , opening the door for nonnative plants and animals to cross the polar thresholds and claim new waters for themselves .
We get that all this bodes poorly for penguins and humans alike .
Do n’t we ?
After two days of warm , sunny weather , when I suggest we might expect a change to sleet or snow , one of the guests aboard the Endeavour snorts : Snow ?
Nobody told us to expect that .
More than a few express surprise at snow on the frozen continent .
Others , with the stunned look of people booked on the wrong tour , self - medicate at the bar , and do n’t seem to notice the weather at all .
We share meals in the ship ’s glass - walled dining room , with its gliding panoramas of snow , ice , icebergs , sea , sky , whales , and seabirds , and I hear more than a few guests describe how they came to be here — struck by spontaneous wanderlust after viewing that paean to snow and fatherhood , March of the Penguins .
It ’s blizzarding the day we arrive at Petermann Island — Oceanites ’
Antarctic field station and home to three researchers collecting data on penguin breeding efforts .
After a brief Zodiac ride , Naveen , Lynch , and I land ahead of the guests and are welcomed ashore by the resident scientists based there for the winter .
The greetings are heartfelt and effusive and involve the bestowing of gifts of chocolate and booze and fashion magazines laden with perfume swatches .
( There ’s no shower here . )
We trudge through oversized snowflakes butterflying through the air , past nesting gentoo penguins and their pink guano latrines , to the Arctic Oven , a 20 - by - 10 - foot blimp of a yellow tent built for the cold extremes of the world .
It ’s part kitchen , part science lab , anchored to the ground with a dozen 60 - pound “ deadmen ” bags filled with rocks , now disappearing into the blizzard .
We undress in the sulfur light inside the vestibule , removing every square inch of our sodden , guano - splattered outer clothing before climbing through the tent ’s zippered hatch .
Or , rather , Lynch and I do .
Naveen doffs only jacket and boots and steps through with dripping hat and rain pants .
Both he and Lynch are giddily happy to be back in their field home —
Naveen too much so to be mindful , shuffling in his socks on the cold floor , reaching out to touch everything : the laptop , the satellite phone , the raunchy cards , inflatable flamingo , and weather - beaten maps hanging on the interior clothesline .
He ’s running a monologue about penguins and punctuating his thoughts by tossing back peanut M&Ms pilfered from a bowl on the kitchen table .
Hey , Lynch reminds him , we ’re on a ship full of goodies .
The Petermann gang hardly has any .
But this is The House That Ron Built , so he squirms good - naturedly and eats another handful anyway .
It ’s the first season Naveen has n’t been resident for at least one of two annual five - week stints here , because , he says sadly , things get done faster when he stays home .
He ’s referring to fundraising , and home is Washington , DC , where he manages the business of collecting charitable contributions and writing science grants that sustain the efforts on Petermann Island , while facilitating 784 visits to 123 bird rookeries across Antarctica since 1994 .
The research is daunting .
Compounding the difficulties of getting boots on the ground in remote seabird rookeries is the fact that some sites are too big to count .
Or too steep .
Or too locked in by ice .
Or too dangerous due to 70 - knot winds on the day of the visit .
Furthermore , counts are most useful during only two short windows each season : one at the peak of egg laying , the other at the peak of crèching ( the time after hatching when penguin chicks congregate in downy flocks , leaving both parents free to hunt for food ) .
The difference between the number of eggs laid and the number of chicks surviving to crèche is a reliable indicator of how well the species is doing from one year to the next .
The resident team on Petermann Island faces different challenges , including as many as three visiting ships a day , all requiring some aspect of a guided tour .
Many days it ’s hard to get anything done , including the basics .
There ’s no outhouse here , only a rock and the flushing sea , and , if you do n’t time it right , 100 - plus witnesses .
One by one the Endeavour ‘s passengers file up to the Arctic Oven , where the camp manager holds open the hatch to the vestibule so the passengers can peer into the inner workings of a field station .
Some seem embarrassed by the zoolike presentation of scientists in their native habitat , and duck away .
Others linger with queries , mostly about the living conditions .
One woman asks an oft - repeated question , Who does the cooking ?
We take turns , says Lynch :
One person cooks and cleans for a day , followed by two days off .
The guest digests this , snow dumping behind her , penguins hee - hawing , wind rattling the guy wires , the fishy stench of guano permeating the air .
Huh , she responds : Kind of like a summerhouse on Long Island .
Visitors are n’t what they used to be , reports Naveen .
The Antarctic aficionados still pilgrimage here , but they ’re outnumbered these days by doom tourists chasing down the disappearing world and the nouveau riche absentmindedly checking off the premier stop on their grand tour of Planet Earth .
You ca n’t protect what you do n’t know , said Lars - Eric Lindblad upon first bringing tourists to Antarctica in 1969 ( aboard the same Explorer that went to the bottom a few weeks ago ) .
From his pioneering efforts , the notion of ecotourists as ambassadors was born .
Nearly 40 years into the training program , the plebes aboard the Endeavour have a ways to go .
One guest , when asked after a two - hour onboard lecture on seabird identification whether the bird overhead is a southern giant petrel or black - browed albatross , looks up , shrugs , and admits , I really do n’t care .
On a day so warm the southern giant petrels are riding thermals rising off icebergs , we sail into the Weddell Sea .
The sun is sharp as knives .
The air , antiseptically invisible .
Islands 50 miles distant seem yards away .
Up close , killer whales hunt the floes for sleeping crabeater seals , while cape petrels , those checkerboard flyers of the cold waters , surf the air curls streaming off the ship .
I ’m wearing flip - flops on deck .
We sail through canyons of ice , enormous tabular bergs colored in sea-glass shades of milk , crystal , turquoise , and cobalt green , shot through with bolts of electric blue .
The bergs tower 80 or more feet above us , some the remnants of the 1,264 - square - mile Larsen B ice shelf , which in 2002 catastrophically disintegrated at a speed then truly startling to science , but now almost commonplace as both poles and many high elevations summarily liquefy .
As recently as 2000 , scientists predicted Arctic summer ice until 2100 , whereas some research now suggests its demise by 2013 .
But even as the bad news from the Arctic mounted , the southernmost continent was considered too big , too remote , too frozen to react with every nuance of changing currents and warming winds .
At 5.4 million square miles , it ’s bigger than Europe , the coldest , windiest , driest place and largest and highest desert on Earth .
Much of Antarctica lies more than two miles above sea level ; 90 percent of the world ’s ice and as much as 70 percent of its freshwater are locked in its frozen vault .
The prospect of this global Sub - Zero melting anytime soon lies beyond the ken of human imagination , and climate models have long forecast a reassuring stability .
But the certainty of an unshakably frozen South Pole is cracking .
The Antarctic Peninsula ’s thermal sprint is hammering 87 percent of its glaciers into retreat .
This past February the Wilkins ice shelf — an area bigger than Connecticut — began to disintegrate , following the familiar script of the Larsen B .
In a heartbeat , the northernmost fringe of Antarctica has become more temperate than polar : endowed with snow , but less of it sticking around long enough to become entombed in glaciers , existing glaciers dumping faster into a warming sea .
God ’s finger is growing thin .
The Antarctic landmass is showing the strain too .
In 2005 , researchers found the first real evidence of massive melting over a multitude of regions previously considered immune , including far inland , at high latitudes , and at high elevations .
Put together , these disparate melt zones add up to an area the size of California .
Furthermore , whereas scientists were expecting a growth in Antarctica ’s coastal ice sheets from heavier snowfall , a 10 - year study found much of them in mysterious , rapid decline .
Losing the coastal ice opens the floodgates for glaciers to surge into the sea , not only raising sea levels but also adding freshwater to oceanic currents fueled by salinity levels , increasing the risks of resetting the currents — Earth ’s natural thermostat .
But it ’s a beautiful day aboard the Endeavour .
Hatless guests stroll the decks , complementary red parkas flapping open , heads craned back to see the massive icebergs , oohing and aahing in their own ecstatic displays .
The ship weaves between a fantastic assortment of bergs melted below the waterline and flipped , revealing the crazed hand of a submarine sculptor , complete with domes , pinnacles , wedges , and weird standing glassy blocks resembling Icehenges .
Some icebergs are favored haul - outs for penguins , whose formidable ice - climbing skills allow them to porpoise out of the waves , stab the ice - axes of their bills into sheer walls , then peg with toenail crampons , hammering move after move until they ’ve climbed 50 or more feet to ledges tattooed with sleeping penguins .
There ’s talk aboard the Endeavour of climate change , including from a vocal contingent of naysayers quoting mythical studies .
One woman repeatedly cites a fictional cluster of 19,000 denialistas hunkered down in German institutes of higher learning , until someone asks her to prove it .
There are also a surprising number of middle grounders leaking equal parts confusion and skepticism about “ this global warming business . ”
The two groups manage to exhibit all five stages of climate - change denial :
There ’s nothing happening ; we do n’t know why it ’s happening ; climate change is natural ; climate change is not bad ; climate change ca n’t be stopped .
The true believers discover each other mostly through shared incredulous silence .
Yet all come together when we happen upon an ancient ice floe topped with a single sleeping emperor penguin .
It ’s a juvenile that has just completed its inconceivable genesis in the dark of the Antarctic winter , perched atop its father ’s webbed feet , tucked into the brood pouch , enduring 100 - knot winds and subzero temperatures .
The young bird utters three soft braying calls as we approach , then stands .
The motor drives on a hundred cameras whine .
Everyone whispers to no one in particular , as all are joined by an invisible thread of respect woven into the collective consciousness by March of the Penguins .
You can almost hear the Morgan Freeman narration hang in the air .
Directly ahead lies heavy pack ice , the dividing line between ships and penguins .
We turn back , leaving the young bird to its solitude .
The pack ice in the Weddell Sea is the same obstacle that sank Ernest Shackleton ’s Endurance in 1915 , and , like him , we set our sights on Paulet Island , where he hoped and failed to land his men .
We ca n’t quite get there either , though Captain Philipp Dieckmann noses the ship in a narrow channel cluttered with big bergs , bergy bits , growlers , and weather - pummeled sea ice , all idiosyncratically on the move with tide and wind , like dancers without a choreographer .
Here and there we kiss ice , the ship shuddering at the impact and wailing in a Björklike voice , seductive and violent .
Everyone who can be is clustered topside , watching the contest , when a German who speaks excellent English confesses how he and his compatriots have been confused by the constant references to “ Adélie ” this and “ Adélie ” that , wondering where in the world is this French woman everyone is talking about .
Naveen and Lynch badly want to get ashore on Paulet and count Adélie penguins and the Antarctic cormorants known as blue - eyed shags .
But Matt Drennan , expedition leader and 20 - year veteran of the Antarctic , with 80 expeditions under his belt , does n’t like the look of things .
Too much ice .
Too much tide .
Wind coming up .
He squints into the glare of memory — things can change too quickly here — and apologizes profusely .
No one second - guesses his tough decision because no one wishes to repeat the travails of the 20 men of the Nordenskjöld Expedition who inadvertently overwintered here in 1903 after their ship sank in the Weddell ice .
Their tiny stone hut , visible from the Endeavour , looks to be built from stacked headstones .
Paulet is only a mile across , yet its slopes , rising more than 1,100 feet , are so steep and its birds so densely packed that they ’ve never been fully counted , only estimated .
The last year conditions enabled an estimate was 1999 , when Naveen managed a flyover in a British navy helicopter and calculated between 95,000 and 105,000 Adélie nests , for a total of perhaps 350,000 adults and chicks on the island .
The question of interest today is how many are present this year .
Adélies , the most polar of the three penguin species nesting in the peninsula , seem to be suffering the most from climate whiplash , their numbers plummeting 80 percent in places .
Exactly why remains a matter of conjecture , though many theories begin and end with krill .
Adélies survive almost exclusively on krill , making forays more than 400 miles to and from their nests and dives up to 574 feet deep in pursuit of the shrimplike invertebrates .
But krill stocks are n’t what they used to be .
Despite the fact that wildlife has been protected on Antarctic lands since 1959 , the Southern Ocean , which feeds most Antarctic life , is still considered fair game .
Industrial - scale krill - fishing fleets arrived here in the 1970s , bent on transforming the keystone species of Antarctica into fish food and omega - 3 supplements .
In 2007 , the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources expanded the catch limit from 450,000 to 2.6 million metric tons in East Antarctica alone .
This despite concerns that the stock is already in decline from climate change .
Krill need pack ice for feeding , yet the pack in the peninsula has shrunk 80 percent in 30 years , forming later each winter and retreating earlier each summer .
The problems for penguins do n’t end with krill .
Adélies need sea ice as a place to rest while foraging , a kind of polar recovery room , now shrinking .
Moreover , the warming climate is producing deep snows and flooding rains that smother or drown their eggs and chicks — changes that may also be fueling outbreaks of ticks severe enough to force some penguins to abandon their eggs and chicks and seek relief in the sea .
Now melting glaciers are releasing time bombs of ddt and likely other pollutants once safely frozen in the ice .
In November 2007 researchers at Palmer Station in the Antarctic Peninsula recorded the first extinction of an Adélie colony , which may historically have housed as many as 30,000 birds .
“ The evidence could no longer be denied , ” the team wrote , “ and it was formally transcribed into our field notebooks and databases … no [ Adélie ] pairs had arrived to breed on Litchfield Island … the first recorded extinction of an entire colony in the 34 - year history of this study . ”
At first glance , the massive penguin rookery at Brown Bluff looks to be strewn with the carcasses of penguin chicks .
But they ’re not dead , only prostrate with heat — fat , absurdly fuzzy , lying prone on rotund krill - filled bellies , wings outstretched , webbed feet raised in the air behind them , shedding heat through the only unfeathered parts of their bodies .
The Adélie chicks hatched earlier than the gentoos on the island , and some are near fledging now , molting their down feathers like penguins emerging from gorilla suits .
Most are joining crèches and partaking in the comical affairs known as feeding chases : a parade of chicks besieging any parent returning from the sea , the youngsters chattering loudly of their hunger .
The returning parents , bloated with krill , lurch as fast and far away as they can , hoping to winnow their own chicks from the mob .
Some feeding chases persist a thousand feet down the beach , a long way for birds with no ankles , says Naveen .
We arrive prepared to count , but are waylaid by the impossibly calm day , the mirrorlike bay with ripples of sinuous leopard seals , the grounded icebergs on shore , and the literally hundreds of adult penguins crowding the waterline .
They ’re restless and hot and hungry .
They ’re also afraid of the leopard seals .
Entering the water requires a flock to reach consensus .
Before that , they reach many false consensuses , a few birds toppling headfirst into the sea only to U - turn and torpedo out again .
This day , as every day , a few will not return with food but instead become food for leopard seals .
We climb a precipitous hill worn to dirt and rock from countless generations of penguin feet .
Birds come and go , effortlessly hopping past us on the uphill .
Near the pinnacle , scrambling atop a boulder , Heather Lynch snaps photos of the colony in all directions and notes the gps coordinates .
There are too many birds to count , except on a digitized image on a computer screen .
Next year , conditions permitting , an Oceanites team will return to this same boulder and count again .
Such is the way databases in the Antarctic grow , as slowly as lichens .
To compensate for the difficulties inherent in polar work , Naveen hooked up with Bill Fagan at the University of Maryland .
Fagan ’s lab , where Lynch is a postdoc , is a scientific front line combining advanced mathematical theory and off - the - map fieldwork to explore questions critical to life on Earth — including those shaping life naturally ( community ecology ) , and those that save life from ourselves ( conservation biology ) .
Lynch , with a master ’s in physics and a Ph.D. in biology from Harvard , is representative of what may well turn out to be the distinguishing feature of 21st - century science — the reintegration of the last century ’s separate disciplines into something beginning to resemble one .
What she offers the Antarctic Site Inventory is the bandwidth to crunch relatively sparse population numbers alongside data on sea ice , climate , and ocean productivity — plugging it all into hierarchical Bayesian models — statistical analyses so complex that only recently has the computational power emerged to manage them .
( An early Bayesian application in 1968 stretched computers of the day , yet succeeded in locating the sunken nuclear submarine the Scorpion , lost somewhere in the Atlantic . )
The work derives from the 18th - century British mathematician and Presbyterian minister Reverend Thomas Bayes and his theorem on the probabilities of the behavior of billiard balls .
Lynch hopes to use Bayesian models to address what Fagan calls the weak - data problem in conservation biology : the persistent dearth of field records over consequential timescales .
The statistical tools are n’t quite the equivalent of sinking all your pool balls on the break .
But they set them up cleanly for your next shot .
At Booth Island , in a heavy snowfall , the naturalists aboard the Endeavour land ahead of the guests and set up orange traffic cones to mark footpaths as close to the action as front - row seats , yet far enough away from penguin trails and colonies to be respectful of their privacy .
Along with ice and weather , Naveen and Lynch are also examining the impact of tourism on breeding penguins , though initial results seem to agree with other studies that well - managed tourism enhances penguin survival , possibly by keeping skuas — predatory gulls nearly the size of eagles — away .
Good for penguins , bad for skuas , says Lynch .
The first 1,000 - passenger liner traveled to Antarctica in 2000 , and last year a 3,000 - passenger cruise ship visited .
Not all make landings , yet the dangers are real , whether people come ashore or not .
When the Explorer sank in 2007 it was small enough , and the weather calm enough , that nearby ships could rescue its passengers .
And the ship sank cleanly enough that a major oil spill , far from any emergency infrastructure , was averted .
In other words , conditions were excellent for a sinking , a reality unlikely to be repeated .
More tourists also change the aesthetic .
Matt Drennan spends several hours a day calculating how to keep the Endeavour out of the line of sight of all the other ships competing for space at the 20 or 25 most popular landing sites on the peninsula .
Maintaining the illusion of solitude is hectically orchestrated every July during the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators ’ online electronic derby .
Ignorant of what December or January will hold , ships submit itineraries for which landing sites they ’d like to visit on which days .
Six months later , the reality of ice and weather hits and the schedules are reshuffled in an undertaking worthy of a Bayesian model .
It ’s a process that ’s still workable , says Drennan , but only just .
He doubts it can absorb twice as many visitors and still maintain the character of a wilderness experience .
Do visitors care ?
No matter the weather outside , the Endeavour ‘s bow is stippled with a flock of hardcore guests wearing red Lindblad parkas — the $ 10,000 parkas , they joke — cameras at the ready , eyes tearing from the wind .
Those less hardy rest in easy chairs in the library , watching the scenery glide by .
Others nap in their bunks .
A few anchor the bar .
One soul holes up in the windowless computer lab with an everlasting game of solitaire .
The old hands aboard , the 12 naturalists , who tally more than 150 years combined Antarctic experience , keep watch for whales from behind the windshield on the bridge .
Sometimes a frozen guest joins them .
But the inside lacks the raw power of the outdoors , the sensual jolt craved by those who know this is a once - in - a - lifetime experience .
The whales spout .
The crabeater seals glance up from their daybeds on the ice floes .
The penguins porpoise from the surface like flying minnows .
Somewhere between the naturalists ’ lectures and the uncensored cut of the wind , the stunning landscapes of Antarctica transform into a living , breathing , ongoing story that will follow these visitors back to the other world and whisper in their ears for a long time to come .
Fifty years ago , a bunch of visiting scientists heard the call of Antarctica .
The result was the Antarctic Treaty , written in language as stripped - down and clear as the Declaration of Independence , presenting a revolutionary argument for the rights of the uninhabited continent : “ Recognizing that it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord . ”
Because of the treaty and related agreements , known as the Antarctic Treaty System or ats , the continent enjoys freedoms unparalleled elsewhere on Earth , including freedom from any military presence ( though some nations use their military to run their research ) , freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation , freedom from territorial ownership , and freedom from nuclear weapons .
The frozen continent offers a thought experiment as to how an intelligent , informed , curious , energetic , disciplined , and mostly rational human society might operate at some future date .
The Arctic , in contrast , presents a dark glimpse into the past , as disappearing ice awakens piratical instincts in nations seeking heretofore inaccessible minerals , oil , fish , and seafaring riches .
New data in the Arctic are already being used to boost increased American territorial claims by 100 nautical miles .
Canada is embroiled in sovereignty disputes with the US , Russia , Denmark , and Norway over sites rich with oil and natural gas , and over ownership of the fabled Northwest Passage .
Yet Antarctica may be only temporarily immune from polar fever , since the ats suspends mineral exploration merely until 2048 .
Seven nations — Argentina , Australia , Britain , Chile , France , Norway , and New Zealand — maintain territorial claims in abeyance , for the time being .
Along with 39 other countries , they wait , should the treaty change , poised inside 64 permanent and seasonal scientific bases , some facilitating no science , some facilitating exploitation thinly disguised as science .
For better or worse , the research footprint grows far bigger than even the tourist footprint in Antarctica .
It ’s questionable whether 40 years from now , when the mineral rights prohibition comes up for renewal , the equivalent spirit of enlightenment will prevail .
By then , the frozen goodies known to abound under Antarctica ’s snowfields may well be more accessible .
The United States has already completed a controversial 1,000 - mile snow road connecting its bases at McMurdo Sound and the South Pole — the road to plunder , should conditions allow .
By 2048 , the global population will have soared to 9 billion , an increase almost equivalent to the total number of people living on earth in 1959 , when the first Antarctic Treaty was signed .
Pressures on Earth ’s resources may well have outgrown our generosity .
In all likelihood we ’re only an oil shortage away from applauding the 19th - century sentiments of poet Bret Harte on America ’s original polar aspirations :
Know you not what fate awaits you
Or to whom the future mates you ?
All ye icebergs , make salaam
You belong to Uncle Sam !
We make final landfall at Port Lockroy , a weatherproof harbor in the Palmer Archipelago , and historic site of an old British whaling station turned military base turned meteorological station .
Whale skeletons line the shores .
A pair of tiny black huts marks the line Churchill held against the Nazis in Antarctica .
Enormous glaciers ring the bay , punctuated by rocky mountaintops knuckling through the snow .
At metronomic intervals , ice calves into the sea , sonic booms marking puffs of snow and ice .
Outside the protected harbor , hurricane - force winds blow , while five yachts that braved the Drake Passage moor in faultless calm .
Port Lockroy is crowded with tourists in kayaks , tourists beachcombing , tourists on Zodiac tours of the harbor .
The hut ’s latest persona is as a museum , gift shop , and post office , its rooms crowded with visitors spending all manner of currencies on tea towels , T - shirts , and postcards .
It ’s a snapshot of one Antarctic future .
A passenger aboard one of the moored yachts visits the Endeavour and gives a talk in the lounge .
He ’s a well - known explorer , examining climate change and the impacts of tourism while making a documentary about himself kayaking in the Antarctic Peninsula .
He refers to his kayaks as floating ambassadors , and the guests are eager to hear his take on this global warming business .
But despite his audience of newly fledged envoys , despite the incomparable backdrop , and the pressing issues , the explorer is reticent , paddling around the touchy subject while waving a drink through the air .
Perhaps this is what ambassadors do .
With a few working hours still left in Antarctica , Ron Naveen and Heather Lynch launch into the bird colony at Jougla Point , most of it off - limits to nonscientists , wading shin - deep in muck and slipping and sliding in melt pools on the edges of rocky escarpments .
Naveen ’s no novice and skates nonchalantly along drop - offs ; Lynch powers behind , field notebook in hand , hood cinched low .
They count and recount , the simplest science imaginable .
Much depends on their numbers , including decisions likely to be made about future human visitation here , the outlook for penguins , and , perhaps , a critical data point in the emerging picture of how this unpeopled world sustains us .
Snow sashays onto the nesting gentoo penguins and blue - eyed shags , disguising the pink mire of the colony that has turned their chicks into unrecognizable lumps of filthy down .
The birds nest shoulder to shoulder , alongside old winch anchors , mooring blocks , whale skulls , wooden crates , discarded cable .
They nest under the old World War II huts and on the cement block holding the British flag .
Through every human endeavor that has blossomed here then faded , they ’ve endured , cooing their courtship calls , hissing at intruders , spreading their feathered parasols to keep snow , sleet , rain , and sun from their perfectly hopeful chicks .

Okay , so here I am at the ripe old age of 22 , just got out of a long , life - wasting relationship , and I was on the rebound .
My priority in life at this point was to go out , get drunk , and get laid .
One night , I did go out , did get drunk , and was talking to a guy who somehow was getting progressively cuter as the night progressed .
It happens , youâ€™ve lived it , letâ€™s move on .
So , a couple , two , three more drinks later , he is suddenly the funniest guy Iâ€™ve ever met , and for some reason , I decided that we should leave and get things rolling .
Now , Iâ€™m not an overly materialistic girl , but when I saw the â€Hello this is my Grandmaâ€™s carâ€ car that he was proudly sporting , I started to lose my buzz , but I didnâ€™t let this get to me until I got into his car to see that he was , indeed , sitting on a cushion .
My grandma did this because she was shrinking and needed the boost .
Okayâ€ ¦letting this slide .
End at his house .
Still lives with the parents , and I was assuming he was about my age — no biggie .
We sneak into his basement room , have another drink , and then it starts to go from there .
Make it onto his bed , start fooling around , having a grand old time , and all of a sudden I hear this SCCCCCCCRRRRREEEEEEAAAAAAAAACCCCCHHHH SSSSSQQQQQwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaccccck !!!
Ok WTF was that !?!?
I ask .
Soâ€ ¦Grandma
Ride jumps up out of the bed half naked and goes , â€ œOHHH I didnâ€™t introduce you to Annie !!!â€ 
Iâ€™m sitting here thinking â€ œWho is Annie and WTF is Annie spewing out that wretched ear piercing noise !?!?â€ 
So the guy , who is getting rapidly uglier by the second as my buzz has just about completely dissipated , proceeds to run across the basement half clothed to go get this enormously huge parrot and bring it into the bed !
Iâ€™M HALF NAKED HERE , BUD !
â€ Do you want to see how Annie is a good girl and can do her tricks ?!? ”
Uhhh , not so much , but I was not having much choice here as I was hurriedly getting dressed .
( And you all know how getting dressed fast doesnâ€™t seem to work ; legs are in arm holes , etc.etc . )
Well as he spewed out random â€œbaby talkâ€ antics to this thing , Annie decided she apparently didnâ€™t like me .
Annie was eyeing me down with her beady little eyes and I was giving her THE LOOK right back .
Annie swoops off , not like a â€œpretty little girlieâ€  and flies at me going for my head !
At this time I proceeded to lie on the bed and pull the blanket over my head , swearing to myself that I was NEVER drinking again and I should try celibacy .
Now , instead of , I donâ€™t know , GETTING THE BIRD AWAY FROM ME , this creep calmly says , â€ Oh , Annie is upset because you are laying on her pillow .
You should move over . ”
You let your bird sleep in your bed ?!!?
â€ Why of course !
She is my BAAAAYBAAAY , arenâ€™t you , Miss Prettiest Bird in the World !?!?
Do you like daddyâ€™s new girlfriend ??! ”
At this point , I managed to escape the entanglement of the bed sheets and got up and out of the bed .
I was then RUNNING out the door and didnâ€™t care that I didnâ€™t have my shoes on in the middle of a Chicago January .
I was deathly afraid I was going to end up in a hole with Precious tossing me a bottle of lotion to rub on my skin .
Yeah , he didnâ€™t get laid .
THANK GOD !!!!!

A pair of North Dakota hemp farmers have filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn a federal ban on the production of commercial hemp .
North Dakota is the only state that allows the cultivation of industrial hemp , and the state legislature recently lifted a requirement that hemp farmers first seek permits from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
But because federal regulations still prohibit state - regulated hemp farming , North Dakota farmers Dave Monson and Wayne Hague filed a lawsuit on June 9 to overturn this ban .
A federal court dismissed their case on November 29 ( 2007 ? ) , and the farmers have now appealed to the next level .
Monson and Hague argue that contrary to the DEA 's arguments , industrial hemp is not the same as marijuana .
While both are varieties of the cannabis plant , hemp advocates point to numerous scientific studies showing that industrial hemp is genetically distinct and does not contain high enough concentrations of the narcotic chemical THC to be used as a recreational drug .
Industrial hemp varieties include those used to produce oilseeds or fiber plants .
Advocates of hemp say that the plant can be produced with very low ecological impact compared with other fiber sources , such as cotton .
In addition , the hemp seed is 25 percent protein , making it second only to soy beans as a vegetable source of complete protein .
The United States lifted its ban on the sale of hemp - containing foods in 2001 , but did not lift the ban on production .
This led to a surge in hemp cultivation in Canada , which currently exports approximately 90 percent of its crop and the products produced from its crop to the United States .
The North American hemp market has continued to grow , now totaling $ 300 million in yearly retail sales .
Hemp advocates point to Canada as proof that hemp cultivation does not create drug problems .
" Canada grows over 30,000 acres of industrial hemp annually without any law enforcement problems , " said Vote Hemp President Eric Steenstra .
The Localized Ownership pattern language makes it possible

The lifetime of a dynamic object in C++-- one allocated from heap memory ( the free - store ) -- is managed explicitly by the program .
The program must guarantee that each dynamic object is deleted when it is no longer needed , and certainly before it becomes garbage .
( There is no garbage collection in standard C++ , and few programs can afford to produce garbage . )
For each dynamic allocation , a policy that determines the object 's lifetime must be found and implemented .
Localized Ownership is a pattern language that tackles the management of dynamic object lifetimes in C ++.
It forms a sequence of patterns that address a range of design constraints .
Early patterns in the sequence emphasize simplicity and locality of the responsible code .
Later patterns offer greater flexibility at the expense of a more complex implementation that is dispersed more widely .
The simplest policies for managing a dynamic object 's lifetime are those that localize the work within a single component , such as a function , object , or class .
A simple solution that suffices is ideal .
Unfortunately , attempts to localize lifetime policies are confounded by rich object architectures that require their objects to play multiple roles in cooperation with many collaborators .
What ownership policies are applicable in these more complex contexts ?
Lifetime .
The lifetime of an object in C++ is the interval of time it exists by occupying memory .
An object is created from one of three " storage classes : " automatic ( local ) , static , and dynamic .
The lifetimes of automatic and static objects are controlled implicitly by the execution of the program .
The lifetime of an automatic object ends when execution exits its block .
The lifetime of a static object continues until the end of the execution of the entire program .
However , the lifetime of a dynamic object continues until the program explicitly destroys that object .
Creator .
A dynamic object is created by the execution of a new expression .
The entity that executes the new expression is the dynamic object 's creator .
The creator may be a ( member ) function , object , or class .
The creator cannot be inferred from the source code alone .
In general , a new expression that creates a dynamic object is executed by a member function ; that member function executes on behalf of an object ; and that object is an instance of a class .
Therefore , the creator of the dynamic object might be deemed to be the function , object , or class .
In the following code , the creator could be the member function f , the object executing A : :f , or the class A .
void A : : f( ) { . . . new Resource . . . }
Although the creator is determined by the intent of the programmer , the language constrains the choice .
If the new expression is executed by a static member function , the creator is either the function or its class .
( There is no object . )
If the new expression is executed by a nonmember function , only the function may be the creator .
( There is neither object nor class . )
Owner .
The owner of a dynamic object is the function , object , or class that bears the responsibility for ending the lifetime of the dynamic object .
Upon creation of a dynamic object , its creator becomes the owner .
A dynamic object may acquire an owner other than its creator .
A dynamic object may have more than one owner at a time .
Ownership does not imply exclusive access to the dynamic object .
Other parts of the program may legitimately access the dynamic object , but that access must be consistent with the owner 's policy .
In particular , other parts of the program must guarantee not to attempt any access after the owner has deleted the object .
The Localized Ownership pattern language contains three primary patterns , of which the first is divided into three sub-cases .
The three patterns are as follows :
Creator As Sole Owner ( Function As Sole Owner , Object As Sole Owner , and Class As Sole Owner ) .
Sequence of Owners .
Shared Ownership .
Although Localized Ownership patterns might be used to manage other resources ( such as files or database locks ) , they are presented specifically in terms of dynamic objects .
There are two reasons for this .
First , the focus on dynamic objects makes the discussion more concrete .
Second , for most C++ programmers , the effort expended on managing dynamic objects dominates the effort expended on managing other resources .
Context .
The creator of a dynamic object is in a position to fully determine the object 's lifetime .
A narrow , specific purpose for the dynamic object suggests that its creator may be able to control its lifetime .
A narrow purpose does not imply that the object is short - lived or that the creator has exclusive access to the object .
Solution .
Upon creation of the dynamic object , its creator becomes the owner .
Ownership responsibility is never transferred ; the creator must eventually dispose of the dynamic object .
Other parts of the system must access the dynamic object according to the owner 's policy .
When the identity of the dynamic object passes through an interface ( such as a pointer or reference as a function parameter or return value ) , constraints on the object 's lifetime must be part of that interface .
The three types of creator result in the following three specializations of this pattern .
Context .
An object with access restricted to the function that creates it , and to other functions whose execution is nested within that function 's execution , is a candidate for sole ownership by the function in which it is created .
The lifetime of the object can be established without considering the lifetimes of any other objects .
Solution .
When the sole owner is a function , that function must eventually delete the object .
The delete expression is coded explicitly in the function .
If the dynamic object is required for only the current invocation of the function , the delete occurs before the function returns to its caller .
If the dynamic object 's lifetime spans many invocations , the function may retain the object from call to call using a local static pointer .
Eventually , the function itself executes the delete when the object is no longer needed .
Examples .
The creator function creates and deletes during a single invocation ; see Listing One .
A function that holds a dynamic buffer from one call to the next is shown in Listing Two .
On each call , the function determines if the current buffer is large enough , allocating a larger buffer when needed .
Context .
The lifetime of the dynamic object cannot be tied to a single function , but its lifetime can be bounded by the lifetime of the object that creates it .
Creation occurs in a nonstatic member function .
Solution .
If the sole owner is an object , then the owner acquired the dynamic object by executing one of its member functions and must delete the dynamic object before the end of its own lifetime .
The last opportunity the owner object has to delete the owned object is during the execution of the owner 's destructor .
Examples .
Stroustrup 's " Resource Allocation is Initialization " is an example of Object As Sole Owner ( see The C++ Programming Language , Second Edition , Addison - Wesley , 1991 ) .
The " Cheshire Cat " technique ( a term coined by John Carolan in " Constructing Bullet - Proof Classes , " Proceedings C++ At Work , SIGS Publications , 1989 ) reduces unwanted , indirect header - file dependencies by moving the private members of a class into an auxiliary object , to which the class delegates its operations .
Typically , the auxiliary structure is dynamically allocated in the constructor and deallocated in the destructor ; see Listing Three .
If a communications Connection object encounters an error , it opens a Window to display pertinent information .
The Connection object lazily defers creation of the Window until an error occurs .
If instructed to clearErrors ( ) , the Connection disposes of the Window if it has one .
If the Connection still holds a Window at the end of its own lifetime , the destructor performs the delete ; see Listing Four .
Context .
Even though there is no single function or object to serve as the owner , the ownership responsibility can be localized to a single class .
The function that creates the object is a static or nonstatic member function of the class .
Solution .
All parts of the class collaborate to determine the lifetime of the owned object .
The implementation of the ownership responsibility is distributed across the member functions as they execute on behalf of all objects of that class .
Static member functions may also participate .
Example .
A Query object provides end - user database services .
Query objects are created and destroyed arbitrarily .
All Query objects share a single DataBase server .
To conserve resources , the DataBase object should exist only when there is at least one Query object .
Collectively , the constructor and destructor of Query use static data members to implement this policy on behalf of the class ; see Listing Five .
Context .
No suitable creator that can assume on - going ownership responsibility can be found .
For example , a factory creates objects on behalf of others .
Once the object has been successfully created , the factory 's ownership responsibility should end , but the created object 's lifetime must not .
Solution .
Ownership may be transferred from the creator to another owner .
Ownership may then be further transferred any number of times .
At each point of transfer , the outgoing owner relinquishes its ownership obligation , whereupon the incoming owner assumes it .
The transfer of ownership must be considered as an explicit part of the interface between the two .
Although the owner may change many times , at any particular time , ownership rests with exactly one owner .
Examples .
The code in Listing Six shows ownership transfer from a factory to a function .
The transfer could as easily be to an object or a class as the incoming owner .
The function in Listing Seven transfers ownership to a local auto_ptr object .
The auto_ptr template is part of the draft C++ standard library ( ANSI Document X3J16/95-0091 , " Working Paper for Draft Proposed International Standard for Information Systems Programming Language C++ , " April 1995 ) .
The only purpose of an auto_ptr object is to assume ownership of a dynamic object .
The auto_ptr destructor deletes the object .
The advantage of transferring ownership to an automatic object is that its destructor will execute under almost all control - flow scenarios that leave the block .
Context .
When a dynamic object is shared widely by diverse components , it may be impossible to identify a single owner or even a sequence of owners .
An object that defies simple characterization and management of its lifetime is likely to be long - lived .
Solution .
Allow arbitrary owners to declare unilateral interest in a dynamic object .
The lifetime of the dynamic object continues until all of the owners have relinquished their interest in it .
Constraints on the owners and the owned object vary depending on the style of implementation .
Examples .
A conventional reference - counted implementation of a string class ( see The C++ Programming Language ) uses Shared Ownership of the representation object , which in turn is Object As Sole Owner of the underlying array of characters .
Usually , the representation class is specifically designed to carry a reference count to support its shared ownership ; that is , the implementation of the ownership intrudes into the class of the owned object .
Ownership is intentionally restricted to the string objects .
Reference counting " smart pointers " ( see Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms , by James Coplien , Addison Wesley , 1992 ) also use Shared Ownership .
As with a reference - counted string class , the mechanism usually intrudes into the owned object and restricts ownership to the smart pointer objects .
The following example demonstrates that the intrusion on the owned object and constraints on the owners are not intrinsically part of the pattern .
Shared ownership information with respect to arbitrary objects is recorded in a global instance of the class Shared .
Shared : : adopt ( ) records an arbitrary owner declaring an interest in an arbitrary object .
Shared : : disown ( ) records an owner relinquishing that interest .
A true result , from disown ( ) , informs the departing owner that no other owners remain , and the dynamic object should be deleted .
Effectively , Shared provides reference counting that constrains neither owner nor owned object ; see Listing Eight .
A Journal object logs messages to a Window .
The current Window is established in its constructor , but may be changed by the bind member function .
A Journal object assumes shared ownership of its Window by registering its ownership with clerk and deleting any unowned Window .
The Window class does not participate in the implementation of this ownership mechanism .
The other owners of Window may be arbitrary functions , objects , and classes .
Journal requires only that they observe the protocol with respect to clerk ; see Listing Nine .
Dangling Pointers .
Any discussion of garbage avoidance often leads to the separate , but related , topic of dangling pointers .
A pointer dangles when use of its value becomes invalid at the end of the lifetime of the object that it addresses .
Use of a dangling pointer is undefined behavior , which can result in a program crash or worse .
A pointer that refers to a dynamic object dangles if the dynamic object is deleted ( by its owner ) .
However , dangling pointers can also arise without the use of dynamic allocation : A pointer to an automatic object dangles if the pointer outlives the object .
A dangling pointer must never be dereferenced .
Reference Counting versus Garbage Collection .
Reference counting ( mentioned with respect to Shared Ownership ) is easily confused with garbage collection .
However , the two mechanisms are not equivalent .
There are circumstances under which reference counting reclaims memory that garbage collection misses , and vice versa .
By tolerating a dangling pointer , reference counting that depends on an explicit decrement operation can recover a dynamic object that garbage collection must retain .
On the other hand , a cycle of mutual references can cause reference counting to overlook a set of objects that garbage collection would reclaim .
Exception Handling .
An exception handling ( EH ) mechanism for C++ ( using termination semantics ) has been proposed in the draft standard , and implementations are becoming available .
Clearly , a nonlocal goto mechanism introduces further analysis in determining that a program is coded correctly , including any use of dynamic memory .
Unfortunately , to date , the C++ community has little experience using EH .
It appears that object state and resource management ( including dynamic memory ) are the two key problems to address when using EH and that resource management is the easier of the two .

Ellen DeGeneres Asks to Use President 's Ranch for Wedding
taped a show on Thursday May 22 , that will air next Wednesday , May 27 , with the first daughterand her mother , first lady .
The ladies chatted about Jenna 's May 10th wedding to
The nuptials took place at the Bush ranch in Crawford , Texas and Jenna brought along photos of the reception .
Ellen , who just announced that she will be marrying partner Portia de Rossi after California lifted the ban on same sex marriage , asked Jenna :
So , the ranch was a great place to get married - it looked like nobody could fly over and get pictures or bother you , really . "
Jenna came back with " Yeah " and Ellen continued , " So , can we borrow it for our wedding , can we get the ranch ? "
Of course Jenna said " sure . "
Actually it 's a moot point because Texas was the 19th state to approve a constitutional ban on same - sex marriage in November 2005 .
It 's definitely fun to think about the absurdity of it - and leave it to Ellen to turn it into a joke .
If you did not get to see Ellen announce her engagement check it out here .
We have a huge spread of Jenna and Henry 's wedding photos here .

hagiography n.1 . the writing of the lives of saints ; 2 . uncritical or idealized biography .
~ Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary
Most Americans have been taught what William Lind calls a comic book version of their own country ’s history .
One aspect of American comic book history , invented in the post - 1865 era , is that from the time of the founding the citizens of the Northern states were generally more civilized , educated , and above all else , moral , than their hillbilly , slave - owning , gun-toting , tobacco - growing , fellow countrymen from the Southern states .
A second element of American comic book history is that the " nation " and its economy were supposedly created by a few Great Men.
Lincoln , for example , is said to be a " redeemer president " who single - handedly gave us " a new birth of freedom . "
" Everything that is good in America today we owe to Lincoln , " the Lincoln idolater Harold Holzer once told a television interviewer .
Similarly , Alexander Hamilton is frequently portrayed as a saintly , god - like , and super - human figure by America ’s court historians because of his fierce and highly effective advocacy of heavy taxation , public debt , central banking , protectionism , mercantilism , hyper- regulation , centralization of governmental power , and Big Government in general .
Biographer Ron Chernow calls Hamilton , a mercantilist who publicly rebuked the writings of Adam Smith , " the prophet of the capitalist revolution in America . "
Neoconservative pundit David Brooks has absurdly claimed that Hamilton single - handedly " created capitalism " ; Forrest McDonald once gave Hamilton all of the credit for America ’s becoming " the richest , most powerful and freest nation in the history of the world " ; neoconservatives William Kristol and David Brooks began their crusade for " national greatness conservatism " ( on display today in Iraq ) with a 1997 Wall Street Journal article that called for a reinvigoration of " the nationalism of Alexander Hamilton " ; and when the Republicans took over Congress in 1994 House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Time magazine that his number - one hero was Alexander Hamilton ( followed John Wayne , Kemal Ataturk , and Father Flanagan ) .
One of the most recent examples of comic book history is a July 5 article in the Wall Street Journal Online entitled " Alexander Hamilton ’s Capital Compromise , " by Fergus M. Bordewich .
The article celebrates the fact that the house Hamilton lived in in New York City is being transformed into a shrine of sorts .
In true hagiographic fashion , Bordewich makes several false claims about his saintly hero .
The first claim , probably motivated by the fact that Hamilton advocated manumission — the ability of slaves to purchase their own freedom — is that Hamilton was " one of the most ardent abolitionists of his generation . "
There are several major problems with this assertion , however : Hamilton was a slave owner ; he never advocated the abolition of slavery per se ; he once purchased six slaves at a slave auction ( for his brother - in - law , says biographer Ron Chernow ) ; and he once returned runaway slaves to their owner .
Hamilton ’s wife Eliza was from a wealthy New York slave - owning family , the Schuylers , and retained some of the " house slaves " after marrying Hamilton .
This fact is mentioned by Hamilton ’s hagiographers , but is usually excused .
For example , in Alexander Hamilton and the Constitution Clinton Rossiter wrote that " Hamilton may have had a slave or two around the house , " and " was too much a man of his age . . . to push for emancipation . "
Moreover , what kind of " abolitionist " is it who attends a slave auction , purchases six slaves , and watches as they are manacled and delivered to a relative where they are doomed to be enslaved for the rest of their lives ?
In his short article Bordewich presents the usual portrayal of moral and civilized Northerners like the " abolitionist " Hamilton , in comparison to retrograde Southerners like Jefferson .
But even Ron Chernow writes of how , in Hamilton ’s time , " Slavery was well entrenched in much of the north " and " New York and New Jersey retained significant slave populations " long after the Revolution .
" New York City , in particular , was identified with slavery . "
By the late 1790s one in five New York City households , like Hamilton ’s , owned slaves who were " regarded as status symbols . "
Slavery was not ended in New York City until the early 1850s ( see Slavery in New York by the New York Historical Society ) .
Bordewich also praises Hamilton for his " audacious plan to consolidate the states ’ debts , and to create a system of credit for the national government which would enable it to recover the trust of the foreign bankers upon whom it depended for future loans . "
Mostly Southern Anti-Federalists " fiercely opposed the plan , predicting that it would lead to overbearing centralization and tyranny by New York and Philadelphia money men . "
The Anti-Federalists were right .
Hamilton schemed to nationalize the war debt , and all the debt held by the states not because he thought it would be the fiscally responsible thing to do , but because he wanted to create a large national debt , period .
If the states were permitted to pay off their own war debts , this would not be possible .
Hamilton called the public debt " a public blessing " because of his belief that it would tie the wealthy ( who would own the government ’s bonds ) of the country to the government , and they would in turn provide political support for higher and higher taxes , to make sure that there was enough money in the treasury to pay off their principal and interest .
In his book Alexander Hamilton , William Graham Sumner wrote that the " controlling motive " of Hamilton with regard to the public debt was " political expediency , " not fiscal responsibility .
His purpose was " to strengthen our infant government by increasing the number of ligaments between the government and the interests of individuals . "
Wealthy individuals , that is .
Hamilton ’s policy of having the federal government nationalize all the old ( state ) government debt was an enormously corrupt scheme .
New bonds were issued , backed by revenue from a new tariff that Hamilton was instrumental in putting into place .
The old war debt was to be cashed out at face value .
The plan " immediately became public knowledge in New York City , " wrote John Steel Gordon in Hamilton ’s Blessing , " but news of it spread only slowly , via horseback and sailing vessel , to the rest of the country . "
This created tremendous arbitrage opportunities for Hamilton ’s friends and political supporters .
New York speculators embarked on a mad scramble down the eastern seaboard to purchase bonds from hapless and unsuspecting war veterans at prices as low as 10 percent of full value .
As Claude Bowers described in his book , Jefferson and Hamilton : " Expresses with very large sums of money on their way to North Carolina for purposes of speculation in certificates splashed and bumped over the wretched winter roads . . . .
Two fast - sailing vessels , chartered by a member of Congress . . . were ploughing the waters southward on a similar mission . "
John Quincy
Adams would later write to his father of how " Christopher Gore , the richest lawyer in Massachusetts , and one of he strongest Bay State supporters of Hamilton ’s [ political ] machine , had made an independent fortune in speculation in the public funds . "
New York newspapers speculated that Robert Morris , a staunch Hamilton supporter , made $ 18 million , while Governor George Clinton of New York pocketed $ 5 million .
Hamilton himself purchased some of the bonds , but he insisted that they were " for his brother - in - law , " just like the slave purchases that he made .
Hamilton succeeded in turning many wealthy people into lobbyists for statism .
As Douglas Adair , an editor of The Federalist Papers , explained : " With devious brilliance , Hamilton set out , by a program of class legislation , to unite the propertied interests of the eastern seaboard into a cohesive administration party , while at the same time he attempted to make the executive dominant over the Congress by a lavish use of the spoils system .
In carrying out this scheme . . .
Hamilton transformed every financial transaction of the Treasury Department into an orgy of speculation and graft in which selected senators , congressmen , and certain of their richer constituents throughout the nation participated . "
Hamilton ’s " system of public credit for the national government , " which is praised by Bordewich and all other Hamiltonian hagiographers , was in reality a recipe for financial irresponsibility and corruption .
As John C. Miller wrote in The Federalist Era , after Hamilton ’s " system " was put into place , " the national debt soared to a total of over $ 80 million .
To service this debt , almost 80 percent of the annual expenditures of the government were required .
During the period 1790 — 1800 , payment of the interest alone of the national debt consumed over 40 percent of the national tax revenue .
For a nation whose government had been tottering on the brink of bankruptcy a few years before , this might well be regarded as a staggering burden of debt . "
Hamilton prevailed politically despite the fact that his crackpot idea of a large public debt being a " public blessing " was a result of the fact that his economic thinking was " befogged in the mists of mercantilism , " as William Graham Sumner wrote .

High blood pressure is linked to dementia A drug used to lower blood pressure could prevent or delay thousands of Alzheimer 's cases , US research has suggested .
People taking angiotensin receptor blockers were up to 40 % less likely to develop dementia than those taking other blood pressure drugs .
And patients already suffering from dementia were less likely to get worse .
The number of people in the UK with dementia is expected to soar to 1.7 million over the next two decades .
This study highlights that it is becoming increasingly important to investigate blood pressure lowering drugs as a potential treatment for dementia
Professor Clive Ballard
Alzheimer 's Society
This could mean an enormous extra burden for families and the taxpayer , but the Boston University School of Medicine research , presented at a conference in Chicago , suggests there could be ways to prevent it .
High blood pressure over long periods can lead to damaged blood vessels , and is known to increase the risk of not only strokes and heart disease , but dementia as well .
Some types of dementia are directly related to the condition of the arteries supplying the brain , but blood pressure is also thought to play a role in Alzheimer 's disease , which is linked to the appearance of protein deposits in brain tissue .
However , the reasons for this are not clear .
Symptom delay
The research looked at records of approximately six million people treated for high blood pressure between 2001 and 2006 .
Those who took angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) were less likely , over that period , to be diagnosed with dementia compared with those on other blood pressure medication such as ACE inhibitors .
If they already had dementia in 2001 , they were 45 % less likely to go on to develop delirium , be admitted to a nursing home , or die prematurely .
This evidence suggests that the drugs , which help prevent the constriction of blood vessels , could not only prevent , or at least delay , the arrival of dementia symptoms , but also slow down the progress of the disease .
ARBs are normally prescribed only to patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors .
Professor Clive Ballard , from the Alzheimer 's Society , said that full clinical trials , following a smaller number of patients over a longer period , were now needed .
" High blood pressure doubles the risk of Alzheimer 's disease and increases risk of stroke - this study highlights that it is becoming increasingly important to investigate blood pressure lowering drugs as a potential treatment for dementia .
" These findings will be important in stimulating further research into the relationship between anti-hypertension drugs and the development of dementia . "

What are these ?
Research at the University of Liverpool has found how Saharan dust storms help sustain life over extensive regions of the North Atlantic Ocean .
Working aboard research vessels in the Atlantic , scientists mapped the distribution of nutrients including phosphorus and nitrogen and investigated how organisms such as phytoplankton are sustained in areas with low nutrient levels .
They found that plants are able to grow in these regions because they are able to take advantage of iron minerals in Saharan dust storms .
This allows them to use organic or ‘ recycled ’ material from dead or decaying plants when nutrients such as phosphorus – an essential component of DNA – in the ocean are low .
Professor George Wolff , from the University ’s Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences , explains : “ We found that cyanobacteria – a type of ancient phytoplankton – are significant to the understanding of how ocean deserts can support plant growth .
Cyanobacteria need nitrogen , phosphorus and iron in order to grow .
They get nitrogen from the atmosphere , but phosphorus is a highly reactive chemical that is scarce in sea water and is not found in the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Iron is present only in tiny amounts in sea water , even though it is one of the most abundant elements on earth .
“ Our findings suggest that Saharan dust storms are largely responsible for the significant difference between the numbers of cyanobacteria in the North and South Atlantic .
The dust fertilises the North Atlantic and allows phytoplankton to use organic phosphorus , but it does n’t reach the southern regions and so without enough iron , phytoplankton are unable to use the organic material and do n’t grow as successfully . ”
Professor Ric Williams , co-author of the research , added : “ The Atlantic is often referred to as an ‘ ocean desert ’ because many nutrients , which are essential in plant life cycles , are either scarce or are only accessible in the darker depths of the ocean .
Plants , however , need some sunlight in order to absorb these important nutrients and so ca n’t always access them from the ocean depths .
They therefore need to find the nutrients from elsewhere .
Now that we are able to show how cyanobacteria make use of organic material we can understand more clearly how life is sustained in the ocean and why it is n’t an ‘ ocean desert . ’
“ These findings are important because plant life cycles are essential in maintaining the balance of gases in our atmosphere .
In looking at how plants survive in this area , we have shown how the Atlantic is able to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the growth of photosynthesising plants . ”
The research is published in Nature GeoScience .
The study also involved scientists at the National Oceanographic Centre , Southampton and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory .
The work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council .
Cold Sugar in Space Provides Clue to the Molecular Origin of Life
Press Release From : National Radio Astronomy Observatory
Posted : Monday , September 20 , 2004
Astronomers using the National Science Foundation 's giant Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope ( GBT ) have discovered a frigid reservoir of simple sugar molecules in a cloud of gas and dust some 26,000 light - years away , near the center of our Milky Way Galaxy .
The discovery suggests how the molecular building blocks necessary for the creation of life could first form in interstellar space .
The astronomers detected the 8 - atom sugar molecule glycolaldehyde in a gas - and - dust cloud called Sagittarius B2 .
Such clouds , often many light - years across , are the raw material from which new stars and planets are formed .
The astronomers detected the same molecule in a warmer part of that cloud in 2000 , but the new detection shows that the sugar exists at an extremely low temperature -- only 8 degrees above absolute zero , the temperature at which all molecular motion stops .
The cold glycolaldehyde detections were surprisingly strong when compared to the original detections and indicate that a considerable quantity of this simple interstellar sugar exists at extremely low temperatures .
Glycoaldehyde is composed of 2 carbon atoms , 2 oxygen atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms and is called a 2 - carbon sugar .
Glycolaldehyde can react with a 3 - carbon sugar to produce a 5 - carbon sugar called ribose .
Ribose molecules form the backbone structure of the molecules DNA and RNA , which carry the genetic code of living organisms .
On Earth , most chemical reactions occur in liquid water .
Conditions are quite different in interstellar space , and most of the complex molecules appear to form on or under the surfaces of tiny dust grains .
In this scenario , smaller molecules such as water , formaldehyde , methane , ammonia , carbon dioxide , or methanol , coat the surfaces and interiors of dust grains in the clouds .
When a shock wave , caused by the infall or outflow of material in the star - formation process , hits the dust grains , it provides the energy to assemble more - complex molecules from the simpler ones , and also to free the newly - formed molecules from the dust grains .
Once the shock has passed , the molecules cool into a cold , thin gas .
Although the chemistry on Earth and in interstellar clouds is much different , the results can be very similar .
This and other recent studies show that prebiotic chemistry -- the formation of the molecular building blocks necessary for the creation of life -- occurs in interstellar clouds long before that cloud collapses to form a new solar system with planets .
" Many of the interstellar molecules discovered to date are the same kinds detected in laboratory experiments specifically designed to synthesize prebiotic molecules .
This fact suggests a universal prebiotic chemistry , " said Jan M. Hollis of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , MD .
This suggests that the molecular building blocks for the creation of life on a new planet might get a head start in the dust of interstellar clouds .
The actual formation of a planetary system is such a hot process that any prebiotic molecules would likely be destroyed .
However , this study has shown that such molecules may form in very cold regions following the passage of a shock wave .
Such conditions might be typical of the outer regions of a young solar system following the star - formation process .
A repository of prebiotic molecules might exist in these outer regions , which is also where comets are formed , the scientists said .
It has long been suggested that a collision with a comet or an encounter with the passing tail of a comet might " seed " a young planet with prebiotic material .
Hollis worked with Philip Jewell of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank , WV , Frank Lovas of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , MD , and Anthony Remijan of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center .
The scientists reported their findings in the September 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The discovery of the cold glycolaldehyde was made by detecting faint radio emission from the molecules .
Molecules rotate end - for -end .
When they change from a higher rotational energy level to a lower energy level , they emit radio waves at precise frequencies .
Conversely , they can absorb radio waves at specific frequencies and change from a lower rotational energy level to a higher one .
A set of frequencies emitted or absorbed by a particular molecule forms a unique " fingerprint " identifying that molecule .
The cold glycolaldehyde was identified both by emission from the molecules and by absorption of radio waves emitted by a background source , all between 13 GHz and 22 GHz in frequency .
" The large diameter and great precision of the GBT made this discovery possible , and also holds the promise of discovering additional new complex interstellar molecules , " Jewell said .
The GBT , dedicated in 2000 , is the world 's largest fully - steerable radio - telescope antenna .
Its dish reflector has more than 2 acres of signal - collecting area .
The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation , operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities , Inc .

This story directly links to a 1998 DIA report on Al Qaeda ’s Central Asia activities obtained by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch which calls the following disclosure a " stunning information point " :
" A good deal of information concerning OBL’s and al Qaeda ’s efforts in Chechnya , the Caucuses , Crimea , and the Central Asian Republics is covered in the ( report ) .
The confirmed existence of a [ secure , reliable , terrorist - sponsored ] " direct route to Chechnya from Pakistan and Afghanistan through Turkey and Azerbaijan " "
In a related article in November 2007 , UK Times covers the case of Turkish Al Qaeda operative , Louai Al - Sakka , an " al - Qaeda Kingpin " who trained the 9/11 hijackers .
The article highlights the key role played by Turkey as a center of al - Qaeda - related activities :
" ( Sakka 's ) ability to keep providing high - quality forged papers made Turkey a main hub for Al - Qaeda movements , " his lawyer says .
Sakka ’s lawyer said : " Just like there is money laundering , there is also terrorist laundering and Turkey was the centre of this . " "
As mentioned in my earlier piece , a large number of detained and captured terrorists have had Turkish passports - both real and fake .
Here is a list of just a few of many documented cases of Turkish terrorists :
* Turkish citizen Soitekin
Ollu admitted that he was an active member of an al - Qaeda linked organization from 2001 - 2005 and had operated in Chechnya ( source ) * A German man with a Turkish passport , Zafer Sari , and Turkish - born Adem Yilmaz , both " accused conspirators " in a bomb - making plot in Germany , had received training in Pakistan " to prepare chemical explosives and military - grade detonators " ( source
* Egyptian man , Wael Abdel Rahman Kishk , arrested in 2002 with " a fake Egyptian pilot 's uniform , phony documents identifying him as a pilot and a forged certificate from a Florida flight school " had a fake Turkish passport ( source )
* Turkish citizen , Genan Ahmet , was convicted " for organizing several terrorist acts " in Kyrgyzstan in 2000 .

Well - Guarded Secrets
Turkey 's involvement in nuclear black - market , illegal weapon trafficking , narcotics , the Islamization of Central Asia , and illegal activities within the US Government are also very well - guarded secrets .
Turkey ’s Lead Role in Afghan Heroin Trade is One of the Best Kept Stories of the Wars on Terror & Drugs
According to the State Department 's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs ' 2006 Report :
* Turkey is a major transit route for Southwest Asian opiates to Europe , and serves as a base and refining center for major narcotics traffickers and brokers ....
* Turkey is also a base of operations for international narcotics traffickers and associates trafficking in opium , morphine base , heroin , precursor chemicals and other drugs .
The majority of these opiates originate in Afghanistan , and are ultimately trafficked to Western Europe .
* Turkey remains a major route , refining center and storage , production and staging area , for the flow of heroin to Europe .
Turkish - based traffickers and brokers operate in conjunction with narcotics smugglers , laboratory operators , and money launderers in and outside Turkey .
They finance and control the smuggling of opiates to and from Turkey .
Afghanistan is the source of most of the opiates reaching Turkey .
* Opiates and hashish also are smuggled to Turkey overland from Afghanistan via Turkmenistan , Azerbaijan , and Georgia .
In 1997 , British Home Office Minister Tom stated that 80 % of the heroin seized in Britain came from Turkey , and that his government was concerned by reports that members of the Turkish police , and even of the Turkish government , were involved in drug trafficking .
In 1998 France 's Le Monde Diplomatique reported that :
" [ T ]he MIT ( Turkey 's Intelligence agency ) itself accuses its rival organisation , Turkey ’s national police , of having " provided police identity cards and diplomatic passports to members of a group which , in the guise of anti-terrorist activities , traveled to Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium , Hungary and Azerbaijan to engage in drug trafficking .
Further , journalist Adrian Gatton quotes Chris Harrison , a senior Customs officer in Manchester , that Customs could not get at the Turkish kingpins because they are " protected " at a high level .
Drug Trafficking Finances Terrorism
With 93 % of worldwide heroin supplynow coming from Afghanistan , groups like al - Qaeda and the Taliban necessarily benefit from this trade with their Turkish partners .
Despite the odd attempts by the US government to cut off money flows to terrorist groups by focusing on charities , most of the funding comes from trafficking in drugs .
" We now know Al Qaeda 's dominant source of funding is the illegal sale of narcotics . "
" ... al - Qaeda and its Taliban allies are increasingly financing operations with opium sales .
Anti-drug officials in Afghanistan have no hard figures on how much al - Qaeda and the Taliban are earning from drugs , but conservative estimates run into tens of millions of dollars . "
* In 2004 , the Washington Times quoted Rep. Kirk - IL , a member of the House Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee saying : Time Magazine reported in 2004 :
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds summed up the situation in Part Two of her Highjacking of the Nation series :
" We know that Al Qaeda and Taliban ’s main source of funding is the illegal sale of narcotics .
Based on all the reports , facts , and expert statements , we know that Turkey is a major , if not the top , player in the transportation , processing , and distribution of all the narcotics derived from the Afghan poppies , and as a result , it is the major contributing country to Al Qaeda .
Yet , to date , more than five years into our over exhaustive ‘ war on terror propaganda ’ , have we heard any mentioning of , any tough message to , any sanction against , or any threat that was issued and targeted at Turkey ? "
Turkey ’s Active Participation in Nuclear Black - Market and Illegal Weapon Trafficking is one of the Best Kept Stories of the War on Terror & WMD
* As reported in the New York Times , at least two Turkish businessmen were key suppliers to A.Q. Khan 's nuclear proliferation network .
Turkey was used to manufacture hardware for the network , and was also used for trans - shipment of nuclear technology on the black market .
When authorities intercepted a ship called BBC China as it was delivering nuclear hardware to Libya in 2003 , consignments from Turkish Businessman , Gunes Cire and Selim Alguadis , were found on board .
* As far back as 2000 , Bill Clinton was forced to halt a deal to supply Turkey with nuclear technology because of Turkey 's role in the nuclear black market .
" Turkish agents in Washington ... were selling the information on to ( nuclear ) black market buyers , including Pakistan . "
" falsified end - user certificates on weapons purchased in the United States to enable sales to third countries not allowed access to the technology .
Principal recipients include the five " Stans " in central Asia — Pakistan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Kazakhstan . "
* In another case covered extensively by the LA Times PBS : Turkish businessman Zeki Bilmen of Giza Technologies in New Jersey shipped nuclear detonators to the AQ Khan network in Pakistan via South Africa .
Both the US mainstream media and the court documents ( pdf ) in the case , while they named the nationalities of all players and companies involved in this case , they excluded the nationality of Bilmen and Giza Technologies .
* Further proof of Turkey 's involvement in the nuclear black market came in early 2008 in the UK's Times .
The Times reported that :* In 2008 , Phil Giraldi , former CIA operative stationed in Turkey , discussed Turkey 's role in using : * According to a report by Turkish Atomic Energy Authority ( TAEA ) , at least 104 nuclear smuggling incidents had occurred in the past eight years in Turkey .
For instance , in September 1999 , 5 Kilograms of Uranium enriched to 4.6 percent were confiscated from an international smuggling ring in Turkey , which included four Turkish , one Azerbaijani , and three Kazakhstani citizens .
The report cites over one hundred incidents like this , and these are only cases that have been intercepted and reported .
Turkey ’s Operations in Islamization of Central Asia & Balkans via Mosques and Madrassas is one of the Best Kept Stories in US Pipeline Politics
* In 1999 , Washington Times reported that :
" Some members of the Kosovo Liberation Army , which has financed its war effort through the sale of heroin , were trained in terrorist camps run by international fugitive Osama bin Laden ...
" For the past 10 years , the most senior leaders of al Qaeda have visited the Balkans , including bin Laden himself on three occasions between 1994 and 1996 .
The Egyptian surgeon turned terrorist leader Ayman Al - Zawahiri has operated terrorist training camps , weapons of mass destruction factories and money - laundering and drug - trading networks throughout Albania , Kosovo , Macedonia , Bulgaria , Turkey and Bosnia .
This has gone on for a decade . "
* Similarly , the Wall Street Journal , Europe reported in 2001 : * Turkish organizations such as the Gulen ' movement , ' a $ 25 billion economic powerhouse , reportedly financed by the CIA , Saudi Arabia and Turkey , has been establishing madrassas and mosques across Central Asia - including Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan - for the past decade .
The construction and operation of these madrassas and mosques appear to serve a number of purposes :
Indoctrination and radicalization of students
Providing a front for CIA and State Department - sanctioned ' teachers ' to operate with the protection of Diplomatic passports .
" Construction of mosques and religious schools accelerated in the 1990s , with financial help from Turkey , Egypt , and , primarily , Saudi Arabia . "
" Since 1990 ...
More religious institutions , including religious schools and mosques , have appeared , many with the support of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Turkey . "
* The Gulen movement itself has " a university , eleven high schools , one primary school and nine education facilities training university applicants " in Azerbaijan , while the Turkish government itself is " sponsoring Islamic educational projects " featuring " a specifically Turkish form of Islam in this Shi‘a majority country . " *
We see the same pattern of mosque building in Kazakhstan .
Wikipedia states that :*
And we see more of the same in Turkmenistan
The US government support and use of Turkey as a proxy in Central Asia and the Islamization activities in these ex-Soviet States have been guarded as State Secrets and " covert operations . "
I covered this operation and Gulen 's movement in my two previous pieces here and here .
An FBI whistleblower case involving Turkey and Central Asia is one of the most gagged and Best Kept Secrets
Here is how the US government ensured that Edmonds ' case involving Turkey and Central Asia remains a best kept secret :
* The US Justice Dept invoked the State Secrets Privilege on Edmonds case in 2002 .
Here is the press release from the DoJ announcing the decision .
* The US Justice Dept invoked the State Secrets Privilege a second time in 2003 ( pdf ) when Sibel was subpoenaed in a 911 - related civil case .
The Justice Department quashed the subpoena in an emergency motion " in order to protect the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States . "
* New York
Times front page story in 2003 reports : Justice Department Gags Congress in Sibel Edmonds case .
Senator Grassley said , " This is about as close to a gag order as you can get . "
* When the FBI 's Inspector General issued a report which vindicated Sibel 's case , it was immediately classified .
A redacted version of the report which was recently released ( pdf ) is 90 % blacked out .
A recent NPR report on Sibel 's case calls this document a " must read . "
* The media and the public are barred from Edmonds ' court appeal , reported Washington Post in 2005 .
" The court 's unusual decision to close arguments prompted a challenge by Edmonds 's attorneys .
That challenge was supported by news organizations , including the Associated Press . "
Turkey & Central Asia : Best Kept Secrets
Major stories and cases involving Turkey and Central Asia , whether it is Turkish militants entering Afghanistan to join al - Qaeda , or Turkish operatives involved in Islamization and radicalization in Central Asia via mosques and madrassas , or the Turkish dealers running heroin trade and nuclear black market operations , or a US citizen and FBI whistleblower whose case involves Turkish and Central Asian targets in the US , are always , as Professor Williams says , Best Kept Stories .

There are times when a good man gets screwed and yet can't say a word , which leaves it for somebody else to stand on an orange crate and say , " Hey !
This stinks ! "
Such is the case with 2nd Lieutenant Caleb Campbell , U.S. Army .
2nd Lt. Campbell was a surprisingly fine safety for Army the past four years .
So surprisingly fine that in April he was selected in the seventh round of the NFL draft by the Detroit Lions , the first West Point cadet taken in 11 years .
The Lions picked him because the Army assured the NFL it had a policy allowing cadets with " exceptional skills " to delay military service and go pro as a way of pumping up recruiting .
So the tiny town of Perryton , Texas , threw Campbell a big party in the church basement the day before he left for training camp since , not only was he the first local kid to go to West Point , he was the first one ever drafted .
Campbell flew to Detroit and got his jersey ( No. 47 , in honor of All - Pro safety John Lynch ) and a locker with his nameplate on it and his playbook .
And in mid-July he got a room at a Dearborn Marriott , just like all the other rookies , and stayed up wondering what the NFL was all going to be like .
And then , the day before camp began , Lions GM Matt Millen called Campbell and his playbook into his office and told him it was all over .
The Army was rescinding the policy .
Campbell had to report immediately .
Turns out the Army had no business having such a policy .
Turns out the Department of Defense insists any service academy athlete who 's drafted serve at least two years immediately after graduation , skills or no skills .
And those two years can't be at Ford Field .
Turns out that when the Navy and Air Force heard that Campbell was getting a special deal , they freaked .
Navy 's athletic director even called it a " significant " recruiting handicap .
Funny , since it was the Navy that allowed former Midshipman Napoleon McCallum to play his rookie year with the L.A. Raiders while stationed at a Long Beach naval base .
2nd Lt. Campbell felt like he was hit in the nose with a shovel .
Every day during his four years at West Point , he was reminded of and lived by the Cadet Honor Code : A cadet will not lie , cheat , steal , or tolerate those who do .
Instead the Army lied to 2nd Lt. Caleb Campbell .
Now he gets to tolerate it .
First , he cried , but then he bucked up .
He did n't file a lawsuit or punch a wall or ask questions you or I would 've asked , such as , " The Army revised the policy on July 8 .
Why did it take until July 23 , the night before camp started , to tell me ? "
Or , " Why can't I be grandfathered in , the way Army baseball players Nick Hill and Milan Dinga are being allowed to finish their season in the minor leagues ? "
All Campbell did was throw his shoulders back and say , " I went to the academy to be a soldier . "
But here 's what stinks .
Campbell did go to West Point to lead men into battle , but then he found out he was good enough to play on Sundays .
At the end of his sophomore season , he could 've transferred out , without penalty , to a big - time football college like Oklahoma or Michigan .
But then head coach Bobby Ross told him about the Army 's best - of - both - world 's policy .
Campbell stayed .
So the Army got two more years out of him , and all the boffo draft publicity — fans chanting " USA ! USA ! " at Radio City Music
Hall — before it ran him full speed into a brick wall .
" I never thought [ my football career ] would end this way , " Campbell says .
" I thought it would be a knee .
Or I 'd get cut .
My dream was to play in the NFL .
But my other dream was to be an officer in the greatest army in the world .
Now I 'm down to the best of one world , I guess .
I 'm a soldier and I 'm going to see the task through . "
And what task is that , you ask ?
Serving as an assistant coach for Army 's football team this season , followed by reassignment , perhaps to Iraq or Afghanistan .
Which brings up another question Campbell wo n't ask : " How is coaching football at West Point any more valuable to the war effort than playing it in Detroit ? "
What could be better for Army morale than 2nd Lt. Campbell starring in the NFL every Sunday and soldiers gathering around TV sets overseas , rooting their boots off for one of their own , secretly relieved he's on a team where losses do n't go home in bags ?
" Lt. Campbell is the kind of leader our soldiers deserve , " an Army spokesman said .
The question is : Does the Army deserve 2nd Lt. Campbell ?

Anyone seen my rubber ring ?
The world 's most crowded swimming pool
Someone floated the idea and they all went with it .
But once in the water , trying to swim a few lengths was suddenly out of the question .
In fact , there was treading room only when thousands of swimmers crowded into a pool in Penglai in Sichuan , western China .
Water crowd : China 's swimming pools are hugely popular
Families are gradually returning to the area after May 's devastating earthquake - In one of the world 's most populous countries , the fact there was no elbow room in the pool was not going to stop the fun .
But despite their collection of colourful rubber rings , the swimmers could n't float about for too long .
The resort has become popular with China 's rising middle class who take day - trips to the scenic spot .
Government officials say the increase in tourists is due to it now being safe to return to the Sichuan area after the devastating earthquake in May .
Official figures say around 70,000 people died in the natural disaster , which left 4.8 million people homeless .
It is the biggest natural disaster to hit China since 1976 .
Fibre - optic cables , which use light signals to transmit data , carry more than 95 per cent of the world 's internet and telephone traffic .
They are faster and capable of carrying more data than satellite technology .
The increased use of video downloads , from sites such as YouTube , means that global bandwidth useage more than doubles every 18 months .

After obtaining a federal judge ’s approval to unseal the documents in the anthrax investigation , the FBI has released selected documents relating to its case against Bruce Ivins .
Those documents can be viewed here .
I ’m in the process of reviewing these documents and will post preliminary thoughts here as I do so , updating this post as I make my way through them , and then will undoubtedly have more to write after I am able to speak with some experts with regard to the FBI ’s scientific claims .
One critical caveat to keep at the forefront of one ’s mind is that when one side is in exclusive possession of all documents and can pick and choose which ones to release in full or in part in order to make their case , while leaving out the parts that undercut the picture they want to paint – which is exactly what the FBI is doing here — then it is very easy to make things look however you want .

Cosmetic Surgery & Reconstructive Surgical Medical Clinic
“ I believe that elective surgery must be performed in a safe and conservative manner with the highest level of attention to detail and service .
As the demand for cosmetic procedures increases , physicians have an increased responsibility to provide their patients with honest and accurate information about different options and to emphasize patient safety and natural results .
It is the responsibility of the patients to adequately investigate doctor ’s credentials and qualifications and to be critical of procedures that make unrealistic promises .
I recognize the importance of technology and offer my patients the state of the art in non-surgical rejuvenation .
However , I am careful about my choice of products and not easily impressed by the latest “ fad ” .

From MSNBC :
Beverly Hills is one of the most fertile oil fields in Los Angeles , producing nearly a million barrels a year .
Many wells are camouflaged or hidden inside buildings .
Not far from here , in Wilmington , they churn out far more oil — in fact , the Department of Energy calls Wilmington the third largest oil field in the 48 contiguous states .
With oil prices so high , all over Los Angeles people are digging , or restarting , wells — even ones that only turn out 10 barrels a day .
Conservative estimates are that California is sitting on three billion barrels of accessible oil .
In Los Angeles , there are three challenges :
The fields are old , there ’s too much urban sprawl to drill easily , and there ’s a lack of rigs and crews .
Also , the oil here is much heavier than the stuff they pull out of west Texas , meaning it ’s less profitable .
Perhaps most pleasantly surprised all by this are the thousands of individuals who own the mineral rights to the land where drilling is happening , moms and pops whose families have owned those rights for years .
I would like to see oil derricks in the following celebrities ’ backyards * :
– Pamela Anderson
– Michael Jackson
– Tori Spelling
– Steven Segal
– OJ Simpson
– David Hasselhoff
Seriously , I wonder where else smaller mom-and - pop operations will become lucrative in coming years …

Aug. 20 , 2008 -- Children can be quite imaginative .
But how often does a child fool an adult into believing that something did n't happen ?
New research shows that children are able to fool adults quite readily when it comes to believing that a real event did not actually happen .
But adults were a bit better at sniffing out the truth when a child lied about a false event , filling in the blanks to pretend that it took place .
Study co-author Gail Goodman , PhD , says in a news release that " the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system , mostly as a result of abuse cases , has motivated intense scientific effort to understand children 's true and false reports . "
Goodman is a psychology professor with the University of California , Davis .
She and her team had more than 100 adults view videotapes of 3 - to 5 - year - old boys and girls being interviewed about certain made - up or real events .
The children were asked things like : " Who was there when you got in trouble because you were playing on the rocks ? "
Some of those events actually did take place ; others were made up .
For the events that did happen , children either confirmed that it took place or denied that it occurred .
When it came to the made - up events , children either fibbed , saying that it did in fact happen , or they truthfully said that it did not take place .
The adult participants were then asked to watch the videotapes and to act as if they were a juror on a real case .
The researchers found that adults were " relatively " able to nail the made - up events .
But when it came to the denials , adults tended to believe when children lied that an event did not happen when it actually did occur .
Adults were " especially likely " to believe that a child was telling the truth when they made a denial .
" The findings suggest that adults are better at detecting false reports than they are at detecting false denials , " Goodman says .
She says that " while accurately detecting false reports protects innocent people from false allegations , the failure to detect false denials could mean that adults fail to protect children who falsely deny actual victimization . "
LAS VEGAS —
At the Defcon security conference today , the Electronic Frontier Foundation held a press conference saying it is representing the MIT hackers who figured out how to get free rides on Boston ’s subways .
That raises the stakes in a dispute about whether the three undergraduates have the right to describe their work hacking electronic payment cards without violating the federal computer fraud and abuse statute .
At the same time , the EFF confirmed that a federal judge today ordered that the three hackers could not go forward with their scheduled talk on Sunday .
Kurt Opsahl , senior staff attorney at the EFF , said the group would appeal the ruling on First Amendment grounds .
On Friday , the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority sued the three students ( they also named MIT officials in a motion , but not in the actual lawsuit ) , alleging that the talk would subject it to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses .
The EFF is defending the hackers as part of its Coder ’s Rights project announced earlier in the week and said that the three young men had the First Amendment right to speak about the flaws they found in the CharlieCard magnetic stripe cards and radio - frequency identification tags used by the MBTA .
The problem with the suit ’s timing is that it was filed after Defcon organizers had already given out thousands of CDs with the students ’ paper on it .
The baby - faced students — Zack Anderson , 21 , R.J. Ryan , 22 , and Alessandro Chiesa , 20 — attended the press conference .
Afterward , in a meeting with reporters , they said they were frightened about their legal exposure .
Each time they were asked something , they looked over at their attorney to get a nod of approval .
The case has been moving swiftly .
The students scheduled the Defcon talk months ago .
Their professor , Ron Rivest , a famous cryptographer , agreed to help the students get in touch with the MBTA in late July .
Rivest told the students that he was told by the agency that the “ FBI was investigating . ”
On July 30 , a vendor notified the MBTA about the content of the talk .
On Aug. 5 , the students , MIT , and the MBTA ’s attorneys held a meeting .
The description of the talk changed slightly , with the description of “ free rides ” deleted .
Opsahl said the students came away from that meeting with the impression that the matter had been resolved .
But the MBTA then filed its lawsuit on late Friday .
The EFF agreed to represent the students that day and worked all night to prepare for the emergency hearing today .
Opsahl termed the order issued at 1:30 pm Eastern time today by Judge Douglas P. Woodlock a “ gag order . ” Marcia Hoffman , another staff attorney for the EFF , said the order would have a chilling effect on other security researchers who find bugs and warn companies and the public about them .
Despite statements made by the MBTA to Rivest , Opsahl said the students were not the subject of an FBI investigation .
“ The court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion , ” Opsahl said .
During the press conference before hundreds of Defcon attendees , the crowd broke out with hoots as Opsahl noted that the court did not prevent anyone else from distributing information that the students supplied in the paper .
Some publications were planning to post the material on the Internet .
Moreover , the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald have already published stories about the flaws in the MBTA electronic payment system .
In the Netherlands , the courts declined to grant a request to stop the publication of similar information about hacking the payment system for the rail system there .
“ We think they should invest their time in improving the security of their own system , ” Opsahl said .
The students declined to answer many questions .
But they said they did the work as part of a final project at an MIT class .
Opsahl said it was not the intention of the students to disclose exactly how to hack the electronic payment system .
“ We believe in the system and would like a resolution , ” said Ryan .
“ We disagree with the ruling but we are not going to disoebey it , ” added Anderson .
“ Sorry we ca n’t talk more . ”

Physicists , start your engines .
Officials at CERN , the European Center for Nuclear Research , outside Geneva , announced Thursday that their new particle accelerator , the world ’s largest , would begin operation on Sept. 10 .
On that date , the physicists and engineers will make the first attempt to circulate a beam of protons around a 17 - mile - long super - cooled underground racetrack known as the Large Hadron Collider .
The collider , 14 years and $ 8 billion in the making , has been built to smash together protons that have been accelerated to energies of 7 trillion electron volts , and examine the remains for clues to the origin of mass and new forces and particles in the universe .
But the collisions will not happen immediately .
The first step on the journey to new physics will happen this weekend , when engineers test their method of injecting high - energy protons , which are produced in a separate accelerator , the Super Proton Synchrotron , into the collider by sending a batch through one part of the racetrack .
In September , the first protons to circle the entire ring will have a relatively modest energy of 450 billion electron volts .
Once the physicists and engineers have learned to drive their new machine and had a few collisions at that energy , they will ramp up the energy as fast as they can to 5 trillion electron volts  unexplored territory .
There are over a dozen people working at our fair Gizmodo , but as a Windows user , I 'm in a definite minority .
I still rock XP , and I 'm pretty happy with that .
Why have n't I switched to Macs ?
Plenty of reasons , not least of which being that I 'm just too smart to switch to a Mac .
That 's right , I 'm too smart for Macs .
As Bill Gates 's retirement rapidly approaches I figured now is a good time to lay out why I 'm loyal to his OS .

I grew up with Windows .
Although my first computer was a Mac Classic ( I was like 3 at the time , and I only used it to play that helicopter game where you have to drop the little man into the horse - drawn hay carriage ) , I 've been using Windows PCs for nearly my entire life , learning how to fiddle with the command prompt in DOS and dealing with the rudimentary pile of crap that was Windows 3.1 .
I survived Windows 95 , Windows 98 , Windows ME for a short , painful time , Windows 2000 and now , finally , Windows XP .
It has n't always been pretty ( see : Windows ME ) , but through it all I 've figured out every little trick there is to know about running Windows .
I 'm a monster on Windows .
And yeah , while some of those earlier versions were essentially garbage , running Mac as your OS was n't all that great a choice either , especially before OS X came out .
Yes , fanboys , I know you love your Macs and everything , but come on :
The OS never really came into its own as a real competitor to Windows until 2001 .
By then , it was too late for me .

And while I used to be pretty into PC gaming , the whole no - good - games - on - Macs thing does n't bother me so much anymore .
It 's just that to me , when it comes down to it , the PC just feels more logical .
Windows is an OS that feels structured and it makes sense just because I 'm used to them .
Macs feel more nebulous and more dumbed down , like the corners have been softened to not intimidate your mom when she uses your computer .
Well , I like having the corners exposed .
I like tinkering in the registry to improve performance , I like being able to really tweak the system at the base level .
Windows has its engine exposed , and while it might not always be pretty , if you know what you 're doing you really have access to the whole thing .
And hardware choices are choices I cherish as are access to plenty of apps .
Apple takes pride in hiding everything under the rug and keeping it out of your hands to not let you mess it up .
I do n't need kid gloves .
Furthermore , beyond the OS itself , I hate the cult of personality that surrounds Steve Jobs .
I like the soon - to - be- retired Bill Gates way more than Steve Jobs , because the guy cares about more than just making enough money to build a castle for himself out of stacks of $ 100 bills ( not that Bill ca n't do that ) .
Bill Gates is going to be remembered for seriously impacting the global health climate for the better .
After all , the Nobel Prize is named after the dude who invented TNT , but his name is invoked a lot more often for encouraging advancements in science , literature and peace .
And chances are , if the Gates Foundation keeps chugging along , Gates may even win a Nobel .
Steve Jobs , on the other hand , just makes pretty plastic objects , and when it comes down to it , he seems like kind of a greedy dick .
I 'm more than happy to not give him any more money .

And you know what ?
Macs are too hip .
Oh , look at me !
I do graphic design !
I wear women 's jeans and hang out in coffee shops !
I 'm a DJ !
Well good for you .
My computer is not a fashion statement .
It 's a computer .
But really , when it comes down to it , the main reason I still use Windows is this : I 'm stubborn and lazy .
I do n't want to switch because it will amount to admitting that I 've been wrong for the last 15 years or so .
And it would be just a huge pain to do it even if I swallowed my pride , having to relearn all the shortcuts and commands and little nuances that make an OS tick .
I know all those for Windows already .
I am just far too lazy to relearn OS X , and I do n't care how easy you claim it is .
I 've made my choice , and I 'm sticking by it .
At least until I buy my next computer , because I sure as hell do n't want to have to use Vista .
I mean , I like Windows , but I 'm not crazy .
On November 16 , 2005 , Willie “ Bo ” Mitchell and three co-defendants — Shelton “ Little Rock ” Harris , Shelly “ Wayne ” Martin , and Shawn Earl Gardner — appeared for a hearing in the modern federal courthouse in downtown Baltimore , Maryland .
The four African American men were facing federal charges of racketeering , weapons possession , drug dealing , and five counts of first - degree murder .
For nearly two years the prosecutors had been methodically building their case , with the aim of putting the defendants to death .
In Baltimore , which has a murder rate eight times higher than that of New York City , such cases are depressingly commonplace .
A few minutes after 10 a.m. , United States District Court Judge Andre M. Davis took his seat and began his introductory remarks .
Suddenly , the leader of the defendants , Willie Mitchell , a short , unremarkable looking twenty - eight - yearold with close - cropped hair , leapt from his chair , grabbed a microphone , and launched into a bizarre soliloquy .
“ I am not a defendant , ” Mitchell declared .
“ I do not have attorneys . ”
The court “ lacks territorial jurisdiction over me , ” he argued , to the amazement of his lawyers .
To support these contentions , he cited decades - old acts of Congress involving the abandonment of the gold standard and the creation of the Federal Reserve .
Judge Davis , a Baltimore - born African American in his late fifties , tried to interrupt .
“ I object , ” Mitchell repeated robotically .
Shelly Martin and Shelton Harris followed Mitchell to the microphone , giving the same speech verbatim .
Their attorneys tried to intervene , but when Harris ’s lawyer leaned over to speak to him , Harris shoved him away .
Judge Davis ordered the three defendants to be removed from the court , and turned to Gardner , who had , until then , remained quiet .
But Gardner , too , intoned the same strange speech .
“ I am Shawn Earl Gardner , live man , flesh and blood , ” he proclaimed .
Every time the judge referred to him as “ the defendant ” or “ Mr. Gardner , ” Gardner automatically interrupted : “ My name is Shawn Earl Gardner , sir . ”
Davis tried to explain to Gardner that his behavior was putting his chances of acquittal or leniency at risk .
“ Do n’t throw your life away , ” Davis pleaded .
But Gardner would n’t stop .
Judge Davis concluded the hearing , determined to find out what was going on .
As it turned out , he was n’t alone .
In the previous year , nearly twenty defendants in other Baltimore cases had begun adopting what lawyers in the federal courthouse came to call “ the flesh - and - blood defense . ”
The defense , such as it is , boils down to this :
As officers of the court , all defense lawyers are really on the government ’s side , having sworn an oath to uphold a vast , century - old conspiracy to conceal the fact that most aspects of the federal government are illegitimate , including the courts , which have no constitutional authority to bring people to trial .
The defendants also believed that a legal distinction could be drawn between their name as written on their indictment and their true identity as a “ flesh and blood man . ”
Judge Davis and his law clerk pored over the case files , which led them to a series of strange Web sites .
The fleshand - blood defense , they discovered , came from a place far from Baltimore , from people as different from Willie Mitchell as people could possibly be .
Its antecedents stretched back decades , involving religious zealots , gun nuts , tax protestors , and violent separatists driven by theories that had fueled delusions of Aryan supremacy and race war in gun-loaded compounds in the wilds of Montana and Idaho .
Although Mitchell and his peers did n’t know it , they were inheriting the intellectual legacy of white supremacists who believe that America was irrevocably broken when the 14th Amendment provided equal rights to former slaves .
It was the ideology that inspired the Oklahoma City bombing , the biggest act of domestic terrorism in the nation ’s history , and now , a decade later , it had somehow sprouted in the crime - ridden ghettos of Baltimore .
The series of events that led to the prosecution of Willie Mitchell et al are as convoluted , tragic and intermittently absurd as an episode of HBO ’s acclaimed Baltimore crime drama , The Wire .
Mitchell and company came of age on the streets of West Baltimore , a few miles and a world away from the rejuvenated inner harbor and the tourist attractions near the federal courthouse .
According to prosecutors , the group began selling drugs together as teenagers in the mid-1990s , driving up I -95 to New York City , buying half kilos of cocaine in upper Manhattan and cooking it into crack to sell back home .
They added heroin to their repertoire a few years later , as well as robbing and killing other drug dealers .
By 2002 , they were firmly established in what passes as normal enterprise in a hollowed - out economy like Baltimore , where the drug trade often provides more opportunity than legitimate work and the bedrock institutions of family and school have crumbled .
They had children out of wedlock with multiple women .
They were occasionally arrested , although they never served much time .
It was an insular culture where a ruthless prohibition against “ snitching ” to the police was often more powerful than any law .
Even as cities like New York saw the murder rate decline dramatically , drug killings in Baltimore continued at a steady clip .
According to the indictment , the end began on February 18 , 2002 , in a downtown Baltimore nightclub called Hammerjacks , where Mitchell got into a dispute and stabbed a fellow drug dealer in the back , seriously wounding him .
If Mitchell had hoped to get away with this attempted murder , he was swiftly and brutally set straight by the drug dealer ’s associates .
When police on patrol found Mitchell later that evening , he was on a sidewalk with several men jumping on his head .
Mitchell survived the assault , but he remained in serious trouble .
The police had issued a warrant for his arrest ; more ominously , his enemies had placed a $ 10,000 contract on his head .
Mitchell probably did n’t know exactly what his enemies had in mind , but he was seasoned enough to realize that they wanted him killed .
Ten days after the club incident , prosecutors allege , he made a phone call to an associate of the men who had beaten him up .
The associate was a drug dealer named Oliver “ Woody ” McCaffity .
Mitchell proposed that the two men meet that evening for a drug deal .
Neither man came to the meeting alone .
Mitchell brought a friend , Shelton Harris .
McCaffity brought his sometime girlfriend , Lisa Brown .
Brown was a pastor ’s daughter , a computer systems analyst and mother of three .
Her parents told reporters that she had broken up with McCaffity after learning of his involvement with drugs .
But when he called and invited her to the movies , she decided to go along .
The two parties drove to the Park Heights section of Northwest Baltimore .
It was a quick meeting .
Mitchell and Harris climbed into the backseat of McCaffity ’s Infiniti Q - 45 .
Then they shot McCaffity through the head and fired through Brown ’s raised right hand into her left temple , where police later found a .357 caliber bullet .
The bodies of McCaffity and Brown were left in the car , which rolled downhill and rammed into a nearby tree at the dead - end of the street .
Police found it two hours later .
A palm print on the car window was later matched to Harris , and McCaffity ’s cell phone records revealed calls that night to Mitchell ’s phone .
Mitchell , suspecting that McCaffity ’s associates were going to try to kill him , had apparently decided to kill first .
The murder would probably not have attracted much attention , except for the fact that McCaffity ’s Infiniti was owned by Hasim Rahman , the recently dethroned heavyweight boxing champion of the world .
McCaffity was a friend and business associate of Rahman , causing the ex-champ to quickly call a press conference denying any involvement in the crimes .
( Police have never alleged otherwise . )
If the killing of McCaffity and Brown had been a successful preemptive strike , Mitchell was also prepared to kill for more mundane reasons .
On March 24 , a few weeks after the Mc- Caffity murder , Mitchell allegedly called a former high school classmate named Darryl Wyche and offered to buy some heroin and cocaine from him .
Darryl , excited by the prospect of a big sale , agreed .
The two made plans to meet in a nearby industrial park around midnight .
Again , neither party came alone .
Wyche brought his younger brother Tony , who had reluctantly agreed to drive .
Mitchell brought Harris again , as well as two more friends : Shelly Martin and Shawn Gardner .
The Wyche brothers opened the back door of their Honda to let Mitchell and his men into the back seat .
Then each received a bullet in the side of the head .
The next morning the police found the bodies , seat belts still on .
( Mitchell appears to have seen Wyche as an easy source of drugs and cash . )
But Mitchell ’s luck was about to end .
When Baltimore homicide detectives found the bodies of the Wyche brothers , they assumed they had come across another hard - to - solve drug killing .
Then they received an unexpected phone call .
It was from Darryl Wyche ’s mother - in - law , who reported finding a strange message on her phone .
Recorded at 12:43 a.m. , the message was four and a half minutes of a group of men with names like “ Wayne ” and “ Shorty ” saying things like “ Bup - bup - bup - bup - bup , yo , they both fucked . ”
The call had come from the cellphone of Darryl Wyche .
Wyche ’s family and the police soon figured out what had happened :
One of the murderers had stolen Darryl Wyche ’s phone and forgotten to turn it off .
While the killers were driving away , one of them had accidentally pressed the phone ’s speed dial button , calling Darryl ’s mother - in - law and producing a most unusual piece of evidence : a voicemail confession .
With considerable understatement , a lieutenant in the city homicide unit reflected on his good fortune to the Baltimore Sun .
“ We got lucky , ” he said .
Willie Mitchell and Shelly Martin were soon rounded up and put in jail .
What would become the fifth and final murder charge in the case of Willie Mitchell and his cohorts took place two months later .
This time , only Mitchell ’s friend Shawn Gardner was directly involved .
It began with a man named Darius Spence , who had found out that his wife , Tanya , was cheating on him with a local drug dealer everyone called “ Momma . ”
Spence decided to have Momma beaten up severely .
To accomplish this , he negotiated with another drug dealer named Willie Montgomery .
Would Montgomery be willing to beat up Momma in exchange for money ?
But Montgomery had another proposition altogether .
Beating Momma up did n’t make sense , Montgomery argued , because then Momma would undoubtedly try to kill Montgomery .
It was better just to kill Momma outright , and for five thousand dollars , Montgomery would be glad to do the job .
Spence said he ’d think it over .
Unfortunately for Darius Spence , Montgomery was n’t interested in waiting around for an answer .
Instead , sensing opportunity , Montgomery decided to tell Momma about the hit .
If I turn down the deal , Montgomery explained , then Spence will probably just hire someone else to kill you .
Therefore , Montgomery reasoned , you should hire me to kill Spence first .
Momma was persuaded .
( As Montgomery later explained to the prosecutors , “ I guess he like that idea better than Darius Spence ’s idea . ” )
To execute the hit on Spence , Montgomery recruited two associates , one of whom was Shawn Gardner .
For the next two months , the three men staked out Spence ’s apartment .
The plan was for Shawn Gardner and his associate to invade from the basement and carry out the killing , and then run to a nearby getaway car , which was to be driven by Montgomery .
Special care was to be taken not to harm Tanya , and they would cover her eyes with duct tape to prevent her from identifying them .
Still , Montgomery warned Momma that he could n’t guarantee Tanya ’s safety .
“ If it ’s up to me , she wo n’t be hurt , ” Montgomery told Momma , “ but some things could go wrong . ”
Momma ’s reply was to the point : “ Do what you do . ”
On June 7 , 2002 , the three men drove to the Spence apartment , a worn red brick building at the end of a cul - de - sac a few miles from Baltimore city .
But the hit did n’t go as planned .
Darius Spence was n’t in the apartment , and they did n’t manage to blindfold Tanya .
As children played outside the Spence apartment , Tanya burst through the kitchen door on the third floor , screaming , “ No ! No ! ” Lifting one leg over the balcony , she tried to climb down to the floor below but lost her grip and fell fifteen feet to the ground , landing a few feet from the children .
Gasping for breath , she motioned for them to run away before crawling under the first floor balcony .
Moments later , the two killers emerged from the Spence apartment , ran down the steps and stopped a few feet from Tanya , now lying in the fetal position in the dirt and begging for her life .
One pulled out a large caliber revolver and fired two shots into Tanya ’s chest as the children watched .
Then both men ran away .
Unfortunately for the killers , Montgomery was n’t where they thought he ’d be .
Somehow the meeting place had gotten confused , and the getaway failed .
Police quickly apprehended Shawn Gardner and his associate .
Eventually , the law caught up to Montgomery , too .
Gardner was tried , convicted , and sentenced in state court to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Tanya Spence .
Meanwhile , Willie Mitchell and Shelly Martin were charged by the state with the Wyche brothers ’ killings and sat in prison for the next year and a half as police and prosecutors assembled their case .
Then , on January 22 , 2004 — nearly two years after the first four murders — the word came down from the office of U.S. Attorney Thomas DiBiagio : the Willie Mitchell case was going federal , and the government was seeking the death penalty .
The Justice Department , DiBiagio explained , was going after “ individuals responsible for making life hell in Baltimore . ”
For Mitchell and company , this was bad news .
Instead of jurors selected from the city pool , Mitchell would likely be judged by an all - white panel of citizens from places like Maryland ’s westernmost rural counties or the far reaches of the Eastern Shore .
He would face better - funded prosecutors , and was far more likely to get the death penalty .
Maryland has only executed five people in the last thirty years , but in 2005 , then - Attorney General John Ashcroft was aggressively seeking death sentences .
In fact , the Justice Department was even retrying cases in order to win death penalties for crimes like the Spence murder , for which Shawn Gardner was already serving life without parole .
DiBiagio ’s office also added a raft of conspiracy charges to the indictment , filed under the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act .
By alleging that the defendants were part of an organized conspiracy — the so - called “ Willie Mitchell organization ” — prosecutors could hold all four defendants responsible for any of the crimes the others had committed .
That ’s why Shelton Harris , who was n’t originally arrested for the Wyche or the McCaffity and Brown murders , was pulled off the street and charged with the full slate of crimes .
It ’s also why Mitchell and Harris were charged with the Spence murder , although they were already in jail when Shawn Gardner committed it .
RICO is normally applied to members of the mafia and organized crime , and its use sent a clear message : the government was coming at Mitchell and company with everything it had .
The prosecutors bolstered the conspiracy argument by noting that , unlike most Baltimore drug dealers , Mitchell and company had incorporated a legal entity for which they all worked and allegedly funneled proceeds of their drug business into : “ Shake Down Entertainment , Ltd . ”
The group promoted rap CDs and concerts through the company , which even had its own record label , “ Shystyville . ”
Soon , Shystyville CDs with titles like “ Pure Shit ” became evidence of not just the conspiracy but the crimes themselves , with prosecutors entering into the record lyrics like these :
I watch ya brains fly all over on the bitch next to you
Homeboy it ’s up to you I could put this pup to you
Then to pumpin ’ you up like a innertube
Send shots that ’ll pump up the end of you
Leave you all fat and bloated you know I keep
the Mac loaded then I like ta clack rollin ’
That ’s why Bo and Weez on lock now and every day on lock down
Niggas getting shot down for runnin ’ they mouth clown
Tell me how it feels with a gun in ya mouth now
Prosecutors alleged that the “ bitch next to you ” was Lisa Brown , who was sitting beside Oliver McCaffity when he was shot through the head , that a “ pup ” is slang for the largecaliber revolver used in the killing , that the “ Bo ” on “ lock now ” was the imprisoned Willie “ Bo ” Mitchell , and that the reference to “ Niggas getting shot for runnin ’ they mouth ” amounted to witness intimidation .
Faced with the prospect of an all - white jury hearing this music in the courtroom , the defense lawyers objected on the grounds that lots of songs have lyrics that “ proudly refer to violent retaliation , ” offering by way of example country star Toby Keith ’s “ Courtesy of the Red , White and Blue ( The Angry American ) . ”
Nearly two years passed .
The wheels of justice were turning , slowly but surely .
Then came the memorable hearing in which the defendants debuted the flesh - and - blood defense .
After that , everything changed .
A month after the hearing , Judge Davis took the unusual step of issuing a written opinion denying all of the defendant ’s “ unusual — if not bizarre ” arguments .
“ Perhaps they would even be humorous , ” Davis wrote , “ were the stakes not so high … It is truly ironic that four African - American defendants here apparently rely on an ideology derived from a famously discredited notion : the illegitimacy of the Fourteenth Amendment . ”
One can understand his incredulity that four Baltimore drug dealers might invoke a racist argument that dates back to the nineteenth century .
But as it turns out , that ’s when the seeds of the flesh - and - blood defense were sown .
In 1878 , southern Democrats pushed legislation through Congress limiting the ability of the federal government to marshal troops on U.S. soil .
Known as Posse Comitatus , ( Latin for “ power of the county ” ) the law ’s authors hoped to constrain the government ’s ability to protect black southerners from violence and discrimination .
The act symbolically marked the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow .
For the next eight decades , black Americans lived under the yoke of institutional racism .
But by the late 1950s , the civil rights movement was growing in strength .
In 1957 , President Eisenhower sent 1,200 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock , Arkansas , so that nine black students could safely enter a previously all - white high school .
The landmark Civil Rights
Act followed in 1964 .
These developments horrified one William Gale , a World War II veteran , insurance salesman , self - styled minister of racist Christian Identity theology , and raving anti-Semite .
In 1971 , he launched a movement whose impact would reverberate through the radical fringes of American society for decades to come .
He called it Posse Comitatus , named for the 1878 law he believed Eisenhower had violated by sending the troops to Little Rock .
In a series of tapes and self - published pamphlets , Gale explained that county sheriffs were the supreme legal law enforcement officers in the land , and that county residents had the right to form a posse to enforce the Constitution — however they , as “ sovereign citizens , ” chose to interpret it .
Public officials who interfered , instructed Gale , should be “ hung by the neck ” at high noon .
Gale ’s racist beliefs were hardly unique .
His singular innovation was to devise a “ legal ” philosophy that was enormously appealing to disaffected , alienated citizens .
It was a promise of power , a means of asserting that they were the true inheritors of the founding fathers ’ ideal , a dream they believed had been corrupted by a vast conspiracy that only they could see .
Gale ’s ideas gave people on the paranoid edge of society a collective identity .
It told them what they desperately wanted to hear : that the federal government was illegitimate , and that the legal weapons the state used to oppress them could be turned against the state .
Soon , Posses were sprouting across the country , attracting veterans of the 1960s - era tax protest movement , Second Amendment absolutists , Christian Identity adherents , and ardent anti-communists who had abandoned the John Birch Society because they felt the organization was n’t extreme enough .
Local groups would meet to share literature , listen to tapes of Gale ’s sermons , and discuss preparations for the approaching End Times .
This extremist stew produced exotic amalgamations of paranoia , such as when Posse members would explain the need for local militias to stockpile weapons in order to defend white Christians from blacks in the coming race war sparked by the inevitable economic collapse caused by the income tax and a cabal of international Jewish bankers bent on global dominance through one world government , for Satan .
While local Posses would periodically confront law enforcement officials in the 1970s , ( usually in property disputes ) , they were often incompetent , and few people were hurt .
But things took a serious turn in 1978 , when thousands of farmers rallied in Washington D.C. seeking relief from low commodity prices , high interest rates , and farm debt .
When Congressional relief attempts failed , some farmers became susceptible to peddlers of the Posse ideology , which preached that the farm crisis had been brought on by the international Jewish banking conspiracy , abandonment of the gold standard and a malevolent Federal Reserve .
By 1982 , Bill Gale had flown to Kansas to conduct paramilitary training and indoctrination for splinter groups of disaffected farmers .
At night , a country music station in Dodge City broadcast tapes of Gale ’s sermons .
“ You ’re either going to get back to the Constitution of the United States in your government , ” he intoned , “ or officials are gonna hang by the neck until they ’re dead … Arise and fight !
If a Jew comes near you , run a sword through him . ”
As Posse ideology rippled across the distressed farm belt , violence followed .
Several deadly confrontations between Posse adherents and law enforcement made national headlines ; Geraldo Rivera descended on Nebraska to document the “ Seeds of Hate ” in America ’s heartland .
By 1987 , Gale ’s rhetoric had escalated further .
He told his followers that “ You ’ve got an enemy government running around … its source and its location is Washington , D.C. , and the federal buildings they ’ve built with your tax money all over the cities in this land . ”
Hucksters and charlatans prowled the Midwest as the farm crisis deepened , selling desperate farmers expensive seminars and prepackaged legal defenses “ guaranteed ” to cancel debts and forestall foreclosure .
Since the gold standard had been abandoned in 1933 , they argued , money had no inherent value , and so neither did their debts .
All they had to do , farmers were told , was opt out of the system by sending a letter to the appropriate authorities renouncing their driver ’s license , birth certificate , and social security number .
That number was allegedly tied to a secret government account held in a secure subterranean facility in lower Manhattan , where citizens are used as collateral against international debts issued by the Fed and everyone ’s name is on a master list , spelled in capital letters — the very same capital letters used in the official court documents detailing foreclosure and other actions against them .
The capital letter name was nothing but an artificial construct , they were told , a legal “ straw man . ”
It was n’t them — natural , live , flesh and blood men .
Bill Gale died on April 28 , 1988 , three months after being sentenced in federal court for conspiracy , tax crimes , and mailing death threats to the Internal Revenue Service .
By that time , the farm crisis had begun to recede .
Posse ideology simmered for the next few years , morphing into the “ Christian Patriot ” movement , which sanded down some of the roughest racist and anti-Semitic edges while retaining the core beliefs of Constitutional fundamentalism .
The patriots saw themselves as “ sovereign citizens , ” unlike the “ federal citizens ” who had been created by the 14th Amendment ’s guarantee of equal protection under the law .
The deadly confrontations between federal agents and extremists at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and Waco , Texas in 1993 brought latent anger with the federal government back to a boil .
The militia movement of the 1990s built on Posse tenets of county - based , self - organized paramilitary groups led by citizens expressing their basic Constitutional rights .
Most groups stuck with conducting survivalist training camps and filing bogus liens against houses owned by local judges .
But a few did much more .
In 1993 , a Michigan farmer and survivalist named James Nichols was pulled over for speeding .
Instead of simply paying the fine , he argued in court that his “ sovereign citizen ” status made him immune to prosecution .
That same year , James ’ brother Terry tried to pay off a $ 17,000 debt with a fake check issued by a radical “ family farm preservation ” group run by Posse adherents .
Two years later , Terry Nichols helped to bring the Posse ’s anti-government hatred to its ultimate fruition .
On April 18 , 1995 , he and a friend named Timothy McVeigh loaded 108 fifty - pound bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer into a Ryder truck .
The next day , McVeigh bombed the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City , killing 168 people on the second anniversary of Waco .
After the attack , the Feds began cracking down on white supremacist groups , including one called the “ Montana Freemen , ” who were , in the words of hate - group expert Daniel Levitas , “ the direct ideological descendants of the Posse Comitatus . ” ( Levitas ’ book , The Terrorist Next Door , contains the definitive account of Bill Gale and the Posse . )
The Freemen were arrested in their isolated compound after a threemonth standoff with the FBI .
At trial , they filed an array of bizarre documents citing the Fed , the gold standard , the 14th Amendment , and the Uniform Commercial Code , but to no avail .
They were sent to the maximum security “ Supermax ” federal prison in Florence , Colorado , where they remain today .
But the appeal of their anti-government dogma did n’t disappear .
The Freemen continued to attract sympathizers outside Supermax walls .
Some collected the documents the Freemen filed during their trial and began offering them for sale via adver tisements in “ America ’s Bulletin , ” a newsletter espousing Posse - style anti-government theories that is widely distributed throughout the prison system by white supremacists .
In October 2004 , a prisoner named Michael Burpee arrived at the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in downtown Baltimore .
Burpee had recently been convicted in Florida of trafficking PCP to Maryland .
Hoping for leniency , he pled guilty , only to receive a twenty seven - year prison sentence dictated by harsh federal sentencing guidelines .
Desperate for a way out , he began listening to someone — presumably a fellow prisoner — who explained how the charges were all part of a secret government conspiracy against him .
Then Burpee was brought up on new federal drug charges in Maryland , and shipped north .
He carried with him a pile of documents that were remarkably similar to those that had been filed by the Montana Freemen .
In Baltimore , Burpee found a group of inmates at the margins of society , people like Willie Mitchell and company who were staring at the full force of the federal government .
As one defense attorney representing a flesh - and - blood defendant put it , they “ saw a freight train coming and felt three feet tall . ”
Soon the unorthodox legal filings and courtroom outbursts began to multiply .
It was , one public defender later explained , “ like an infection that was invading our client population of pre-trial detainees . ”
Burpee appears to have been patient zero in the epidemic .
For over a year , he harangued his lawyers and judge about the conspiracy and spread the word in the Baltimore lockup .
Then , in a stroke of bad luck for the public defender ’s office , the U.S. Attorney ’s office decided to drop the charges against Burpee — perhaps reasoning that he was n’t worth the hassle considering that he had already been sentenced to twenty - seven years .
For Burpee ’s peers , the decision imbued the flesh - and - blood defense with legitimacy and the hope of freedom .
Before long , the relatives of the defendants were scanning Web sites like www.redemptionservice.com, which offers maps showing how Satanic runes were secretly incorporated into the street plan of Washington , D.C. , and a deluxe package of instructions for renouncing one ’s social security number for only $ 3,900 , payable by check or money order .
Like the Midwestern farmers before them , the Baltimore inmates were susceptible to the notion that the federal government was engaged in a massive , historic plot to deprive them of life , liberty , and property .
Such suspicions are prevalent in certain pockets of the black community — that year , a study from the Rand Corporation found that over 25 percent of African Americans surveyed believed the AIDS virus was developed by the government , and 12 percent thought it was released into the population by the CIA .
And black separatist groups like the Nation of Islam — also fond of conspiracy theories — have long cultivated members through the prison system ; some of these groups have explicitly adopted the language of constitutional fundamentalists .
Given these developments , Levitas told me , “ I ’m surprised this did n’t happen sooner . ”
This , then , was how Willie Mitchell came to draw on the accumulated layers of three decades of right - wing paranoia and demand that his case be dismissed “ in accord with … House Joint Resolution 192 , and Public Law 73 - 10 ” — laws that involved the abandonment of the gold standard and the Federal Reserve .
And it explained why Shawn Gardner kept insisting that he be addressed as “ Shawn - Earl : Gardner , ” rather than the capital - letter SHAWN GARDNER printed on the indictment : he thought that if he could convince the court to call him by his “ natural ” name , it would be tantamount to admitting that the charges had been filed against someone else .
On the morning of January 10 , 2006 , two months after the first flesh - and - blood hearing , Gardner returned to Judge Davis ’s courtroom .
Moments after Davis arrived , Gardner stood up .
“ I object , ” he said , over and over , until Judge Davis had finally had enough .
“ Do you know what you ’re doing ? ” he asked Gardner .
“ You are committing suicide in broad daylight .
There are public suicides in this country far too often .
People jump off the Golden Gate Bridge , the Brooklyn Bridge .
People walk into their workplaces with a gun and put the gun up to their head and pull the trigger .
People slash their wrists .
I do n’t want you to join that community , but that ’s what you ’re doing , sir . ”
Gardner tried to argue that the court had no power over him under “ common law . ”
“ At common law , ” Judge Davis replied , “ you were property .
You were bought and sold just like those Timberlands on your feet today can be bought and sold .
That ’s what your ancestors were , some of them , and that is what my ancestors were , some of them . ”
“ You have invoked ideas formulated and advanced by people who think less of you than they think of dirt , ” Davis continued .
“ The extremists who have concocted these ideas that you are now advancing in this courtroom are laughing their heads off .
You are giving them everything they ever wished for .
They should be paying you to do what you are doing .
They are going to make you the poster child for their movement .
When you complete this suicide , they will honor you because you are doing their work , better and more effectively than any of them ever dreamed they could do .
Some of them — ” “ I object , ” said Gardner , interrupting .
“ The government wants to do the same thing anyway .
So what ’s the difference ? ”
Gardner , unrepentant , was escorted from the courtroom .
And so the tenets of Posse Comitatus continued their long , strange journey , from the racist , hate - filled mind of William Gale to four black defendants on trial for their life in Baltimore federal court .
A little more than a year after the November 2005 hearing , the flesh - and - blood phenomenon took another twist .
A key part of the conspiracy indictment against Mitchell et al was the allegation that the defendants acted together in pursuit of criminal goals .
The seemingly choreographed speeches and the identical filings , all submitted on the same day and mailed by the same person , suggested that the four defendants were going to great lengths to coordinate their actions , despite being housed in separate prison facilities and having no obvious means of communication .
Ergo , evidence that the conspiracy was continuing in jail .
The U.S. Attorney ’s office also added new charges of felony obstruction of justice , citing the disruptive nature of the fleshand - blood defense .
The prosecutors were n’t just rejecting the defense as an argument for innocence .
They were saying that it was , itself , a crime .
Undaunted , Mitchell and company continued making courtroom speeches and filing more nonsensical motions .
One , for instance , claimed that Judge Davis ’ court only had jurisdiction over crimes committed in federally owned “ forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and enclaves . ”
None of these arguments had a prayer of overturning the charges .
But they had an impact nonetheless .
They made a long , complex trial longer and more complex still .
Seeking the death penalty is rightfully arduous — it requires legal justifications for the penalty itself , enhanced scrutiny over jury selection , an additional penalty phase after a conviction , and so on .
Conspiracy charges create further legal burdens .
And the way Mitchell et al chose to deal with their attorneys — not dismissing them outright , but asking them to sign a peculiar “ contract ” that would essentially prohibit them from mounting a defense — created more problems .
If the defendants were n’t dealt with carefully , they might be able to appeal by claiming that they had been inadequately represented .
The last thing Judge Davis wanted was for an appellate court to throw out a verdict and send the case back to Baltimore to start all over again .
According to a source close to the court , dealing with the flesh and blood defense has been “ one of the greatest challenges Davis has faced in twenty years as a judge , by far . ”
By mid-2007 , the federal prosecutors were starting to run low on a vital resource : time .
As years go by , memories fade , police officers retire or transfer , informants change their mind , and juries wonder , why , if the case is so straightforward , it took so long to make .
On September 6 , 2007 , prosecutors withdrew the death penalty for all four defendants .
Nobody in the Baltimore federal courthouse is willing to state , or even speculate on the record , that Mitchell and his cohorts may have averted death with the flesh - and - blood defense .
There are other possibilities involving evidence , witnesses , and Justice Department policy .
But the elaborate processes of federal capital cases were n’t built to accommodate farcical pro se filings and challenges .
Traffic offenses , tax cases — even farm foreclosures — are one thing .
When the end goal is execution , even the most ludicrous defenses are taken seriously .
On January 8 , 2008 , the case of United States of America v. Willie Mitchell et al convened once again in the main courtroom of the federal courthouse .
The lawyers arrived first , chatting in the manner of people who had spent nearly four years and counting on the odyssey of this case .
The defendants came next .
While Shawn Gardner wore the blue work shirt of a lifer in state prison , Willie Mitchell sported comfortable baggy jeans and a stylish black shirt .
Mitchell sauntered to his table , and spied the lone spectator in the courtroom ’s auditorium - style gallery of one hundred - plus seats , a slender black woman who looked to be in her late twenties .
His eyes lit up as he smiled and mouthed “ How are you ? ” “ I ’m good , I ’m good ” she murmured .
“ Your new lawyer — get his card ! ”
Judge Davis arrived last , emerging from a wooden door behind the bench , beneath oil portraits of judges from days gone by .
The hearing will be short , he said ; the purpose is to establish a schedule for future motions , and ultimately the trial .
Davis and the lawyers spent the next twenty minutes trying find eight weeks of available courtroom time for ten busy lawyers plus the judge .
Then , apropos of nothing , Shelton Harris stood up .
“ Good morning your honor , ” he began .
Davis saw where this was going and cut him off .
“ I have n’t recognized you yet , Mr. Harris .
You ’ll have time to talk later , ” he said .
“ I accept your offer , ” Harris replied softly , and sat down .
The scheduling discussion continued ; Mitchell rested his head in his arms as though bored .
Finally , Judge Davis allowed Harris to speak .
Harris launched into the now familiar oration — ” I request you , the judge , close the accounts … ”
He spoke rapidly in a low , gravelly voice , as if he ’d worked hard to memorize the speech and did n’t want to leave anything out .
Harris finished , sat , and Judge Davis turned to the defendants .
The speech you just gave has no legal meaning whatsoever , he said sternly .
They were words in the English language , but they have no meaning as a matter of law .
If , in future proceedings , you persist — even politely — in making these speeches , you face a severe risk of being expelled from the courtroom .
The court also may conclude that you are waiving your right to appointed counsel , in which case you would have to represent yourself .
That would be a sad day .
“ We are in recess , ” Davis said .
He turned back toward the door to leave .
Then several things happened at once .
Shawn Gardner , handcuffed , slumped in the arms of the federal marshals , who seized him beneath his armpits and dragged him across the courtroom toward the door .
Willie Mitchell raised his right hand to speak , intent on giving his version of Harris ’ speech , but the marshals grabbed his arm and forced it down behind his back toward his left wrist , which was already cuffed .
Mitchell struggled and yelled at his lawyer , “ They got my arm in a chicken wing ! ”
The marshals forcibly moved Martin and Harris toward the door .
Judge Davis watched with consternation as they were dragged from his court .
Willie Mitchell and company wo n’t go on trial until September , if then , and they wo n’t face the death penalty , even though they probably deserve it if anyone does .
But they will probably be convicted and spend the rest of their lives in federal prison , never to be heard from again , because in the end , the flesh - and - blood defense is no defense at all .
The 14th Amendment did n’t revoke Shawn Gardner ’s natural citizenship — it gave him protection under the law , and paved the way for another black man to judge his case .
There ’s no international cabal of Jewish bankers conspiring against him — one of his lawyers , a professor at Howard University Law School , is Jewish .
The secret histories and grand conspiracies that have fueled decades of right - wing paranoia , morphing to accommodate one doomed cause after another until finding an unlikely temporary home in a Baltimore lockup , are lies and nothing more .
As the marshals shoved the four men toward the courtroom door , back to the prison they ’ll never leave , they shook their heads and looked at each other smiling , as if to say right , right , is n’t it always just like this ?
One of them let out a chuckle that rose above the din .
Judge Davis turned to the court reporter .
“ Let the record show , ” he said , “ that Mr. Harris is laughing . ”
GRINDHOUSE fans take note , Rob Zombie ’s faux trailer has taken its next step in becoming a feature film as it was revealed today that the WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE SS in becoming a comic book series .
“ Werewolf Women of the SS is back !
This time it ’s back as a comic book series , ” Zombie writes on his blog .
“ The wacky exploits of Commandant Hess , Lt. Boorman , Von Strasser Eva and Gretchen Krupp , Fu Manchu and even Hiltler will be coming you way .
Everything you ever wanted to know about Project Pure Wolf but were afraid to ask ! ”
Hours after the Abu Dhabi Investment Council announced it is negotiating an $ 800 million deal for a 75 percent stake in the landmark Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan , Chrysler revealed plans to buy the Packard Garage in downtown Abu Dhabi and it ’s main tenant — the Arabian Daze Electric Camel Company .
The price was not disclosed , but a reporter in Abu Dhabi recalls seeing a For Sale sign in the window yesterday that said , “ $ 3500 or two courtside tickets to the NBA Finals . ”
While Chrysler no longer owns the Chrysler Building , the move is seen as a symbolic retaliation for high Middle East oil prices which have hurt sales of the company ’s cars and trucks and brought the value CEO ’s golden parachute down to $ 250 million .
“ This gives Chrysler an energy - efficient vehicle to compete with the foreign hybrids , ” said Jake Westy , Chrysler ’s Director of Finding Energy - Efficient Vehicles to Compete With The Foreign Hybrids .
While electric camels have never been available in the U.S. , they ’re almost as rare in Abu Dhabi , a city where oil tycoons use Bentleys as dune buggies .
“ The electric camel is not just a golf cart with a water cooler , ” said Westy .
“ It ’s a golf cart with a water cooler and a DVD player . ”
The 2 - seat electric camels , which will be called the Firehump in the U.S. , have a top speed of 35 miles - per - hour in the city and 70 MPH when caught in the grille of a semi .
Firehumps are expected to begin arriving in Chrysler showrooms in late 2008 , once they have been fitted with safety glass , safety bumpers and passenger - side defibrillators .
Automotive industry experts see Chrysler ’s purchase of Arabian Daze and the electric camels as a desperation move to avoid being the subject of a Michael Moore documentary on global warming .
Two of Washington ’s most prominent foreign policy graybeards praised Saturday ’s direct participation in multinational talks with Iran by a senior U.S. diplomat but called on the administration of President George W. Bush to drop his demands that Tehran freeze its uranium enrichment program as a precondition for broader negotiations .
Retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft , who served as national security adviser under Republican presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush , and Zbigniew Brzezinski , who held the same post under Democratic President Jimmy Carter , urged Bush to go further by offering immediate rewards to Tehran in exchange for such a freeze .
And both men warned that repeated U.S. threats to use military force against Iran were counterproductive and strengthened hard - line forces in the regime led by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
They said an actual military attack  whether by the U.S. or by Israel  would likely be disastrous for U.S. interests in the region .
" A war with Iran will produce calamities for sure , " said Brzezinski , who pointed , among other things , to its likely impact on the price of oil and the likelihood that it would create yet another front to add to the two wars  Iraq and Afghanistan  in which U.S. military forces are already engaged .
" [ Brzezinski ’s assessment ] may be a little more dire [ than mine ] , but not much , " Scowcroft told IPS in a brief interview after the two men spoke at a briefing sponsored by the Center for Security and International Studies ( CSIS ) .
" It would turn the region into a cauldron of conflict , bitterness , and hatred .
It would turn Islam against us . "
Both men have been strongly critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East , particularly the decision to invade Iraq  although Brzezinski has been considerably more vocal than Scowcroft , who remains a close friend of Bush ’s father .
Both leading lights of the so - called " realist " foreign - policy establishment , they are currently collaborating on a book to be published in September .
Their joint appearance at CSIS , which was announced late last week after the administration had confirmed that undersecretary of state for policy , Ambassador William Burns , would attend Saturday ’s meeting between the so - called P5+1 ( the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany ) and Iran , seemed timed to demonstrate strong bipartisan support for continued and enhanced U.S. engagement .
Burns ’ direct participation at the talks not only marked the highest - level officially and publicly acknowledged meeting between the U.S. and Iran since the two nations broke off diplomatic relations in late 1979 .
It also appeared to mark a potentially significant easing of previous administration demands that Tehran suspend its uranium enrichment program as a condition for direct talks .
Coupled with reports that Washington plans to open an interests section in Tehran , as well as a series of strong statements by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Michael Mullen , warning against the consequences of a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran , Burns ’ presence was widely interpreted as a sign that the administration has made a strategic decision to engage Iran diplomatically , much as it did , beginning in late 2006 , with yet another charter member of Bush ’s " Axis of Evil , " North Korea .
Indeed , hawks outside the administration who are nonetheless closely associated with administration hard - liners led by Vice President Dick Cheney have been complaining bitterly about the decision to send Burns since it was announced .
The neoconservative Weekly Standard called the move " stunningly shameful , " while former UN Ambassador John Bolton said it was proof of the administration ’s " complete intellectual collapse . "
Similarly , the neoconservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal , which has long urged confrontation with Iran , has assailed the decision as foreshadowing " détente . "
On Monday , it published a column by Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) that charged Bush with " appeasing " Tehran and conducting " diplomatic malpractice on a Carteresque level . "
While these protests themselves constitute evidence that a strategic decision to engage Iran in much the same way that the administration has dealt with North Korea over the past 18 months 
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice will meet for the first time with her North Korean counterpart in Singapore later this week  has indeed been made , many analysts remain uncertain .
The White House itself stressed that Burns ’ presence was a " one - time " affair .
And Rice , who , along with Pentagon chief Robert Gates , is seen as the administration ’s main champion for engagement , followed up the meeting by setting a two - week deadline for Tehran to respond to the P5+1 ’s offer  the so - called " freeze - for - freeze "  to forgo a fourth round of UN sanctions against it if it refrained from adding new centrifuges to its enrichment program .
The group , she said , had sent a " very strong message to the Iranians that they ca n’t go and stall and that they have to make a decision , " suggesting that Washington would push for sanctions if Tehran does not provide a satisfactory response by the deadline .
To some observers , both her tone and her words suggested that Rice herself feels vulnerable , particularly given the failure of Iran ’s representative to the Geneva talks , Ambassador Saeed Jalili , to respond directly to the proposal on the table .
Scowcroft agreed Tuesday that the Iranian response had indeed been " disappointing " but also suggested that Rice ’s " rather sharp " remarks were likely to strengthen hard - liners in Tehran .
Brzezinski also criticized Rice ’s ultimatum , asserting that it was " not helpful to the negotiating process . "
Scowcroft said Burns ’ presence in Geneva was " encouraging , " while Brzezinski called it a " very good step " but insufficient in itself to break the " logjam " created by the administration ’s precondition for direct talks .
They also denounced the administration ’s repeated reminders that " all options remain on the table " as counterproductive .
" It tends to push Iranians into a more nationalistic , dogmatic stance , " said Brzezinski , while Scowcroft said it offered only the " illusion of a clean solution " to what is essentially " a very complicated diplomatic problem . "
At the same time , they endorsed the use of sanctions as a means of pressuring Iran , provided that they were coupled with incentives whose benefits to Tehran would be clear and immediate in order to make it easier for the regime to make concessions .
" Give them a way out without losing face , " Scowcroft said .
On speculation that Israel may be preparing to take unilateral military action against Iran ’s nuclear facilities , Brzezinski said it would not be a " smart strategic choice " due to the likelihood that the U.S. would even become " more bogged down " in the region .
Scowcroft said he would tell the Israelis to " calm down . "
( Inter Press Service )
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- European telcos are likely to subsidize Apple 's new version of the iPhone , say analysts .
Exclusive Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) partner O2 is expected to sell the hotly - anticipated 3G iPhone for about $ 196 or £ 100 , according to a report by the U.K's Times Online , citing a UBS analyst report .
The speculation follows a story first reported by Fortune.com that AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) was planning to sell the new iPhone this summer for around $ 200 .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs is widely expected to unveil the faster , sleeker version of the iPhone during the company 's developer conference in one week .
The new iPhone would be available later this month in the U.S. through Apple and AT&T .
AT&T pricing strategy calls for a $ 200 subsidy for customers who sign two - year service contracts .
" It will be subsidized , " says CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood , of O2's iPhone price plan .
" But it wo n't be free , " Wood speculates .
O2 customers " will have to take connections or contracts at the point of purchase .
They will have to sign on the dotted line .
That 's how they will make sure they get their money back , " says Wood .
The lower - priced phones in the U.S. and potentially the U.K. and other parts of Europe would help juice the iPhone 's sales volume and give the telcos an attractive weapon to win new subscribers .
In the United States , AT&T says it pulls in an average of $ 95 a month from each iPhone customer , nearly twice the average monthly bill of its conventional cell phone user .
AT&T has a revenue - sharing agreement with Apple that requires it to give Apple as much as 25 % of its i Phone customers ' monthly payments .
Subsidies are a widespread pricing practice in the United States and overseas .
In exchange for a cheaper phone , customers are locked in to a carrier for a year or two .
It 's a small investment by the telcos for a large return , as Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi outlined in a report last month .
Cutting the price of the iPhone in half would put the cost of the phone within reach of more consumers and likely double the number of iPhones sold , Sacconaghi argues .
After giving Apple its cut of the revenue , the remaining take for AT&T is between $ 70 and $ 75 a month per iPhone user , totaling more than $ 1,700 over the life of the two - year contract , wrote Sacconaghi .
Though it did n't get much attention at the time , on anApril 23 conference call with analysts , Apple CFO Tim Cook said the company did n't put price guidelines on European carriers selling the original iPhone .
" The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that , I would n't comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential , " Cook said at the time .
One thing is clear , the iPhone 's manufacturer 's suggested retail price of $ 400 seems more fluid than ever .
" There 's certainly more flexibility in pricing , " says CCS Insight 's Wood .
Bound and gagged , Elmer Nuñez - ­Rodriguez watched helplessly as a stocky , dark - haired man charged toward him with a phone in one hand and a yellow claw hammer in the other .
With one swing , the man drove the hammer into Elmer 's foot , threw Elmer onto the bed and ripped off the duct tape covering Elmer 's mouth .
The man grabbed an iron and pressed the steaming hot metal into each of Elmer 's forearms , searing raw pink V shapes into Elmer 's dark - colored flesh .
On the other end of the phone , Elmer 's friend Danilo Rosales heard Elmer screech in pain and cry out in Spanish , " Get the money because otherwise , they are going to kill me . "
The man walked outside to where his girlfriend waited .
He was smiling .
The next morning , the man with the hammer , Charles Spezzia , told Elmer that it was his last day to live .
Elmer 's hands were untied so he could wash up .
While bathing , Elmer heard his kidnappers walk outside .
Terrified and sitting in the tub , the baby - faced 22 - year - old began to pray .
Across town , Danilo was scrambling to find the money .
Three days earlier , the fee for Elmer 's brother , Miguel , whom smugglers had brought up from Mexico , was $ 1,800 .
Elmer had only been able to raise a fraction of that amount .
But when Elmer showed up at the drop spot , Miguel managed to escape , so Spezzia took Elmer hostage in exchange and was keeping him at the Howard Johnson Inn just off Interstate 45 near Clear Lake .
Spezzia and his smuggling partners had been calling Danilo and Miguel , threatening to kill Elmer unless they came up with the fee , which the smugglers kept raising every day .
The tab was now an impossible $ 3,300 .
Danilo called everyone he knew begging for a loan .
Elmer 's family in Honduras began selling off whatever they could .
Neither Elmer nor his brother Miguel is a celebrity or the son of a wealthy family , the type of person the average American might expect to be the target of kidnappers .
As U.S. border security continues to tighten , more and more people living in Mexico , Central and South America desperate to enter the United States at any cost turn to these people smugglers , or coyotes , to guide them .
It is the ultimate collision of two contradictory truths : life is better north of the U.S. border , but to get there migrants must risk being tortured or killed by the only ones who can get them there .
And just like with the drug trade , deals go bad , turning U.S. streets and neighborhoods into crime scenes .
After hearing Elmer scream , Danilo and Miguel knew they could n't get the money fast enough .
Panic set in .
They had to get help .
Even if it meant risking their own freedom and possible deportation , they knew what they had to do .

When it comes to people smugglers , there are no honest players .
They carry guns , raise prices at a whim , extort money and have little or no sympathy for their human cargo .
" These guys are the worst of the worst criminals , " says U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Special Agent in Charge Sean McElroy , who oversees ICE 's smuggling division in Houston .
But , of course , things are rarely so cut and dried .
" You have to look at it as services that are being offered to a community who needs them because legally people cannot qualify to enter the country , " says Houston community activist Maria Jimenez .
" No one wants to risk their lives in order to come through , so if you could simply establish a system where people could enter flexibly , you would deal a very strong blow to the smugglers .
But as the border has become more fortified , smugglers have become increasingly more important .
They are a necessary evil . "
Houston is a major hub for immigrant smugglers .
They flow north from the border up the Texas highways and country roads , and use Houston as a garrison to hold illegal immigrants while waiting for payment before sending them off to relatives in cities across the country .
Smugglers stash illegal immigrants throughout Houston in hotels , motels , trailer parks and private homes .
" It 's not unusual for us to get three or four calls a week , " says McElroy , " where we 're responding and going into places that are basically housing between 15 to 30 individuals who have been smuggled .
We get a lot of call - outs and we do a lot of federal prosecutions . "
In February , for instance , five Mexican nationals and one Honduran pled guilty in federal court after ICE agents found them holding 44 illegal immigrants at a house in southeast Houston and another 13 at a nearby business .
In April , Fernando Lemus - Gonzalez was sentenced to 30 years in prison on an eight - count indictment for " transporting undocumented aliens . "
He was smuggling eight illegal immigrants through Hebbronville when he lost control of his SUV and crashed , killing five of his passengers .
Mauricio Briones - Hernandez was also traveling through Hebbronville with a dozen illegals in his car when he crashed , resulting in an immigrant 's death and a prison sentence for Briones - Hernandez of more than 12 years .
In June , two Mexican nationals and a Brazilian pled guilty to conspiracy to harbor and transport illegal immigrants .
They were accused of stashing 15 people at a home in the 10,000 block of Sela .
One of the illegal immigrants found there said a smuggler had hit him with a baseball bat .
The smugglers were also accused of holding six other people , including a six - year - old boy , at a house on the 2800 block of Hayes Street .
Sometimes smuggling schemes involve federal agents .
In July , Border Patrol agent Jesus Miguel Huizar pled guilty to conspiring to smuggle more than 100 illegal immigrants , at $ 350 a head , through a checkpoint , and had to forfeit his El Paso home , used as a stash house , to the government .
In January , former Border Patrol agent David Cruz and his wife pled guilty to conspiracy charges , and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer Sergio Garza was arrested in Laredo for his suspected role in helping illegal immigrants into the United States .
Most smuggling organizations are loose networks that lack the clear - cut hierarchy traditionally seen with the major drug cartels , says McElroy .
And there are seldom any Robin Hoods .
It 's all about the money .
McElroy says today 's prices range from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 to bring someone up from Mexico , and between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 from South America .
And when you consider that smugglers are bringing in anywhere from a few dozen to more than a hundred immigrants a week and " are probably not paying taxes , " says McElroy , the dollars add up quickly .
Over the last few years , ICE has seen an increase in violence .
Agents hardly ever work a case where guns or some form of torture are not employed .
" It 's not unusual for us to go into places and find ropes and chains , " McElroy says .
" We get calls from relatives telling us that they 've been told that their family member is going to be killed or maimed or tied up outside in extreme weather conditions .
I mean , we 've heard it all .
Whether they 're doing it or not , they 're saying they 're going to do it , and in some cases they do , like in the Spezzia case . "
In the mainstream , oftentimes there 's not much sympathy for illegal immigrants , and smuggling crimes are viewed as victimless .
After all , the immigrant does pay the smuggler to get him across the ­border .
" The average American citizen does not understand the complexities of unauthorized migration , " says University of Houston professor Nestor Rodriguez .
" They say , ' Well , that 's what you get for doing things illegally . '
But the reality is that these are people who are trying to survive and help their families survive and take a large risk to do it .
People should care [ about smuggling crimes ] because this is the suffering of humans and Americans have always stood for fair play and humanitarian values .
And also because it happens on our land and this is not the type of behavior that we want to allow here . "
Most smuggling crimes , however , go unreported to the police .
Victims are afraid to speak up for fear they will be deported — often considered a worse fate than whatever bodily or mental injuries were incurred .
" A lot of the time , " says McElroy , " if they had called us in the first place , some bad things may not have happened .
We work closely with [ local nonprofit groups ] and try to stress : Come and report crimes like these .
Because it 's not worth having your relative held hostage . "
Jimenez agrees that most illegal immigrants are still afraid to report smugglers to the police , but slowly that is changing .
She likens the situation to food poisoning at a restaurant .
Once you get sick from eating the food , do you go back , do you sue or do you simply disappear ?
" I think people are much more aware of the consequences and are therefore more willing to denounce the coyote , especially when they 're being abused , " Jimenez says .
" Many years ago it was much more difficult because [ the smugglers ] were people you knew , the hometown guides , and you did n't want to expose anyone because ultimately you'd be sent back and lose the money you paid . "

Miguel was loading trucks for roughly $ 60 a week near his hometown of San Pedro Sula , Honduras , when he decided to try to join his younger brother , Elmer , in the United States .
Elmer had made the journey nearly a year earlier to find work to support his sick mother .
After arriving in Houston in January 2006 , Elmer took a landscaping job and sent home as much money as he could .
After a month , his mother died , but Elmer decided to stay .
It was November 2006 when Miguel began heading north .
With 1,500 Lempira — a little less than $ 80 — in his pocket , and a small dose of how - to knowledge from his brother Elmer , Miguel jumped on a bus heading into Guatemala .
After more than a month trekking through mountains , jungles and deserts in Guatemala and Mexico , Miguel stowed away on the last of six cargo trains he took during his journey , finally chugging into Nuevo Laredo .
Miguel found refuge at an immigrant flophouse and took a job selling newspapers .
For about three weeks , he lived and worked along the border .
On the job , Miguel met a fellow Honduran who introduced him to a man named Luis .
For $ 1,600 , Luis told Miguel , he could arrange for Miguel 's safe passage to Houston .
The smugglers later raised the fee to $ 1,800 .
Miguel then called Elmer , whose friend told Miguel that he had the money .
When Miguel relayed this to Luis , the deal began to roll into motion .
To smugglers , penniless immigrants are not worth much money up front ; they are almost like commodity futures .
Their real value lies down the road , and only if they can protect their merchandise through whatever means are necessary and then cash in .
It was just days after New Year 's 2007 when Luis took Miguel to his house , where four other migrants hoping to get across the border were waiting for the guide to show up .
The coyote was a Hispanic man who went by the name " El Negro . "
He loaded the migrants into his van and set out for the riverbank .
There , the group crouched by the Rio Grande for more than an hour before making their move .
Just after Miguel and the others rushed across the water into the United States , border patrol agents spotted them and began the chase .
The six men scattered .
Two migrants disappeared for good , but Miguel , El Negro and two others regrouped and began walking toward Houston .
After eight hours , the men reached a train station and again , Miguel found himself stowing away on a freight train .
An hour later , they hopped off at mile marker 58 and El Negro used a cell phone to call for a ride .
Miguel spent his first night in the United States sleeping in a dirt bed in the nearby brush .
The next afternoon , Spezzia and two others showed up in a black Ford Expedition .
Miguel and his traveling companions climbed in .
He and the two other immigrants lay crammed on top of each other in the back as they rode for three hours until reaching the Howard Johnson Inn near Clear Lake that Friday afternoon .
_____________________
Across town that night , Elmer 's cell phone rang .
It was El Negro .
Elmer did not answer , but the coyote left a message saying that he was going to kill Miguel if Elmer did not pick up his brother .
The next morning , El Negro called again and this time Elmer answered .
They agreed to meet at a gas station near the corner of Beltway 8 and South Post Oak .
Elmer called his friend Danilo for a ride .
Elmer was scared ; he had only $ 500 , a far cry from the $ 1,800 he needed to free his brother , and he could not get ahold of another friend who'd said he 'd lend Elmer the cash .
Elmer and Danilo hopped into Danilo's 2001 Ford Windstar and started toward the gas station .
Along the way , Danilo stopped and picked up two men he worked with .
They thought that if they showed up with more people , the odds were better that everything would run smoothly .
At the gas station , Elmer 's plan was to get Miguel , give the smugglers what money he had and work out a way to pay the rest later .
He walked over to the SUV with Miguel and Spezzia inside and opened Miguel 's door .
Elmer testified in court that he tried to talk to Spezzia but Spezzia would not let him .
Instead , Spezzia grabbed Elmer , took a pistol out of his waistband and pressed it into Elmer 's stomach .
Miguel jumped out of the car and began running .
Spezzia forced Elmer inside the Expedition as they sped away from the gas station .
Inside the car , Spezzia hit Elmer across the right eye with the gun ; blood spattered across Elmer 's shirt .
Meanwhile , Miguel quickly jumped into the van with Danilo and they chased after the SUV , trying to write down its license plate number .
But Danilo lost them when the smugglers drove onto Beltway 8 and cruised through the EZ Pass Lane of a tollbooth .
Danilo did n't follow .
He was afraid of getting pulled over by police , detained and possibly deported .
Stunned and frightened , Miguel and Danilo did not speak on the drive back to Danilo 's home that morning .
Over the next several days , Danilo spoke on the phone with the smugglers several times .
They set new deadlines and kept raising the fee — $ 2,300 , $ 3,000 and finally up to $ 3,300 — threatening to beat Elmer and chop off his fingers one by one until they reached his head .
On Monday evening , January 8 , 2007 , three days after Elmer had been kidnapped , Danilo called the Houston Police Department asking for officers to save his friend 's life .
_____________________
Charles Spezzia , known as " Charlie " to his fellow smugglers , was born in Chicago .
He is described by people who 've met the black - haired , brown - eyed man as looking much younger than his 26 years , almost like a teenager .
He stands at five foot nine inches and weighs more than 200 pounds .
Spezzia has a criminal record , but it 's rather unimpressive .
Nothing violent , at least .
He had been charged with stealing a car and driving on a suspended driver 's license , according to Harris County court records , but that was about it .
Prosecutors say they never determined exactly how long he was in the immigrant smuggling game , but his ex-girlfriend Patricia Garza testified he had been doing it for years by the time they met in 2006 .
She said he'd told her his father was a smuggler who had been deported to Mexico for plying his profession and had introduced Spezzia to the business .
Prosecutors would have had a tougher time getting a conviction against Spezzia if not for Garza , according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa .
She testified against Spezzia , which in turn helped her get a lighter sentence of only 11 months in prison .
About a year before police arrested them , the two met at Sugar 's Cabaret , a strip club where Garza was dancing under the name " Sasha . "
At the time , she was working part - time and pulling in about $ 3,000 a month , though she said in court that she had a negative balance in her bank account .
Born in Germany but a U.S. citizen , Garza , 24 , dropped out of school after ninth grade .
She was married when she met Spezzia and never divorced , but had separated from her husband .
She had two children at the time and was pregnant with a third when she was arrested .
Garza did not know exactly how Spez­zia made his money , only that he frequently made business trips out of town .
In October 2006 , Garza 's home burned down and she moved in with Spezzia at the Windjammer Apartments , less than a five - minute walk from the Howard Johnson Inn .
It was n't until shortly after moving in with Spezzia that Garza got her first inkling as to what her boyfriend did for a living .
One day in November , the two drove to McDonald 's where Spezzia bought a noticeably large order of hamburgers and fries to take to some friends who were holding people at a Red Roof Inn off of I - 45 .
When they arrived , Spezzia got out of the car and Garza heard him talking about the illegal immigrants holed up at the hotel .
At the time , Spezzia did n't explain to Garza why the immigrants were there or what was really going on .
Several weeks later , Spezzia asked Garza to go on a run down south with him .
" He just asked me if I wanted to go , " Garza testified .
" I said , yes , I would go with him ... [ He said ] we were just going to go and pick up these people . "
These people , of course , turned out to be smuggled ­illegal immigrants .
With Spezzia behind the wheel of a rented SUV , the two set out down the highway toward a ranch south of San Benito .
During the six - hour drive , Garza peppered Spezzia with questions , wanting to know exactly how everything worked .
Spezzia told Garza that a coyote , also called a runner , brought the illegal immigrants across the border , eight at a time on average .
The coyote would then call Spezzia and he would pick them up at a specified location .
Garza said that Spezzia pointed out different spots where he 'd picked up immigrants in the past .
_____________________
Spezzia always drove rental cars , usually Expeditions but sometimes a Hummer or a Cadillac Escalade .
He would typically go at night , and preferred it when it rained , telling Garza police usually would n't stop him in a downpour .
Most immigrants did n't pay until they were safe in Houston .
Spezzia and his partners kept the immigrants in a hotel or inside Spezzia 's apartment .
From there , Spezzia or an associate would call the immigrants ' friends or relatives and arrange a meeting spot .
The money was either paid in person at the drop - off or wired ahead through Western Union .
The typical fee was $ 1,500 , but it would go up the further south the immigrant came from .
Spezzia kept a third of the money and would give the rest to the coyote because , as Garza testified , " they did all the work . "
On the November night when Garza came along , Spezzia wheeled off the highway and down a dirt road onto the ranch , where he stopped and turned off the car lights .
Eight immigrants and a runner broke from the brush and crammed into Spezzia 's Expedition .
Spezzia was driving back toward Houston when a sheriff 's patrol car drove up behind them near San Benito .
Spezzia made a quick turn , opened the doors and his cargo scrambled out just as the deputy turned on his flashing lights and pulled over the SUV .
Police questioned the pair for hours before setting them free .
The two denied knowing anything , and neither the deputy nor Border Patrol agents who were called in ever found the coyote or any of the immigrants who fled into the night .
The encounter scared Garza , and she told Spezzia she never wanted anything to do with his business ever again .
But that did n't last .
Within months , she was helping him once more .
_____________________
After the close call with the police near San Benito , Spezzia took a break from driving to South Texas to pick up illegal immigrants .
It did n't stop him from running a stash house , though .
Garza came home to the Windjammer Apartments one day and found her bed in the living room and about 12 immigrants being kept inside the bedroom .
They were there for four or five days before being released .
Garza said Spezzia would play with a sawed - off shotgun in front of her in the apartment , and he told her he'd carry it into the bedroom to scare the immigrants .
And when that load had left , a new one rolled in .
In late December , Spezzia resumed driving south to pick up coyotes and illegal immigrants .
He kept them at the Howard Johnson Inn near his home .
In just a few short weeks , Spezzia and his friends had picked up several loads .
Miguel was part of one that second weekend of January 2007 .
It was that same weekend that Garza began helping her boyfriend again .
Spezzia 's driver 's license had expired and the employees at Western Union would n't let him pick up the money that families were sending to free their smuggled relatives .
Spezzia had called Western Union , and a worker there told him that he had more than 1,000 transactions and they wanted to make sure the money was n't illegal .
Over the weekend , Garza went to Western Union two or three times a day .
She testified that at least $ 20,000 went through her hands , with most of it going to Spezzia and some to the families of ­runners .
On Saturday , January 6 , Garza was having trouble with a particular transaction at Western Union because there was a problem with a specific name .
She tried calling Spezzia but could n't get ahold of him .
Later that day , when Garza finally saw Spezzia , he told her something had gone wrong at a drop - off and that the man who'd been smuggled had run off , so they nabbed a family member and were keeping him at the Howard Johnson Inn .
Two days later , she was in the hotel room with Spezzia and Elmer when Spezzia had Danilo on the phone .
Spezzia told her to step outside .
It was cold that day , so Garza waited in the car .
About half an hour later , Spezzia joined her .
" Charles said that he had burned him on his arm , " Garza testified .
" He had a smile on his face . "
That evening , Spezzia and Garza slept at a Palace Inn motel to get some alone time because Spezzia 's brother and his girlfriend had been fighting .
Before going to sleep , Spezzia told Garza he was scared but that it would all be over the next day .
Danilo had already begun working with police and federal immigration agents that morning trying to rescue Elmer .
Danilo had given the agents Spezzia 's phone number , and they traced it to his apartment .
Spezzia and Garza were pulling out of the Windjammer parking lot in a blue Mercury when suddenly a police car appeared .
Spezzia turned the corner into the Howard Johnson 's and cops swarmed all around with guns drawn .
Spezzia and Garza were arrested in the parking lot of the hotel , where police had discovered Elmer alone in the bathroom .
The only shirt Elmer had with him was a red , white and blue soccer jersey with " U.S.A. " written across the chest .
Later that day , federal immigration agents initiated deportation proceedings against Elmer and Miguel and placed the brothers inside a holding facility for nearly three months before releasing them with instructions to check in regularly .
_____________________
Elmer and Miguel have disappeared .
The two might still be in Houston ; they might not .
No one seems to know for certain .
A member of a Houston social services organization who handles immigration cases told the Houston Press that he referred Elmer and Miguel to trauma counseling as a requirement for assistance in their immigration matter .
Suddenly , however , the two brothers vanished more than a year ago and the worker has not heard from them since .
At the time , Elmer and Miguel were trying to obtain U - visas , which authorize noncitizens to stay in the United States provided they 've suffered physical or emotional abuse as the result of a crime and have been helpful with the investigation and prosecution of the crime .
The trauma counseling was suggested to Elmer and Miguel to show the government that they had in fact suffered emotional harm after Elmer was taken hostage .
When asked about the status of Elmer and Miguel 's immigration cases and for the names of the attorneys representing the two brothers , ICE spokeswoman Nina Pruneda said that due to a certain " sensitivity " surrounding the case , she could not give the Press any information , and she directed the Press to file a freedom of information request .
Several days later , Houston 's ICE spokesman Greg Palmore said that there is no indication in the case file that either Elmer or Miguel have split town or decided to flee to avoid their pending immigration hearing .
Palmore says that as far as he can tell from the file , both men are still awaiting their day in court .
As for Garza , these days she is focused on raising her children and getting her life back on track .
She asked the Press not to reveal her location and declined to say much about her days riding shotgun with Spezzia .
When first asked for an interview , she said , " This is n't anything that 's going to land me in a body bag , is it ? "
Garza says she no longer has any contact with Spezzia .
" I have kids and I 'm not trying to put them in any kind of endangerment , " she says .
" We all made a mistake and that 's all there really is to it .
I 'm just trying to move on with my life . "
These days , Spezzia calls home a cell inside Big Sandy federal penitentiary , a little more than a two - hour drive from Lexington , Kentucky .
But unlike the illegal immigrants he was convicted of harboring , no amount of money will set him free .
He is at the front end of his 27 - year sentence , which he is appealing .
His attorney , John Friessel , declined to comment and asked that the Press not contact Spezzia or his family .
During his weeklong jury trial , Spezzia never took the stand .
The only glimpse jurrors got of his side of the story was through the testimony of ICE agent Reginald Buchanan , who interviewed Spezzia shortly after Spezzia 's arrest .
Spezzia told Buchanan that a man called Negro Banbone picked Spezzia up on that Saturday in January , saying he was going to deliver an illegal immigrant to a family but was not comfortable going alone .
Banbone offered Spezzia $ 1,000 of the $ 1,800 fee , so Spezzia went along .
Spez­zia told Buchanan that he was involved but his role was minimal , and that Banbone and others were the ringleaders .
But to the jury , none of this mattered .
Garza 's testimony , coupled with the wrenching accounts from Miguel and Elmer , was enough for them to convict Spezzia .
" It was more emotional than most federal criminal trials , " says Assistant U.S. Attorney Costa .
Miguel and Elmer " told their story , why they came and what happened when they did , and I think most people in the court were moved by that .
It 's a very human story and a tragic story . "
More damning than all the testimony , however , says Costa , were the photographs taken of Elmer after his rescue , undeniable proof of the brutality he suffered .
The jury saw pictures of Elmer sitting in the hotel room wearing a blood - stained shirt .
They saw other pictures of his charred forearms and his mangled foot .
It was too much .
It was enough .

Y Combinator

[ ruby - list:35058 ] に刺激を受け て Y combinator を解読してみた。 こんなもん読むくらいなら以下の参考ページを読んだほうがいい。
参考にした ( というかほとんどそのままな ) ページ ( 英語 )
動機
再帰関数は再帰するときに自分自身を名前で呼ぶのが普通である。
これをなんとかして名前を使わず、関数そのものを呼ぶように させたい。
求めかた
まず単純な fact ( 階乗 ) を以下に示す。言語 は
Scheme である 。
( define fact ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) )
ここから名前をなくすために、まず普通に書いた fact と同じ中身の 関数を返す関数を作る 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( fact (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
fact 呼び出しも引数にしてくくりだしてしまう。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( proc (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
しかしこれをどう呼び出せばいいだろう。
( fact - maker 5 )
ではまずい。関数が返って終わりだ。
再帰し続ける限り ( 呼び出しが続く限り ) fact が必要なわけだから、 引数に fact - maker が必要だ。また最初の一回だけでなく fact - maker は 常に 「 次 」 の関数に引数として fact - maker を渡し続けないといけない。 と考えると、まず一発目の呼び出し は
( ( fact - maker fact - maker ) 5 )
でなければいけないし 、fact - maker の中身の proc 呼び出しの ところでも同じく ( proc proc ) でなければならない 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( ( proc proc ) (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
これで ( 1 ) 関数の生成 ( 2 ) 呼び出し ( 3 ) 次の引数に fact - maker を渡す、 の三つが連鎖して行われるようになり、正常に値を求められる。
しかしこれではまだ fact - maker という名前が残っているし、 必ず ( proc proc ) と書かなければいけないのも悔しい。 ( fact (- n 1 ) ) だったところを単純に fact を引数化して ( proc (- n 1 ) ) と書き換えれば済むようにしたい。そこで今度は ( fact - maker fact - maker ) 自体を生成する関数を作ることを 考えよう。これには 、
(f 5 )
と
( ( lambda ( x ) ( f x ) ) 5 )
の評価値が同じであるという技を使う。 ( この二つの違いはと言うと、上のほうが「即座に」値を求めている
のに対して下は lambda をかますことで評価を少し先送りしていることだ。 評価される時期は ( Schemeでは ) 異なるが、λ抽象としての評価値は同じである)
この技を適用すると 、
( ( proc proc ) real - arg )
この式は次のように書きなおせる。
( ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) real - arg )
だから fact - maker は次のように書き直しても評価値は同じだ 。
( define fact - maker ( lambda ( proc ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
ここで proc ではなく最初から今展開した lambda を引数にとる ようにすれば、この部分を外に出して階乗計算部分だけ残すことが できる。関数名は fact0 に、引数名は proc から f に変えよう 。
( define fact0 ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;; くくりだされた部分 ( fact - maker いっこぶん ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) )
ところで、わざわざ lambda でくくって出すのではなく ( proc proc ) を そのまま抜き出してはいけないのだろうか。これは、いけない。実際 やってみると無限ループに陥る。そもそもやりたいことは ( proc proc ) が f の 「中 」で評価されることであって、( proc proc ) をそのまま抜き出すと f の 「外 」で評価されてしまう。
あとは呼び出し側の ( fact - maker fact - maker ) を修正すればいい。 fact - maker 一個分に相当する表現はわかっているから、それを 二回書いてリストにするだけだ 。
( ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( fact0 ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) )
さらに fact0 は名前なのでくくりだせる 。
( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ) )
これで完成である。 あとは fact0 をあわせればうまくいく 。
; ; ; 名前を付けただけ ( define Y ( lambda ( f ) ( ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( proc ) ( f ( lambda ( arg ) ( ( proc proc ) arg ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ;;; 自分自身を受け取る fact ( define fact0 ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( n ) ( if ( zero ? n) 1 (* n ( f (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( ( Y fact0 ) 5 ) ; 答えは 120
この Y を Y combinator って言うんだってさ。ふーん。 ちなみにコンビネータっていうのはプログラム意味論の用語。手続き名も 含む 「 変数」がすべて束縛変数である ( 引数になっている ) λ式のこと。 そういうλ式はまわりの環境に依らずに同じ動作ができる……つまり完全に 自分自身の意味が固定されている 。
