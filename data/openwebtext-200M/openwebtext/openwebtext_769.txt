Merry Christmas from Rick Warren !
You ’re all hateful , evil , and not even Christian !
Barack Obama ’s good buddy Rick Warren recorded a video yesterday , talking about the outcry over his being chosen to given the invocation at Obama ’s swearing in .
And it ’s a doozie .
Warren ’s big mouth , and apparent ego , is pretty much guaranteeing that this controversy will continue all the way up until the inauguration and beyond .
In the new video , Warren accuses gays of “ hate speech , ” of launching “ hateful attacks ” against him , and he then says that gay and lesbian Americans have “ Christ - ophobia , ” a clear effort to mock the term “ homophobia . ”
He goes on to explain that gays are “ afraid of any Christian , ” suggesting that gay and lesbian Americans – gay and lesbian Obama voters – are not Christians .
He then goes on to call gays criticizing him “ evil . ”
All this from a man who compared gay marriage to incest and pedophilia , and who explicitly bans “ unrepentant gays ” from his church membership .
( He also adds that bloggers are “ rude ” and “ need to get a life . ”
I do n’t really care about that part , it ’s just more evidence that we ’re getting under Warren ’s skin , and that he ’s not quite ready for prime time . )
Now that Obama has tied his horse to Rick Warren , and Warren is now speaking out and accusing gay and lesbian Obama supporters of being hateful , evil , of not being Christians , and of fearing all Christians and apparently Christ himself – mind you , we ’re told by Obama ’s pastor friend that we ’re not really Christian only three days before Christmas – it ’s time for Barack Obama to answer some questions about the very vocal Mr. Warren .
Does Obama agree with Rick Warren that gay and lesbian Americans have been “ evil ” and “ hateful ” in this affair ?
Does Obama agree that gay Americans are not Christians ?
Does Obama agree that gays have “ Christ - ophobia ” ?
Keep fanning those flames , Mr. Warren .
This all changed in 1689 when , in the Glorious Revolution , the English Parliament relegated the monarch to the tabloid gossip pages and took for itself the power of both taxing and spending .
This unification led to rapid increases in government spending :
But taxes have always been unpopular , and in eighteenth century England they were riotously , call - out - the - militia unpopular .
Parliament 's appetite for spending would thus have been curbed .
But Parliament discovered an unexpected benefit of its newly enhanced taxing power : the government could become the safest of all borrowers .
By the 1720s the British government discovered it could borrow at astonishingly low interest rates .
This liberating discovery -- that you could spend without taxing -- led to unprecedented levels of public debt .
Under times of fiscal stress this debt mounted rapidly .
Between 1720 and 1815 , the interminable struggle with France for European supremacy raised the debt to 2.5 times national income , close even to the levels of the modern US .
WWI and WWII also saw rapid accumulations of debt , as the figure above shows .
Now , as societies face permanent fiscal stress from the massed armies of the elderly and the battalions of their attending physicians , we can see where public debt is headed once again .
The pressure of increased retirement and medical costs for the poor will not abate .
We have entered the permanent equivalent of the British government 's eighteenth - century struggle with the French .
We have entered a world of constantly rising debt .
What will stop it from rising ?
The inability to service the debt through taxes .
Economists like Martin Feldstein have for years warned in vain of the insidious damage such debt does by crowding out private capital .
But because this damage is creeping and insidious -- not as obvious as hacking off a limb -- it will never motivate real political action .
Instead we will see an endless series of " fiscal responsibility summits . "
There will be plans for reforms , all conveniently timed to bite some years in the future .
The new politics of Obama will soon succumb to the old politics of debt .
None of this is new .
As the British public debt mounted in the eighteenth century there were similar demands for reform .
" Sinking funds " were created to allow for the extinction of the debt , which in the meantime grew ever larger .
What stopped the rise of British debt after 1815 was not any political genius , but the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo and the subsequent collapse in military spending .
But Napoleon at his best was a much easier foe that the combination of American retirees and their physicians .
A bicentennial silver dollar is a reverse of the Eisenhower dollar coin .
The essence of it was to celebrate the memorial of the 200th birthday celebration of the bicentennial of American independence .
The bicentennial coins created were of two different types .
Type one was for circulation and type two was to be a collectible .
In creating Type one , they used copper alloy / based metal while they used 40 % silver for Type two .
The question is : how much is a bicentennial silver dollar worth ?
Due to the remarkable history surrounding the mint of the bicentennial Eisenhower dollar coin , most coin collectors are eager to know how much a bicentennial silver dollar worth is .
One can measure its worth through the rise and fall in the value of silver .
For example , if silver contents are worth around $ 20 per ounce , a bicentennial silver dollar will worth around $ 14 , while proofs will worth $ 20 .
Although there are two types of the bicentennial dollar , they both share the same design .

Bicentennial Coinage Design And Sales
The Bicentennial coinage is what we also refer to as the complete set of circulating commemorative coins .
The coinage consists of a dollar , half a dollar , and a quarter that was struck in 1975 and 1976 by the United States Mint .
Both the Eisenhower dollar , Kennedy half a dollar , and Washington quarter coin bears the double date 1776 - 1976 at the obverses regardless of when struck .
None of the three denominations carries the year 1975 during the bicentennial celebration .
A nationwide design competition held to determine the final design for the obverse of the coinage .
The designs chosen was the design of the Liberty Bell overlapped against the moon , for the dollar .
The plan for the half dollar was the Independence hall , while the design for the quarter was the Colonial drummer .
The coinage is still standard in modern days due to the large quantity struck .
The circulation pieces were in copper - nickel , while 45,000,000 40 % of silver pieces were for collectors .
It happened that there was the sale of over half of the bicentennial silver coins before its withdrawal from sales in 1986 .
The Bicentennial Coinage Competition
The Treasury Department announced a design competition on the 23rd of October , 1973 , for the reverse design of the dollar , half a dollar , and quarter coin .
Every citizen was eligible to enter the competition , except persons chosen to be on the panel and the sculptors employed by the US government .
These were the only categories of persons that one could consider ineligible to participate in the competition .
Citizens were to submit a photograph or drawing of his or her desired design bearing the “ quarter dollar ” inscription .
Shultz , who was the Treasury Secretary at that time and a panel of judges selected by the National Sculpture Society , would decide the design which they will use for each denomination .
The inscription for higher denominations was to change to half a dollar and one dollar .
The price tag for each winner was $ 5,000 .
Also , the reverses would bear the motto “ e Pluribus Unum ” and the country ’s name .
The 14th of December , 1973 , was the first deadline for submission but later extended to the 9th of January , 1974 , due to Christmas mail delays and energy crisis .
They chose West Point as the venue for judging the designs .
However , due to the delay , it shifted to the Philadelphia mint .
The mint received up to 884 entries and 15,000 inquiries before the deadline .
Each sculptor that submitted won a $ 750 prize , however , only twelve designs made it to the semifinal .
They encouraged and assisted the competitors in making plaster models and putting their work in the models if they had not done so already .
Three persons won the competition .
The first winner of the coinage competition was Mr. Jack L. Ahr , who lived at 1802 South Highland Avenue , Arlington Heights , Illinois .
The panel chose his design “ the colonial drummer ” to appear on the reverse of the quarter .
Mr. Seth G. Huntington , who was staying at 4153 Aldrich Avenue South , Minneapolis , Minnesota , also won the competition .
They chose his design of the Independence Hall to appear at the back of the half dollar .
The third winner was Mr. Dennis R. Williams , a student at the Columbus College of Art and Design , Columbus , Ohio .
They chose his design of the moon and Liberty Bell combination to appear on the obverse of the dollar .
The Bicentennial Coinage Issue Of 1975 – 1976
Within 1892 and 1954 , the United States government issued out commemorative coins basically to raise funds for some organizations that were worthy of federal support .
A sponsoring organization receives the right to purchase the issue at the standard value and sell it back to the public at a premium value to gain dividends .
However , there were lots of complaints from the public concerning private organizations purchasing the coins and reselling them for private profit .
The people believed that these organizations should not use public coins for private gain .
Also , various problems , including the mishandling of distributions , led the firm , Treasure Department , to oppose the continual issuance of the coin .
Thus , the issuance of the coin stopped , and there was no striking of the coin after 1954 .
In 1966 , Congress formed an oversight body known as The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission ( ARBC ) .
The essence of the ARBC was to manage the upcoming 200th anniversary of American independence ( bicentennial ) planned for 1976 .
Meanwhile , in 1970 , the bicentennial medals and coins advisory committee suggested the issuance of a particular half dollar in memory of the 200th bicentennial celebration .
The committee also suggested the redesign of already circulating American coins .
At first , the United States Mint and Brooks department opposed the proposals but later went ahead to redesign the reverses of the dollar , half a dollar , and quarter coins .
It also added that it could issue an exclusive collectible set in silver clad .
President Nixon signed the legislation that authorized it on the 18th of October , 1973 .
The legislation provided for the minting of the dollar , half a dollar , and quarter coins denomination from the 4th of July , 1975 , to the 31st of December , 1976 , and would bear the date 1776 - 1976 and special reverses .
Also , there were expectations of 45 million coins in silver clad to sell to the public at a premium .
Bicentennial Dollar Coin
After the era of the peace dollar coin that ended in 1935 , there was no dollar coin in print for up to 30 years .
In 1965 bullion prices were on the rise .
The effect of it is that it made the United States Mint start striking copper - nickel coins rather than silver coins .
However , in 1969 , legislators sought to reestablish a dollar coin .
With the ongoing consideration waiting to gain approval , there came the sudden death of Eisenhower in March 1969 .
Thus , many proposals stated that the printing of the new dollar coin should gear towards honoring Eisenhower by putting his face at the front .
Finally , in 1971 , the United States Mint started issuing the Eisenhower dollar coin , which was the first coin of that denomination since the end of the peace dollar coin in 1935 .
Frank Gasparro designed both sides of the coin .
At the front of the coin was President Dwight D. Eisenhower , and at the back of the coin is an image of the moon to honor the Apollo 11 moon mission designed by astronaut Michael Collins .
Before the release of the coin for circulation , a dispute between supporters was on whether the coin should be 40 % silver or in the base metal .
The disagreement caused a delay but was later resolved in 1979 when they were able to reach a compromise .
The newly accepted idea was that the mint would strike the Eisenhower dollar in 40 % silver as a collectible and also in base metal for circulation .
On the 31st of December 1970 , President Richard Nixon , who was the vice president to President Eisenhower , signed the legislation that authorized the mintage of the new dollar coin .
The new dollar coin named the Eisenhower coin did n’t do very well in circulation except within Nevada casinos , where it replaced private issued tokens .
But the collector ’s pieces received full acceptance , which resulted in massive sales of the silver coin .
In 1975 , the mint deliberated to replace the Eisenhower dollar coin with a smaller sized piece and also to mark the bicentennial of American independence .
Dennis E Williams did a special reverse of the dollar coin , which included adding a double date to the dollar coin between1776 to 1976 .
However , from 1975 , coins started having double dates , which is 1776 - 1976 , to signify the 200th celebration of the bicentennial of American Independence .
The Eisenhower coin also reversed to the bicentennial dollar coin .
Conclusion
The bicentennial coinage is one of the best projects ever by the US government though it experienced little success .
The coinage marks a memorable day for the United States of America .
These and many more reasons are why how much is a bicentennial silver dollar worth will be a repeated question in the United States of America .
While speculations show that the coin circulation failed due to the low valued metals used to strike it , the bicentennial silver dollar collectible expects to increase in value because of the bicentennial celebration .
Americans will be delighted to have such a piece in their coin inventory .

At my hotel in Phnom Penh , the women and children sat on one side of the room , palais - style , the men on the other .
It was a disco night and a lot of fun ; then suddenly people walked to the windows and wept .
The DJ had played a song by the much - loved Khmer singer Sin Sisamouth , who had been forced to dig his own grave and to sing the Khmer Rouge anthem before he was beaten to death .
I experienced many such reminders .
There was another kind of reminder .
In the village of Neak Long I walked with a distraught man through a necklace of bomb craters .
His entire family of 13 had been blown to pieces by an American B - 52 .
That had happened almost two years before Pol Pot came to power in 1975 .
It is estimated more than 600,000 Cambodians were slaughtered that way .
The problem with the UN - backed trial of the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders , which has just begun in Phnom Penh , is that it is dealing only with the killers of Sin Sisamouth and not with the killers of the family in Neak Long , and not with their collaborators .
There were three stages of Cambodia 's holocaust .
Pol
Pot 's genocide was but one of them , yet only it has a place in the official memory .
It is highly unlikely Pot Pot would have come to power had President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser , Henry Kissinger , not attacked neutral Cambodia .
In 1973 , B - 52s dropped more bombs on Cambodia 's heartland than were dropped on Japan during the second world war : equivalent to five Hiroshimas .
Files reveal that the CIA was in little doubt of the effect .
" [ The Khmer Rouge ] are using damage caused by B - 52 strikes as the main theme of their propaganda , " reported the director of operations on May 2 , 1973 .
" This approach has resulted in the successful recruitment of a number of young men [ and ] has been effective with refugees . "
Prior to the bombing , the Khmer Rouge had been a Maoist cult without a popular base .
The bombing delivered a catalyst .
What Nixon and Kissinger began , Pol Pot completed .
Kissinger will not be in the dock in Phnom Penh .
He is advising President Obama on geopolitics .
Neither will Margaret
Thatcher , nor a number of her retired ministers and officials who , in secretly supporting the Khmer Rouge after the Vietnamese had expelled them , contributed directly to the third stage of Cambodia 's holocaust .
In 1979 , the US and Britain imposed a devastating embargo on stricken Cambodia because its liberators , Vietnam , had come from the wrong side of the cold war .
Few Foreign
Office campaigns have been as cynical or as brutal .
The British demanded that the now defunct Pol Pot regime retain the " right " to represent its victims at the UN and voted with Pol Pot in the agencies of the UN , including the World Health Organisation , thereby preventing it from working in Cambodia .
To disguise this outrage , Britain , the US and China , Pol Pot 's main backer , invented a " non communist " coalition in exile that was , in fact , dominated by the Khmer Rouge .
In Thailand , the CIA and Defence Intelligence Agency formed direct links with the Khmer Rouge .
In 1983 , the Thatcher government sent the SAS to train the " coalition " in landmine technology - in a country more seeded with mines than anywhere except Afghanistan .
" I confirm , " Thatcher wrote to opposition leader Neil Kinnock , " that there is no British government involvement of any kind in training , equipping or co-operating with Khmer Rouge forces or those allied to them . "
The lie was breathtaking .
In 1991 , the Major government was forced to admit to parliament that the SAS had been secretly training the " coalition " .
Unless international justice is a farce , those who sided with Pol Pot 's mass murderers ought to be summoned to the court in Phnom Penh : at the very least their names read into infamy 's register .

Swindles in which someone overseas seeks access to a person ’s bank account are so well known that most potential victims can spot them in seconds .
But one man found success by tweaking the formula , prosecutors say : Rather than trying to dupe an account holder into giving up information , he duped the bank .
And instead of swindling a person , he tried to rob a country  of $ 27 million .
To carry out the elaborate scheme , prosecutors in New York said on Friday , the man , identified as Paul Gabriel Amos , 37 , a Nigerian citizen who lived in Singapore , worked with others to create official - looking documents that instructed Citibank to wire the money in two dozen transactions to accounts that Mr. Amos and the others controlled around the world .
The money came from a Citibank account in New York held by the National Bank of Ethiopia , that country ’s central bank .
Prosecutors said the conspirators , contacted by Citibank to verify the transactions , posed as Ethiopian bank officials and approved the transfers .

I guess the Republicans actually want to stay in the minority ?
Politico :
Fresh off his stint as a war correspondent in Gaza , Joe the Plumber is now doing political strategy with Republicans .
When GOP congressional aides gather Tuesday morning for a meeting of the Conservative Working Group , Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher – more commonly known as Joe the Plumber — will be their featured guest .
This group is an organization of conservative Capitol Hill staffers who meet regularly to chart GOP strategy for the week .
Wurzelbacher , who became a household name during the presidential election , will be focusing his talk on the proposed stimulus package .
He 's apparently not a fan of the economic rescue package , according to members of the group .
Some ID cards will be handed out to the public by the end of next year , the Home Secretary said today .

Jacqui Smith said " small volumes " of cards will be available months ahead of schedule .
Ministers are considering launching a website in the New Year enabling anyone who wants a card to register their interest .
The cards , which will store copies of two fingerprints and a facial scan - will enable holders to travel around Europe without a passport .
They will cost £ 30 each and will be available for everyone else from 2011 .
The overall cost of the ID card and biometric passport scheme is nearly £ 5 bn .
Launching the government 's response to a consultation on ID card delivery , Ms Smith said the cards would replace bank statements , driving licences and birth certificates for anyone looking to confirm their identity .
The biometric data stored on the cards and the ID card database could be collected on the high street at post office counters or in shops , she said .
She also announced stronger powers for the ID cards watchdog to enforce cooperation by government departments and companies involved in collecting the data .
Addressing the Social Market Foundation think tank in central London , she said there was already a need for a " universal means of proving identity " .
She said : " The time is fast approaching when the use of bills and bank statements to prove our identity will no longer cut it , and when our personal dictionary of different passwords for different purposes will become too unwieldy to work effectively . "
Toronto residential property taxes will rise by 4 per cent in 2009 - an increase of $ 89 on a home assessed at $ 387,000 , according to the budget unveiled this morning .
Under the $ 8.7 billion budget proposal , the total take from property taxes will rise by 2.5 per cent .
But in keeping with the city 's long - term policy of easing business property tax rates , homeowners pick up a greater share of the increase .
Mayor David Miller said the increase amounts to 25 cents a day .
Councillor Shelley Carroll , the city 's budget chief , said there are " no major service reductions " contemplated in the budget plan .
Some user fees on recreation programs will also increase .
But the land transfer tax and the vehicle tax will not increase , Miller said .
Miller said higher costs for transit , policing , snow clearance and welfare are the main factors driving the city 's costs up .
The city managed to find $ 100 million in cost savings to offset the higher spending , he said .
Miller said that programs to cancel or defer tax increases for low - income earners and seniors will be expanded .
That means another 22,000 families will qualify for assistance , Miller said .
But he said the city can still manage to pay its bills .
" We are introducing our second consecutive budget balanced at its inception , " Miller said .
The budget committee will hold public hearings on the budget Feb. 18 - next Wednesday .
The committee will also accept written briefs .
Seven councilors who form the core of Miller 's opposition on council disputed the mayor 's claim that the budget will raise taxes by 4 per cent .
Asked why the city is raising taxes during a recession , Miller said the city is n't legally permitted to run an operating deficit .
That 's in contrast to the federal government , which can run a deficit to stimulate the economy during downturns .
The city , meanwhile , is boosting taxes about $ 89 per household .
Thomas Lubanga insists he was trying to bring peace to the Ituri region
The first witness at the war crimes trial of DR Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga has retracted his testimony at the International Criminal Court .
Testifying from behind a screen , but visible to the defendant , he first said he had been recruited by Mr Lubanga 's fighters on his way home from school .
But after a break in proceedings he denied this .
The court in The Hague was adjourned after the prosecution asked for witness safety to be reviewed .
Mr Lubanga , the first person to be tried at the ICC , denies using hundreds of child soldiers in Democratic Republic of Congo 's five - year conflict , which ended in 2003 .
His trial opened on Monday after a seven - month delay , as judges and prosecutors disputed confidential evidence .
Witness ' concerns ' Correspondents note that while the unnamed boy 's identity was concealed from the public gallery , he could be seen by Mr Lubanga , 48 , who glared at him as he testified .
THOMAS LUBANGA
Leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots , an ethnic Hema militia Accused of recruiting children under 15 as soldiers Arrested in Kinshasa in March 2005
Held by the ICC at The Hague since 2006 Born in 1960 , has a degree in psychology
Trial starts road to justice Profile : Thomas Lubanga Asked by prosecutor Fatou Bensouda whether he had attended a military training camp , he replied " No " , and the defendant was seen to give a smile , the AFP news agency reports .
Ms Bensouda then requested , and obtained , a delay of the trial to investigate " concerns the witness has about protective measures ... what happens after he gives his testimony and returns home " .
" We are convinced it has an effect on the testimony the witness is giving now , " she told the three judges .
The witness gave testimony in Swahili from behind a screen to protect him from public view and his voice was electronically distorted .
Earlier , the witness said that " Thomas Lubanga 's soldiers " had recruited him one day as he was walking home from school with friends .
Mr Lubanga insists he was trying to bring peace to Ituri , a region in the east wracked by years of conflict between rival groups seeking to control its vast mineral wealth .
Seeking a sentence of up to 30 years , prosecutors say child soldiers enlisted for Mr Lubanga 's Hema militia were used to kill members of the rival Lendu ethnic group , or as his bodyguards .
Children were allegedly abducted on their way to school or to sports fields and young girls were taken as sexual slaves by militia commanders as soon as they reached puberty .
The UN says more than 30,000 children were recruited during the fighting , which saw some 60,000 people lose their lives .

The Illusion of Democracy
THE
ILLUSION
OF
DEMOCRACY
There are three points of view when it comes to the federal government :
1 ) Everything is more or less going along just fine .
Sure we have some problems but we ’ll work them out .
2 ) It ’s too cumbersome and intrusive , taxes are excessive , the national debt is a disgrace , and our foreign policy is long on machismo and short on goodwill .
The Democrats and Republicans got us into this mess and probably ca n’t get us out .
3 ) If you ignore it , it will go away .
Our recent presidential election took place in November of 2008 .
As usual , our so - called democracy basically gave us two choices .
The Democrats want an extensive , intrusive federal government to engineer social change and redistribute wealth .
Higher taxes and more government involvement ( intervention ) , thereby suffocating free enterprise and diminishing individual freedom .
Their goal is to nurture ( control ) their subjects from cradle to grave .
The Republicans want a strong federal government to engineer endless economic growth and support a vast military - industrial complex .
Increased military expenditures and more self - appointed international police action , thereby contributing to global strife and tarnishing our relationship with the rest of the world .
Both of these philosophies are extremely costly .
Democrats and Republicans have driven our national debt up to nearly $ 12 trillion , and it continues to rise .
Future generations will bear the burden for this insane federal spending recklessness .
If you ’re enthusiastic about one of these two options , by all means stay the course .
But if you ’re stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to choose the lesser of two evils , perhaps it ’s time to unscrew your head back out of the sand and seek an alternative .
Even though the media will try to convince you that a vote for anyone other than a Democrat or a Republican is a wasted vote , there are other alternatives .
The election process is meant to give the voters the illusion of a free democracy without actually having one .
The two major candidates for president , one Democrat and one Republican , are basically chosen by a handful of small states ( the New Hampshire Primary , the Iowa Caucuses , etc. ) , then each of the candidates personally selects their respective running mate and potential successor .
To maintain their position of power and control , the two major political parties enacted election laws that have given them a decisive advantage over any emerging alternative philosophies .
Democrats and Republicans in Congress have awarded matching campaign funds to the two major political parties ( themselves ) while making it difficult for third parties to qualify for them .
The candidates of these two parties are automatically placed on ballots in every state , while third party candidates must contend with legal quagmires on a state by state basis to get on ballots .
And so on .
To anyone with a brain larger than a pinto bean this does n’t seem like much of a democracy .
To make matter worse , the mass media focuses only on the two major political parties , as if they ’re the only two points of view , further diminishing a free democracy .
There are n’t many choices when there are only two alternatives .
This unbalanced , unfair system was n’t the result of evil intent .
But government operates on endless compromise and those in power tend to manipulate the system to favor those in power .
And the mass media goes along with it to maintain a positive relationship with those in power in order to obtain access .
Basically , the system is rigged .
The two parties in power have made it difficult for a third party to compete and the mass media has become their ally by promoting an illusion of a democracy , encouraging everyone to participate in the process under the mistaken premise that the public is apathetic rather than disgusted .
So the masses turn out every four years to do their civic duty and vote for the lesser of two evils .
But a vote for the lesser of two evils is still a vote for evil and an illusion of a democracy is only an illusion .
A two - party system is not a democracy – it ’s a closed system tightly controlled by the two parties in power .
Anyone who enthusiastically supports such a system is perpetuating a narrow , unjust form of government .
Every citizen has three choices :
1 ) You can participate in a rigged system , giving legitimacy to that system , by voting for one of the two major candidates as usual .
Be sure to pat yourself on the back for doing your civic duty .
2 ) You can vote for a third party candidate , preferably one that seeks to limit the power and scope of government , sending a message to the two major parties and the mass media that politics as usual is unacceptable .
Be sure to pat yourself on the back for having a mind of your own .
3 ) You can choose to ignore your enslavement by ever increasing government forces and bang your head against the wall .
Be sure to pat yourself on the back so you do n’t swallow your gum .
Choose wisely .
The fate of eternity is in your hands .

While most Religion Dispatches readers are familiar with the growing influence of Christian Zionists and their close relationship with Israel , few are probably aware of the penetration of American evangelicals into Northern Iraq .
Shortly after the invasion of Iraq , a number of fundamentalist Christian organizations announced plans to participate in the future rebuilding effort .
At the time , the Rev. Franklin Graham indicated that his organization , Samaritan 's Purse , would lead the way .
Graham , the son of the Rev. Billy Graham , who shortly after September 11 , got himself into a bit of a pickle by lashing out at all Muslims , famously calling Islam " a very evil and wicked religion , " was now poised -- with US troops about to march into Baghdad - - to organize welcome wagons stuffed with Bibles and bandages .
Around that time , while working on Bad Faith - - a yet - to - be- completed book focusing on the financial forces behind the religious right -- Mike Reynolds * got wind of the Nashville , Tennessee - based America 21 , a nonprofit political action committee that hopes to bring America to God by encouraging " moral leadership from our churches " to be heard " in the halls of Congress and across this nation . "
According to Reynolds , an investigative reporter whose work on the religious right has been featured in Rolling Stone , US News & World Report , and 60 Minutes , " the group caught my eye because it was involved with holding support rallies for Judge Roy Moore , who , as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court defied a federal order to remove his 5,300 - pound monument of the Ten Commandments from inside the state 's judicial building . "
The statue was later removed from the building and Moore was removed from the bench .
" Later , " said Reynolds , " I discovered that America 21 was involved with former Texas Congressman Tom Delay and the Republican Party 's uber - lobbyist Jack Abramoff . "
According to Reynolds , America 21 " was run by an old anti-abortion ambulance - chasing lawyer and lobbyist named J Thomas Smith ... [ who ] was working on behalf of some Christian evangelicals that were looking to set up shop in Kurdistan . "
Those discoveries led him to Douglas and Marilyn Layton and Servant Group International , a project run out of the Belmont Church in Nashville .
While Franklin Graham was preparing to provide relief to beleaguered Iraqis ( and to find Christian converts ) , Servant Group International had already been in Iraq for more than ten years .
Again , Reynolds :
In September 2003 , four months after US forces defeated Saddam Hussein , 350 evangelical pastors and church leaders assembled in Kirkuk , welcomed by Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani .
During the gathering , George Grant , the American director of the Classical School of The Medes , declared that ' Jesus Christ is Lord over all things ;
He is Lord over every Mullah , every Ayatollah , every Imam , and every Mahdi pretender ;
He is Lord over the whole of the earth , even Iraq !'
In a recent interview , Reynolds discussed the curiously strong presence that Christian evangelicals have established in Northern Iraq :
How did Christian evangelicals get so deeply involved with the Kurds ?
You might say that it started after Saddam Hussein 's 1988 assault on the Kurds , which culminated in the chemical weapon attack that killed thousands in the village of Halabja .
Some 14,000 refugees from Kurdistan made their way to Nashville , Tennessee , now home to the largest Kurdish population in the nation .
Four years later , a group of Nashville evangelical Dominionists known as Servant Group International , departed from the Belmont Church - - a megachurch occupying several blocks on Music Square - - making their way to the mountains of northern Iraq where they set up shop .
Why is Kurdistan important to Christian evangelicals ?
For evangelicals , Northern Iraq is prime real estate in what they call the " 10/40 Window , " which is a geographical delineation at 10 and 40 degrees North latitude that opens across North Africa , through the Middle East , India and closes in Indonesia .
The concept originated in 1991 with Argentine evangelist Luis Bush , and was expanded upon by his fellow New Apostolics C. Peter Wagner and George Otis Jr .
These zealous dominionists called it the " primary spiritual battleground in the world today ... the Church 's final evangelistic frontier . "
When the " spiritual warriors " of Servant Group International headed out of Nashville for Kurdistan it was under this banner .
With the compliance of the Barzani- led KRG and a sympathetic Bush Administration , these US evangelicals have established a solid base of operations in the Middle East for their aggressive and potentially inflammable brand of proselytizing .
With tensions ratcheting up between the Kurds and Iraqi Sunnis over who will control the oil - rich regions of Kirkuk and the Nineveh plain , having these American end - time evangelicals trying to convert Muslims in Kurdistan with the blessings of the KRG is , as a longtime Kurdistan expert told me , " like striking matches in a room full of gasoline . "
What was Servant Group International up to ?
The folks from Belmont Church had a very big agenda .
They brought with them Kurdish - language Bibles , medical equipment , lots of money , and a long - range plan to establish their " Father 's Kingdom " between the Turkish border and Iran .
Since the time of its arrival in Northern Iraq , Servant Group International has widened its presence , establishing bases in Turkey , Liberia , Indonesia , Germany , and Norway .
Can you describe how Servant Group International operates ?
What is especially distinctive about SGI -- and its partners -- is its development of a military model of evangelism ( ' spiritual warfare ' ) , which includes covert action tactics ( ' tentmaking ' ) , intelligence gathering ( ' spiritual mapping ' ) .
They have an ingrained animosity to Islam , and their Dominionist ' Kingdom Now ' worldview , is a fusion of neo-Calvinist authoritarianism and ' New Apostolic ' Pentecostalism , a cult - like millenarian sect of the Assemblies of God led by self - anointed ' apostles ' and ' prophets . '
Interestingly enough , its best - known adherent is Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin .

Abundant tiny particles of diamond dust exist in sediments dating to 12,900 years ago at six North American sites , adding strong evidence for Earth 's impact with a rare swarm of carbon - and - water - rich comets or carbonaceous chondrites , reports a nine - member scientific team .
These nanodiamonds , which are produced under high - temperature , high - pressure conditions created by cosmic impacts and have been found in meteorites , are concentrated in similarly aged sediments at Murray Springs , Ariz. , Bull Creek , Okla. , Gainey , Mich. , and Topper , S.C. , as well as Lake Hind , Manitoba , and Chobot , Alberta , in Canada .
Nanodiamonds can be produced on Earth , but only through high - explosive detonations or chemical vaporization .
Last year a 26 - member team from 16 institutions proposed that a cosmic impact event , possibly by multiple airbursts of comets , set off a 1,300 - year - long cold spell known as the Younger Dryas , fragmented the prehistoric Clovis culture and led to the extinction of a large range of animals , including mammoths , across North America .
The team 's paper was published in the Oct. 9 , 2007 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Now , reporting in the Jan. 2 issue of the journal Science , a team led by the University of Oregon 's Douglas J. Kennett , a member of the original research team , report finding billions of nanometer - sized diamonds concentrated in sediments -- weighing from about 10 to 2,700 parts per billion -- in the six locations during digs funded by the National Science Foundation .
" The nanodiamonds that we found at all six locations exist only in sediments associated with the Younger Dryas Boundary layers , not above it or below it , " said Kennett , a UO archaeologist .
" These discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants , animals and humans across North America . "
The Clovis culture of hunters and gatherers was named after hunting tools referred to as Clovis points , first discovered in a mammoth 's skeleton in 1926 near Clovis , N.M. Clovis sites later were identified across the United States , Mexico and Central America .
Clovis people possibly entered North America across a land bridge from Siberia .
The peak of the Clovis era is generally considered to have run from 13,200 to 12,900 years ago .
One of the diamond - rich sediment layers reported sits directly on top of Clovis materials at the Murray Springs site .
The eight co-authors on the Science paper were : Kennett 's father , James P. Kennett of the University of California , Santa Barbara ; A. West of GeoScience Consulting in Dewey , Ariz . ; C. Mercer of the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba , Japan ; Que Hee of the University of California , Los Angeles ; L. Bement of the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey at the University of Oklahoma ; T.E. Bunch and M. Sellers , both of Northern Arizona University ; and W.S. Wolbach of DePaul University in Chicago .
GAZA  Waves of Israeli airstrikes destroyed Hamas security facilities in Gaza on Saturday in a crushing response to the group ’s rocket fire , killing more than 225  the highest one - day toll in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict in decades .
Israeli military officials said the airstrikes , which went on into the night , were the start of what could be days or even months of an effort to force Hamas to end its rocket barrages into southern Israel .
The operation could include ground forces , a senior Israeli security official said .
Palestinian officials said that most of the dead were security officers for Hamas , including two senior commanders , and that at least 600 people had been wounded in the attacks .

After the initial airstrikes , dozens of rockets were fired into southern Israel , where an emergency was declared .
Thousands of Israelis hurried into bomb shelters amid the hail of rockets , including some longer - range models that reached farther north than ever before .
One man was killed in the town of Netivot , the first death from rocket fire since it intensified a week ago , and four were wounded .
A number of governments and international officials , including leaders of Russia , Egypt , the European Union and the United Nations , condemned Israel ’s use of force and also called on Hamas to end the rocket fire .
But in strong terms , the Bush administration blamed Hamas for the violence and demanded that it stop firing rockets .
A military operation had been forecast and demanded by Israeli officials for weeks , ever since a rocky cease - fire between Israel and Hamas fully collapsed a week ago , leading again to rocket attacks in large numbers against Israel and isolated Israeli operations here .
Still , there was a shocking quality to Saturday ’s attacks , which began in broad daylight as police cadets were graduating , women were shopping at the outdoor market , and children were emerging from school .

The center of Gaza City was a scene of chaotic horror , with rubble everywhere , sirens wailing , and women shrieking as dozens of mutilated bodies were laid out on the pavement and in the lobby of Shifa Hospital so that family members could identify them .
The dead included civilians , including several construction workers and at least two children in school uniforms .
By afternoon , shops were shuttered , funerals began and mourning tents were visible on nearly every major street of this densely populated city .
The leader of the Hamas government in Gaza , Ismail Haniya , said in a statement that “ Palestine has never witnessed an uglier massacre . ”
Later , in a televised speech , he vowed to fight Israel .
“ We say in all confidence that even if we are hung on the gallows or they make our blood flow in the streets or they tear our bodies apart , we will bow only before God and we will not abandon Palestine , ” he said .
In Damascus , Syria , Hamas ’s supreme leader , Khaled Meshal , said in an interview with Al Jazeera television that he was calling for a new Palestinian intifada against Israel , including the resumption of suicide attacks within Israel for the first time since 2005 .
Hamas , he said , had accepted “ all the peaceful options , but without results . ”

Ehud Barak , the Israeli defense minister and chairman of the Labor Party , said the military operation in Gaza would expand and deepen as necessary , adding , “ There is a time for calm and a time for fighting , and this is the time for fighting . ”
“ We wanted to attack military targets while the terrorists were inside the facilities and before Hamas was able to get its rockets out that were stored in some of the targets , ” said a top Israeli security official , briefing a group of reporters by telephone on condition of anonymity .
“ Right now , we have to hit Hamas hard to stop the launching , ” he added .
“ I do n’t see any other way for Hamas to change its behavior .
Hamas is not just a terrorist organization .
It actually rules Gaza and is well supported by Iran with some of its leadership in Syria . ”
Hamas had in recent weeks let it be known that it doubted Israel would engage in a major military undertaking because of its coming elections .
But in some ways the elections have made it impossible for officials like Mr. Barak not to react , because the public has grown anxious and angry over the rocket fire , which while causing no recent deaths and few injuries is deeply disturbing for those living near Gaza .

Israeli officials said that anyone linked to the Hamas security structure or government was fair game because Hamas was a terrorist group that sought Israel ’s destruction .
But with work here increasingly scarce because of an international embargo on Hamas , young men are tempted by the steady work of the police force without necessarily fully accepting the Hamas ideology .
One of the biggest tolls on Saturday was at a police cadet graduation ceremony in which 15 people were killed .
Spokesmen for Hamas officials , who have mostly gone underground , called on militants to seek revenge and fight to the last drop of blood .
Several compared what was happening to the 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah , when Israel reacted to the capture and killing of soldiers along its northern border with air raids , followed by a ground attack .
Hezbollah is widely viewed as having withstood those assaults and emerged much stronger politically .
The Arab League initially called an emergency meeting for Sunday in Cairo with all the foreign ministers from the member states , but later postponed it to Wednesday to give ministers time to respond .
Governments that dislike Hamas , like Egypt ’s , Jordan ’s and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , are in a delicate position .
They blame Hamas for having taken over Gaza by force 18 months ago in the aftermath of its election victory in the Palestinian Parliament , and they oppose its rocket fire on Israeli towns and communities .

But the sight of scores of Palestinians killed by Israeli warplanes outraged their citizens , and anti-Israel demonstrations broke out across the region .
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority angrily condemned the Israeli airstrikes .
Egypt , worried about possible efforts by Palestinians to enter the country , has set up machine guns along the Gaza border .
But on Saturday it temporarily opened the Rafah border crossing in order to allow the wounded to be brought to Egyptian hospitals .
In the West Bank and in some Arab parts of Jerusalem and Israel , Palestinians threw stones , causing some injuries .
Hamas is officially committed to Israel ’s destruction , and after it took over Gaza in 2007 , it said it would not recognize Israel , honor previous Palestinian Authority commitments to it or end its violence against Israelis .
Buy American is meant to ensure that only US goods are used in public works
The EU has increased its pressure on the US to reconsider the " Buy American " clause in the $ 800 bn ( £ 567bn ) economic recovery package now before Congress .
The clause seeks to ensure that only US iron , steel and manufactured goods are used in projects funded by the bill .
A European Commission spokesman said it was the " worst possible signal " .
However , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said President Obama had assured her the US would not follow protectionist policies .
" He stressed that , " she said .
The rescue plan has already been approved by the US House of Representatives and is under discussion in the Senate this week , which could sign it off before the weekend .
Criticism
The EU spokesman said Europe would launch a complaint with the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) if the clause remained .
We regard this legislation as setting a very dangerous precedent at a time when the world is facing a global economic crisis
John Bruton
EU ambassador to Washington
Obama diary : First 100 days
Dire warnings about protectionism " There is n't a great deal of scope for doing much more , but if America went ahead and did this we would have to take it up with the World Trade Organization , " the European Commission trade spokesman , Peter Power , told the BBC's Chris Mason in Brussels .
European and Canadian ambassadors to Washington have already warned that the clause could provoke protectionism and trigger retaliatory moves .
EU Ambassador to Washington John Bruton said that , if passed , the measure could erode global leadership on free trade .
" We regard this legislation as setting a very dangerous precedent at a time when the world is facing a global economic crisis , " he said .
' Under review '
The White House has said it is reviewing the Buy American part of the stimulus bill , although Vice - President Joe Biden said last week that it was legitimate to have some portion of it in the final measure .
Barack Obama says he hopes the bill will be passed quickly
In addition to the opposition from the EU and Canada , some senior US Republicans have cautioned that the Buy American measure could start trade wars .
Mr Obama has urged the US Congress not to delay his stimulus plan over modest differences .
The Democratic leader in the Senate , Harry Reid , has said he hopes the stimulus can be approved by the end of the week .
It is unlikely that the package will be able to pass the Senate without Republican support .
' Nationalistic trend '
The continuing wrangles over the Buy American clause come as hundreds of workers at UK power stations continue wildcat strike action in protest at the employment of Italian and Portuguese workers at a Total oil refinery .
HAVE YOUR SAY
At times like this of course a domestic government should encourage the consumption of home produced goods Robert Feal - Martinez , Swindon , UK Send us your comments Union leaders have denied accusations that the strikers are guilty of xenophobia .
Instead they say the UK workers are unfairly being denied the right to carry out work , because contracts are being awarded to foreign firms who bring in their own staff .
Despite this argument , the Italian and Portuguese governments have called for an end to the protests .
" We want to underline the responsibility of government to avoid this protectionist , xenophobic , nationalistic trend , " said Portugal 's Foreign Minister Luis Amado .

The Russian Prosecutor General ’s office announced plans to challenge the verdict .
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , 16 journalists have been killed in Russia because of their work since 2000 .
The most recent was Anastasia Baburova , who was shot Jan. 19 along with the lawyer Stanislav Markelov as they left a news conference .
Only one of those 16 cases has resulted in a conviction , and none of those who organized the killings have been found .
“ Russia is a country where for years and years now , journalists who cover human rights issues and corruption are being murdered and assaulted , ” said Miklos Haraszti , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ’s representative for media freedom .

“ It has to be admitted , at the highest level of the country , that there can be no free speech in a country where the best journalists are afraid for their lives for doing their jobs . ”
The three - month trial took place in a cramped courtroom , where the murder suspects watched from behind the bars of an iron cage .
Two were brothers , Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov , who prosecutors said had assisted their brother Rustam in stalking Ms. Politkovskaya to her apartment .
Rustam , who prosecutors say was the gunman , is believed to be in hiding .
A third murder suspect , Sergei Khadzhikurbanov , was accused of having hired the Makhmudov brothers , provided the weapon and coordinated the murder .
A fourth defendant , Col. Pavel A. Ryaguzov , was accused of criminal ties to the killers , but no role in the killing itself .
He was also acquitted Thursday .
The prosecution offered thin evidence , relying heavily on cellphone billing records that showed that the suspects called one another from areas around the crime scene before and after the murder took place .
The jury deliberated for two hours before returning its verdict .
Two deaths were attributed to winds in New Jersey .
In Mountainside , in Union County , the police said Maureen Carse , 61 , of Union , was killed just after 6 a.m. when a tree snapped and crashed through the windshield of her car on Route 22 .
In Newark , an unidentified woman who had just left a supermarket was killed just before 1:30 p.m. when a tree branch fell and struck her head , the police said .
Winds fanned flames that heavily damaged 11 attached homes in Queens and sent thick dark smoke swirling in the streets , hindering firefighters who could not see clearly to pinpoint a rapidly moving fire .
Six people  four firefighters and two civilians  had minor injuries in the blaze , which wrecked a row of buildings on 96th Street near 91st Avenue in Woodhaven .
Firefighters atop tower ladders poured streams of water , at times through blinding smoke screens , onto flames that leapt from gaping holes in the common loft of the two - story row houses .
By late afternoon , the fire was under control , but the roof was gone , the homes had been gutted and residents shivered in the street , wrapped in Red Cross blankets and facing homelessness .
The winds were blamed for two accidents on the Long Island Rail Road .
Shortly after 8 a.m. , a train bound for Manhattan from Ronkonkoma struck a swinging crossing gate as the train approached the Bethpage station .
The gate flew up and shattered a train window , injuring eight people .
Six were treated at New Island Hospital in Bethpage , and two others refused treatment .
A Midwestern mother accused of using a fake MySpace account to torment a teenager who later committed suicide thought the plan was a clever and funny way to deal with a girl she suspected was spreading lies about her daughter , according to witnesses Thursday .
Ashley Grills , who was testifying under a grant of immunity , said that Lori Drew was directly involved in creating the bogus MySpace profile of a 16 - year - old boy that was used to lure Megan Meier , 13 , into an online relationship .
Grills , 20 , said she was the one who came up with the idea of the MySpace account , but that Drew agreed and “ thought it was funny . ”
Megan , of Dardenne Prairie , Mo. , hanged herself two years ago after receiving an e-mail from the fictitious “ Josh Evans ” saying “ the world would be a better place without you , ” prosecutors allege .
Advertisement
Drew , 49 , is accused of violating federal law by providing false information to MySpace to set up the account , obtaining information about Megan in violation of MySpace rules , and then using the MySpace account to intentionally “ inflict emotional distress ” on the girl .
The circumstances surrounding Megan ’s death caused a national uproar when they were revealed last year .
Authorities in Missouri launched an investigation but eventually concluded that there was no statute under which Drew could be charged .
U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien indicted Drew in Los Angeles on the computer charges this spring on the theory that because MySpace is based in Beverly Hills , his office had jurisdiction .
Drew ’s attorney , H. Dean Steward , on Thursday sought to cast Megan as a deeply troubled teen who had already considered suicide and who was taking an antidepressant medication , which warned of suicidal tendencies as a potential side effect .
He read to jurors an e-mail Megan allegedly sent to Drew ’s daughter , Sarah , less than a year before the suicide : “ Every day is a struggle .
I ca n’t do anything right .
I ’m always in trouble . ”
Advertisement
Grills , a longtime family friend of the Drews ’ and an employee of Drew ’s coupon distribution business , testified that she , Drew and Drew ’s daughter were trying to figure out a way “ to expose Megan ” for rumors she ’d allegedly been spreading about Sarah .
Drew was present when Grills sat at the computer and agreed to the terms of service , though they did not read them , Grills testified .
She said Drew also helped formulate messages that were sent to Megan and at one point suggested that they have “ Josh ” arrange a meeting with Megan at a local mall at which Sarah and her friends would “ pop out ” and tease Megan .
Grills said that she and Sarah thought they might get in trouble for fabricating the Josh Evans account , but that Drew told them “ that it was fine and people do it all the time . ”
Under cross-examination , Grills said she thought she sent the final e-mail telling Megan that the world would be better off without her from an AOL instant messaging service , not MySpace .
Advertisement
In comments to a reporter outside the courtroom , Steward suggested that the revelation was a blow to the government ’s claim of jurisdiction .
Grills also testified under cross examination that Megan had been trading insults with several people online the afternoon she killed herself .
In other testimony Thursday , the Drews ’ hairdresser and a classmate of Drew ’s daughter said both Lori and Sarah Drew acknowledged to them that they were involved in the hoax on Megan .
The hairdresser , Dawn Chu , said Lori Drew told her she had a “ funny story ” to tell her before recounting how she and Grills had set up the account to fool Megan .
Chu said she told Drew that doing so was wrong , but that she did n’t respond .

She said Drew came in for a haircut again on the day of Megan ’s wake .
Chu said she asked Drew why she was going to the wake , given her role in the hoax .
“ It ’s not like I pulled the trigger , ” she quoted Drew as saying .

When President Obama discusses his $ 275 billion mortgage bailout , he talks as if it was a national problem , caused by a national decline in home prices .
“ We must stem the spread of foreclosures and falling home values for all Americans , ” he says .
But there is no national market for homes and no national price for homes .
Instead , most of the United States will pay for the folly of few .
The beneficiaries of taxpayer charity will be highly concentrated in just five states – California , Nevada , Arizona , Florida and Michigan .
That is not because the subsidized homeowners are poor ( Californians with $ 700,000 mortgages are not poor ) , but because they took on too much debt , often by refinancing in risky ways to “ cash out ” thousands more than the original loan .
Nearly all subprime loans were for refinancing , not buying a home .
MORE : WHY CALIFORNIA IS WORTH SAVING
MORE : WHAT THE BRONX CAN TEACH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
It turns out that the five states with by far the highest foreclosure rates have some things in common with each other , but very little in common with most other states .
I studied the latest available figures for state foreclosure rates , changes in home prices over one and five years , existing home sales , the percentage of mortgages that are underwater , and unemployment .
Then I compared figures for the five most foreclosure - prone states with New York and also with the 25th - ranking ( median ) state .
One out of 76 homes in Nevada went into foreclosure in January , for example , compared with one out of 173 in California , with Arizona and Florida close behind .
In New York , by contrast , only 1 out of 2,271 homes went into foreclosure .
Nationwide , foreclosures fell 10 % in January , to one out of every 466 homes .
But that is a “ mean ” average dominated by places like California and Florida .
In the median state with the 25th highest foreclosure rate , by contrast , only one out of 949 homes was in foreclosure – just one - tenth of 1 % .
Foreclosure rates were even lower in 25 other states .
In Vermont , foreclosures amounted to just one out of 51,906 homes .
Foreclosure can be a personal crisis , but it is not a national crisis .
Now consider the change in home prices between the third quarters of 2007 and 2008 , using the OFHEO price index – the only measure available by state .
Like most of the new mortgage - relief plan , the OFHEO index covers mortgages that qualified for Fannie and Freddie financing .
It excludes jumbo mortgages larger than $ 729,750 in high - cost areas like New York City .
As of the third quarter of 2008 , OFHEO home prices were still higher than a year before in 18 states , and down less than 2 % in a dozen others .
Double - digit declines in home prices were confined to just four states – surprise , every one of the Foreclosure Five except Michigan .
Even though California home prices fell 20.8 % over the year ending in the fall of 2008 , however , they were still 50 % higher than they were just five years ago .
In Florida and Nevada too , the bust in home prices obviously followed a speculative boom .
Back in April 6 , 2008 , a New York Times graph showed that default rates on only the riskiest subprime mortgages had already reached 21 % in Merced and Stockton , California , and ranged from 19 % to 24 % in Fort Myers and Naples , Florida .
So what ’s happening now ?
By looking at sales , you can see the free market is working very well .
Sales of existing homes over the past year have soared in four states where home prices fell the most .
Reducing the inventory of unsold homes , foreclosed or not , makes it easier to sell remaining homes and thereby works to arrest falling home prices .
Falling home prices are not the problem , they ’re the solution .
Obama is particularly interested in mortgages that are underwater – that is , larger than the value of the home .
But again , this varies enormously by state .
The state with the tenth highest percentage of underwater mortgages , Texas , has the same 16.5 % underwater as the so - called national average .
The other 40 states have a below - average percentage of homes that are worth less than their mortgages , which means the mean average is not at all typical of most states .
A similar report from First American Core Logic reports that only 4.4 % of New York mortgages are underwater , not even a tenth as many as in Nevada .
Looking at the Foreclosure Five , you find another consistency – unemployment rates far above the national average ( half the states were below 5.9 % in December ) .
The exception is Arizona , where unemployment is a more reasonable 6.9 % .
Stephen Miller of the University of Nevada and Rangan Gupta of the University of Pretoria explained the apparent anomaly by explaining that migration and the market for second homes make Phoenix housing dependent on economic conditions in Los Angeles and Las Vegas .
Miller and Gupta found that “ Los Angeles housing prices cause housing prices in Las Vegas ( directly ) and Phoenix ( indirectly ) .
In addition , Las Vegas housing prices cause housing prices in Phoenix ” to rise or fall in step .
Boosting the Obama team ’s selective mortgage subsidies , Mark Zandi of Moody ’s Economy.com recently told NBC , “ either you can help your neighbor , and help them so they can stay in their home .
Or do n’t help them , and they ’ll lose their home , and it will cost you money , because . . . your home will have just dropped in value . ”
On the contrary , federal subsidies for over - indebted homeowners will not often involve helping “ neighbors ” but rather those who live thousands of miles away , mainly in just five states .
In reality , the “ Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan ” compels taxpayers in most states to help those in just a few .
Aside from Michigan ’s unique dependence on autos , the other four states ’ problems are already being solved the old - fashioned way :
If something becomes too expensive , cut the price .
Or move .

I have done plenty of crazy stuff in my life , but a few adventures stand out .
Exactly 15 years ago , I was on what is called " the most remote place in the world " , an Antarctic island called " Peter I " .
It was remote , even to Antarctic standards : three days sailing from the nearest South Pole base and 1,000 miles away from the nearest hospital .
1,000 miles of frozen sea and drifting ice bergs .
It took our expedition team 6 days to get there , departing with an ice breaker from the Falklands - by itself not known to be the most frequented tourist destination .
When we landed on Peter I , we were only the third team to ever put foot on the island .
Imagine that : there had been more people and more landings on the moon than on that island .15 years ago , to the date according to my diary , we had the roughest storm ever .
I described it in this short story
This was crazy stuff .
The mere size and financial risk of the expedition , the logistical challenges , the nightmares in battling the snow blizzards hoping nobody would get hurt , and that ( please God ! ) the tents would hold up ...
But the real nutty stuff was that we had no clue how were were going to get back to the civilized world .
A one way ticket to the most remote place on the planet , it seemed ... We had chartered a Russian research vessel to pick us up ( see this short story ) , but they would only go as far as King George island , in the North of the Antarctic .
How we were going to get out of King George , was still a logistics puzzle we had not resolved when we landed on Peter I.
Desperate situations required drastic measures , so while still on the island , we chartered a C130 plane from the Uruguayan air force , through a company in Punta Arenas ( Chili ) .
Over short wave radio , we made deals with the charter company to put day - trip tourists on the plane , splitting the charter fee with us .
To cover the remaining costs , we had to sell all our tents and survival gear on King George island before the plane flew us to Southern Chili .
That was 15 years ago .
Two months after I ( eventually ) got back to Belgium , I did my first mission as a humanitarian aid worker .
And another series of crazy adventures started .
My three expeditions to the Antarctic and the Pacific are recorded in this eBook .

The historic wealth destruction of 2008 was obviously deflationary .
Defaults strip away wealth .
Institutions respond by selling assets to raise capital .
Widespread deleveraging leads to supply expansion in assets and contraction in money and credit .
Deflation .
Nevertheless , the response has been unprecedented in its own right .
Government debt held by the public was $ 5.51 trillion when September began ; by the end of 2008 , it had risen to $ 6.37 trillion .
The more than $ 1 trillion expansion in Treasury borrowing surely partially serves to offset the $ 438 billion budget deficit .
But what about the additional half a trillion dollars ?
On September 17 , the Treasury announced the creation of the " Supplementary Financing Account " in the Federal Reserve .
This is a capital reserve in the Fed financed by the Treasury selling new debt , but its excess capital is " trapped " and does not immediately reach currency in circulation .
As of January 2 , $ 259 billion is in this cash pool and $ 365 billion counting the Treasury 's " General Account . "
The capital itself is money borrowed by the public , so its immediate net effect is deflationary .
On top of that , the Fed in an unprecedented gesture has started incentivizing excess bank - reserve deposits by issuing interest on these holdings , trapping liquidity .
The Fed is essentially issuing debt , and banks are engaging in what amounts to a dollar - based Fed vs. interbank carry trade .
Banks borrow money from the Fed , deposit it back into the Fed , and profit from the differential between the federal - funds and overnight rates .
Less than $ 40 billion a year ago , the excess reserve deposits held by the Fed have ballooned to $ 860 billion .
These deposits comprise another huge pool of excess liquidity on the Fed 's balance sheet that does n't immediately affect circulated currency .
Another Fed - induced cash trap has been in the form of increased reverse repurchase agreements , which are up to $ 88 billion .
Reverse repurchase agreements are the offering of collateral in exchange for a cash loan .
The Fed has utilized reverse repurchase agreements in its liquification of banks .
It buys off toxic defaulting assets in exchange for cash and immediately reclaims the cash by selling the banks ' T - bills .
The Fed printed money to pay for these T - bills , so there is excess liquidity that is trapped in time - sensitive debt .
The Fed 's risk transfer to the taxpayer is only worsened by its lack of transparency in doing so .
The $ 2 trillion in lending is going to unknown places in exchange for unknown collateral .
This leads me to believe the Fed has been busy buying up all of the toxic assets held by banks .
This explains why it let the congressional bailout funds be used for equity purchases and not toxic debt .
It hides the huge toxic - asset purchases — which it paid for with printed money — in its balance sheet 's opacities .
Bloomberg recently made a Freedom of Information
Act request for details on bailout fund appropriations , but the Fed refused to comply and is being sued .
This secrecy by the Fed in its appropriations of taxpayer money and the most - likely worthless collateral it exchanged it for represents inflationary risks the Fed is attempting to conceal .
The Fed 's balance sheet suggests it has been cranking the printing presses like mad .
Fed liabilities have expanded to $ 2.26 trillion , up over 140 % since September .
However , currency in circulation is up only 7 % in that same time period .
Where is this " trapped " $ 1.37 trillion ?
The answer is it 's confined in temporary cash pools , whether in the Supplementary Financing Account or excess reserve deposits or in time - sensitive T - bills .
The Federal Reserve seems to be sequestering all of this cash to buy time for the Treasury to finish its funding activities .
But who is going to keep funding this expansion of Treasury debt issuance ?
The American public is broke and cannot offer its capital in return for terrible yields .
Foreign nations do n't have the means or will to continue financing our debt .
Commodity prices have collapsed , cutting deeply into foreigners ' export revenues .
Oil is down from highs around $ 150 / barrel this past summer to around $ 40 / barrel now .
In November , China announced a $ 585 billion economic stimulus package to be fully invested by the end of 2010 .
The Chinese government agreed to provide only $ 170 billion of the funds .
How will China raise the other $ 415 billion for continuous use until the end of 2010 ?
Surely , local governments and private banks and businesses can't finance such a large package in the midst of a historic recession .
The only reserve China can tap into to finance its stimulus package is its $ 1.9 trillion foreign exchange reserves , $ 585 billion of which is in US Treasury securities .
Financing its stimulus package would require selling Treasury securities , but becoming a net seller of US debt could have disastrous economic , political , and even militaristic consequences for China , so it will be interesting to see how events unfold .
What seems certain , however , is that China can no longer purchase more American debt to finance the US Treasury ( and consequently the Fed ) .
This is a problem echoed by the rest of the big creditor nations .
After China , the biggest holders of American debt securities are Japan , the United Kingdom , Caribbean banking centers , and OPEC nations .
Japan is facing enormous headwinds as its quality - focused exports are suffering massive demand destruction as its consumers abroad lose wealth at epic proportions .
Japan was a net seller of US Treasuries in 2008 and it is highly unlikely it will switch to being a net buyer anytime soon .
The British demand for American debt represented Middle Eastern oil - financed investment , but with oil prices collapsing , it will be next to impossible for this proxy demand from the UK to rise and finance additional debt .
The demand for US debt by Caribbean banking centers is because of their tax laws but as the credit crunch leads to liquidity destruction in Caribbean banks , these banking centers will no longer be able to buy additional debt .
OPEC nations ' US debt demand , similar to the UK's , is tied to Middle Eastern oil revenues financing American consumption ( of their oil exports ) .
As oil prices tank , so will OPEC nations ' economies and they too will have no wealth to buy up more American debt .
Bernie Madoff is well recognized as the perpetrator of the biggest Ponzi scheme in history , at $ 50 billion .
I beg to differ with that assessment .
The United States has financed debt with debt since the late 1980s , when its external debt / GDP broke the 0 mark .
Since then , it has risen to over 100 % of its GDP ( which in itself is quite artificially inflated because of manipulated hedonics - adjusted inflation figures ) , and now stands at $ 13 trillion .
That is what 's called a debt bubble .
Bernie who ?
But the debt bubble appears ready to collapse .
The pyramid scheme is finally running out of investors , and many Treasury ETFs ( like SHY , TLT , IEF , and IEI ) are showing classic parabolic topping patterns and the next few weeks should confirm or deny my suspicions .
Interest rates are at an obvious floor at zero , so there is nowhere to go but up .
That means bond prices have nowhere to go but down , and the falling prices will cascade into more selling until the debt bubble deflates and all the spending is financed by quantitative easing .
Judging by gold backwardation ( discussed later ) and the bearish charts on the bubbly debt ETFs , I think the debt monetization and dollar devaluation will begin within the next six weeks .
The ProShares UltraShort Lehman 20 + Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TBT ) and ProShares UltraShort Lehman 7–10 Year Treasury Bond ETF ( PST ) are good ways to play this debt - market collapse .
With an insolvent public and no foreign demand for Treasuries , the Federal Reserve will monetize debt to finance its continued bailouts and economic stimulus .
This is purely created capital pumped right into the system .
This is not anything new for the Fed — for the past two decades , it has kept interest rates artificially low and created massive artificial wealth in the form of malinvestment and debt financing .
In the past , the Fed has been able to funnel the inflationary effects of its expansionary monetary policy into equity values with its low rates , which discourage saving , causing bubble after bubble .
The excess liquidity was soaked up by the stock market , which gave the appearance of economic growth .
With inflation being funneled into equity and real estate over the last two decades , illusory wealth was created and the public remained oblivious to the inflationary risk and the great disparity between real returns and nominal .
Now that the " artificial - wealth bubble " of the past two decades is finally collapsing , one of two scenarios can occur : capital destruction or purchasing - power destruction .
Capital destruction occurs when the monetary supply decreases as individuals and institutions sell assets to pay off debts and defaults and savings starts growing at the expense of consumption , otherwise known as deleveraging .
This is deflation and the public immediately sees and feels its effect , as savings accounts , equity funds , and wages start declining .
Deflation serves no benefit to the Federal Reserve , as declining prices spur positive - feedback panic selling and bank runs , and debt repayments in nominal terms under deflation cause real losses .
Purchasing - power destruction is much more desirable by the Fed .
Its effects are " hidden " to a certain extent , as the public does n't see any nominal losses and only feels wealth destruction in obscure price inflation .
It breeds perceptions of illusionary strength rather than deflation 's exaggerated weakness .
The typical taxpayer will panic when his or her mutual fund goes down 20 % but will probably not react to an expansion of monetary supply unless it reaches 1970s price - inflationary levels .
In addition , the government can pay back its public debt with devalued nominal dollars , which transfers wealth from the taxpayers to the government to pay its debt .
Inflation is essentially a regressive consumption tax , which the government wants and the Fed attempts to " hide . "
Not only is the Treasury 's debt burden reduced but the government 's tax revenues inherently increase .
The Fed , in an effort to minimize inflationary perception , has for the last two decades supported naked COMEX gold shorts to keep gold prices artificially low .
The Fed , as well as European central banks , unconditionally supported these naked shorts to deflate prices and stave off inflationary perception , as gold prices stay artificially low .
This caused gold shorts to be " guaranteed " eventual profit , by Western central banks offering huge artificial supply whenever necessary , causing long positions in gold to be wiped out by margin calls and losses .
Now that the economy is contracting , the Fed wo n't be able to funnel the excess liquidity into equities or other similar assets .
It also can't allow the unprecedented excess liquidity of today to be directly injected into the economy , as that would be immediately very inflationary , with more than three times the money chasing the same amount of goods , technically leading to 300 % price inflation .
These figures are strictly based on monetization of the Fed 's current liabilities , not including any future deficit spending ( which is sure to dramatically increase , especially with Barack Obama 's policies ) , the American external debt , or unfunded social programs that need payment as Baby Boomers retire .
In order to funnel the excess liquidity into a less harmful asset , the Fed appears to be abandoning its support for gold naked shorts , causing shorts to suffer their own margin calls and cause rapid price expansion in gold .
On December 2 , for the first time in history , gold reached backwardation .
Gold is not an asset that is consumed but rather stored , so it is traditionally in what is called a contango market , meaning the price for future delivery is higher than the spot price ( which is for immediate settlement ) .
This is sensible because gold has a carrying cost , in the form of storage , insurance , and financing , which is reflected in the time premium for its futures .
Backwardation is the opposite of contango , representing a situation in which the spot price is higher than the price for future delivery .
On December 2 , COMEX spot prices for gold were 1.99 % higher than December gold futures , which are for December 31 delivery .
This is highly unusual and it provides strong evidence for the theory that the Fed is abandoning its support for gold shorts .
Backwardation represents a perceived lack of supply ( in this case , the artificial supply the Fed would always issue at strategic times no longer exists ) , causing investors to pay a premium for guaranteed delivery .
I consider gold 's backwardation as a leading indicator to a dramatic increase in prices .
In fact , crude began its most recent backwardation in August 2007 at around $ 75 / barrel and increased dramatically over the next nine months to $ 133 / barrel at contango levels .
" Inflation is essentially a regressive consumption tax , which the government wants and the Fed attempts to hide . "
But why would the Fed abandon its support for naked COMEX shorts ?
The unique nature of gold and precious metals provides its desirability in this Fed operation .
Gold has little utility except as a store of value , unlike most commodities ( like oil , which is consumed as quickly as it's extracted and refined ) , so its supply / demand schedule has unusual traits .
Most commodities and assets go down in price as the public loses capital , because the public has less to consume with and that is reflected in demand destruction that leads to price deflation .
Gold is not directly consumed and has much less industrial use than most other commodities .
As a result , gold is relatively " recession - proof , " as evidenced by its relative strength in 2008 .
Gold prices rose 1.7 % last year , which is quite spectacular considering equity values went down 39.3 % , real estate values went down 21.8 % , and commodity prices went down 45.0 % in the same period ( as determined by the S&P 500 , Case - Shiller Composite , and S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Indices , respectively ) .
Because gold is not easily influenced by consumer spending , highly inflationary gold prices do n't do any direct damage to the public and are a good way to funnel excess liquidity without economic destruction .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is a staunch proponent of devaluing the dollar against gold and is very supportive of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's decision to do so in 1934 .
In the past , manipulating gold prices to artificially low levels was beneficial because it prevented capital flight into a nonproductive asset like gold and kept production , investment , and consumption high ( even if it was malinvestment and unfunded consumption ) .
Bernanke 's continued active support for gold - price suppression would lead to widespread deflation that would collapse equity values and cause pervasive insolvencies and bankruptcies .
Insolvency in insurers removes all emergency " backups " to irresponsible lending and spending , which would surely ruin the economy .
Bernanke 's plan seems to be to devalue the dollar against gold with huge monetary expansion , causing nominal equity values to rise .
I 've heard estimates of 7500 and 8000 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as being minimum support levels that would cause insurers and banks to realize massive losses , causing widespread insolvencies in them and other weak sectors like commercial real estate that would irreversibly collapse the economy .
This gold - price expansion , set off by the massive short squeeze , will continue until gold prices reflect gold supply and Federal Reserve liabilities in circulation .
The " intrinsic " value of gold today ( called the Shadow Gold Price ) , calculated dividing total Fed liabilities by official gold holdings , is about $ 9,600 / oz , compared to the actual spot price of around $ 850 / oz today .
This gold - price calculation essentially assumes dollar - gold convertibility , as is mandated by the US Constitution and was utilized at various periods of American history .
The US dollar 's strength as the equity and commodity markets collapsed was due to deleveraging and an effect of the Fed 's temporary sequestration of dollars , taking dollars out of supply .
That is over .
Oil seems to be putting in a bottom on strong volume , no one is left to buy any more negative real - yield securities the Treasury is issuing , and gold has started looking very bullish .
But a good speculator always considers all situations .
Even if deflation is to occur , which I see as next to impossible , the price of gold should still rise to $ 1,500 / oz levels next year , because it has shown relative strength as one of the most viable assets left to invest in .
In addition , the short squeeze occurring in gold will provide substantial technical price expansion , even in the absence of dollar devaluation .
A rise in nominal values in deflation represents an ever greater rise in real values , so I think gold 's price ascent in real terms will be nearly identical in inflation or deflation .
I see the market breaking down from these levels to about the November lows , with commercial - real - estate stocks like Simon Property Group ( SPG ) , Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO ) , and Boston Property Group ( BXP ) leading the way , as well as retailers like Sears Holdings ( SHLD ) .
I recommend short positions ( including leveraged bear ETFs ) against these stocks for the very near term .
If the market indeed breaks down but shows bouncing / strength around 7500 – 8000 in the Dow Jones , that would confirm to me that the Fed is able and willing to inflate its way out of this crisis and I will sell my bearish positions and buy into bullish gold positions .
Because in inflation the dollar is devalued , I am a proponent of owning bullion and avoiding gold ETFs , but I do believe gold and gold - miner stocks will provide great returns over the next few years .
Royal Gold ( RGLD ) , Iamgold ( IAG ) , Jaguar Mining ( JAG ) , Anglogold Ashanti ( AU ) , Newmont Mining ( NEM ) , Randgold ( GOLD ) , Goldcorp ( GG ) , and Barricks ( ABX ) are among my favorite gold equities at this early stage in the process .
I leave you with this , a quote from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke about President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's 1934 Gold Reserve Act , which was the greatest theft of wealth I 'm aware of in American history :
The finding that leaving the gold standard was the key to recovery from the Great Depression was certainly confirmed by the U.S. experience .
One of the first actions of President Roosevelt was to eliminate the constraint on U.S. monetary policy created by the gold standard , first by allowing the dollar to float and then by resetting its value at a significantly lower level …
With the gold standard constraint removed and the banking system stabilized , the money supply and the price level began to rise .
Between Roosevelt 's coming to power in 1933 and the recession of 1937 – 38 , the economy grew strongly .
My predictions : gold at $ 2,000 / oz by the end of the year and $ 10,000 / oz by 2012 and silver at $ 30 / oz by the end of the year and $ 130 / oz by 2012 .
Countless drugs are manufactured as generic equivalents to brand name counterparts .
Generic drugs must be bioequivalent to the brand name drug , meaning that they contain the same active ingredient at the same dose , in the same dosage form , with the same route of administration .
The rate and extent of availability of the drugs must also be identical .
Brand name drugs and their generic equivalents are interchangeable , and have demonstrated the same therapeutic effectiveness in clinical trials .
Generic drugs , however , may not contain identical inactive ingredients or have identical formulations , packaging , or appearance .
The United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) allows generic drugs to be manufactured once the patent on the original brand name drug expires .
The generic drug may have a patented formulation , but the active ingredient is no longer protected by patent .
Manufacturers of generic drugs must only submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application to the FDA for approval and are not required to complete the lengthy and costly animal and clinical trials of the active ingredient .
Generic drugs are valuable in today ’s health care system , mostly because they are often sold at a 30 to 80 % savings compared to brand name drugs .
Consumers save nearly $ 10 billion annually by buying generic drugs instead of brand name drugs .
Still , many patients and health care practitioners believe that brand name drugs are clinically superior to generic drugs .
A new review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in December 2008 maintains that this opinion is unfounded .
The authors summarized nearly 25 years of randomized clinical trials comparing brand name and generic cardiovascular medications .
They also separately addressed editorials concerning generic substitution for brand name drugs .
Among all the drugs examined by the authors , no evidence indicated that brand name drugs were clinically superior to generic equivalents .
Clinical equivalence was reported for all classes of cardiovascular drugs studied .
Interestingly , though , of the 43 editorials written on generic substitution , more than half ( 53 % ) of the authors had a negative view of generic drug use .
A similar investigation of bioequivalence examined psychoactive drugs , but concluded that generic drugs may not , in fact , have the same clinical efficacy and tolerability as brand name drugs .
All of the psychoactive drugs reviewed were approved as bioequivalent and recommended as appropriate replacements for brand name counterparts when studied in healthy subjects in clinical trials .
However , in clinical practice , significant differences were uncovered .
Notably , several medications used to control seizures were not as effective as their brand name equivalents and previously seizure - free patients experienced a recurrence of seizures while taking generic medications .
The authors of this review concluded that testing of generic drugs should include analysis of clinical use and tolerability in addition to assessment in healthy subjects .
Generic drugs are important today , primarily for cost - saving reasons .
The FDA does require that all generic drugs are as safe and effective as their brand name counterparts and nearly 50 % of generic drugs are actually produced by the brand name manufacturer .
No one should be deterred from using generic equivalents , but rigorous testing should be employed to ensure that all formulations of generic drugs are tolerable and effective in clinical practice .

Defense Against Bear Hugs

Do not , under any circumstances , hug this man .

Raising an Engine
On Friday , the missing left engine from US Airways Flight 1549 was pulled to the surface from the bottom of the Hudson River .
By now , having watched your house fall in value , your 401 ( k ) plan slide toward nothingness , your job security wane , your benefits fade , the complete failure of business management , the disastrous failure of regulatory control , the finger - pointing of the political parties , and the revelation of an epic $ 50 billion fraud , none of us could be blamed if we wanted to move to Montana and shun human beings .
So here 's the big question .
What can we do to feel safe again ?
Should we push the politicians for fundamental reform ?
No way .
They simply are n't qualified to provide it .
Neither party has shown any willingness to stop promising benefits that have to be paid for by our children and grandchildren .
Their Ponzi schemes , more politely known as Social Security and Medicare , are far larger than the alleged fraud of Bernard Madoff .
It wo n't be easy , but here are some basic steps .
Go for cash .
We can't pressure the politicians if we 're as debt - strapped as they 've made the country .
We need to do whatever it takes to eliminate the menace of credit card debt .
We should make it a goal to pay all of our bills in full monthly and build enough equity in our homes that we can self - finance most outsize expenses .
That means the end of a debt - driven consumer society .
Our belt - tightening ( read : lower standard of living ) may last as long as five years .
The lending industry wo n't like this .
We may owe them money , but we do n't owe them any consideration .
Be prepared .
Most of us suffer from a misplaced trust that the world is a place of civility and continuity .
It is n't .
We need to keep a cash reserve large enough that we do n't worry at every economic hiccup .
As a practical matter , even if your cash reserve earns zero interest , it can produce an outsize return in smart , day - to - day purchases of used and bankruptcy sale goods .
Faith And Works
An awful story from the Washington Post :
“ Rob Foster was 16 when his family unraveled .
He had told his parents that he wanted to leave Calvary Temple , the Pentecostal church in Sterling the family had attended for decades .
But church leaders were blunt with his parents :
Throw your son out of the house , or you will be excommunicated .
And so that December two years ago , Gary and Marsha Foster told Rob that he had to leave .
They would not see him or talk to him .
“ I was devastated , ” he said .
(…)
Under the leadership of longtime pastor Star R. Scott , Calvary opened a school , television and radio ministries , and satellite churches around the globe .
The local congregation at one point numbered 2,000 .
Scott ’s followers see him as an inspiring interpreter of God ’s word .
Members pack the church most nights , united in their desire to live as the Bible intended and reject what they view as society ’s moral ambivalence .
(…)
In his sermons , Scott teaches that his church is scripturally superior to others and views keeping people in the fold as a matter of their salvation .
“ Anything that ’s other than a member in harmony has to be identified and expelled , ” Scott preached in May 2007 .
Do n’t be afraid of “ social services ” if you throw rebellious children out of the house , he told the congregation in an earlier sermon , because “ you obeyed God . ”
In an interview , he cited scriptures : “ Deuteronomy says if your kid does n’t follow your God , kill ’em .
That ’s what we do , but not physically .
To us , you ’re dead if you ’re not serving our God , ” he said .
Scott describes those who decide to leave the church as “ depraved , ” and Calvary ’s practice is to cut them off .
When parents have left the church , some young children have been urged to stay ; a few have been taken in by pastors .
Scott ’s family has been divided , too : Scott is estranged from his 36 - year - old son , Star Scott Jr. “ Jesus said , ‘ I did n’t come to bring peace , I came to bring a sword , ’ ” the elder Scott said about the divided families . ”
He also said : “ A new command I give you : Love one another .
As I have loved you , so you must love one another .
By this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another . ”
Also : “ Judge not , that ye be not judged .
For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again . ”
And : “ My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth . ”
And that ’s one of the things that puzzles me about this story .
This sort of thing does n’t happen only in religious groups ; really bad therapists can do similar kinds of damage .
But Christianity has texts , and those texts speak of love , and of justice , and of compassion .
How could you be told that Christ required you to throw your child out onto the street and not know that whoever told you this was not speaking for God ?
More puzzling still is this quote from the pastor who told these families to throw their kids out :
“ I ’m the one who is in authority , and I ’ll have to answer to God for that . ”
In his position , that thought would terrify me .
Suppose you believed in a just and loving God , a God who had said the things I quoted above .
And suppose you had taken it upon yourself to tell parents to throw their kids out onto the street , children to stop speaking to their “ apostate ” parents , and the various other things detailed in the Post story .
The thought that you might be wrong might not worry you much if you did n’t take God seriously — if you just took Him to be a name you could toss around at will .
But if you imagined that He was real — a real other person who might or might not approve of the things you had done in His name — then how could you not lie awake at night , wondering whether you had somehow mistaken
His will ?
And if this thought did trouble you , how could you go on to do what this pastor did ?
( And yes : I know about Abraham .
But read the story and tell me whether you think it covers this case — whether , for instance , you really think that it was God that inspired his racing ministry — apparently , church funds paid for all those cool cars — not to mention the instruction to take a “ virgin bride ” 35 years his junior less than a month after the death of his wife .
Again : taking God ’s name to justify all this would n’t worry you if you did n’t believe in God .
But if you did , it would be terrifying .
This is one of those cases in which I think that the actions of a religious person , though justified entirely in the language of faith , can best be understood on the assumption that the person in question does not really believe in God at all , in any serious sense . )
One of the best aspects of doing the work that we do is getting to see the really cool stuff that customers do with the tools we make .
One such nugget of awesome came to us last Friday , when we got an email with this AppleScript as an attachment :
faces-v3
[ Update : If you downloaded an earlier version of the script and it did n't work , try the updated one above .
It handles the ' ~ ' in the iPhoto library preference now , and it avoids a problem that folks using a document style with no line head specified would encounter . ]
The script makes use of the new Faces feature of iPhoto ' 09 .
It looks for named faces in your library , then creates an OmniGraffle document showing which ones appear in photos together .
At that point , it fires off OmniGraffle 's automatic layout feature .
I 'll let the script 's author , Armin Briegel , describe the results :
“ It probably depends on your picture taking habits , but in my graph you can pick out families and groups of people , such as my son 's classmates .
The big mess in the middle is obviously our closest friends and families .
But even there the families are in close proximity to each other . ”
In any case , this gets our robot - stamp of approval , so we thought other folks might want to check it out , as well .
Enjoy !

Bond villain , and adjusting the time on the clock I 'd installed in my top hat with the other ( also like a Bond villain , if there was a Bond villain who had such a fly hat ) .
" I think we both know what time it is , Mr. Bond .
Hat time .
I 'm going to kill you . "
" Refresh my memory , Evans , what do I have you working on right now ? "
He took out his small , leather - bound notebook .
He uses it to write down my orders and important phone numbers , as well as his own fiction and poetry .
Sometimes when he's not looking , I slip in pictures of my wiener between the pages .
He reached the page that had my latest batch of instructions and started reading .
" Mornings , you have me hanging around Hannah Montana forums , drawing comparisons between whatever project she 's currently working on and Nazism .
Most afternoons , you have me either washing your car or breaking into Jack 's house and replacing all of the pictures in his picture frames with photos of you , and ... let 's see .
Here it is , last night , at about 3 am , you called me up and mumbled something about a parachute made out of bacon . "
" Yes !
And what progress have you made on the Porkachute ? "
" So far , none , sir , but in fairness , you told me about this last night .
Also , what you 're asking for is n't technically possible . "
" Right , this all sounds like really great stuff , " I said , my mind wandering as I absently dug around in my bellybutton for awhile .
" As much as I love what you 're probably doing , I want you to drop everything and work on something new .
Evans , I 've expressed my love for Watchmen before , right ?
Well , there 's a Watchmen press screening at the Ancient Chinese Secret Theater , this Monday .
Did you know that ? "
" It 's - that 's not what it 's called .
It 's Grauman 's Chinese Theater , but yes , I was aware of it . "
" Whatever .
Now , I have it on good authority that Entertainment Weekly 's Owen Gleiberman will be attending , so he can review it for their magazine . "
" Alright , " Evans said .
His eyes narrowed , and suspicion was growing on his face , like a beard , which was also growing ( on his face ) .
" Gleiberman has been with EW since day one , and I 've always found his reviews to be very fair and thoughtful .
He 's never pandering , but he 's not elitist either .
He 's right in the middle , and I really respect his opinion . "
Remember when those two satellites collided the other day ?

" Future launches will have to be adjusted with regard to the fact that the debris [ from the collision ] has spread over an 800 - km area and will gather at a common orbit in 5 - 6 years , " said Alexander Stepanov , director of the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg .

According to NASA this massive cloud of human failure joins the 19,000 other objects that currently pollute the low and high orbit space around the planet .
As we reported last week , the Hubble Space Telescope is already in danger .
On a related note , anyone who criticized the Pixar movie Wall - E for " liberal bias " or for " unfairly " depicting future humans as slovenly creatures that polluted Earth and space to the point where it was uninhabitable is a doofus .
And so ends my personal rant for the day .

Big Pharma as a major chemical polluter
Big Pharma is contaminating our planet
Centuries of the chemical destruction of our planet
( Natural News )
Many of the pharmaceuticals consumed in the United States are made in India , where labor is cheap and environmental laws are lenient on powerful corporations .
U.S. drug companies are exploiting this situation to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of high - profit pharmaceuticals in India , where ingredients purchased for a few cents can be re-sold to U.S. health patients for hundreds of dollars ( the markup on some drugs is literally over 500,000 % ) .
There 's something else Big Pharma does n't want you to know about its drug operations in India : Researchers were recently stunned to discover that 100 pounds of a powerful antibiotic calledwas being dumped into a local streamThat 's a quantity of antibiotics that could treat an entire city of 90,000 people
But that 's not all :
The same waterway contained an astonishingreports the , some at levels that were .
( And even the levels found in the U.S. were quite alarming . )
These findings are now added to the revelations of pharmaceutical contamination unveiled by thelast year , which found that the public water supplies in virtually all U.S. cities tested were contaminated with pharmaceutical chemicals .
What 's emerging from these disturbing discoveries is a picture ofthat 's dumping chemicals into the world 's sensitive waterways , polluting villages , cities and aquatic ecosystems around the world .
Under the Bush Administration , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency outright refused to regulate pharmaceuticals as environmental hazards .
With Obama in the White House , it remains to be seen whether the new administration will clamp down on Big Pharma now has something in common with Exxon , Cargill , Alcoa and Chevron :
The outrageous pollution of the environment with toxic chemicals .
But in many ways , Big Pharma 's chemicals are far more dangerous .
HRT drugs , for example , are toxic at , and they 're now being found in public water supplies around the world .
Municipal water treatment facilities , by the way , do n't remove pharmaceutical chemicals from the water !
Whatever HRT drugs , psychiatric drugs or other chemicals that exist in the water are passed right through the water treatment centers which unwisely add yet more chemicals ( fluoride and chlorine , typically ) to the toxic brew .
Citizens drinking public water supplies in India , the U.K. , Canada and the United States are now verifiably participating in a grand experiment involving the mass medication of the population with low levels of utterly untested pharmaceutical combinations .
How long will this be allowed to continue before the environmental protection authorities clamp down onSo far , environmental regulators have done nothing to stop the dumping of drugs into public water supplies .
This is true even in America , where hospitals routinely dispose of drugs by simply flushing them down the toilet ( injecting them directly into the water supply consumed downstream ) .
Consumers also need to realize that .
Many drugs pass right through the human body unaltered , where they are flushed back into the water supply that 's consumed downstream .
( Yes , the toilet water from one city becomes the drinking water of the next city down the river .
If you did n't know this , you have a LOT to learn about the water supply , and you probably wo n't like what you learn ... especially if you live downstream ... )
It 's becoming quite clear that the pharmaceutical industry is now directly contributing to the mass chemical contamination of our planet .
By allowing factories to dump drugs into local waterways , by tolerating a " flush it " mentality at hospitals and pharmacies , and by drugging consumers with an endless brew of vaccines , medications and toxic substances such as chemotherapy agents , Those who take pharmaceuticals are , in fact , directly contributing to the chemical contamination of the planet .
That 's why getting off medications is not only good for your health ; it 's also good for the planet ..
Consuming pharmaceuticals is simply incompatible with sustainable life on Earth .
And the more drugs are manufactured and consumed , the worse this problem will become .
Let me put it this way :
You can save the planet , or you can save Big Pharma .
But not both .
Which would you rather have around for future generations ?
Living oceans , blue skies , clean water and healthy species ?
Or sterile oceans , dwindling aquatic life , mutant human babies and widespread cancer , infertility and shortened lifespans ?
It 's your choice : Mother Nature , or Big Pharma .
The devastating long - term effects of this chemical contamination of our world 's waterways have yet to be truly understood at all .
The chemicals being dumped into our environment by Big Pharma today may pollute our planet for hundreds of years , destroying aquatic ecosystems , killing fish populations and causing widespread physical deformities across many species .
Combine this with all the pesticide runoff already being used across the planet and it becomes quite clear that How 's that ?
Because humans do n't exist in isolation from the natural world .
When we destroy or disrupt the planet 's delicate ecosystems through chemical contamination , we unleash a backlash of effects that put the entire human race in jeopardy :
Outbreaks of infectious disease , plummeting fish stocks in ocean waters , rising risks of superbugs across the population and even long - term disruptions in the food supply due to pharmaceutical contamination of food crops and soil microorganisms .
( Irrigation water being sprayed on crops is now also contaminated with pharmaceuticals ... )
Stated bluntly , what 's happening is that -- and it 's doing it for profit .
While their factories in India are dumping millions of doses of antibiotics ( and a brew of twenty other drugs ) into the water supply each year , they 're importing those drugs into the U.S. and selling them at monopoly prices to gullible consumers , all while pretending they 're on some sort of humanitarian mission to help people .
The truth is that , and we 'll all end up paying the price for allowing these crimes to continue under our watch .
Every living thing in our world is interconnected :
You can't poison the waterways with a toxic brew of dangerous chemicals and expect to be insulated from the effects of that forever .
Sometimes I stand back in sheer astonishment at how short - sighted human civilization truly is .
Today our population demonstrates a striking lack of understanding about theon our planet combined with an outright abandonment of ethics and morals .
Companies ( and many people ) simply do whatever benefits them at the moment , regardless of the long - term consequences .
The pharmaceutical industry exemplifies this destructive philosophy best , as it actually works to trap people in a cycle of disease treatment , all while raking in obscene profits for poisoning the people and the planet .
What a shameful business model .
It 's beyond shame , really .
It 's a crime .
And it 's time we put an end to these crimes against the People and against the planet .
Once again , for their role in planning and executing these crimes against humanity and Nature .
In the U.S. , this must be pursued by the Dept. of Justice , since the FDA , EPA and FTC remain in a tight conspiracy with the drug industry and will do nothing to bring their protected corporations to justice .
You can help support the effort to bring these criminals to justice ( and end the chemical contamination of our planet by Big Pharma ) by contacting your elected representatives ( in any country ) and letting them know how outraged you are about the widespread chemical pollution caused by the pharmaceutical industry .
Save the planet .
End the era of Big Pharma .

TUESDAY NIGHT , President Obama ended his speech with a familiar refrain , asking God to bless us and bless our country .
Last month , after we had watched the Inauguration , it was one of my church - going students who asked , " Why was there so much religion ? "
Other students asked , " Why was there a Christian prayer ?
What about Jews ? "
Finally , one 11 - year - old girl , whose family is not religious , said , in response to the " God bless America " line , " I felt like somebody who 's going to be important to me left me out . "
May those who share religious belief share that gladly , in church or in private gatherings .
At public events of the government that belongs to us all , let the blessings invoked be the blessings all of us can bestow : those of our own hearts and minds , our hopes and efforts , the energies Obama has proved so talented at evoking .
Our country needs the energy and thought of all our future citizens .
I can't think of one good thing that comes from drawing a circle and leaving even one of my students outside it .

As anti-Semitism apparently rises in the wake of recent events in Gaza , it ’s time to ask whether anti-Israeli protests are merely a front for expressions of hatred of Jews ?
FRANKLY , GIVEN a choice , I prefer the skinheads and other brutes who express their anti-Semitism openly .
In such places , we know the enemy .
But please spare me the pieties and the righteous indignation of those “ good people ” protesting throughout Europe against Israel ’s defensive operation in Gaza .
True , thousands have taken up banners in support of Israel .
At the same time , however , the streets of Europe ( and even some in America ) are in an uproar .
These are the “ humanitarians ” – the good , the noble , the refined , who chant “ peace ” .
Now you ’re up and about ?
Now you speak ?
Where were you when , throughout the years , thousands of jihadist bombs fell on Israel ?
The streets of Europe were empty .
There were no pictures in the newspapers of grieving Jewish mothers and fathers .
You called it “ peace ” as long as the Arabs were doing the killing and the Jews were doing the dying .
All was well with the world .
Suddenly , as Israel answered back , you found your Cause ; and how self - righteous you are in your Cause .
Israel is a Jewish State .
Is that your problem ?
At the first hint of Jewish self - defence , how quickly you show your true colours .
You speak of disproportion .
You want proportion ?
Give Israel a population of 300 million residing in 22 countries , similar to the Arab Muslims who surround and ambush Israel – instead of 5 ½ million Jews in one single country .
There ’s plenty of “ proportion ” coming from your BBC , which delights in presenting one side of the story and picks up where Der Sturmer left off .
Now , with this type of “ news ” , we know how Europe was conditioned for a Holocaust .
Already we see Nights of Broken Glass .
Thank you , Europe , for reminding us why America was discovered just in time ( and why Israel was redeemed many generations too late ) .
You dare judge Israel ?
In your deportations , your expulsions , your forced conversions , your inquisitions , your pogroms , you have no moral authority over Israel or even within your own borders .
You gave all that up from 1492 to 1942 .
To those on the Left who sought peace , well , dear peace - lovers , peace brought this on .
As for those “ innocent civilians ” in Gaza , they were given a choice and they chose Hamas .
They chose this pestilence .
As for those “ refugee camps ” – why are they “ refugee camps ” when Israel handed over all that territory for a nation to be built in peace and security alongside Israel ?
Why are all Palestinians automatically refugees even after they ’ve been given a home ?
The only true refugees are the thousands of Israelis who were driven from Gaza and still live in trailer parks .
On this day , in response to a column I wrote about Theresienstadt , someone responded that I was incorrect ; that Theresienstadt was not a prelude to Auschwitz , but rather “ a vacation resort ” .
I wrote back wishing this person a lifetime in such vacation resorts .
I wish the same lifetime vacation resorts to all those parading throughout the streets of Europe with banners crying , “ Death to Israel ” .
God bless the IDF !
Go Israel !

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Dramatic improvements in U.S. air quality over the last two decades have added 21 weeks to the life of the average American , researchers reported on Wednesday .

Reducing fine particles given off by automobiles , diesel engines , steel mills and coal - fired power plants have added as much as 15 percent of the 2.72 years of extra longevity seen in the United States since the early 1980s , they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Changes in smoking habits are the biggest reason why Americans are living longer , said Arden Pope , an epidemiologist at Brigham Young University in Utah who led the study .
Improved socioeconomic conditions , judged partly by the proportion of high school graduates living in an area , rank next .
But cleaner air was a big factor .
“ It ’s stunning that the air pollution effect seems to be as robust as it is after controlling for these other things , ” Pope said in a telephone interview .
Using life expectancy , economic , demographic and pollution data from 51 metropolitan areas , Pope and his colleagues found when fine - particle air pollution dropped by 10 micrograms per cubic meter , life expectancy rose by 31 weeks .
Areas such a Akron , Ohio , and Philadelphia showed that kind of drop in air pollution .
The bigger the decline , the longer people began living .
In some areas where fine - particle counts dropped by 13 to 14 micrograms -- such as Buffalo , New York and Pittsburgh -- people typically started living about 43 weeks longer .
The findings show there has been a real dividend from the efforts since the 1970s to improve air quality , said Pope .
In a commentary , Daniel Krewski of the University of Ottawa said the study “ provides direct confirmation of the population health benefits of mitigating air pollution and greatly strengthens the foundation of the argument for air - quality management . ”
Based on earlier research , the World Health Organization has estimated that 1.4 percent of all deaths around the world are caused by air pollution particles .
Obama greets Jindal at the Bipartisan meeting of the National Governor 's Association in December .
It 's Jindal vs. Obama
We 've already got a national showdown of Jindal vs. Obama – and it's not even 2012 .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , widely seen as a potential 2012 GOP presidential contender , will deliver the Republican response following President Obama ’s nationally televised Address to the Nation on Feb.
24 , Republican congressional leaders announced in a joint statement today .

“ Gov. Jindal embodies what I have long said : the Republican Party must not be simply the party of ‘ opposition , ’ but the party of better solutions , ” said House Minority John Boehner .
“ His stewardship of the state of Louisiana , dedication to reforming government , and commitment to bringing forth new and innovative ideas make him a leader not just within the Republican Party , but in our nation as a whole . ”
Jindal has indicated he's not interested in running for president , but he 's certainly taking on several high - profile Washington speaking roles lately .
Jindal has also been tapped to headline the National Republican Congressional Committee ’s March Dinner – a forum that in past years was given to President Bush .
Obama 's national address is the traditional substitute of sorts for a first year president 's State of the Union Address .
Myanmar faces food shortages in many parts of the country , largely because of last year 's cyclone Nargis destroyed most of the delta 's harvest and a rat infestation wiped out most of the remaining crops .
A total of 2 million acres ( 800,000 hectares ) of rice paddy were submerged saltwater waves and 85 percent of seed stocks were destroyed .
A shortage of labor - 130,000 were left dead after Nargis - higher fertilizer prices and lower rice prices have dissuaded delta farmers from planting , causing about 185,000 tons of emergency food aid needed this year .

There is a general alert going out for an upcoming wave of hunger due to a drought in the Horn of Africa :
In Uganda 's Karamoja region 970,000 people are heading towards starvation .
The Government declared the whole region as an emergency area and said " food must [ quickly ] be distributed to this area to avert this problem . "
Drought conditions will cause conditions unlikely to improve before October when the next harvest is due .

The same regional drought also hit Kenya hard .
In the South - eastern regions , the third consecutive bad crop will force 3.2 million people to resort to food aid .

Since August last year , WFP , the UN 's main food assistance agency , has lost 4 staff in Somalia due to security incidents .
Last week they said if the situation does not improve , they will be forced to cut their food aid , which will affect 2.5 million people .
( Full )
In Zimbabwe , the hunger figures are even worse .
The prolonged political turmoil has turned Africa 's former breadbasket into one of the continent 's poorest countries .
Currently 4.5 million Zimbabweans are fully dependent on food aid , a figure expected to raise to 6 million in the next month .
Due to lack of donor funding , WFP has been forced to cut core monthly maize rations from 10kg - already 2 kg below the recommended ration - to 5 kg a month for adults .
That is just about 600 calories a day .

So , how does one survive total economic collapse ?
There are a variety of survival skills , concerning both finances and day - to - day living , that you can adopt to help you and your family survive total economic collapse , if such a situation befalls you .
It 's All About C Now ( from Dan M )
Last year , I saw that a certain founded - and - headquartered - in - the - Netherlands electronics company was hiring web developers in my town , so sent in my résumé .
Like most résumés , mine contained the standard skills & buzzword section :
Languages and technical writing : PHP , MySQL , AJAX , JavaScript , PRADO Framework , MSSQL Server , C# , . Net Framework , Perl , C/C++ , Visual Basic , ASP , HTML , DHTML , XML , SOAP , CSS , Java , UML
I was pretty excited to get an interview .
Well , that is until the interviewer took one look at my resume and said " Why is C so far down on your list ? "
" Well , " I tried to carefully explain , " I 'm not as skilled in C as I am in the other languages on the list .
That , and I really prefer web development . "
" Hmph , " she scoffed , " take my advice ; you should really get with the program and learn C ! "
I laughed nervously .
" Get with the program , huh ? " I said , hoping it was a joke .
" Yeah , you 're way behind here , none of this stuff matters , " she said excitedly , " it 's all about C now ! "
Figuring that the interviewer was getting her acronyms mixed up , I responded " Err , wait , do you meant C - sharp ?
Because I 've worked quote a bit with the .
NET Frame — "
" Uhh , " she cut me off , " no , I mean C . "
There was an awkward moment of silence .
" I 'm sorry , " I said sheepishly , " there must have been some mix up .
I was under the impression this was a web development position .
I assume you 're looking for an embedded systems developer for , like , TVs and other electronics ? "
She blankly stared back .
" This is for the web developer position , " she angrily responded , " we do everything through C modules on our website ! "
The interview ended shortly after that , with us both realizing it wouldnt be a good fit .
The CIA Interview ( from David )
Back in 1998 , while I was finishing up my undergrad in computer science , my school held a pretty large career fair with all sorts of different companies .
The idea was , you could drop off your résumé , meet the HR reps , and get a feel for what work would be like .
One booth that looked particular interesting was the CIA's .
The had lots of openings for cool positions ( intelligence stuff ) and support positions ( application development ) .
After speaking with one of their interviewers for a bit , I decided to give them my résumé .
" Hmmm , " he said after taking one glance , " I 'm not going to lie to you David , but you likely wo n't be considered for any jobs . "
I was pretty surprised to hear that , as I would be graduating with honors from a top computer science school and already had a wealth of work experience from internships .
While I probably would n't have been cool enough to be an agent , I figured I 'd at least be eligible for a support position .
I asked what it was they were looking for in a candidate .
" Let me show you something , " the interviewer said , pulling out another résumé from his folder , " we get a ton of these here , and if you do n't truly stand out from the rest , you wo n't make it . "
I briefly pursued the résumé and noticed a 3.1 GPA , a single internship , a flagship skill of Microsoft Word , and not a single extra-curricular activity .
It was , however , very nicely formatted with diagonal lines and triangles in the background .
I asked the interviewer why this was a better candidate .
" Just look at it , " she responded , " it 's everything , all around .
For example , you used dots for your bullet points and he has these nice arrows . "
I never ended up getting a call about a position at the CIA .
We Don't Need People Like You ( also from Dan M )
Many years back , when I was fresh out of school , I decided to apply for a job at the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office .
The USPTO had started to grant patents on computer programs and , as such , was looking for Computer Science Patent Examiners .
After filling out the requisite stack of application paperwork , I was granted an interview .
When I arrived for the interview , there was a small waiting room for candidates for the position .
Half an hour later , my name was called and I entered the interviewer 's office .
I sat there in silence for roughly 8 seconds until he turned the résumé around and pointed to the second line , " what is this ? " he demanded , jabbing roughly at the education section .
" Uhh , " I paused , wondering if I had misspelled my degree .
" Umm .... Bachelor of Computer Science ... Carnegie Mellon ... School of Computer Sci — "
" That 's what I thought " he said scornfully .
I blankly started .
After a few moments I responded , " I 'm sorry ? "
" Do you have any idea what we do here , Dan ? "
" Yes , I do " , I stuttered , " you examine patent applications on a variety of systems and ... whatnot .
Right ? "
" Exactly !
We do n't need people like you here , " he said , tossing my résumé back at me .
" We only accept Math and Engineering majors here ! "
Obviously , my career aspirations at the USPTO died shortly after that .
Though , after the experience , I tend not to be as surprised as others when we hear the latest story about somebody being granted a patent for " inventing " the scrollbar or something .
Have your own Tale From an Interview ?
Then go ahead and send it on in .
Isaac Mao , 36 , of Shanghai , credited as China 's first blogger , began using the term Great Firewall in 2005 to describe the frustrating structure of internet blocks and filters imposed by a government determined to move its censor - ship system into the digital age , and keep the world out .
He was a pioneer in using proxy server technology to access overseas websites .
But while Western attention focuses on how much international content China still blocks , Mr Mao is excited by what has recently happened .
His verdict : blogging has given Chinese people nerve .
" Two years ago nobody would have believed this was true , " Mr Mao says .
But " as more and more social problems have emerged in China , people have had the chance to connect and share things that could not be seen before .
Once there are enough bloggers nothing can be hidden . "
The number of bloggers in China doubled to 107 million in the six months to last June , according to the China Internet Network Information Centre .
Total users rose 56 per cent from the previous year , to 253 million , giving China the largest online population in the world .
Mr Mao says he can see a tipping point coming .
He believes that as a result of blogging , young Chinese brainwashed by their education system are now trying to think for themselves , work together and find smarter solutions .
" The reason many people still do n't care about political change is that they do n't trust each other .
It 's the legacy of the Cul - tural Revolution .
So they do n't talk to their neighbours about community issues , they do n't talk about urban issues . "
But people are now trusting and sharing online , not always in public , but through social networking , which he says is difficult for the authorities to track .
" The tipping point is everyone being able to talk about sensitive things , and wanting to talk about it , and nobody being punished . "
While bloggers continue to be blocked and jailed , Mr Mao says this is failing to deter them .
The sheer number of Chinese now blogging about minor matters , " puts the burden on the Government to try to check and monitor so much content .
They can't tell what is sensitive " .
He thinks freedom of expression is as much about simple daily stories as it is about topics such as Tibet .
He talks about democracy but does not see himself as a troublemaker .
" I support a lot of civic rights lawyers and activists technically and help them build websites and blogs …
It 's really important to help community development rather than directly confront or just criticise the government . "
The recent fourth annual Chinese Bloggers Conference in Guangzhou canvassed citizen journalism 's impact on topics ranging from the Tibetan riots to the melamine food safety scandal .
An editor at one of the new , independent magazines trying to push journalistic boundaries said that if privately owned media were the foot soldiers in the march towards free speech , bloggers were guerillas - and the Chinese Government did not know how to fight a guerilla war .
The guerilla comparison can sometimes be literal .
Mr Mao says a group of bloggers sympathetic to Zeng Jinyan , wife of the jailed AIDS activist Hu Jia , and his baby daughter , under house arrest in Beijing , recently " hacked the system " of their captors .
They used Google Earth to map the layout of her apartment complex , tracked the position and timing of police movements , and identified their cars .
One jumped the wall of the complex , hid in the garden and caught Zeng 's attention with an infra-red beam from a digital camera .
Under the guise of collecting milk powder for the baby , Hu Jia 's mother slipped past the heavies at the front door to collect a parcel containing a mobile phone and other techno - goodies that have allowed her to " twitter " , or micro - blog via phone .
Mr Mao says the authorities are yet to grapple with " twitter " .

Chinese military chief vows nuclear , conventional build - up
BEIJING , Feb 2 ( AFP ) Feb 02 , 2009
China will accelerate the build - up of its nuclear and conventional arsenal to form a credible deterrent , the general in charge of the country 's strategic missile force said .
" We will accelerate the building of our nuclear and conventional combat strength , " said Jing Zhiyuan , the commander of the Second Artillery Corp , in an article he co-wrote for the authoritative journal Qiushi published on Sunday .
" We will strengthen the build - up of combat systems and improve the training of high - quality personnel , " said the article .
China will also develop " a nuclear and conventional missile force corresponding to the needs of winning a war " in conditions changed by modern information technology , it said .
The Second Artillery Corps is an independent branch of the armed forces directly under the control of the powerful Central Military Commission .
It is armed with hundreds of strategic and tactical missiles .
" The Second Artillery is the core of our nation 's strategic deterrence .
It is the main support pillar and backup force of our national security and development , " the article said .
The corps ' jobs include " deterring other countries from using nuclear weapons against China , and for conducting nuclear counter - attacks and precision strikes with conventional missiles , " China said in a recent policy paper .
Quishi is a journal for the ruling Communist Party to publish policies and theories .
The United States has long expressed concern over China 's military build - up , and accused the Chinese government of not being transparent about its defence spending .
China has said its military budget for 2008 was 417.8 billion yuan ( 61 billion dollars ) , a rise of 17.6 percent from the previous year .
The Norway division of iTunes made a huge blunder yesterday when it accidentally made copies of Kelly Clarkson ’s upcoming album , All I Ever Wanted , available for download via iTunes .
Norwegian iTunes users noticed yesterday that 30 second previews of Clarkson ’s new CD had become available , only to soon find out that full track downloads were possible as well .
The leak , attributed to an iTunes error , has already caused Clarkson ’s record label to panic as copies of the soon to be released album have already been unleashed on P2P networks .
I would n’t be too worried , though .
After all , I doubt that Clarkson ’s demographic of listeners are the type of people who even know what P2P is .
It ’s a tad amusing though , if not downright ironic , that this debacle occurred in Norway .
If you recall , Apple had previously run into legal trouble in Norway over its failure to offer DRM - free songs on iTunes , and a consumer advocacy group subsequently initiated legal proceedings against Apple over its failure to open up iTunes to other music players .
Of course , these legal proceedings were dropped when Apple announced that iTunes would soon be going DRM - free .
But what are the odds that Norway would be at the center of a big music leak involving DRM - free songs after it had spent so much energy crusading against DRM in the preceding months .
Lastly , an album leak is probably the last thing the former American Idol winner needs .
Clarkson ’s last CD was a bust , and the success of her upcoming album may well determine where her career goes from here .
Not that I ’m a fan or anything ..
All I Ever Wanted is officially scheduled to be released on March 10 .

Newsweek magazine , which has given us many of the most damaging deceptions about America in recent years ( remember the “ Koran - Down - the - Toilet ” hoax ? ) , now weighs in with a pretentious and embarrassingly ignorant cover story , “ We Are All Socialists Now . ”
To be sure , the basic theme –that the huge “ stimulus ” and the big big big TARP is leading once - capitalist America down the dangerous road to socialism–is not limited to the skinny weekly .
You hear it all over the place , from Right to Left , from talk radio to the evening news ( or so I am told ; personally , I have n’t watched an evening news broadcast since 1987 ) .
There ’s a element of truth to the basic theme ( although not to the headline ) : the state is getting more and more deeply involved in business , even taking controlling interests in some private companies .
And the state is even trying to “ make policy ” for private companies they do not control , but merely “ help ” with “ infusions of capital , ” as in the recent call for salary caps for certain CEOs .
So state power is growing at the expense of corporations .
But that ’s not socialism .
Socialism rests on a firm theoretical bedrock : the abolition of private property .
I have n’t heard anyone this side of Barney Frank calling for any such thing .
What is happening now–and Newsweek is honest enough to say so down in the body of the article–is an expansion of the state ’s role , an increase in public / private joint ventures and partnerships , and much more state regulation of business .
Yes , it ’s very “ European , ” and some of the Europeans even call it “ social democracy , ” but it is n’t .
It ’s fascism .
Nobody calls it by its proper name , for two basic reasons : first , because “ fascism ” has long since lost its actual , historical , content ; it ’s been a pure epithet for many decades .
Lots of the people writing about current events like what Obama et. al. are doing , and would n’t want to stigmatize it with that “ f ” epithet .
Second , not one person in a thousand knows what fascist political economy was .
Yet during the great economic crisis of the 1930s , fascism was widely regarded as a possible solution , indeed as the only acceptable solution to a spasm that had shaken the entire First World , and beyond .
It was hailed as a “ third way ” between two failed systems ( communism and capitalism ) , retaining the best of each .
Private property was preserved , as the role of the state was expanded .
This was necessary because the Great Depression was defined as a crisis “ of the system , ” not just a glitch “ in the system . ”
And so Mussolini created the “ Corporate State , ” in which , in theory at least , the big national enterprises were entrusted to state ownership ( or substantial state ownership ) and of course state management .
Some of the big “ Corporations ” lasted a very long time ; indeed some have only very recently been privatized , and the state still holds important chunks –so - called “ golden shares ” –in some of them .
Back in the early thirties , before “ fascism ” became a pure epithet , leading politicians and economists recognized that it might work , and many believed it was urgently required .
When Roosevelt was elected in 1932 , in fact , Mussolini personally reviewed his book , Looking Forward , and the Duce ‘s bottom line was , “ this guy is one of us . ”
As an economic fix , the Corporate State was not a great success , either in America or in Italy .
Roosevelt ’s New Deal did n’t cure America ’s economic ills any more than Mussolini ’s Third Way did .
In both countries , however , its most durable consequence was the expansion of the ability of the state to give orders to more and more citizens , in more and more corners of their lives .
In the first half of the twentieth century , that was hardly unique to the “ fascist ” states ; tyranny was the order of the day in the “ socialist ” or “ communist ” countries as well ( not for nothing were so many learned books written about “ totalitarianism , ” which embraced both “ systems ” ) .
Paul Johnson writes of a “ new species ” of “ despotic utopias , ” and Richard Pipes went so far as to call both Soviet Bolshevism and Italian fascism “ heresies of socialism . ”
So I suppose to that extent , Newsweek has a certain point , although probably not what the authors of the cover story had in mind .
For those of us more concerned with the future of freedom than with the pedantic subtleties , the key point is the political one : the great “ rescue ” to which our governors are subjecting us will challenge our commitment to freedom in many dramatic ways .
It ’s going to be a hell of a fight .
I hope .
Christina Romer , whom Mr. Obama has designated to be his chief economist , concluded in research she helped write in 1994 that interest - rate policy is the most powerful force in economic recoveries and that fiscal stimulus generally acts too slowly to be of much help in pulling the economy out of recessions , though associates said she now supports a big stimulus package if policy makers roll it out early enough in the recession .
The goal behind all those ideas is to jump - start economic activity by getting as much money as possible as quickly as possible into the hands of consumers and businesses , trying to make up for the falling demand in the private sector that is leading to higher unemployment .
And although the package includes a big dose of tax cuts , it represents a big departure from President Bush ’s playbook by relying heavily on direct government spending .
“ This is not an intellectual exercise , and there ’s no pride of authorship , ” Mr. Obama told a news conference in Washington on Friday .
“ If members of Congress have good ideas , if they can identify a project for me that will create jobs in an efficient way  that does not hamper our ability to , over the long term , get control of our deficit ; that is good for the economy  then I ’m going to accept it . ”
Mr. Obama ’s aides said he did not intend to unveil a detailed formal proposal but rather to allow Congress to fill in the outline that he has proposed .
Given the recent scale of the downturn  the nation lost 1.5 million jobs in the last three months of 2008 , and economic output during those months shrank by 6 percent compared with same period in 2007  economists were highly uncertain about whether the economic plan would provide enough firepower .
Adam Posen , the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , said Mr. Obama ’s plan could provide just the right boost  if it was carried out properly .
But as the Federal Reserve has been learning for months now , the biggest obstacle to economic activity right now is not a shortage of money .
The real obstacle is pervasive fear , which has made banks reluctant to lend and companies reluctant to invest in expansion .
10 Odd Computer Input Options
Is n’t it great how you ’ve got the entire world at your fingertips thanks to the internet ?
And is n’t it even better that those fingertips are using a system built in 1874 for typewriters when “ wireless communication ” meant shouting across the office ?
Some people are so unimpressed with this clunky QWERTY style they ’ve found ways to make it more exciting – or replace it entirely .
1. Optimus Maximus
You ca n’t talk about cool keyboards without mentioning the Optimus Maximus .
Seriously , it ’s not allowed – try it and Swiss hackers will trace your IP and beat you up .
First rumored in July 2005 , this geek wet dream has finally arrived after three years and people are queuing up for the chance to blow two thousand dollars on a keyboard .
The gimmick is that every key is an OLED display which changes to show that function that key has .
But is n’t the sort of person who ’ll spend four figures on a keyboard almost guaranteed to be a touch typist ?
Is n’t that like a blind man buying an original Picasso ?
Is this the first piece of hardware ever to make the PS3 look sensibly priced ?
2. Cyber Scrabble
The DX1 is the Megatron to the above Optimus Maximus .
The opposite ( though hopefully not so evil ) .
While the Maximus features fixed keys with striking labels , the DX1 has movable keys with no labels at all .
25 movable buttons can be clumped in any arrangement you like , with every button capable of single function or macros .
A dream come true for the PC Gamer , you can set your FPS commands or your RTS build order to utterly customized input clusters and feel like a total cyber - badass as you do it .
No word on whether inputs count extra if you put one of the button tiles on a “ triple word score . ”
3. Datahand II
Just like those Datapalms from “ Hackers ” , only not stupid or in a totally failed movie .
The DataHand Professional II looks the Nintendo PowerGlove grew up and had to get a job .
Despite the appearance of something that would suck your fleshy fingers in and mince them , the DataHand is actually an extremely compressed QWERTY keyboard .
Every key only a tenth of an inch from your fingertips .
So yes , pretty much all technology but the Wii is a conspiracy to remove even the idea of movement from your life .
4. Wearable wireless keyboard
Of course , even having a physical keyboard is so last century you might as well be bashing rocks together and hoping ASCII - coded sparks fly out .
The “ Body Coupled FingeRing ” hopes to be the next generation of input technology .
Just make sure you capitalise that R in FingeRing or it sounds positively filthy , as well as something that would electrocute you if you tried it while wearing the equipment .
The idea is that if you ’re going to be moving your fingers a certain amount anyway , actually having a big board for them to bash against is n’t necessary .
The fingeRings track your fingers and work out what keys you were going for , hopefully without cutting off too much of the blood supply .
It ’s not clear what happens if you try to grab a donut or wave to someone while typing , but we calculate a 50 % chance that your computer will explode .
5. Bluetooth laser keyboard
If you like the idea of no physical keyboard , but prefer a product that is actually available and does n’t make you look quite so much like a runaway Borg ) , look no further than the I - Tech Virtual Laser Keyboard .
Yes .
Laser Keyboard .
A projected display , utterly wireless , and with an “ I ” in the title – if this thing got any more futuristic you ’d need dilithium crystals to run it .
While it scores a perfect 100 % on the “ Black box with ominous red light ” , and is therefore guaranteed to turn evil , there is n’t very much it can actually do to you .
There ’s only so much damage a typo can do and we figure the average bloodthirsty machine intelligence will get bored with that pretty quickly – just do n’t use one if you work in a build with the word “ nuclear ” in the title .
6. Draw a DJ Deck
Once you ’re freed from “ having a physical object to touch ” , lugging around a design intended to prevent underpaid women from jamming brass armatures goes past ironic and into crippling .
Step forward the awesome drawable DJ deck – literally draw a deck on any surface and the camera ( with associated software ) converts it into usable input .
This is exactly the kind of tech one - man crews can put together , a perfect balancing point between “ too many possibilities to count ” and “ but do we actually need it at all ? ”
If your answer to the second question is no then congratulations , you ’re not a nerd , and thanks for making it this far into the article despite that !
7. Orbitouch
Now we ’re well past keyboards and into the future – the Orbitouch sounds like the sort of MacGuffin that needs to be saved from Ming the Merciless ’s Death - O - Cannon , and would certainly fit into any starship bridge from the seventies .
Big , chunky and brightly colored it looks more like a preschool toy than office equipment .
You input different characters by pressing the two domes into one of eight positions – that may be massively slower than your regular typing speed , but for some people your crumb - laden keyboard gives a rate of zero words per hour .
Intended for disabled users , the large and easily manipulated control surfaces means that “ fingers ” are no longer a necessity to get typing .
8. WiiPC
You knew it had to happen – homebrewers have worked out how to pair your Wiimote with your PC , giving you the funnest and flailingest mouse possible , and because open source is kind of their thing they ’ve posted a helpful guide on how to do it yourself .
Chances are that the Wiimotes relative lack of sensitivity will stop this being more than a novelty – the average application button is n’t designed with tennis simulation in mind – but as soon as someone works out how to connect the Balance Board to AudioSurf there ’s a chance you wo n’t see us again for a month .
9. Backball Mouse
Sitting at the computer all day can leave people with fat asses .
Now , in the cyberest example of recursion we ’ve ever seen , Interaction Architecture will let people use that generously cushioned derriere to control the computer again with the “ BackBall ” – basically the biggest trackball you ’ve ever seen .
The odds of getting good enough at that for online deathmatches are slim in the extreme , but just imagine the possible burns .
“ I just headshotted you – WITH MY ASS ! ”
10 . Gaming Bra and Boxer
Never have “ well - meaning ” and “ tragically doomed ” ever collided so intimately or hilariously .
JennyLC’s “ Intimate Controllers ” are intended to combine fun and frolics , arming a bra and boxer shorts with joypad controls for couply control .
But we know just how intense things can get in the heat of battle , and we hardly think mashing breasts like an emergency stop button will lead to the right mood , never mind the fact that JennyLC seems to think “ halfway down the outside of the thigh ” is a male erogenous zone .
And remember : playing videogames can develop real instinctual reactions , and we do n’t think developing the crisis response of “ Hit your partner in the crotch ” is a good idea .

What 's OpenDNS ?
A San Francisco - based startup offering free DNS -- domain name system -- tools for homes , schools , and small businesses .
We 've been using them for years at home just because they speed up our Internet .
But they 're increasingly catching on for their anti-phishing and parental filtering tools .
The company has 10 million users , 20 employees , and is profitable -- making money from Yahoo search ads that show up when people mistype domain names .
At CES , OpenDNS announced that Netgear will be bundling their filtering and anti-phishing software with its routers .
The company recently appointed former VMware exec Nand Mulchandani as chief executive .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Pledging to take " the air out of golden parachutes , " President Obama announced Wednesday that executives of companies receiving federal bailout money will have their pay capped at $ 500,000 under a revised financial compensation plan .
$ 500,000 will be the limit on executive salaries at companies receiving tax dollars , President Obama says .
Last year 's " shameful " handout of $ 18 billion in Wall Street bonuses " is exactly the kind of disregard for the costs and consequences of their actions that brought about this crisis : a culture of narrow self - interest and short - term gain at the expense of everything else , " Obama said to reporters at the White House .
" For top executives to award themselves these kinds of compensation packages in the midst of this economic crisis is n't just bad taste -- it 's a bad strategy -- and I will not tolerate it .
We 're going to be demanding some restraint in exchange for federal aid -- so that when firms seek new federal dollars , we wo n't find them up to the same old tricks , " the president added .
Under Obama 's plan , companies that want to pay their executives more than $ 500,000 will have to do so through stocks that cannot be sold until the companies pay back the money they borrow from the government .
The rules will be implemented by the Treasury Department and do not need to be approved by Congress .
The restrictions will most affect large companies that receive " exceptional assistance , " such as Citigroup .
The struggling banking giant has taken about $ 45 billion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The new rules also will mandate that shareholders of banks have a greater say about the salaries paid to company heads .
The measures will put in place greater transparency for costs such as holiday parties and office renovations .
Obama also pledged further reforms in the future , promising that the administration will " examine the ways in which the means and manner of executive compensation have contributed to a reckless culture and quarter - by - quarter mentality that in turn have wrought havoc in our financial system . "
Watch Obama talk about limiting executive salaries »
" We 're going to be taking a look at broader reforms so that executives are compensated for sound risk management and rewarded for growth measured over years , not just days or weeks , " Obama said .

Lower high school graduation rates and higher rates of obesity are two of the reasons that many Hispanics are denied entry into the U.S. military , according to a RAND Corporation study released today .
Although Hispanics do well once in the military , they are underrepresented in all branches of the nation 's armed forces , primarily because they often fail to meet eligibility requirements , according to the study .
The U.S. Congress has said that the U.S. military should closely mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the nation , creating the need to enlist more Hispanics .
The RAND study examines why Hispanics are underrepresented in the military and discusses possible solutions .
" Hispanics who do join the military tend to serve longer and be promoted faster than their white counterparts , " said Beth Asch , the study 's lead author and a senior economist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" What is needed are strategies to help more Hispanics meet recruitment standards or recruit more intensively among those who already meet the standards . "
The U.S. Air Force , Army , Navy and Marines all prefer to recruit youths who have earned a high school diploma .
Hispanics , as a group , have a below - average rate of high school graduation .
Other factors that often disqualify Hispanics are lower scores on the Armed Forces Qualification Test -- possibly due to language difficulties -- and being overweight .
The armed forces could recruit highly qualified Hispanics more intensively , but there already is much competition for these candidates from civilian employers and colleges , Asch said .
Military recruitment efforts should promote the availability of higher education benefits , leadership opportunities and the chance to serve one 's country .
Hispanic youth with more education , especially those with some college , and non-citizens are more likely to pass weight standards , but enlistment programs that fast - track the citizenship of immigrants serving in the military may be politically controversial .
Researchers suggest the military might be able to recruit more overweight candidates by enrolling them in weight reduction programs while they are in the Delayed Entry Program .
Another option would be to relax the weight standards at entry or stratify the weight requirements by job description .
One more alternative would be to ease the weight standard while maintaining the strength standards , an option already adopted by the Marine Corps and being tested by the Army .
Some efforts at taking another look at recruiting standards are underway .
As part of its Tier Two Attrition Screen , the Army has recruited more lower - quality but highly motivated enlistees -- specifically non-high school graduates -- and begun several experimental programs to allow applicants who are overweight to qualify for enlistment .
Disqualifying factors such as high school graduation rates and low test scores may be difficult for the military to directly influence , because they are shaped by numerous outside influences , from the recruits ' parental education levels to family income .
However , the military may be able to inspire some potential recruits to complete their education through outreach efforts that emphasize the benefits of being eligible for military service , according to researchers .
The study , " Military Enlistment of Hispanic Youth : Obstacles and Opportunities , " can be found at www.rand.org.
Other authors of the study are Christopher Buck , Meridith Kleykamp and David Loughran , all of RAND , and Jacob Klerman , formerly of RAND .
The study was conducted for the Office of Accession Policy , Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness .
It was produced in the Forces and Policy Resources Center of the RAND National Defense Research Institute , a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Staff , the Unified Combatant Commands , the Department of the Navy , the Marine Corps , the defense agencies and the defense Intelligence community .

In a dramatic plea made during a live broadcast of regional affairs debate program " Middle East Today " on international broadcaster PressTV , an American lawyer called on Tehran to support his bid to sue Israel for genocide against the Palestinians .
" I would like to propose here today on this program that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei give me the authority to sue Israel at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for inflicting genocide against the Palestinian people , " said panelist Francis A. Boyle , professor of International Law .
Speaking Thursday evening on the phone from Champaign , Illinois , Boyle said , " I think that would be one way that the deadlock at the United Nations Security Council could be very easily broken and could shake up the American people and the European Union to the developing genocide being inflicted on the Palestinians in Gaza today . "
Boyle was referring to the repeated use of the United States ' veto at the Security Council to block any resolutions critical of its key ally in the Middle East .
The International Court of Justice was established in 1922 to provide a venue for one state to sue another , and Boyle is no stranger to The Hague .
" I was the person who filed the first lawsuit ever on genocide with the World Court on behalf of Bosnia against the rump Yugoslavia back in 1993 .
I won two court orders for Yugoslavia to cease and desist from committing genocide against the Bosnians , " Boyle told " Middle East Today . "
He said based on his knowledge , judgment , and experience he could do the same for Iran against Israel .
Boyle had previously petitioned Palestinian Authority President Yasir Arafat .
" Despite my best efforts he did not give me the authority to file the lawsuit .
I doubt very seriously that President [ Mahmoud ] Abbas will either .
Therefore , I am turning to the Islamic Republic of Iran in my quest to save the Palestinians from extermination by Israel . "
Boyle declined to comment on why Arafat did n't authorize the lawsuit , but informed sources suggested he may have been concerned over the tenuous legality of his young state , and that a lawsuit accusing Israel of genocide might have had negative implications for the peace process by alienating the United States .
Boyle responded by saying that for obvious reasons neither of these issues should be of any particular concern to Tehran .
Article II of the 1948 Genocide Convention , of which Iran is a signatory , defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .
Clauses include : ( A ) Killing members of the group ; ( B ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; and ( C ) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction .
In his original petition to Arafat , Boyle wrote :
I am sure we can agree that Israel has indeed perpetrated the international crime of genocide against the Palestinian people .
The purpose of this lawsuit would be to demonstrate that undeniable fact to the entire World .
These World Court legal proceedings will prove to the entire World and to all of history that what the Nazis did to the Jews a generation ago is legally similar to what the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinian people today : genocide .
The Israeli government has ruthlessly implemented a systematic and comprehensive military , political and economic campaign with the intent to destroy in substantial part the national , ethnic and racial group known as the Palestinian People .
In the event Boyle receives an appointment from Tehran and repeats his Bosnia success at the World Court , then the issue will be referred to the Security Council for endorsement .
However , with the United States ' record of vetoing any resolutions critical of Israel , Boyle expects no different reaction this time .
He told " Middle East Today " that it would be a mistake to underestimate the influence of the Jewish and Zionist lobby in the United States , but said they are not invincible .
" We did get President [ Ronald ] Reagan to open a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization back in 1988 that still continues as of today , despite the massive opposition of the Zionist lobby here in the United States , " he said .
" If the U.S. uses its power of veto then under the 1950 Uniting for Peace Resolution the case will go to the [ United Nations ] General Assembly .
And Israel will then be legally forced to cease and desist its destructive actions against the Palestinian people . "
Boyle told " Middle East Today " that the real purpose of his appearance on the program was to extend a respectful request to President Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Khamenei to issue him the authority to sue Israel at the World Court to stop genocide in Gaza where the United Nations said on Thursday it was terminating all humanitarian services to the people of Gaza .
" The Israelis know what they are doing , and they know it 's illegal , " Boyle said , " And that is really what we have to focus on . "
In case you needed further proof of China 's breakneck pace of growth , VeriSign is reporting that the .cn Top Level Domain ( TLD ) has now become the second biggest TLD , surpassing Germany 's .de .
The stats are part of VeriSign 's ongoing look at how some TLD registrations are performing .
For the third quarter of this year , growth rates were 76 percent for China 's country code .cn compared to the same time last year .
Although 76 percent growth is impressive , the stats suggest that growth has slowed a bit in this realm for China .
Last year , for example , VeriSign reported that registrations for the .cn TLD were up by 467 percent over the same time in 2006 .
It was enough to put China in second place by surpassing .uk , which had held the number two position after .com for several years .
VeriSign also tallied 8 percent growth for .de year - over - year and 14 percent for .uk .
over the same , year - ago quarter .
Overall , the registrar counted 174 million domain name registrations across all TLD's , which is an increase of 19 percent over the third quarter of 2007 .
County Code Top Level Domain Names ( ccTLDs ) were on a tear in the third quarter , up by 26 percent on a year - over - year basis to hit 68.9 million registered domain names .
By contrast , .com and .net domain name registrations totaled 89.4 million , up by 16 percent on a year - over - year basis .
VeriSign reports .com and .net together , so a breakout of the two domains is not something that VeriSign could provide .
However , the top ten domain TLD's for the quarter were : .com , .cn , .de , .net , .org , .uk , .info , .nl ( The Netherlands ) , .eu ( European Union ) , and .biz .
" I can't say there were any huge surprises as we carefully and continuously monitor several data sources that pertain to the Naming business , so that we understand new trends as they unfold , " said VeriSign spokesperson Allison Fritz in an e-mailed comment .
The .org registry is one of the original three gTLDs ( generic top level domains ) along with .com and .net and it also saw growth in 2008 .
Fritz noted that .org experienced growth quarter over quarter that is in line with the growth of other TLD's .
VeriSign declined to comment further on .org as it is not a TLD with which it has any oversight .
Since 2003 , the .org domain has been operated by PIR ( the Public Interest Registry ) .
Alexa Raad , CEO of PIR , told InternetNews.com that the .org TLD passed the 7 million mark for domain registrations in August of this year , while noting that .org experienced 14 to 15 percent annual growth for 2008 .
( Full stats on the year are expected in January of 2009 . )
While .org is growing at a respectable rate , Raad pointed out that there is an important difference in how .org deals with short term registrations , a practice commonly referred to as " domain tasting . "
The domain tasting practice occurs when a domain speculator buys a domain name and tries to make money from it during a five day grace period .
" We were the first registry to introduce a fee for domain tasting , " Raad stated .
" So we drove a lot of that out .
So .org did n't have the same speculation as others and we have a rather solid base of registrations . "
The implication is that the practice of domain tasting can inflate domain registration numbers beyond those that are legitimately used .
Though 2008 was officially a year in which the US was in a recession , Raad has a degree of measured confidence in the continued growth of the .org domain .
" We all live in the same world however we 've done a lot of work to stabilize our part of the business , " Raad commented .
" We 're not prone to the speculators and our brand is known for trusted well intended content and we also have high renewal numbers .
From that perspective we 've actually been able to achieve stability . "

Good morning .
If you 're coming to The Oval for the first time , welcome .
There 's a post here that explains this blog 's mission .
Now , let 's get right to it .
President - elect Barack Obama this morning will warn that unless " dramatic action " is taken quickly , it may be too late to pull the economy out of a recession that could last for years .
His staff just released excerpts from a speech the president - elect is due to give at 11 a.m. ET .
Among those excerpts :
• " I do n't believe it 's too late to change course , but it will be if we do n't take dramatic action as soon as possible .
If nothing is done , this recession could linger for years .
The unemployment rate could reach double digits .
Our economy could fall $ 1 trillion short of its full capacity , which translates into more than $ 12,000 in lost income for a family of four .
We could lose a generation of potential and promise , as more young Americans are forced to forgo dreams of college or the chance to train for the jobs of the future .
And our nation could lose the competitive edge that has served as a foundation for our strength and standing in the world .
" In short , a bad situation could become dramatically worse . "
• " There is no doubt that the cost of this plan will be considerable .
It will certainly add to the budget deficit in the short - term .
But equally certain are the consequences of doing too little or nothing at all , for that will lead to an even greater deficit of jobs , incomes , and confidence in our economy .
It is true that we cannot depend on government alone to create jobs or long - term growth , but at this particular moment , only government can provide the short - term boost necessary to lift us from a recession this deep and severe .
Only government can break the vicious cycles that are crippling our economy –- where a lack of spending leads to lost jobs which leads to even less spending ; where an inability to lend and borrow stops growth and leads to even less credit . "
• " It is time to set a new course for this economy , and that change must begin now .
We should have an open and honest discussion about this recovery plan in the days ahead , but I urge Congress to move as quickly as possible on behalf of the American people .
For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet , more Americans will lose their jobs .
More families will lose their savings .
More dreams will be deferred and denied .
And our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that , at some point , we may not be able to reverse . "
We 're planning to live - blog the president - elect 's speech , which he 'll give at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va . Check back here at The Oval as 11 a.m. ET approaches .
Speaking of the economy and unemployment in particular , USA TODAY 's Barbara Hagenbaugh and Sue Kirchhoff write this morning that some experts believe that employment news could get " truly gruesome " in coming months .

The power nap for many people is a pleasure and also a need .
But often there is no time for such a luxury .
Many people feel bad and stressed when they take a power nap in the afternoon while others work .
It has spread the impression that a power nap is a sign of laziness and also that it prevents good sleep and creates insomnia during the night .
A series of data obtained in recent years show that people have a biological need to power nap in the middle of the day .
As the human body needs sleep at night it also needs sleep during the day .
A power nap has no adverse effects on the duration and quality of sleep .
In short the human brain , is somehow biologically programmed for both sleep periods without any negative interaction .
The biological need for a power nap , when met , has beneficial effects among both the young and elderly .
Chronic sleep loss leads to attention problems , concentration problems , data processing speed problems , short - term memory and decision - making problems .
Indeed , the chronic sleep deprivation is a risk factor for developing obesity and diabetes .
The people that are feeling sleepy continuously with difficulty restraining their eyes open must … « Wake up » to realize that they are not sleeping enough , thereby damaging their health .
In such cases a quick power nap during the day can prove very beneficial .
In young adults , a power nap increases and improves mental alertness and preparedness .
A power nap can improve your mental skills
Researchers looked at 32 people aged from 55 to 85 years and studied the effects of a power nap in their mental abilities .
Participants in the survey were presented with a series of tests of mental control skills when they could not sleep in the afternoon and when they had the opportunity to take a power nap .
The findings of the researchers offer valuable information :
The people who took part in this research , when given the opportunity to take a power nap they did .
After a power nap , their performance on mental skills tests , was significantly better than when they could not sleep in the afternoon
Also , something very interesting , even the next day their performance in the tests and their intellectual skills were better if they had a power nap the previous afternoon .
A power nap can affect the night sleep ?
The power nap was not found to affect the sleep of the night .
Participants in the survey even though they were asleep in the afternoon , did not have a problem to sleep at night .
Simply observed that if they had sleep in the afternoon , needed 6 minutes more to fall asleep at night
So we see that the biological need for sleep in the afternoon and evening is not accidental .
The human brain and the rest of the body benefit from a power nap , they become invigorated and effective .
Under ideal conditions , those who have poor night ’s sleep must change their program to include 7 - 8 hours of sleep during 24 hours .
If this is not possible , then they must seek to have a short power nap .
A power nap for those people will be especially refreshing and relaxing .
Do you take a power nap ?
You should not be fighting the biological clock , particularly if you have taken a heavy meal .
It is good to have a short power nap , even five to ten minutes rest is enough to renew .
There is much evidence that the force that a power nap can give you is useful in the office and beneficial for life and driving .
The duration of a power nap should not be longer than 20 minutes .
Try to include in your daily schedule a convenient time ( preferably before the afternoon ) and make sure that the room you will rest will be dark and quiet .
For the majority of people a power nap for about 10 - 20 minutes is enough .
When the power nap lasts longer then when you wake up you may have feelings of disorientation and instability .
To avoid this it is suggested to put an alarm so as not to sleep deeply .
For most people ( there is a significant variation from person to person ) there are two periods where their power is at a peak , the latter is greater .
The first occurs after the morning awakening , but begins to fall before lunchtime .
If the meal is good , it is very difficult for those who have enjoyed their launch to keep their eyes open and concentrate during the afternoon .
Even without a quick nap , most people start repents 3 - 4 in the afternoon .
The second energy period is for most people the most efficient , physically and mentally period of the day .
The experts recommend taking a power nap between 2 pm and 4 pm .
It is not suggested to take a power nap after 5 pm .
A Power nap can improve your memory
Taking a quick power nap at work , for a few minutes , can improve the capacity of your memory .
A brief power nap refreshes the brain and can improve your concentration , awareness and the efficiency of your memory .
It appeared that a power nap of only six minutes might have the same effect on memory as an overnight rest .
Researchers asked students to memorize a list of words and tested their ability to recall them from their memory after an hour of playing solitaire .
The students had to remember 30 words .
They let the students rest for an hour before passing the memory test .
During the break some of the students slept for six minutes while the others stayed awake .
The scientists showed that those who slept for a while showed exceptional memory skills compared with those who stayed awake .
It is known that with increasing age , people sleep less at night , which is not good for their health .
In the elderly a power nap can substitute the deficit of not sleeping at night .
The satisfaction of the biological need for a power nap , improves the physical and mental state , is fruitful for the workers but also for the economy in general .
New research suggests that pollution from traffic can ‘ reprogram ’ genes in the womb , increasing the risk for asthma .
The study is the first to link pollution to genetic changes , although researchers say that more studies are needed to confirm the findings .
[ social_buttons ]
The study , published in PLoS ONE Journal , looked at ACSL3 , a gene expressed in the lung , and its association with asthma in children at or around age 5 .
The mothers ’ exposure ( while pregnant ) to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) was recorded , and the umbilical cord blood from their children was examined for the modified gene .
“ Our data support the concept that environmental exposures can interact with genes during key developmental periods to trigger disease onset later in life , and that tissues are being reprogrammed to become abnormal later . ” – Dr Shuk -mei
Ho , study leader and director of the Center for Environmental Genetics at the University of Cincinnati .
Researchers found a significant association between high levels of maternal PAH exposure and the chemical changes which control activation of the ACSL3 gene .
“ We know that children living in polluted areas have a higher incidence of asthma but what we did n’t know was it was affecting a gene . ” – Dr Keith Prowse , VP , British Lung Foundation
Early detection of the modified gene may help to prevent asthma , which strikes as many as 25 % of children in high traffic pollution areas .
“ We do n’t yet know whether air pollution can actually cause asthma and although this study is very interesting , further research is needed before we can say for sure .
We do know however that pollution triggers symptoms in two thirds of people with asthma , and many say that a reduction in air pollution would make the single biggest difference to their quality of life . ”

DUNGU , Congo —
The American military helped plan and pay for a recent attack on a notorious Ugandan rebel group , but the offensive went awry , scattering fighters who carried out a wave of massacres as they fled , killing as many as 900 civilians .
The operation was led by Uganda and aimed to crush the Lord ’s Resistance Army , a brutal rebel group that had been hiding out in a Congolese national park , rebuffing efforts to sign a peace treaty .
But the rebel leaders escaped , breaking their fighters into small groups that continue to ransack town after town in northeastern Congo , hacking , burning , shooting and clubbing to death anyone in their way .
The United States has been training Ugandan troops in counterterrorism for several years , but its role in the operation has not been widely known .
It is the first time the United States has helped plan such a specific military offensive with Uganda , according to senior American military officials .
They described a team of 17 advisers and analysts from the Pentagon ’s new Africa Command working closely with Ugandan officers on the mission , providing satellite phones , intelligence and $ 1 million in fuel .
No American forces ever got involved in the ground fighting in this isolated , rugged corner of Congo , but human rights advocates and villagers here complain that the Ugandans and the Congolese troops who carried out the operation did little or nothing to protect nearby villages , despite a history of rebel reprisals against civilians .

Via multiple sources ( Greta Christina , Pam Spaulding , Glenn Greenwald , Americans United , as well as others ) , this unpleasant news : President - elect Barack Obama has apparently chosen megachurch pastor Rick Warren to give a speech at his inauguration day .
If you ’re not familiar with Rick Warren , or if you only know him as the author of The Purpose - Driven Life , here ’s a few of his greatest hits :
• Warren has been a dedicated enemy of marriage equality , equating gay rights to incest and pedophilia ( source ) , and was a fervent supporter of the pro-bigotry Proposition 8 .
He is against civil unions for gay couples ( source ) .
He has even , arguably , given his support to African Christians who want homosexuality to be illegal ( source ) .
• He ’s also rabidly anti-choice , comparing abortion to the Holocaust ( source ) .
• Just for good measure , he ’s said that atheists are not qualified for the presidency :
“ I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says , ‘ I do n’t need God , ’… They ’re saying , ‘ I ’m totally self - sufficient by [ myself ] . ’
And nobody is self - sufficient to be president by themselves .
It ’s too big a job . ”
• And , oh yes , he ’s a creationist .
If Warren seems more approachable or more reasonable than the hate - spewing religious right leaders we all know , it ’s only because he presents his bigotry in a kinder , gentler facade .
His church does occasionally discuss other issues , such as AIDS in Africa or global warming , but it takes more than that to earn my respect when he still spends so much time and energy pounding the religious right ’s standard causes .
In fact , Warren has said that only five issues are “ non-negotiable ” – his opposition to abortion , stem - cell research , cloning , gay rights and euthanasia – which puts him firmly in the camp of the other religious hatemongers .
Apparently , if push came to shove , he would discard efforts to help the suffering of AIDS orphans , prevent the genocide in Darfur , or avert the looming threat of climate change in order to prevent gay couples from having civil unions .
For all the high - minded media talk about the “ new evangelicals ” , Warren is not substantially different from the old guard , and his beliefs are grounded in the same bigoted and ignorant worldview that motivates his predecessors .
He ’s said himself that the difference between himself and Jerry Falwell is mainly “ a matter of tone ” ( source ) .
Inviting him to speak at the inauguration is a terrible decision .
The fact is , I understand why Obama made it – I think I grasp the political considerations that went into it – and I still think it ’s a bad decision .
I suspect Obama thought that , by inviting Warren , he would seem sensible and centrist in the eyes of the public , and might peel off some evangelical voters from the Republican coalition .
And since Warren ’s speech is a symbolic gesture only , he probably thinks that his policies once in office will make up any lost goodwill among progressive voters .
As I said , I assume that was the Obama team ’s political calculus , but I think the real effects will be different .
I think this invitation will be viewed as a slap in the face by liberal and progressive Americans – the very people who supported Obama ’s bid for the presidency and worked to put him into office .
And while it may generate some fleeting goodwill among evangelical voters , I have no doubt that the vast majority of them will vote Republican in the next election anyway .
Meanwhile , the lost goodwill among Obama ’s supporters may not be as easy to win back as he apparently thinks .
It ’s very likely that he ’ll need us again to pressure Congress to support his proposals .
Will we be willing to work again for him , having been denigrated in this way ?
Insulting your allies for the sake of a futile gesture to your sworn enemies is a bad idea and bad politics .
And I suspect the blowback has been far more intense and sustained than Obama ’s team anticipated , causing controversy and embarrassment where they had hoped to avoid both .
Although I still consider Obama ’s election a tremendous net positive for America , this shameful pick may be a sign of how much work we ’ll have to do in the next eight years to prod our leaders toward implementing a truly progressive agenda .
We cannot tell a lie – it turns out that Martha Washington was a real babe .
Forget the view of our first first lady as an old frump with a double chin , and think first knockout !
The surprising peek into the past comes courtesy of forensic anthropologists who , using a miniature portrait of a middle - aged Martha , did a computerized age - regression portrait that shows what she would have looked like at 25 .
“ We always see Martha with a withered face in her old age .
But she was quite a beautiful woman in her younger years , and Washington loved her deeply , ” Edward Lengel , senior editor at the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia , told The Washington Post .
George and Martha got hitched 250 years ago last month , and her flattering new portrait now hangs at George Washington ’s Historic Mount Vernon .
It ’s a scene out of Dante ’s “ Inferno ” : a lake of asphalt and other hydrocarbons stretched out across what was once an estuary of the Caribbean Sea .
From its oil - blackened banks , the fumes are overwhelming , and dead birds can be seen scattered on the gooey surface that , after a heavy rain , can be mistaken for water .
The oil refinery that created this lake dominates the skyline , flames pouring from its flare stacks .
“ Sometimes dogs and other animals get stuck as well , ” environmental activist Yvette Raveneau says of the 200 - acre artificial lake that lies on the outskirts of Willemstad on the island of Curaçao .
The lake is just a small part of the environmental legacy of the Isla oil refinery , built in 1918 on this , the largest of the Netherlands ’ Caribbean island dependencies .
Smokestack emissions still fall on nearby neighborhoods and are blamed for a wide range of health problems .
Oil leaks have contaminated the harbor and coral reefs in the nearby sea .
“ I am one of the enemies of this lake , but it is not the highest priority , ” says Ms. Raveneau , a chemistry teacher and president of Friends of the Earth ’s Curaçao branch .
Ten years ago , she led the Netherlands ’ Queen Beatrix on a tour of this contaminated corner of her kingdom .
“ It ’s well known that the emissions are much too high , they are hazardous to the health , and yet they go on and on , year after year . ”
The refinery blessed and cursed this island of 150,000 .
Built by Royal Dutch Shell , it provided thousands of jobs and an industrial base for this arid , out - of - the way island and literally fueled the allied invasion of North Africa in World War II .
It still employs 900 people and is one of Curaçao ’s largest foreign - exchange earners .
“ The refinery is a given on the island , and it ’s hard to say we would do better without it , ” says Don Werdekker , director of the Cura­­­­­çao Hospitality and Tourism As­­­sociation .
“ Some tourist destinations are highly dependent on that one sector , and you can see today how that makes them vulnerable in a crisis .
Provided the refinery operates according to the best possible environmental guidelines , we welcome it , ” he says .
But Dutch and local authorities never imposed the same environmental regulations they had at home , removing an incentive to invest in pollution - abatement technology .
By 1985 the Isla refinery was so antiquated that Shell , Holland ’s lar­gest corporation , declared it obsolete .
But instead of tearing it down at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars , Shell got the island government to buy it for $ 1 and to absolve the conglomerate of any future environmental and health liabilities .
Shell knew that it was getting a sweetheart deal , says Raveneau ’s colleague Lloyd Narain , and the island government was naive .
“ We islanders knew nothing about the refinery – it had been an island within the island – and the government did n’t even have a specialist on their side , ” he says .
Island leaders panicked when Shell pulled out .
They feared social unrest if the plant closed .
Many on the island now think Shell has at least a moral responsibility to clean up past contamination at the refinery , which is currently operated by the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA on a long - term lease .
The international office of Friends of the Earth agrees , and last year held a worldwide campaign to urge Shell to clean up Isla and eight other problematic sites .
“ We think Shell headquarters should take responsibility for the problems they have caused in some developing countries , ” says Albert ten Kate , a campaigner at the group ’s Amsterdam headquarters .
“ Unfortunately , there has n’t been much progress . ”
Mr. Narain and Raveneau , who have been fighting the refinery since 1989 , put overall cleanup costs at $ 1 billion , a sum far beyond the island ’s means .
Shell , based in The Hague , denies responsibility .
“ As Shell has not had a presence on the island of Curaçao for 23 years and transferred ownership at this time , ” a company spokeswoman says , “ all liabilities regarding environmental issues have been transferred to the current owner . ”
Over the past decade , multinational corporations have come under increasing pressure to assume responsibility for past environmental contamination of sites in the developing world .
Chevron is fighting a court case in Ecuador , where it faces potential damages of up to $ 16.3 billion for the alleged dumping of billions of tons of toxic waste .
Friends of the Earth wants
Shell to set aside at least $ 10 billion to clean up oil contamination in Nigeria .
The most pressing problem is the result of current operations : the plume of airborne pollutants .
Residents downwind say it triggers headaches , ­nausea , itchy skin , and respiratory problems .
Norbert George , president of the Humane Care Foun­­dation in Willemstad , estimates that more than 12 percent of the island ’s population has suffered health damage .
Residents say the emissions rapidly corrode metal objects and sometimes stain laundry as it dries on clotheslines .
“ In its present condition , [ the refinery ] poses a health threat to the community and does not agree with the tourism industry of the island , ” says the island ’s most prominent entrepreneur , Jacob Gelt Dekker , a multimillionaire philanthropist and luxury resort owner .
“ Local politicians have been unable to make decisions , mostly due to conflicts of interest .
Many of them have ties to the plant . ”
Humphrey Davelaar , Curaçao ’s health commissioner and head of the is­­land ’s primary health laboratory , did not respond to requests for comment and official statistics on emissions and health effects .
PDVSA ’s Caracas - based communications director could not be reached .
A lack of concrete information makes it difficult to assess the refinery ’s impact on the marine environment , says Rolf Bak of the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research .
“ It ’s certain that the reefs downstream of the harbor entrance are degraded , ” he says .
It ’s hard to say how much is from the refinery and how much from shipping or elsewhere , he adds .
PDVSA has made improvements , but has been sued in local courts for alleged continued failures to comply with pollution permits .
The company has argued that if it were required to comply , it would be forced to close the plant .
“ The courts have said they must comply with the permit , but the permit is vague , so the judges ca n’t tell you a thing , ” says activist Narain , who ultimately faults the island ’s leadership .
“ If you do n’t have a government that wants to protect the people and really thinks about sustainable development , nothing will happen . ”
It looks like Bandai have put a lot of time in and money into the imminent Akira Blu-ray , hopefully putting to rest the fears of fans worldwide that it might be yet another quick transfer .
According to Blu-ray.com , although the film had a full restoration for it ’s 2001 DVD release , no punches have been pulled for it ’s 20th anniversary , with the focus being moved onto remastering the score and soundtrack :
It was in the planning stages for bringing AKIRA to Blu-ray , that composer Shoji Yamashiro proposed taking the format to its limits by including a 192 khz / 24 - bit audio track that would allow viewers to experience the full warmth and detail of the original recordings .
After much debate , the decision was made to move forward .
Unfortunately , there were no available studios with the ability to master at this level of fidelity , and many of their sound systems could not reliably reproduce the dynamic range of sound that Shoji Yamashiro wanted to bring to the front during the re mastering process .
As a result , the soundtrack ’s re-mastering was done at Mr. Yamashiro ’s own studio , equipped with the best equipment available , and the original analog master tapes were brought out from storage .
Even though AKIRA had major restoration work done for the 2001 DVD release , including a 1080 p theatrical quality master , advances in digital restoration and film transfer technologies have increased to the point where a brand new transfer was warranted .
As with the audio , a new inter-positive was struck from the original film negative for a new scan into a digital intermediate ( DI ) ; the master computer file upon which all of the remastering work was performed .
In fact , the transfer is of such quality that apparently it pushes the BR format to some of it ’s technical and storage limits :
Even at a running time of only 124 minutes , AKIRA pushes the boundaries of what can be compressed to a Blu-ray Disc .
The root of this challenge lies in the 192 khz / 24 - bit 5.1 track .
Uncompressed linear PCM at this resolution needs an astonishing 28 megabits per second ( mbps ) of transfer rate .
To give a point of reference , this is 30 % greater than the video bitrate on the well - regarded Pirates of the Carribean : Dead Man ’s Chest Blu-ray , and 8 mbps over the maximum allowable combined audio bitrate in the Blu-ray spec .
This of course , does n’t even account for the original Dolby Surround mix ( linear PCM ) , the English Dub ( 48khz/16 - bit Dolby TrueHD ) , or the Japanese Dolby Digital tracks .
For help , Bandai turned to Dolby , whose TrueHD codec is standard for their releases .
The two companies worked together closely to balance the available space on a BD - 50 with the needs of both the audio and video tracks .
In the end , the combined load of all four audio tracks bump their head against that 20 mbps ceiling , never breaking through , while still leaving plenty of room for a high quality video presentation .
Interesting and exciting news .
Although worryingly I can’t seem to find a UK website right now that ’s taking pre-orders – worrying because the February 24th launch date is just ten days away .
In the worse - case - scenario , and a euro release is substantially delayed again , then at lease the US disc is being reported to be region - free .
Either way , expect a full report when I get my hands on it .
Special thanks to my good friend Jeb for the tip - off on this one .
Thanks to some high tech info courtesy of David Honan ( a new RP contributor ) and his ATCS setup , we knew this train had begun it 's slow journey through the darkness of the 7.8 mile Cascade Tunnel .
This group , participating in Ross Fotheringham 's annual Tracks in the Snow event , was also well equipped with radios and while waiting for the train , we were greeted with some discouraging words .
Lost contact with FRED , may need to take the switch at Scenic and back out of the tunnel .
Time to head for the warmth of our vehicles , and so we did .
But not half way back , " we 're on the move " crackled over the radios .
A mad dash back to our staked out positions , mine being the most difficult to reach , only to wait another 5 minutes or so for the fans to slow to stop and the tunnel door to open .
Plenty of time to read the graffiti on the bridge .
Nine minutes later .. headlights , a roar of GE's , showtime !

Here for a different angle and lighting of this scene !
The FDA has effectively banned a naturally - occurring form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxamine by declaring it to be a drug , reports the American Association for Health Freedom .
Responding to a petition filed by a drug company , the FDA declared pyridoxamine to be " a new drug .
" Now , any nutritional supplements containing pyridoxamine will be considered adulterated and illegal by the FDA , which may raid vitamin companies and seize such products .
See the history of FDA raids on vitamin companies here : www.naturalnews.com/021791.html
Pyridoxamine occurs naturally in fish , chicken and other foods ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6 ) , putting the FDA in the strange position of banning a substance from dietary supplements even though it is already present in the food supply .
The FDA 's war on Mother NatureIt 's not the first time the FDA has declared a natural molecule to be a " drug " while attacking nutritional supplements that contain the same molecule .
A similar story unfolded with red yeast rice and the lovastatin molecules it contains that lower high cholesterol .
The drug companies engaged in biopiracy , ripping off the molecule from red yeast rice to make their now - famous " statin drugs . "
Once the statin drugs were patented , Big Pharma and the FDA went after red yeast rice , claiming the supplement was " adulterated with pharmaceuticals .
"
It was n't really adulterated , of course .
It just contained a natural statin - drug - like molecule that the drug companies copied and patented .
It would be like Big Pharma patenting vitamin C , then the FDA claiming that all oranges and lemons were adulterated with drugs because they naturally contain their own vitamin C. This is the insanity of the FDA as it operates today .
You can read more about the FDA on our channel webiste www.FDAreform.org which is updated every few days .
So will this ruling on pyridoxamine affect nutritional supplements ?
Yes , any supplements containing this form of vitamin B6 can now be declared " adulterated " by the FDA .
Manufacturers of such supplements can be arrested and shut down for engaging in " illegal drug trafficking . "
Such is the nature of the FDA 's agenda to criminalize nutritional supplement companies and limit consumers ' access to Mother Nature 's remedies .
Whoa .
Is that Barack Obama on the cover of the new GQ , or is it ... Bryant Gumbel ?
The Photoshop wizards over at GQ should have learned a lesson about artificially " darkening " people from the O.J. Simpson fiasco in the 1990s .
To compound matters , this goes on top of the Beyonce " lightening " scandal earlier this year .
Black people come in sooo many different hues , one can understand if due to lighting and such the images are off a little bit , but Obama is waaay more chocolate than he truly is in the GQ cover .
Message to art director :
Add a litte more vanilla , less mocha .
Or perhaps they should stay away from the airbrush tool after all , or do n't stop at Starbucks before heading into the office .
Either way Obama 's true complexion is fairer than most .
Why is this so difficult ?
To be fair , this has happened to white men as well , most recently ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit earlier this autumn ( which he demanded be redone ) .
But seriously , we 're not mad at GQ ; they 've got it right countless times before .
Just remember , ease up on the airbrush .
Midweek Mental Greening
At some point , you ’ve probably heard someone say , “ Music is my therapy . ”
Actually , you ’ve probably heard a lot of people say it .
What you might not have heard as often is , “ Dave Matthews Band is my own personal anti-depressant . ”
For me , it ’s true .
Whether I ’m feeling sad , angry , apathetic , or even hopeless , I can pop in a DMB CD and , I swear , within the first few seconds not only can I physically feel how much better I mentally feel , but sometimes all even feels right with the world again .
When my sister gave me DMB concert tickets for Christmas last month , she may as well have handed me sunshine in a bottle .
Music is a powerful tool when it comes to our moods ( I know – common sense , right ? ) .
Whether we ’re playing it or listening to it , music can help relieve stress , soothe anxiety and boost energy .
It ’s no surprise , then , that Michigan State University founded the first music therapy degree program in 1944 and “ professional ” music therapy ( i.e. not just listening to your favorite jam when you ’re feeling blue ) has been going strong for more than 60 years .
In case you do n’t know much about music therapy , here are a few points of interest from the American Music Therapy Association ( AMTA ) :
Music therapy can consist of both listening to and actually making music .
It can benefit everyone from children to seniors , and in addition to people with mental health , learning , and developmental problems , music therapy can benefit healthy folks , individuals with brain or physical injuries , and people experiencing pain .
The practice of music therapy often is used in schools , hospitals , psychiatric facilities , and nursing homes .
Music therapists are for real .
After completing music therapy curricula in college , aspiring music therapists can try to earn the music therapist board - certified credential ( MT - BC ) .
( Which means I do n’t have the professional credentials to tell you to get some DMB on your iPod , even though I still think you should … ) .
Under certain conditions , Medicare may cover music therapy .
In a few states , Medicaid may include music therapy under a waiver program or existing treatment category .
Some private health insurance providers even include music therapy coverage .
The AMTA also provides information about its regions , and some folks throughout the country , like those in Austin and San Diego , can find independently operated facilities closer to home .
And music as a therapy tool is pretty darn green , for both our bodies and the planet – do n’t you think ?
There are no chemicals to ingest , musical instruments tend to be passed down and reused until the keys pop off ( just ask my old junior high band teacher ) , and even though it takes a good bit of natural gas , crude oil , and water to manufacture CDs ( not to mention something like a million years for one CD to completely decompose – seriously , I ’m not making it up ) , CDs are recyclable .
So , what are your thoughts on using music as therapy ?
Have any of you had experience with professional music therapy ?
Or , if not , how do you use music yourself to brighten – or soothe – your moods ?
Any special songs or bands you want to share ?

A South Korean court has fined the parents of a teenage rapist more than $ 60,000 ( £ 40,000 ) for failing to supervise their son .
The 18 - year - old , who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , raped a local seven - year - old girl in 2006 .
The court said the boy had grown up watching pornography and had imitated a film he had seen , during the attack .
It said his parents could have prevented the crime with appropriate education , but neglected their duty .
The teenager is serving a 10 - year sentence for the rape , but a court in Seoul ruled that his parents were also liable for his crime .
A court statement said : " The parents could have prevented the crime with appropriate education but failed to show enough attention to their child .
" They neglected their duty to raise their child so that he can properly adjust to society . "
The girl 's parents were seeking 225 m won ( $ 165,000 ; £ 111,000 ) in damages .
The identities of all the parties involved in the case have been withheld .
Analysts say the case raises many questions about the extent to which parents can be held responsible for the actions of their children .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Barack Obama 's inauguration marks a profound manifestation of the Rev. Martin Luther King 's dream , civil rights leaders say , but the movement would be foolish to drop its guard now .
Christine King Farris sits next to a photo of her brother as she reads to kids to commemorate his birthday Thursday .
King did not fight tirelessly and ultimately give his life so African - Americans could take office ; he fought for the disenfranchised and downtrodden , no matter their color , said Charles Steele , president and CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , which King and Steele 's father helped found .
" President - elect Barack Obama is just a piece of the puzzle , " he said .
" This tells us that we are at a station , but it 's not our destination .
We 've got to get back on the train . "
Steele said he worries that those who espouse King 's dream may grow lackadaisical because an African - American has taken the reins of the free world .
But it is imperative , he said , that they " march now more than ever before . "
Steele points to 1963 , when tens of thousands of protesters converged on Washington to demand equal rights .
It was there King delivered his " I Have a Dream " speech from the Lincoln Memorial steps .
President Kennedy 's administration was considered the most receptive ever to the concerns of the civil rights movement , Steele said .
But rather than sit back and hope Kennedy did the right thing , King and thousands stormed Washington to lay out demands that later would yield the Civil Rights Act and National Voting Rights Act .
Those down for the cause today must do the same with Obama , Steele said .
" Back in the '60s we were fighting for President - elect Barack Obama ; we just did n't know it was him , " Steele said .
" It was civil rights , not politics , that got us to this position , and we can't forget that . "
Andrew Young remembers pickets outside City Hall the day he took office as Atlanta 's second black mayor in 1982 .
Young , a former King lieutenant , said he was initially confused when he noticed some of the protesters were his supporters .
" I said , ' I have n't changed . '
They said , ' Yes , you have .
You 're in charge , ' " recalled Young , who also has been a U.S. congressman and U.N. ambassador .
" They were there reminding me I was the man . "
Obama , too , needs to be reminded of the concerns of the African - American community , Young said , warning civil rights supporters not to assume Obama owes them something .
" He is one of the fruits of our labors , " Young said , " and all he has to do is plant more seeds and grow more trees that bear more fruit . "
Young 's words rang true with Kee-Shawn Smith , 19 , a sophomore at the historically black Clark Atlanta University .
She said King and Obama have " set the way " for African - Americans and it's time to concentrate on race , the human one .
" America gives you that one thing -- opportunity , " she said .
" A lot of African - Americans have to realize we have the same opportunities as any other race , any other culture .
...
People should take strides to do better than [ Obama ] . "
Neither Obama 's election nor the King holiday represent that " we just want African - Americans to have this .
It 's more a global perspective , " said Jeffrey Harrell , 20 , a junior at Morehouse College , another historically black school .
" It 's about everybody . "
Today , there are still immigrants and women fighting for rights , there are people who are hungry and others without homes , Harrell said .
" Until everyone is able to take part in what 's called the American dream , the struggle 's not done , " he said .
Harrell also said he was struck by the timing of the inauguration , which falls the day after the King holiday , and he was n't alone in his belief that it was more than coincidental .
" It shows it 's supposed to be this way , " he said .
His words struck a theme , as poet and author Maya Angelou called the timing " amazing " and said it was as if " someone in the outer sphere " planned it .
The Rev. Joseph Lowery , a close friend of King 's who will deliver the benediction at Obama 's inauguration , said the timing of the two events " reflects the mysticism of the movement . "
Details :
Is it coincidence or " divine order " ? »
Young chuckled upon hearing Lowery 's words relayed and added , " I always say that coincidence is God 's way of remaining anonymous .
... I can't think of a nicer birthday present for Martin Luther King . "
King 's only living sibling , Christine King Farris , told CNN that she , too , felt the timing was " in divine order . "
Watch Christine King Farris talk about her brother , Obama »
King Farris spent part of Thursday morning , her brother 's birthday , reading to children at the national park bearing his namesake .
She read tales about the shenanigans of a mischievous young King and his brother , Alfred Daniel -- M.L. and A.D. -- who once conspired to get out of music practice by loosening a leg on the piano stool .
The prank sent the piano instructor crashing to the floor , King Farris recounted , to the giggles of elementary and preschool students .
But she also spoke of her brother 's prophecy when he once told their mother , " One day , I 'm going to turn this world upside down . "
Farris said afterward it 's important that children understand that though King is portrayed as larger than life , he was once a child like them .
It 's a necessary lesson in a nation that has struggled with the concept of " equitable opportunity . "
" It 's going to take some time because it deals with attitudes and , really , the upbringing of children and young people to understand that although we are different in color , in hue and so forth , we are still together .
We should be like brothers and sisters , " she said .
Setting aside race and working together is paramount to the success of Obama 's presidency , Angelou said , and with each day it grows more vital .
" We needed President - elect Obama desperately , and he needs us , " she said .
" We need to be up and doing .
...
What he needs are a lot of foot soldiers .
He needs a lot of us going out trying to help , to allow him to become the president he 's come here to be . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s Supreme Court early next month will hear arguments over whether to allow a ban on same - sex marriage that has become a national rallying point for gays and their supporters .
California voters on November 4 approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman .
A ruling by the same state top court which is now considering the ban had opened the way to same - sex marriage in May of last year , ushering in a summer of gay nuptials ended by the vote .
Trend - setting California fell in line with the majority of U.S. states when it passed the ban , but it spurred nationwide protests that were not seen when other states passed similar legislation .
Supporters on both sides have deluged the California Supreme Court with dozens of briefs .
The court has agreed to hear the case on March 5 , extremely quickly by judicial standards , and it has three months after oral arguments to rule .
State Attorney General Jerry Brown , the former governor , wants the court to reject the ban , arguing it curtails the right to liberty that is paramount in the state constitution .
Ban proponents say California ’s state charter gives the people broad latitude to make laws and set policy , which the court cannot change .
Proponents of both sides have agreed the ban limits rights of a minority group -- ban opponents say the court must defend minorities in such a case , while ban proponents say the people ’s decisions are final .
In a city launched by shotgun weddings and quickie divorces , and which offers the chance to be wed by faux Liberaces , King Tuts and Grim Reapers , there remains at least one nuptial taboo :
You ca n’t be married by an atheist .
Michael Jacobson , a 64 - year - old retiree who calls himself a lifelong atheist , tried this year to get a license to perform weddings .
Clark County rejected his application because he had no ties to a congregation , as state law requires .
So Jacobson and attorneys from two national secular groups -- the American Humanist Assn. and the Center for Inquiry -- are trying to change things .
If they ca n’t persuade the state Legislature to rework the law , they plan to sue .
Jacobson , who spends most afternoons reading online or dining at a nearby buffet , is an admittedly reluctant plaintiff .
But he ’s willing to fight on principle , recalling one time he could n’t :
In the 1960s , the Army demanded that his dog tags note his religion .
He reluctantly chose Judaism , which reflected his ancestry if not his beliefs .

“ One of the things I like to do is stand up and say I ’m a nonbeliever , so you know you ’re not alone , ” he said recently .
For years Mel Lipman , a friend of Jacobson ’s and president of the American Humanist Assn. , had presided over nonreligious weddings in Las Vegas .
But he belonged to the Humanist Society , a secular branch of the Humanist Assn. , whose tax status as a religious group satisfied the clerk ’s requirements .
When Lipman and his wife moved to Florida this spring , Jacobson -- a balding man with a thin , white mustache and a trace of his native Philadelphia in his voice -- decided to become the local atheist celebrant .
“ But I ’m not going to do it by saying I belong to a religious organization , ” he said .
“ That ’s a sham , because atheists are not religious . ”

Jacobson filled out an application to perform marriages , but sidestepped the questions on religion .
County Clerk Shirley Parraguirre said she had little choice but to reject it .
As Nevada law requires , all of the county ’s 2,500 or so licensed officiants are connected to a congregation -- though some are as small as two people , Parraguirre said .
( Judges and commissioners of civil marriages can also lead ceremonies . )
Some of the state ’s regulations hark back to the 1960s , when ministers were dumping their flocks to become wealthy “ Marrying Sams , ” according to the book “ Las Vegas : An Unconventional History . ”
One would - be officiant apparently hoped to marry enough people to finance his divorce .
Lawmakers , trying to ferret out the profit - hungry , said weddings must be among a minister ’s “ incidental ” duties .
Drive past the string of neon - lighted downtown chapels , and you ’ll see that did n’t quite pan out .

Clark County issues nearly 100,000 marriage licenses a year and boasts dozens of places to exchange vows -- atop Harley - Davidsons , in Renaissance costumes , aboard gondolas -- 24 hours a day .
The competition is so fierce that in recent years , employees at rival chapels have accused one another of slashing tires and shouting death threats .
“ Someone is working at all of these chapels , ” said Parraguirre , whose office does n’t have the resources to track down ministers flouting the law .
In fact , she worries that if the criteria to become an officiant changes , her staff will be “ bombarded with people coming in and just doing it for a job . ”
But Bob Ritter , an attorney for the American Humanist Assn. , argued that when a celebrant marries a couple , he is acting as an agent of the state .
Therefore , it ’s unconstitutional to block someone from holding that position based on his religion -- or lack of it , he says .
“ Many atheists and agnostics have . . . deeply held beliefs , ” Ritter wrote in a letter to Parraguirre .
“ Are not their beliefs entitled to the same respect ? ” Nevada law , he continued , implies that “ the religious are more trustworthy than the nonreligious .
This is a bigoted assumption . ”
Most state laws regarding who can wed couples are akin to Nevada ’s , Ritter said .
At least three states , however , allow notaries -- who are licensed to administer oaths and act as witnesses -- to preside over “ I do’s . ”
Ritter hopes Nevada legislators will embrace something similar .

If not , Ritter might have success in court , said Lynne Henderson , a law professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
Judges performing ceremonies , for example , do n’t have to meet religious criteria , so it ’s absurd to make anyone else do so , she said .
Officials could regulate celebrants in other ways , such as making them get training .
“ It ’s very weird , ” Henderson said , “ to try to support these laws in a city of 24 - hour wedding chapels . ”

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2009 February 21
Explanation : Now growing brighter , Comet Lulin is headed for its closest approach to planet Earth early next week .
But the comet 's greenish glow , familiar to earthbound skygazers , is replaced by false colors in this premier view from the orbiting Swift satellite .
Image data from the Swift detectors , normally intended to follow cosmic gamma-ray bursts , were recorded on January 28 .
The data are combined here , along with a sky survey image of background stars , to show optical and ultraviolet light in green - blue hues and x-rays from the comet in red .
The result maps remarkable x-ray emission on the comet 's sunward side as incoming solar wind ions interact with gases in the swollen coma .
It also shows substantial ultraviolet emission opposite the Sun , in the direction of motion and the comet 's tail .
The ultraviolet emission is from the OH molecule derived from the breakup of water , an indicator of the copius amounts of water produced by this extremely active comet .
In fact , astronomers estimate Lulin was releasing about 800 gallons of water each second , enough to fill an Olympic - size swimming pool in less than 15 minutes .

NPR did a piece on the “ honor killing ” of Sandeela Kanwal on January 26 , 2009 .
Kanwal was the daughter of Chaudry Rashid , a Pakistani immigrant who lives in a suburb of Atlanta .
The police in Clayton County ( where Kanwal and Rashid lived ) say that Rashid killed his daughter because she wanted to divorce her husband and Rashid felt that this would bring shame upon his family .
They also say that he confessed to the crime .
Rashid ’s lawyer points out that Rashid had no access to an interpreter in person , that the murder weapon is missing ( it was burned ) and that Rashid did not understand his rights when they were read to him .
The case and the NPR article bring up a lot of questions and concerns on my part concerning race and religion .
Police say that Rashid told them that he killed his daughter because she was n’t being true to her religion or her husband .
Rashid himself has connected Islam to the murder of his daughter .
Throughout the NPR piece , Rashid ’s religion is mentioned .
Sgt. Stefan Schindler mentions that the town they live in ( Tara , GA ) does not have a lot of Muslims in it .
Shahid Malik , who is suppose to be a representative Pakistani community ( how can one person be the representative of an entire ethnic community ? ! ) , says that this case will “ hurt the Muslim community , Pakistani community ” .
Lastly , in the article , the reporter , Jamie Tarabay , mentions that two other “ honor killings ” that have taken place in the U.S.
One was perpetrated by an Egyptian Muslim immigrant , the other by a Turkish immigrant .
Islam and Muslims are constantly evoked in this piece , which is disappointing .
The most obvious reason is that “ honor killings ” are n’t solely perpetrated by Muslims .
By constantly connecting Muslims to “ honor killings ” , the problem seems like a “ Muslim problem ” that needs to be dealt with by Muslims .
It once again makes Muslims seem like heartless animals who are only concerned with honor .
Another reason I am concerned with connecting Muslims to honor killings is because it presents a face of Muslims that is only South Asian and Arab .
Whether it is right or wrong , people in the U.S. connect honor killings to Asian and Arab countries .
When honor killings are focused on as a “ Muslim problem ” , we are turning Muslims into ethnic groups from those parts of the world .
Muslims once again become foreign , scary and dangerous every time Muslims and “ honor killings ” are connected .
Additionally , I am troubled by the focus on “ honor killings ” as a phenomena of certain ethnic groups instead of “ honor killings ” being one of the many manifestations of how patriarchy can lead to violence against women .
The way “ honor killings ” was reported in the story and the way it is reported in general , “ honor killings ” are often disconnected from the larger issue of patriarchy ( which affects all women ) and instead focused on as a purely localized issue that affects certain racial groups .
I would like “ honor killings ” to be focused on as part of the global fight against violence against women .
This is one of the reasons why I dislike the term “ honor killings ” .
It makes it hard to connect these crimes to this global fight and instead makes it seem like an issue that only Muslims have to combat .
This is n’t to say that we should have our head in the sand about these crimes and act like they do n’t exist or not address them because they “ make us look bad ” .
When someone kills their daughter in the name of Islam , yes , that person should be given a lesson on how 1 ) Islam condemns violence against women and 2 ) how Islam respects human life regard of gender .
That said , I wish that the Western media would stop focusing on “ honor killings ” as an isolated issue .
It seems that only one person in this whole ordeal got this point .
Alan Begner ( Rashid ’s lawyer ) , hopes the state does n’t make this about Islam or ethnicity .
This death could have happened , he says , in any culture , with any family . ”
Thank you Mr. Begner !
For a guy who says he does not enjoy the physical toll of running , United States Navy SEAL David Goggins sure does a good job of fooling those of us watching from the sidelines .
In 2001 , he graduated from Basic Underwater Demolitions / SEAL ( BUD/S ) training with Class 235 .
In 2004 , Goggins graduated from Army Ranger School with the distinction of enlisted " Top Honor Man . "
His life as a SEAL has led him to operational assignments with SEAL Team FIVE , based in Coronado , California , with multiple deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq .
He has also served as a close quarters combat instructor and land warfare instructor .
In November 2005 , Goggins received the tragic news of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that was carrying six of his fellow SEALs who were killed in action .
This devastating accident sparked action and he began to participate in extreme Ultra Running events to raise money for the families of his fallen comrades and to honor their warrior spirits .
As an Ultra Athlete , Goggins has completed in fourteen 100 - plus - mile races .
His first complete triathlon was the Ultraman World Championships in 2006 where he finished second place overall while using a rented bike without clipless pedals .
On the eve before the 30th anniversary Ironman Hawaii , Slowtwitch caught up with Petty Officer 1st Class Goggins and his wife Liza after bike check - in at the King K Hotel in Kailua - Kona .
David : I actually just got back from France doing Mont Blanc 100 - mile race .
It was probably the hardest 100 - mile race in the world .
Actually , 106 - miles , 33,000 - ft of climbing .
I did that three weeks ago so my body has n't quite recovered from that yet .
It starts in France , goes into Italy into Switzerland and back into France so it makes a big circle around the base of Mt. Blanc .
Very mountainous .
I was ready for it , but the race itself breaks you down .
ST : You started running races in 05 and 06 ?
David :
My first race was in November of 05 .
I 'm not sure if it 's a SEAL mentality , I can't speak for all the SEALs , but I know it 's my mentality .
I was pretty stupid about that .
It 's not arrogance on my part , but sometimes you think you can do things but I was n't prepared for it .
I was 280 - lbs and running 20 - minutes every other day and not really thinking about it too much .
It 's a very funny picture , but everybody thinks they can do more than what they can .
ST : What does that do to your body ?
David :
It destroyed my body .
Luckily my wife is a nurse .
At mile 70 , everything in my body shut down .
A 280 - lb man is n't supposed to run that far .
I broke almost all the metatarsals in my feet .
I had stress fractures , shin splints , all my kidneys shutdown and I was urinating blood .
ST : Did stopping ever cross your mind ?
David : No .
Not at all .
No .
Liza :
When he started peeing blood , yeah .
When I saw that his kidneys were failing , I thought he should stop and that there was a risk he could die , but he said no and that he wanted to keep going .
ST : You start your training runs in the wee hours of the AM ?
David :
Here 's the thing .
I do n't like doing this .
I do n't like to run , but it 's one of the ways I can find out who I am in life .
I can't find out who David Goggins is by watching Sunday Night Football .
I need to set the bar high and then try to meet it .
The only way I can that is to do ridiculous things at the most ridiculous times .
When I 'm really tired and want to sleep , that 's when I go out there and do it .
ST : And you ( to Liza , David 's wife ) , you do n't mind it ?
Liza :
If he can run it , I can drive it .
ST : That ( the driving ) would be brutal .
David :
It takes a very supportive wife .
ST : What did you think of Captain Duncan Smith ’s idea to parachute and then race ?
David : I was a support guy out here last year .
I thought it was a cool idea but I never thought it would happen .
I just thought it was a bunch of guys talking .
Now that it 's here , there are a lot of logistics involved in this .
There is a lot of timing .
You have to jump out right before the race and get back to shore , make sure timing chips are working , making sure all of your gear is on .
Then to get back to the starting line and then start going .
I think it 's a pretty neat idea , all in all , it 's a pretty neat idea .
ST : Is the jump more practice than the actual race ?
David : I 'm not that worried about the race .
It 's a very hard race but I 'm more concerned about the jump .
Being safe and everybody being safe and everything going right .
You can lose your life in a triathlon but you need to make sure you have thought about jumping out of an airplane before you can think about a 2.4 - mile swim .
ST : What logistics are going into your day tomorrow ?
When does your day begin ?
David :
My day will start at 4:00 AM .
Actually , I 'll get up at 3:00 AM and then from there I 'll make sure I have everything for the jump including : my fins , my uniform , my booties and my jump helmet .
I 'll make sure everything is good to go .
From there , I 'll come downstairs and get my body markings on very quick .
Myself and Keith Davids will jump in a car and go to the airport , get our parachutes checked , make sure that 's all good , make sure our fins are right , hop in the airplane , do a take off , and then jump out .
From there , the logistics of making sure the boats are there to pick us up on time and making sure we drop out of the bird right where we need to drop .
If things do n't go exactly right , it could be a pretty long day .
If things go right like we 've practiced , it should all be good .
ST : Have you completed any practice jumps this week ?
David : I actually did n't jump today .
We were out there watching the jump so we were on the ground to see how everything should look an getting a different angle .
We wanted to see how long it would take for everybody to get in back to pier after the jump .
ST : How does an Ironman compare to the other events you do ?
David : I 'm not putting the Ironman down by any means , it 's just that I 'm conditioned to go longer .
This is a long race and these guys can go fast , that 's the amazing thing about these athletes .
They can redline , max heart rate , for 8 and 9 hours .
I 'm not capable of doing that .
ST : Is this race like a sprint for you ?
David :
This is a sprint race , but I 'm not capable of sprinting .
I 'm a guy who can go 48 hours of non -stop running but at 140 heart rate .
ST : Will you do another workout after the race finish ?
David :
That 's kind of my mentality about the whole thing .
I 'll see what happens .
I 'll definitely do something else after the race is over .
Once the Ironman is over , I will do some more working out but it will be on my own time after everything is shut down .
ST : How do you prepare for the jump aspect of your day ?
David :
We have a whole bunch of different A , B , C and D plans .
Say tomorrow , we get up and it 's raining .
Then the jump is canceled and we go right to the starting line and are normal racers like everyone else .
Say something happens where everything goes right and we get out to the landing strip where the bird is at and we 're going to load it but something is wrong with the bird .
We have a backup plan for that to get in the cars and drive back .
If something happens where we 're up there and ready to jump out but something happens where we can't jump , then our plan C is to fly back to the landing strip , get our equipment and get back to the start for the race .
We have a whole bunch of plans in case any one of those things should happen .
In the military , you learn that one plan is not enough , two plans is not enough , three plans ... maybe .
ST : What is your transition from parachute uniform to racing uniform going to look like ?
David :
Once we land and jump into the boat , the boat will race us to shore , and we 'll get out and get dressed .
If I wear my speedsuit under the parachute equipment , it will get torn .
The jump is kind of violent .
ST : How high up will you be when you jump ?
David :
It depends tomorrow how the clouds and weather are .
It could be as high as 12,500 - feet or it could be as low as 2,000 - feet .
ST : What will the rest of your racing season be like ?
David : I thought about coming back out for Ultraman in November but I 'm going to Oahu in January for the Hurt 100 .
It 's a 100 - mile trail race out there and is probably one of the hardest trail races in America .
It 's technical , lots of climbing and rooty .
We 'll see what happens .
ST : What are the other competitors like in the Ultraman and ultra running races ?
David :
You know , those races are much different than Ironman .
There are maybe 100 other competitors out there racing , the finish line may have four or five people standing at it , you may get an award like a belt buckle but you will likely get nothing at all .
There is no hoop - la , there is a pasta dinner , and stuff like that .
ST : Do you like that about Ultra events ?
David : I do .
It 's not that I 'm shy , but I just do n't need anyone shouting my name when I cross the finish line .
ST : Will being an Ironman mean something to you ?
Some racers have trained and worked towards that moment their entire lives .
Having served our country in war , how do you put that in perspective ?
David :
For me triathlon and Ironman is a great experience .
To be here , with all these people , to see people in wheelchairs and with no legs competing , that 's inspirational to me .
It 's going to be a long and hard day for me and a whole lot of people , but it 's really just a good training day for me to use towards other much longer races in the near future .
ST : What is your SEAL career looking like right now ?
David :
Right now I 'm still active and have been in the military for 13 years .
I 've been a SEAL for almost 9 of those years .
As of right now I have a couple more years left in the Navy and I 'll probably extend at that time .
The Navy is a great opportunity for me and my family .
If not , who knows , maybe I 'll come back and be a professional triathlete .
ST : How do you balance training for these endurance events with your professional SEAL career where your team is counting on you ?
David :
For me , when I 'm going through my team workouts , it 's hard on the body , because going through the normal SEAL training is really hard on the body .
But , I 'm the kind of person who believes there are 24 hours in the day so if you miss training , it 's all on you .
You may miss an hour or two of sleep but then you can get in an hour or two of training .
I wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning because I have to work by a certain time .
I judge my workouts so they fit around my work schedule .
I have to be to work at 7 o'clock so what happens is I wake up with enough time to get in my morning run , then ride my bike into work - a 25 - mile ride one way .
To get all that stuff in I need at least a four hour window .
When I get to work , the worse case scenario is I can't do anything else that day .
No run at lunch time , but I know that when work is over I 'm going to ride my bike back home .
ST : What does work consist of for you ?
David : Right now I 'm more at the instructional level .
I 'm doing instruction type duties .
I 'm going around and doing a lot of mentoring for younger kids .
I 'm flying a lot now , going around and going to schools and telling people what it 's like to be , not only a Navy SEAL , but to be healthy in life .
With obesity in American right now , I 'm getting out there and expressing to these kids what it means to live a healthy lifestyle .
ST : Is there a beneficiary you are working with ?
David :
For me right now , I 'm raising money for all Special Operation units and branches .
If you 're a Ranger , if you 're a Green Beret , if you 're a SEAL , I 'm just trying to raise money for your family .
Being that I went through Ranger school ( Ed note : Goggins graduated Ranger school as the Honor Man ) and I was in the Air Force and now I 'm a SEAL , I 've been through all of them and I want to give back .
As far as the obesity thing goes , I 'm hoping that maybe someone hears my story about weighing 280 pounds and now I weigh 185 , and maybe that will touch someone 's life for them to think if that guy can do it , maybe I can too .
On Saturday , October 11th , Petty Officer David Goggins , Commander Keith Davids , and Captain Duncan Smith parachuted out of the C - 130 ( bird ) and into Kailua - Kona Bay only moments before the professional men and women 's race began .
All three men landed successfully and completed the first ever transition 0 ( parachute to swim ) and went on to complete the 30th anniversary Ironman Hawaii .
Although they competed separately , Goggins and Davids completed the event in 11 hours and 24 minutes , and crossed the finish line together .
Smith completed the parachute , then established a perimeter to ensure the other two men completed their jumps safely and successfully .

Rumors are that former American Idol Contestant Carrie Underwood has “ snagged a senator . ”
Well it ’s not exactly what you think we do n’t mean a real “ senator . ”
So you ask … what are we referring too ?
According to an Ottawa news source , Underwood has been seen canoodling with Canadian born hockey player , Mike Fisher .
Fisher who plays for the Ottawa Senators is the teams center .
The 6 ’1 , 28 - year - old hockey star reportedly met Underwood when he went to see her in concert in March 2008 .
According to sources things between the couple heated up over the holidays .
The 25 year - old singer reportedly attended a game with Fishers parents , sister and brother at the Air Canada Centre .
She was spotted on the Jumbotron in the VIP box with them .
This was enough to make those rumors start heating up .
However , in this case apparently the are n’t rumors .
Tony Greco , friend and fitness train of Fisher ’s told the media source that things were going well for the Fisher and his new “ love interest . ”
“ I think it ’s serious , I mean he ’s really happy with her .
They ’re a perfect match , ” he said .
When reporters ask Fisher about the rumors he did n’t deny or confirm them .
Fishers response was :
“ I ca n’t comment on anything in my personal life , so that ’s about all I can say , I do n’t really want to say anything . ”
Guess we ’ll just have to wait and see !

The office of the Defense Department ’s inspector general said in a report Friday that it had found no wrongdoing in a Pentagon public relations program that made use of retired officers who worked as military analysts for television and radio networks .
The report was prompted by articles in The New York Times last year that described an elaborate and largely hidden Pentagon effort , dating from 2002 , to transform a group of high - profile network military analysts into “ surrogates ” or “ message force multipliers ” for the Bush administration .
The articles also documented how military analysts with ties to defense contractors sometimes used their special access to seek advantage in the competition for contracts related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In response to the articles , at least 45 members of Congress called for inquiries into the program , with some asserting that it might have constituted an illegal campaign of propaganda directed at the American public .
Dr. C. Loring Brace Does Race Exist ?
An antagonist 's perspective
by C. Loring Brace
I am going to start this essay with what may seem to many as an outrageous assertion :
There is no such thing as a biological entity that warrants the term " race . "
The immediate reaction of most literate people is that this is obviously nonsense .
The physician will retort , " What do you mean ' there is no such thing as race ' ?
I see it in my practice everyday ! "
Jane Doe and John Roe will be equally incredulous .
Note carefully , however , that my opening declaration did not claim that " there is no such thing as race . "
What I said is that there is no " biological entity that warrants the term ' race ' . "
" You 're splitting hairs , " the reader may retort .
" Stop playing verbal games and tell us what you really mean ! "
And so I shall , but there is another charge that has been thrown my way , which I need to dispel before explaining the basis for my statement .
Given the tenor of our times at the dawn of the new millennium , some have suggested that my position is based mainly on the perception of the social inequities that have accompanied the classification of people into " races . "
My stance , then , has been interpreted as a manifestation of what is being called " political correctness . "
My answer is that it is really the defenders of the concept of " race " who are unwittingly shaped by the political reality of American history .
[ Read a proponent 's perspective , that of anthropologist George Gill . ]
Brace challenges the notion that his position on race is a manifestation of " political correctness . "
But all of this needs explaining .
First , it is perfectly true that the long - term residents of the various parts of the world have patterns of features that we can easily identify as characteristic of the areas from which they come .
It should be added that they have to have resided in those places for a couple of hundred thousand years before their regional patterns became established .
Well , you may ask , why can't we call those regional patterns " races " ?
In fact , we can and do , but it does not make them coherent biological entities .
" Races " defined in such a way are products of our perceptions .
" Seeing is believing " will be the retort , and , after all , are n't we seeing reality in those regional differences ?
Until Copernicus challenged the notion , common sense said the sun revolved around the Earth .
Should we be challenging our common - sense notion of " race " ?
I should point out that this is the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago .
To this day , few have actually made the observations and done the calculations that led those Renaissance scholars to challenge the universal perception that the sun sets in the evening to rise again at the dawn .
It was just a matter of common sense to believe that the sun revolves around the Earth , just as it was common sense to " know " that the Earth was flat .
Our beliefs concerning " race " are based on the same sort of common sense , and they are just as basically wrong .
The nature of human variation I would suggest that there are very few who , of their own experience , have actually perceived at first hand the nature of human variation .
What we know of the characteristics of the various regions of the world we have largely gained vicariously and in misleadingly spotty fashion .
Pictures and the television camera tell us that the people of Oslo in Norway , Cairo in Egypt , and Nairobi in Kenya look very different .
And when we actually meet natives of those separate places , which can indeed happen , we can see representations of those differences at first hand .
But if one were to walk up beside the Nile from Cairo , across the Tropic of Cancer to Khartoum in the Sudan and on to Nairobi , there would be no visible boundary between one people and another .
The same thing would be true if one were to walk north from Cairo , through the Caucasus , and on up into Russia , eventually swinging west across the northern end of the Baltic Sea to Scandinavia .
The people at any adjacent stops along the way look like one another more than they look like anyone else since , after all , they are related to one another .
As a rule , the boy marries the girl next door throughout the whole world , but next door goes on without stop from one region to another .
While in skin color Europeans and Chinese are closer to each other than either is to Africans , the distribution of blood groups indicates that Europeans and Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese .
We realize that in the extremes of our transit — Moscow to Nairobi , perhaps — there is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we euphemistically call white to black , and that this is related to the latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of sunlight .
What we do not see , however , is the myriad other traits that are distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet radiation .
Where skin color is concerned , all the northern populations of the Old World are lighter than the long - term inhabitants near the equator .
Although Europeans and Chinese are obviously different , in skin color they are closer to each other than either is to equatorial Africans .
But if we test the distribution of the widely known ABO blood - group system , then Europeans and Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese .
Then if we take that scourge sickle - cell anemia , so often thought of as an African disease , we discover that , while it does reach high frequencies in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa , it did not originate there .
Its distribution includes southern Italy , the eastern Mediterranean , parts of the Middle East , and over into India .
In fact , it represents a kind of adaptation that aids survival in the face of a particular kind of malaria , and wherever that malaria is a prominent threat , sickle - cell anemia tends to occur in higher frequencies .
It would appear that the gene that controls that trait was introduced to sub-Saharan Africa by traders from those parts of the Middle East where it had arisen in conjunction with the conditions created by the early development of agriculture .
Every time we plot the distribution of a trait possessing a survival value that is greater under some circumstances than under others , it will have a different pattern of geographical variation , and no two such patterns will coincide .
Nose form , tooth size , relative arm and leg length , and a whole series of other traits are distributed each in accordance with its particular controlling selective force .
The gradient of the distribution of each is called a " cline " and those clines are completely independent of one another .
This is what lies behind the aphorism , " There are no races , there are only clines . "
Yes , we can recognize people from a given area .
What we are seeing , however , is a pattern of features derived from common ancestry in the area in question , and these are largely without different survival value .
To the extent that the people in a given region look more like one another than they look like people from other regions , this can be regarded as " family resemblance writ large .
"
And as we have seen , each region grades without break into the one next door .
America has a leading role in generating and perpetuating the concept of " race , " Brace says .
There is nothing wrong with using geographic labels to designate people .
Major continental terms are just fine , and sub-regional refinements such as Western European , Eastern African , Southeast Asian , and so forth carry no unintentional baggage .
In contrast , terms such as " Negroid , " " Caucasoid , " and " Mongoloid " create more problems than they solve .
Those very terms reflect a mix of narrow regional , specific ethnic , and descriptive physical components with an assumption that such separate dimensions have some kind of common tie .
Biologically , such terms are worse than useless .
Their continued use , then , is in social situations where people think they have some meaning .
America and the race concept
The role played by America is particularly important in generating and perpetuating the concept of " race . "
The human inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere largely derive from three very separate regions of the world — Northeast Asia , Northwest Europe , and Western Africa — and none of them has been in the New World long enough to have been shaped by their experiences in the manner of those long - term residents in the various separate regions of the Old World .
It was the American experience of those three separate population components facing one another on a daily basis under conditions of manifest and enforced inequality that created the concept in the first place and endowed it with the assumption that those perceived " races " had very different sets of capabilities .
Those thoughts are very influential and have become enshrined in laws and regulations .
This is why I can conclude that , while the word " race " has no coherent biological meaning , its continued grip on the public mind is in fact a manifestation of the power of the historical continuity of the American social structure , which is assumed by all to be essentially " correct . "
Finally , because of America 's enormous influence on the international scene , ideas generated by the idiosyncrasies of American history have gained currency in ways that transcend American intent or control .
One of those ideas is the concept of " race , " which we have exported to the rest of the world without any realization that this is what we were doing .
The adoption of the biologically indefensible American concept of " race " by an admiring world has to be the ultimate manifestation of political correctness .

Sainsbury 's is to become the first of the Big Four supermarkets to end the sale of eggs from battery hens .
In a significant victory for poultry campaigners , Britain 's third largest grocery chain will sell only eggs from uncaged birds from 5 February – three years before an EU - wide ban on battery cages comes into force .
Sainsbury 's had been planning to phase out the sale of eggs from caged birds next year , but brought its decision forward to mark itself out from Asda , Tesco and Morrisons .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rowen West - Henzell , of Compassion in World Farming , said : " We are over the moon that Sainsbury 's has gone cage - free almost a year ahead of schedule .
The scale of this move is breathtaking . "
The move – which comes two weeks before Channel 4 updates viewers on Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall 's " Chicken Out " campaign to improve poultry welfare – will remove 500,000 birds a week from cages .
In the show , on 26 January , the River Cottage chef will disclose that sales of " higher welfare " meat chickens , including RSPCA , free - range and organic birds , have trebled from five to 15 per cent since he began his campaign in January 2008 .
Separately , statistics released to The Independent by the market researchers TNS show that sales of free - range chickens rose throughout 2008 despite concerns that shoppers would ditch animal welfare during the financial downturn .
Several smaller supermarket chains such as Waitrose , Marks & Spencer and the Co-op have already removed eggs from caged birds from sale , but , with 16 per cent of the market , Sainsbury 's has a bigger share than all of them combined .
Sainsbury 's has also set a target to stop using caged eggs as an ingredient in its food and drink by 2012 .
Its " Taste the Difference " and " Kids " ranges already use only free - range eggs .
It was one of several retailers commended in Compassion in World Farming 's first " good egg " awards on Monday .
The group named companies making " significant progress " in improving welfare standards of hens .
It also commended McDonald's , Starbucks , Marks & Spencer , Waitrose , Pret A Manger , JD Wetherspoon , The Eden Project in Cornwall and the catering at Microsoft UK and Google .
In his show , Fearnley - Whittingstall will show how the resolution he tabled at Tesco 's AGM to improve its record on poultry farming won the support of small shareholders but was rejected by City institutions .
Nonetheless , he said he was still pleased by the success of his campaign .
He said yesterday : " We 've effectively tripled the uptake of higher welfare chicken .
But , if you look at it , 85 per cent of British chicken is still intensively farmed .
" We do n't want to stop there .
So our new programme is n't just an update , it 's about taking the Chicken Out fight to another level .
It 's basically about taking on Britain 's biggest retailer , Tesco , and trying to get it to change . "
Fearnley - Whittingstall claimed that some top restaurant chefs secretly used intensively - farmed chickens .
" I 'm not going to give any names , but I know some chefs do n't use free - range chicken , " he said .
" The sort of arrogance about it is that they think they 're better than their ingredients .
The sign of a great chef is to recognise that you 're never better than your ingredients , and that if your ingredients are really good , you do n't have to do a great deal to make the food great . "
As a result of the EU legislation on battery cages , poultry farmers will be required to build larger " enriched " cages which give hens more space to move about .
Sainsbury 's will not be selling eggs from birds kept in these enriched cages .
Tesco and Asda , which have 48 per cent of UK grocery sales , both sell eggs from caged birds , while Morrisons is phasing out the sale of eggs from caged birds in its own label but still stocks another brand selling them .
Its ' Marking and Feedback Policy ' reads : ' Marking should be in a different colour or medium from the pupil 's writing but should not dominate .
For this reason , red ink is inappropriate . '
Shirley Clarke , an associate of the Institute of Education , said : " Banning red ink is a reaction to years of children having nothing but red over their work and feeling demoralised .
The classical natural wonders are huge and hard to miss – vast canyons , giant mountains and the like .
Many of the most fantastic natural phenomena , however , are also least easy to spot .
Some are incredibly rare while others are located in hard - to - reach parts of the planet .
From moving rocks to mammatus clouds and red tides to fire rainbows , here are seven of the most spectacular phenomenal wonders of the natural world .
1 ) Sailing Stones
The mysterious moving stones of the packed - mud desert of Death Valley have been a center of scientific controversy for decades .
Rocks weighing up to hundreds of pounds have been known to move up to hundreds of yards at a time .
Some scientists have proposed that a combination of strong winds and surface ice account for these movements .
However , this theory does not explain evidence of different rocks starting side by side and moving at different rates and in disparate directions .
Moreover , the physics calculations do not fully support this theory as wind speeds of hundreds of miles per hour would be needed to move some of the stones .
2 ) Columnar Basalt
( Images via : Centripetalnotion , Habitas and Strahlen )
When a thick lava flow cools it contracts vertically but cracks perpendicular to its directional flow with remarkable geometric regularity – in most cases forming a regular grid of remarkable hexagonal extrusions that almost appear to be made by man .
One of the most famous such examples is the Giant ’s Causeway on the coast of Ireland ( shown above ) though the largest and most widely recognized would be Devil ’s Tower in Wyoming .
Basalt also forms different but equally fascinating ways when eruptions are exposed to air or water .
3 ) Blue Holes
( Images via : AEAdvisor , BelizeDiving and ScienceRay )
Blue holes are giant and sudden drops in underwater elevation that get their name from the dark and foreboding blue tone they exhibit when viewed from above in relationship to surrounding waters .
They can be hundreds of feet deep and while divers are able to explore some of them they are largely devoid of oxygen that would support sea life due to poor water circulation – leaving them eerily empty .
Some blue holes , however , contain ancient fossil remains that have been discovered , preserved in their depths .
4 ) Red Tides
( Images via : Carleton , CleanWaterNetwork and UMN )
Red tides are also known as algal blooms – sudden influxes of massive amounts of colored single - cell algae that can convert entire areas of an ocean or beach into a blood red color .
While some of these can be relatively harmless , others can be harbingers of deadly toxins that cause the deaths of fish , birds and marine mammals .
In some cases , even humans have been harmed by red tides though no human exposure are known to have been fatal .
While they can be fatal , the constituent phytoplankton in ride tides are not harmful in small numbers .
5 ) Ice Circles
( Images via Panoramio , CrystalLinks , CropCircleAnswers and DailyMail )
While many see these apparently perfect ice circles as worthy of conspiracy theorizing , scientists generally accept that they are formed by eddies in the water that spin a sizable piece of ice in a circular motion .
As a result of this rotation , other pieces of ice and flotsam wear relatively evenly at the edges of the ice until it slowly forms into an essentially ideal circle .
Ice circles have been seen with diameters of over 500 feet and can also at times be found in clusters and groups at different sizes as shown above .
6 ) Mammatus Clouds
( Images via : John Olson and the DNR )
True to their ominous appearance , mammatus clouds are often harbingers of a coming storm or other extreme weather system .
Typically composed primarily of ice , they can extend for hundreds of miles in each direction and individual formations can remain visibly static for ten to fifteen minutes at a time .
While they may appear foreboding they are merely the messengers – appearing around , before or even after severe weather .
7 ) Fire Rainbows
A circumhorizontal fire rainbow arc occurs at a rare confluence of right time and right place for the sun and certain clouds .
Crystals within the clouds refract light into the various visible waves of the spectrum but only if they are arrayed correctly relative to the ground below .
Due to the rarity with which all of these events happen in conjunction with one another , there are relatively few remarkable photos of this phenomena .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Iran poses a significant threat to the long - term stability of Iraq and continues to support violent Shi’ite militias opposed to the Baghdad government , the Pentagon said on Tuesday .
“ Despite persistent promises to the contrary , Iranian behavior continues to reflect a fundamental desire to oppose the development of a fully secure and stable Iraq , ” the U.S. Defense Department said in its latest report to Congress on progress in Iraq .
The strongly worded 68 - page report said Iran continues to host , train , fund , arm and direct militant groups intent on destabilizing Iraq and warned that Tehran would try to use Iraq ’s provincial elections on January 31 to expand its influence through pro-Iranian candidates and parties .
“ Countering malign influence and balancing soft Iranian influence remain priorities to stabilize Iraq and ensure the sovereignty of its people , ” the Pentagon said in the quarterly report , titled : “ Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq . ”
It reiterated charges by U.S. military officials that Iran had tried to derail a status of forces agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain in Iraq .
The pact was ratified by Iraq ’s presidency council in December .
The Pentagon released the report on the same day that President - elect Barack Obama ’s pick for secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , told the Senate that the Obama administration would take no options off the table in dealing with Iran .
The presence of 142,000 U.S. troops in Iraq has long been a source of tension with neighboring Iran , which Washington separately accuses of seeking nuclear arms in the guise of a civilian energy program .
Iran denies that allegation .
President George W. Bush and top U.S. defense and military officials have also charged Shi’ite - dominated Iran with supplying roadside bombs capable of penetrating U.S. armor to Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
Tehran also denies that accusation and blames lingering violence on the U.S. troop presence .
CIVILIAN DEATHS DOWN SHARPLY
Both U.S. and Iraqi officials have said recently that Iran appeared to be making a conscious effort to restrain Iraqi Shi’ites from carrying out attacks on U.S. and Iraqi forces .
The new report , which focuses on developments in Iraq from September through November 2008 , said incidents involving the munitions known as explosively formed penetrators , or EFPs , have fallen to the lowest rate since early 2006 over the past few months .
The report said civilian deaths in Iraq were down 63 percent from a year earlier but noted an increase in assassinations , including al Qaeda attacks on Sunni leaders in Anbar province .
It also warned that progress could be halted or even reversed by the mishandling of challenges including upcoming elections , the transition of former Sunni militants to permanent employment , internal boundary disputes and the settlement of people displaced by years of warfare .
“ The lack of essential services has now replaced security as the most important concern in the minds of most Iraqis , many of whom are not satisfied with the quality or availability of food , clean water , electricity , sewage services and health care , ” the document said .
It 's Davos but not as we know it
By Tim Weber
Business editor , BBC News website , in Davos
Fewer attendees are arriving by helicopter this year .
Davos is still Davos , but not as we know it .
The schmoozefest has turned into a gloomfest .
There is that word again : gloom .
You may accuse me of overusing it during the past two days .
Problem is , nearly all the business leaders and politicians here are using the word - or variations of it - as well .
Again and again .
No wonder the swagger of bankers and hedge fund managers is gone .
In fact , it is difficult to find bankers here .
Most of Wall Street 's top bosses have decided to stay in New York in their offices .
The people that have come to Davos fall into two categories : they are either humbled or deeply concerned .
There has n't been a session that did n't have a downbeat tone about it .
And with old certainties gone - for example the assumption that free markets can fix everything - the discussions at times seem to be without direction .
Loss of trust is at fairly disastrous levels , we are told
Follow Tim Weber on Twitter
The most depressing session of the day was also one of the most oversubscribed events in Davos history ( with the obvious exception of the lunch with Angelina Jolie ) .
A working dinner looking at why investment bank Lehman Brothers failed and how bad the financial crisis really is , was booked out within minutes , and had a waiting list of more than 150 people .
It was a fascinating evening , intellectually stimulating , but after the first two apocalyptic assessments of the extent of the crisis I wondered whether the organisers would be handing out razor blades at the exit .
Keeping up appearances Davos has always been about keeping up appearances .
But the style has changed .
Davos has been a more subdued affair this time around .
A couple of years ago , venture capital bosses did not think twice about impressing their guests with expensive vintage wines .
This year , showing off is ever so politically incorrect .
One chief executive mused that while " out of principle " he would n't use a helicopter to fly from Zurich airport to Davos , now it would n't play well with his shareholders either .
Little wonder that the party spirit has disappeared .
There are still receptions , but they are fewer , more private and much more subdued affairs .
Local papers claim that spending on parties has dropped 30 % .
A dearth of celebrities Finally , the celebrity count has fallen to nearly zero .
There is no Angelina Jolie , no Brad Pitt , no Sharon Stone or Richard Gere or Michael Douglas or Emma Thompson .
Only Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan and Chinese martial arts movie star Jet Li provide some glamour .
Even Bono is giving it a miss .
The rockstar is a Davos regular , using the World Economic Forum to push his campaign against poverty in developing countries .
This year , however , he decided to stay in his recording studio .
He probably realised that even he would find it difficult to be heard .
Because this year only one topic dominates all discussions : the economic crisis .
Depressingly , this very crisis will probably hit poor countries particularly hard should trade barriers rise and foreign direct investment fall ( except the poorest nations , whose capital markets are not integrated globally ) .
Even the political stars here have lost some of their shine .
Half a year ago , both China 's Premier Wen Jiabao and Russia 's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were rulers of economic powerhouses .
The dramatic fall in demand for Chinese goods and the collapse in the oil price have put an end to that .
Irrational despair ?
From time to time , there is resistance .
There are companies that do well , and their bosses are not too reluctant to say so .
Some participants try to spot some good news , but usually fail .
And a few arch capitalists also keep trying to raise the free market banner .
Only a few industries are at fault in this crisis , insists the boss of a global law firm .
Despite all their flaws , capitalism and entrepreneurialism are still the best methods to create wealth and lift people out of poverty , say a private equity manager and the boss of a sprawling European holding company .
But the Davos herd is moving in a different direction , and bullish bosses are pilloried by their peers .
To quote one of the participants : the irrational exuberance of past years has been replaced by irrational despair .

The coal ash pond that ruptured and sent a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of East Tennessee last month was only one of more than 1,300 similar dumps across the United States — most of them unregulated and unmonitored — that contain billions more gallons of fly ash and other byproducts of burning coal .
Like the one in Tennessee , most of these dumps , which reach up to 1,500 acres , contain heavy metals like arsenic , lead , mercury and selenium , which are considered by the Environmental Protection Agency to be a threat to water supplies and human health .
Yet they are not subject to any federal regulation , which experts say could have prevented the spill , and there is little monitoring of their effects on the surrounding environment .
In fact , coal ash is used throughout the country for construction fill , mine reclamation and other “ beneficial uses . ”
In 2007 , according to a coal industry estimate , 50 tons of fly ash even went to agricultural uses , like improving soil ’s ability to hold water , despite a 1999 E.P.A. warning about high levels of arsenic .
The industry has promoted the reuse of coal combustion products because of the growing amount of them being produced each year — 131 million tons in 2007 , up from less than 90 million tons in 1990 .
The amount of coal ash has ballooned in part because of increased demand for electricity , but more because air pollution controls have improved .
Contaminants and waste products that once spewed through the coal plants ’ smokestacks are increasingly captured in the form of solid waste , held in huge piles in 46 states , near cities like Pittsburgh , St. Louis and Tampa , Fla. , and on the shores of Lake Erie , Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River .
Finding a beautiful and simple equation for something in the natural world is fascinating to me – it ’s like picking at a corner of loose wallpaper in your room and suddenly seeing the scrolling green text of the Matrix on the wall behind it .
Often these relations lead to a deeper understanding , but sometimes an indisputably true and simple relation will remain maddeningly confounding .
In 1981 Yoshio Koide was researching leptons , a family of fundamental particles that includes the familiar electron .
There are three leptons which are “ charge carriers ” ( they have mass ) – the electron , the muon , and the tauon .
Koide was wondering if there was a way to relate the masses of these three particles with one another .
He developed the following equation ( related to the eigenvectors of the democratic matrix , here ’s a review paper if you want more detail ) :
Nothing too wild mathematically here .
If we assume our three lepton masses are positive ( pretty reasonable ) then the value of Q can range from 1/3 ( all the masses are the same ) to 1 ( the masses vary wildly from each other ) .
So what is the value of Q ?
Well , when Koide first proposed this equation , the masses of the leptons were thought to be as follows :
Electron : 0.511 MeV/c 2
Muon : 105.658 MeV/c 2
Tauon : 1,784.2 MeV /c2
If we plug these values into Koide ’s equation , we get a value of 0.667074 – incredibly close to 2/3 , which would be precisely halfway between our upper ( 1 ) and lower ( 1/3 ) bounds we figured out before !
This seems like a ridiculous coincidence .
Things like this make you wonder … well , is it exactly 2/3 ?
Or is it just “ kind of ” close ?
The mass of the electron and the muon had been measured to a rather high level of accuracy , but the accuracy of the tauon measurements had been lagging behind due to the higher energies required .
Perhaps the measurement of the tauon was wrong !
It ’s a hell of a hunch – but let ’s go with it .
Assume that the tauon mass has been measured incorrectly , we can set Q = 2/3 , input the masses of the electron and muon , and see what the tauon mass “ should ” be .
It turns out that Koide ’s equation says the mass of the tauon “ should ” be 1777 MeV / c2 .
Well that ’s wonderful , but nature does n’t seem to care how you think it “ should ” behave .
The only test was to wait for more accurate measurements of the tauon mass and see if this was a neat coincidence based on measurement error or whether there may be something more interesting going on .
The mass of the tauon was later revised with better measurements , and … drumroll …
Old Measurement Koide ’s Prediction New Measurement 1,784.2 MeV /c2 1,777 MeV /c2 1,776.9 MeV /c2
Whoa .
Our simple little equation , using nothing more than grade school arithmetic , has accurately predicted the mass of a fundamental physical particle years in advance of having this measurement confirmed by the best research labs on earth .
And now the question becomes why – why does this work at all ?
We have three seemingly random lepton masses , measurements of the most complicated physical system we know – our universe .
We then input them into a ridiculously simple equation , and the most ridiculously simple answer pops out .
We can gain a tiny bit of insight by figuring out what exactly this equation is telling us .
Basically , we can calculate Q for a given set of three lepton masses .
This Q will tell us where a three - dimensional vector specified by the square roots of our three lepton masses will end up .
Q = 1/3
The set of all vectors that form an angle of zero with the unit vector ( multiples of the unit vector ) .
Q = 2/3
The cone seen above which fits perfectly into the “ corner ” created by our three axes .
The set of all vectors that form an angle of pi/4 with the unit vector .
Q = 1
The set of vectors that form an angle of zero with our basis vectors .
These vectors lie along one of our three axes .
So it appears that our lepton masses have been chosen in some magical manner as to fall perfectly in the middle of these two extremes .
The concept appeals to our perception of the universe as a finely tuned apparatus , but gets us nowhere closer to an interpretation based in physical reality .
It ’s a maddening equation .
Beautiful .
Simple .
True .
And no one knows what the hell to do with it .
Chomsky : Humanity 's survival ' by no means a sure thing ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

Print This Email This Catholics :
What are you giving up for Lent ?
Here 's a unique suggestion : instead of dropping chocolate , red meat , alcohol or any other frivolous comfort , why not think about how to eliminate global hegemony ?
Yes , that " hegemony , " defined by Merriam - Webster as " the social , cultural , ideological , or economic influence exerted by a dominant group . "
" How should Americans , as a whole , consider the season of Lent ? " asked blogger Dandelion Salad .
" Using Noam Chomsky as a lens , it would be good to start with our misuse of the planet , our militarization of space , and ultimately our irrational commitment to global hegemony ...
All of which threaten our own survival and the future lives of our grandchildren . "
To the uninitiated , Lent is a 40 - day period leading up to Easter Sunday during which adherents to Catholicism give up something important to themselves .
The action of sacrifice is symbolic of a Biblical tale in which Jesus -- revered as the savior of mankind by Christians -- wanders the desert , fending off the devil 's temptations .
Speaking from his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , author , scholar and philosopher Noam Chomsky offers a glimpse at what the greatest threats to human survival are today , in the context of his 2003 book , ' Hegemony or Survival : America 's Quest for Global Dominance . '
Chomsky 's full comments are carried in the video below .
" What I mean by that is pretty straightforward , " said Chomsky .
" Survival is a word we all understand .
I 'd like to know whether there 's going to be a world -- a decent world -- where , say , my grandchildren can live .
That 's the question of survival .
" The survival of the human species is by no means an obvious thing .
There are very severe threats to survival .
We learn about them all the time .
The threat of environmental destruction is much too real to put to the side .
The threat of destruction by weapons of mass destruction -- that has come very close many times .
We just learned at the time of the Cuban missile crisis , a terminal nuclear war was averted by one word by one submarine commander who countermanded the order to send off nuclear missiles .
" ... So , survival of the species is by no means a sure thing .
Decent survival .
Well , what 's hegemony ?
Hegemony has to do with the domination of the International system by small sectors of power .
At the moment there happens to be one superpower , but it does not dominate the rest of the world in all dimensions , but overwhelmingly dominates it in one dimension : Namely , the military dimension . "
" Unfortunately , if you look at the factors that surround hegemony , the short term goals to maximize profit , to increase control of the world and so on , and ask how those goals will play out , turns out they do threaten survival , " said Chomsky .
" And , it 's a deep problem because the decisions are not irrational within the framework of the institutions in which they 're being taken , " he continued .
" But , they may be utterly irrational as compared to the likelihood that my grandchildren will have a world to live in . "
" Across the board , the choice of hegemony or survival is one that we must face if we care about our grandchildren , " he concludes .

In summarizing from John Wilburn ’s notes , I mixed Defense attorney Korslund ’s questions with Det.
Mienhart ’s answers , or lack of answer .
This was my error , not John’s .
As I now understand it , Korslund asked the Detective if certain information about marijuana cultivation was correct , but the Prosecution objected to his answering as he had not been established as an expert on the subject ( though no doubt , he is . )
Neither John nor I intended to mislead anyone , this was simply a miscommunication between us .
I would also assert that is is a distinction without a difference .
This blog is not being entered into evidence in court , and our “ rules of evidence ” are far simpler than the courts , being simply , “ is it factually correct ? ”
I am happily ignorant of all facets of drug use , but perhaps we have experts available to us sufficient for our discussion .
Is it correct that a plant produces 8 - 12 ounces of smoking material ?
How much would someone use over the maturation period of the plants to maintain a continuous personal supply for himself and perhaps his close associates ?
Most importantly , would two hydroponics units be sufficient to supply Frederick ’s own use and leave an excess adequate for an ongoing commercial operation ?
If not , the distribution charge is bogus , which is the point of that line of questioning .
Have we an expert who can answer those questions ?
But even that question only relates the charge of distribution .
It remains quite possible that even if he were selling some trivial amount of marijuana at some past time , that he believed it was the burglars returning to do him harm who were breaking down his door .
Self defense would still apply .
Of a larger interest , from a Libertarian standpoint , whether Frederick is guilty or not on any or all charges , is whether the conduct of the Chesapeake police was consistent with our Constitution and our theory of government .
I would assert that it was not , that Chesapeake has gone beyond merely shredding the Bill of Rights but is actively taking away our rights under the Magna Carta .

OUR own Grep
Ip had a very interesting op - ed recently on the possibility that America might default on its debt .
He noted that the credit derivatives market ( American sovereign CDS traded at 82 basis points last Friday ) , now peg the probability of default at about 6 % .
That 's amazing — last summer I found it incredible that CDS traded at 24 basis points .
The rising CDS spreads are the result of speculation that spreads will rise even further , rather than the belief America will actually default .
But even still , it suggests that markets are at the very least considering the possibility of a debt downgrade .
Mr Ip believes the government will sooner try and inflate down the debt than default , which is probably true .
But he reckons that in the unlikely event America must choose between hyperinflation and default , the unthinkable could occur .
In November , I imagined a scenario in which default could happen for political reasons , but that currently seems equally far fetched .
But could it be the case that American default is simply inevitable ?
As Mr Ip points out , the government must address its looming entitlement crisis .
A solution there will involve either increased taxes or reduced benefits ( and will probably some combination of the two ) , which is really just another form of default .
Social Security is a pay - as - you - go system which means that there exists a social contract that current contributors will receive a particular annuity ( based on wage and price inflation ) .
Altering the benefit formula violates that contract , because the government will no longer pay what it promised cohorts when they paid into the system .
Still , a Social Security “ default ” or restructuring is probably the best alternative .
Markets do not like surprises and most American put the probability of a change to entitlements near unity .
Update : Felix Salmon directed me to an earlier discussion on Social Security " default "
It was n't always the case that people believed in continental drift , German geologist and meteorologist Alfred Wegener 's ( 1 ) theory that parts of the Earth 's crust slowly drift atop a liquid core .
He believed 200 million years ago there was once a gigantic supercontinent which he called Pangaea ( " All - earth " ) which slowly moved apart .
Wegener ’s theory of continental drift became commonly accepted when the driving forces for continental drift were discovered during the 50s and 60s :
The enormous heat in the Earth ’s core and Earth ’s mantle generates the flow of rocks within the Earth ’s mantle , a process similar to the movement of warm water in a cooking pot .
This heat - driven mass transport by convection leads not only to plate movement on the Earth ’s surface but also to drifting of the continents floating on the plates .
Visit enchantedlearning.com
A new hypothesis says drifting of the large tectonic plates and the superimposed continents is not only powered by the heat - driven convection processes in the Earth ’s mantle , but rather retroacts on this internal driving processes .
In doing so , the continents function as a ' thermal blanket ' , which leads to an accumulation of heat underneath , and which in turn can cause the break - up of the super - continents .
To date there had been no realistic mathematical–physical theory describing the interaction between the convective movement in the Earths mantle and the continental drift but V. Trubitsin , M. Kaban und M. Rothacher from the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences have now developed a numerical model ( 2 ) , based on the current position of the continents , the structures of the Earth ’s mantle obtained through geophysical measurements , and the current displacement rates on the surface .
Hence they were able to calculate the future position of the continents in hundreds of millions of years .
Distribution of the continents in 120 million years
They say that the enormous heat in the Earth ’s interior does not generally lead to a chaotic mass transport within the Earth ’s mantle .
On the contrary , the continents influence the heat distribution within the Earth ’s mantle and the associated convective mass flow .
In other words the continents act as a thermal blanket causing heat to accumulate beneath .
A self - regulating system develops , beginning and ending with a super - continent .
This super - continent breaks apart due to heat accumulation which in turn leads to a reorganoization of mantle convection with the pieces ultimately joining again to form a large super - continent .
Obviously more heat in the thermal blanket could impact that , though it is unlikely something like projected global warming would actually move mountains .
The graphic above is their projection of what the Earth will look like in 120 million years - the good news is there wo n't be any more 3 day waits to get through the Panama Canal and Europe will have even easier access to cheap labor .
The bad news is Casablanca will be in Portsmouth .

What are the options if Titans - Steelers is postponed ?
Maybe you missed it .
This week , moved from its original appointed date , the Lords held the second reading of what would be the sixth immigration act in a decade : the borders , citizenship and immigration bill .
You might well have heard of some of the proposals involved , because the government has made a song and dance about the fatuous concept of making new citizens earn their naturalisation by doing officially approved community activities .
What almost nobody has noticed , and which was not made public until the bill was printed , is that the Home Office is to be enabled to appoint a new class of officials , with powers greater than the police , who are directly under political control .
Can that be right ?
After all , did n't Jack Straw say in relation to the Damian Green affair :
We are not in a police state .
A police state would be where ministers were directing a police operation .
It has been made clear time and again – or at least whenever any embarrassing errors are made – that the home secretary does not control police forces .
HM Revenue & Customs are insulated from political intervention in the exercise of its powers by being a non-ministerial department .
It is accepted that they should not be used in pursuit of political policy .
And yet …
Part I of the new bill sets out how the home secretary may appoint an immigration officer or any other Home Office official as " a general customs officer " , without revenue collection functions , but with all the powers of one of Her Majesty 's customs officers , and ( cl 5 ) :
A general customs official must comply with the directions of the Secretary of State in the exercise of functions in relation to a general customs matter .
Customs officers have enormous powers .
They can arrest people , search and seize property on suspicion , and recently acquired the capacity to take fingerprints and DNA .
They can ( like police ) seize cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 , and demand the owner prove it was acquired lawfully .
They have surveillance powers from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , and data - acquisition and sharing powers under the Identity Cards Act 2006 , UK Borders Act 2007 , and Serious Crime Act 2007 .
They have resort to " writs of assistance " , an ancient form of arbitrary search specifically outlawed in the US constitution .
And under the Finance Act 2008 , schedule 36 , there are new information gathering powers , yet to be activated , which arguably broaden and build upon even that .
If the home secretary had openly resolved to create a new national police force – call it the national identity police – equipped with the same powers as the Dorset constabulary , say , but reporting directly to her and used for the enforcement of departmental policy there would be , if not public outrage , certainly public interest .
I doubt the existing police would be pleased to be so usurped .
But what 's being done here , ostensibly in order to create a " combined border force " , is actually more dangerous than that .
It 's a super - powered , semi- secret police , calculated partake of the renowned charm of the immigration service .
There 's no provision for general customs officials to be identified or even distinguished from other Home Office officials , nor do they appear to have any specific duties associated with their powers , except to obey the secretary of state .
We 're not living in a police state .
But by Jack Straw 's definition , we might soon be living in a general customs official state .
Regarding unemployment during the Great Depression , Andrew Wilson writing at the WSJ recently said :
As late as 1938 , after almost a decade of governmental “ pump priming , ” almost one out of five workers remained unemployed .
Historian Eric Rauchway says this is a lie , a lie spread by conservatives to besmirch the sainted FDR .
Nonsense .
In 1938 the unemployment rate was 19.1 % , i.e. almost one out of five workers was unemployed , this is from the official Bureau of Census / Bureau of Labor Statistics data series for the 1930s .
You can find the series in Historical Statistics of the United States here ( big PDF ) or here .
The graph is at right .
Rauchway knows this but wants to measure unemployment using an alternative series which shows a lower unemployment rate in 1938 ( 12.5 % ) .
Nothing wrong with that but there ’s no reason to call people who use the official series liars .
So why are there multiple series on unemployment for the 1930s ?
The reason is that the current sampling method of estimation was not developed until 1940 , thus unemployment rates prior to this time have to be estimated and this leads to some judgment calls .
The primary judgment call is what do about people on work relief .
The official series counts these people as unemployed .
Rauchway thinks that counting people on work - relief as unemployed is a right - wing plot .
If so , it is a right - wing plot that exists to this day because people who are on workfare , the modern version of work relief , are also counted as unemployed .
Now if Rauchway wants to lower all estimates of unemployment , including those under say George W. Bush , then at least that would be even - handed but lowering unemployment rates just under the Presidents you like hardly seems like fair play .
Moreover , it ’s quite reasonable to count people on work - relief as unemployed .
Notice that if we counted people on work - relief as employed then eliminating unemployment would be very easy – just require everyone on any kind of unemployment relief to lick stamps .
Of course if we made this change , politicians would immediately conspire to hide as much unemployment as possible behind the fig leaf of workfare / work - relief .
There is a second reason we may not want to count people on work - relief as employed and that is if we are interested in the effect of the New Deal on the private economy .
In other words , did the fiscal stimulus work to restore the economy and get people back to work ?
Well , we ca n’t answer that question using unemployment statistics if we count people on work - relief as employed .
Notice that this was precisely the context of the WSJ quote .
One final thing that one could do is count people on work - relief as neither employed nor unemployed , i.e. not part of the labor force which is what we do for people in the military .
Rauchway has data on this and it shows almost the same thing , nearly one in five unemployed , as the original series .
( In this case , however , Rauchway counts nearly one in five unemployed as a win for the New Deal because the same series also shows higher unemployment earlier in the Great Depression . )
Any way you slice it there is no right - wing plot to raise unemployment rates during the New Deal and a historian should not go around calling people liars just because their judgment offends his wish - conclusions .

35 dead in Australia bushfire
35 people were reportedly killed by the biggest fire in Australia for decades and the tool could still rise .
The fire burned hundreds of homes as a heat wave strikes through the farmland near Melbourne .
Police expect the death toll , already the worst since 75 people died in “ Ash Wednesday ” fires in 1983 , could climb further as they search the ruins of wild fires that flared on Saturday and continued to burn north of the city on Sunday .
According to the police , charred dead bodies were found in cars .
The said totals of 35 dead bodies were found at different locations at north and east for Melbourne .
At least 18 people were also hospitalized with burns .

Leahy Announces Hearing Next Week on Truth Commission
Created : February 25 , 2009 15:15 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Picking up on the controversial proposal he made during a Feb. 9 speech at Georgetown University , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) today reiterated his call for a “ truth commission ” on the Senate floor and said the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold a hearing next Wednesday to begin to consider the idea .
Noting both the pressures to leave the past behind on one hand , but also to prosecute Bush officials on the other , Leahy reiterated his call for a “ middle ground ” that would involve the “ formation of a commission of inquiry dedicated to finding out what happened . ”
This is “ not for the purpose of criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts , to know what happened , and to make sure mistakes are not repeated . ”
He reminded the senators that a recent Gallup poll found that more than 62 percent of Americans polled favored some sort of investigation of criminal activity by the Bush administration .
“ I ’ve seen what ’s happened before with prosecutions , ” added Leahy , clearly anticipating some objections from the left .
“ We do n’t find the whole truth , but prosecute those on the way bottom of the chain of command . ”
Noting that former Vice President Dick Cheney has continued to defend the Bush administration ’s tactics , including torture , Leahy said : “ We need an independent inquiry that ’s beyond reproach and outside of partisan politics . ”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) , spoke afterward in support of Leahy ’s proposal .
Under the previous administration , Whitehouse said , “ we saw U.S. attorneys fired for political reasons , the civil rights division run amok , we saw theories that the president can secretly ignore his own executive orders , and saw those office of legal counsel memos approving interrogation techniques long understood and long known to be torture . ”
“ If we blind ourselves to this history , we deny ourselves these lessons , ” he continued .
“ We can not set aside our responsibility to take an accounting of where we are , what was done and what must now be repaired . ”
CNN : US weapons ' killing innocent civilians ' in Gaza David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday January 2 , 2009

As Israeli warplanes continue to bomb Gaza , attention is turning to the role of American - made weapons in the deadly attacks , which have now killed over 400 and wounded 2000 , including many civilians .
CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr believes that Israel 's use of American weapons against civilians " is becoming very problematic . "
She notes , for example , that the 2000 pound bomb which killed a Hamas leader and members of his family on Thursday " is part of the billions of dollars that Israel has spent buying weapons from the United States . "
Israel 's use of American - made weapons in attacking Gaza has been a matter of offical concern for years .
In 2002 , the State Department announced it was monitoring possible violations of the Arms Export Control Act after the Israeli military used an American - made jet to drop a laser - guided bomb that killed a Hamas leader and 14 civilians in a crowded Gaza City neighborhood .
Just last September , Congress approved a $ 77 million dollar deal to sell a thousand Boeing GBU - 39 bunker - buster " smart bombs " to Israel .
The Jerusalem Post reported on Monday that these small , GPS - guided missiles have now been used on underground tunnels and launchers in Gaza .
" Precision guided bombs are only precision in that they hit the target they are aimed at , " Starr explained .
" We 're getting these civilian casualties .
These weapons are supposed to be used for a country 's self - defense .
Israel , obviously , believes this is its self - defense against Hamas , but you see these civilian casualties .
That 's not why the US sells weapons abroad -- for the killing of innocent civilians . "
" The world community only is going to stand for this for so long , " continued Starr .
" It 's this reason that you 're seeing people look for a political settlement . "
She added that Israel now intends to launch a ground campaign in Gaza to " get rid of Hamas once and for all , " but -- as the US has learned in Iraq and Afghanistan -- it is impossible to wipe out an insurgency by military force along without first getting the civilian population on your side .

Today on page 17 of the New York Times , a group of prominent liberal rabbis and other religious and cultural leaders called for a cease - fire in Gaza .
They were backed by over 2,800 American citizens .
Because they could not get their opinion presented in the major media they had to buy a full page ad .
That 's right .
Rabbis , ministers , writers who want a cease - fire are not news , but have to buy an ad .
Haaretz considered it news .
So far no U.S. media have considered it news .
Why not ?
This is a great puzzle to me .
I hope you will consider it news and will sign the ad here , send it around to all your firends , and get this ball rolling until it can't be ignored .
This is a story about Gaza but also about the way that liberal Jewish voices ( shared by many other interfaith and secular people ) are being shut out of the U.S. media .
No American rabbi has a longer or more substantial track record as a liberal on Israel / Palestine than Rabbi Michael Lerner , who convened this group and raised the money from small donations for the ad ( he started Tikkun magazine 23 years ago as a counter to Commentary and the Jewish right ) but he could not get his views into any oped pages of major newspapers despite valiant efforts since the Gaza invasion .
He did however have this in the Times of London .
The text of the ad in the NY Times can be read here .
Our press release , sent widely to the U.S. media and ignored , is below .
Rabbis and other religious , cultural and community leaders , heading an interfaith list of 2800 people , call for an immediate Cease - Fire in Gaza and an international conference to provide international pressure to facilitate a lasting and just settlement for all parties , in the New York Times , Wednesday , January 14 , 2009 .
“ We have had to buy space in the New York Times to make this call because the major national newspapers will not give room for this perspective , ” says Rabbi Michael Lerner , Editor of Tikkun magazine , who convened the group .
He is joined by Sister Joan Chittister , and Professor Cornel West , Co-chairs with Lerner of the Network of Spiritual Progressives ( NSP ) , and over 2,800 others , including Rabbi Brian Walt ( North American Chair of Rabbis for Human Rights ) , Rabbi Arthur Waskow ( chair of the Shalom Center ) , Rabbi David Shneyer ( past president of the Rabbinic organization Ohalah ) , Rabbi Mordecai Leibling and other rabbis , writers such as Ariel Dorfman , Annie Lamott , Deepak Chopra and Fritjof Capra , movie director Jonathan Demme , Richard Falk ( the UN representative on Human Rights in Palestine ) , Christian ministers , academics and activists .
“ The essential difference between our point of view , which is widespread but underreported , and the opinions being presented in the mainstream media , ” said Rabbi Lerner , “ is that we believe it is unrealistic to expect violent and hardline tactics , however well justified by the other side ’s violence , to build the psychological grounds for peace .
Each side has to learn empathy for the wounds suffered by the other side , and has to practice generosity in promoting peace , the basic conditions for which are already known and are laid out in our statement .
We are appealing to president - elect Obama to lead the international community in applying significant pressure to both sides to accept a mutually generous approach , whether each side feels that generosity yet or not .
We spell out the terms of a lasting settlement in the New York Times ad .
Given the political clout of the Israel Lobby in the U.S. , as manifested in the one - sided coverage that has made invisible Jewish opposition in Israel and the U.S. to Israel 's war in Gaza , it is unlikely that President Obama would be able to muster significant pressure on Israel to accept a settlement that would be just to the Palestinian people ( and hence would last ) .
For that reason , we are urging him to convene an International Conference in which other countries could play an important role in pushing both sides to make significant compromises for peace . "
Many years ago , after an obsessive , multi - year engagement with history and philosophy , I struggled with the following question :
Is it possible to reduce the vast range of humankind 's metaphysical responses down to a few distilled outlooks that have shaped ( and continue to shape ) human culture ?
An elementary classification has been in vogue at least since Herodotus : the East and the West , but it is clearly untenable in light of the internal diversity of both the East and the West .
Is there a better classification , I wondered , that is at once simple , non-geographic , and more comprehensive ?
I was well aware of the danger of oversimplification .
Even accomplished scholars are prone to finding seemingly profound but ultimately specious patterns in human affairs .
Still , in the summer of 2000 , amid the stacks of Stanford 's Green library , I devised a classification that has withstood my own scrutiny over time ( it can surely be fine tuned ) .
All of our metaphysical knowledge , I concluded then , is arrived at via one of these three distinct outlooks : Orthodox , Suprarational , Rational .
1 . Orthodox :
These usually involve lots of norms , observances , dogma , and rituals .
Humans have embraced such belief systems with a dismaying alacrity , preferring numbing and singular interpretations of reality to examined belief .
a .
Revealed orthodoxies :
These arise at specific moments in history , marked by the exclusive words of a god or prophet , and universal in scope .
Examples include monotheisms like Judaism , Christianity , and Islam , and the nearly extinct one of ancient Persia : Zoroastrianism .
A secular example here would be communism .
b. Traditional orthodoxies : Norms , dogma , and rituals accumulate here organically from sources such as social organization , fear / reverence of nature , and traditional myths .
There is usually no single person , deity , or central text at its core .
Examples include Brahmanism in south Asia ( i.e. , the oldest part of Hinduism with its three pillars : caste , rituals , priests ) , the Shinto in Japan , and the beliefs and practices of many ancient , pre-historic peoples .
2 . Suprarational : Inner directed mystical - spiritual traditions , such as those that have long flourished in Islam ( Sufism ) and in Hinduism ( Bhakti ) .
To its common adherents , " the physical world ... so real and absolute and unique [ to everyone else ] , seems ... one way of living among many others ; in short , a small , chaotic , agitated , and rather painful frontier on the margin of immense continents which lie behind unexplored . "
A suprarational outlook does not engender ideas like personal ambition , competition , science , or democracy .
Instead , it furthers tolerance and pacifism , often alongside a gentle , dreamy , fatalistic detachment from the world , admixed with a devotional piety and pervasive superstition .
3 . Rational : Predominantly centered on human life in this world and reliant on the powers of reasoning , initiative , and understanding .
a .
Self - asserting individualism :
This tends to heighten both the good and the evil in people , as evidenced in Classical Greece and the modern West .
On one hand , it makes possible things like science , human rights , democracy , and scholarship ; on the other hand , driven by inflated egos and competitive self - advancement , it furthers a brash and aggressive herd mentality .
People then imitate each other " in freedom " , and reason merely serves self - centered thought and action .
b.
Self - denying individualism :
Here the emphasis is on mental tranquility through self - awareness and reining in selfish desire .
It forgoes many benefits of 3 ( a ) while reducing its ills .
Never with a mass following , this has retained its appeal as a personal philosophy to many .
Examples include the Stoics of Hellenistic Greece and Rome , and the teachings of the Buddha , which , in derivative forms , survive in parts of Asia .
Note that in approaching metaphysical questions , few in the world can adopt just one outlook ; people and cultures generally exhibit an ever - changing , seemingly contradictory mix of all three .
Note : I first presented this classification in my essay On Early Islam , which also contains the larger context for it .

One the one hand , this might not be surprising news , but on the other , the implications are startling .
A supermassive black hole ( called Sagittarius A* ) lives at the centre of the Milky Way .
This is the conclusion of a 16 year observation campaign of a region right in the centre of our galaxy where 28 stars have been tracked , orbiting a common , invisible point .
Usually these stars would be obscured by the gas and dust in that region , but the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) in Chile has used its infrared telescopes to peer deep into the black hole ’s lair .
Judging by the orbital trajectories of these 28 stars , astronomers have not only been able to pinpoint the black hole ’s location , they have also deduced its mass …
It has been long recognised that supermassive black holes probably occupy the centres of most galaxies , from dwarf galaxies to thin galactic disks to large spiral galaxies ; the majority of galaxies appear to have them .
But actually seeing a black hole is no easy task ; astronomers depend on observing the effect a supermassive black hole has on the surrounding gas , dust and stars rather than seeing the object itself ( after all , by definition , a black hole is black ) .
In 1992 , astronomers using the ESO ’s 3.5 - metre New Technology Telescope in Chile turned their attentions on our very own galactic core to begin an unprecedented observation campaign .
Since 2002 , the 8.2 - metre Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) was also put to use .
16 years later , with over 50 nights of total observation time , the results are in .
By tracking individual stars orbiting a common point , ESO researchers have derived the best empirical evidence yet for the existence of a 4 million solar mass black hole .
All the stars are moving rapidly , one star even completed a full orbit within those 16 years , allowing astronomers to indirectly study the mysterious beast driving our galaxy .
“ The centre of the Galaxy is a unique laboratory where we can study the fundamental processes of strong gravity , stellar dynamics and star formation that are of great relevance to all other galactic nuclei , with a level of detail that will never be possible beyond our Galaxy , ” explains Reinhard Genzel , team leader of this research at the Max - Planck - Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching near Munich , Germany .
“ Undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our 16 - year study , is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super - massive black holes do really exist , ” Genzel continues .
“ The stellar orbits in the galactic centre show that the central mass concentration of four million solar masses must be a black hole , beyond any reasonable doubt . ”
Apart from being the most detailed study of Sagittarius A * ’s neighbourhood ( the techniques used in this study are six - times more precise than any study before it ) , the ESO astronomers also deduced the most precise measurement of the distance from the galactic centre to the Solar System ; our supermassive black hole lies a safe 27,000 light years away .
A lot of information was gleaned about the individual stars too .
“ The stars in the innermost region are in random orbits , like a swarm of bees , ” says Stefan Gillessen , first author of the paper published in The Astrophysical Journal .
“ However , further out , six of the 28 stars orbit the black hole in a disc .
In this respect the new study has also confirmed explicitly earlier work in which the disc had been found , but only in a statistical sense .
Ordered motion outside the central light - month , randomly oriented orbits inside – that ’s how the dynamics of the young stars in the Galactic Centre are best described . ”
Quite simply , the object influencing these stars must be a supermassive black hole , there is no other explanation out there .
Does this mean black holes have an even firmer standing as a cosmological “ fact ” rather than “ theory ” ?
It would appear so …

Classified ads , once the mainstay of newspaper advertising , are scarce — headed to Craigslist.com and other websites , where you can place your ad for free or for pennies .
Other key advertising categories , notably auto and real estate , have also plummeted .
Meanwhile , the price of newsprint is skyrocketing , despite declining demand .
Adding to what is essentially an advertising - driven calamity is the reality that though the U.S. population has more than doubled in the past 60 years , absolute newspaper circulation this year will be lower than in 1946 .
A younger generation wants its information online , and newspapers and magazines have obliged by , after first being too slow to embrace the Internet , giving their content away online for free .
Content for which , I might add , they charge their traditional subscribers hefty sums in print .
But even as other sites profit by aggregating and linking to their content , most newspaper websites themselves are austere , dull , and technologically backward , relying for revenue on the evaporating supply of low - cost help - wanted , real estate , and auto classifieds .
The New York Times , Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune are among those organizations that have spent many millions of dollars covering the Iraq War , with each outlet paying for multiple reporters , translators , full - time drivers , guards , bullet - proof armored cars , year - round office space , office managers , and security consultants with intelligence backgrounds to provide threat assessments .
And all of them give that work away for free online .
A friend of mine who was at dinner with a top Times executive asked why the paper had stopped walling off and requiring paid subscriptions for some of its online content .
One factor , the executive said , was that a prominent columnist had voiced chagrin about fewer people reading his work .
My friend wonders why , if the paper was giving away the columnist ’s work for free , it should n’t have had him work for free .
Perhaps he ’s got a point .
Newspaper penetration — the number of households looking at a paper — now amounts to less than 18 percent of the population , compared with 33 percent back in 1946 .
In its home market , The New York Times has a dismal 7 percent penetration .
The New York Times Company , which , like the rest of the industry , used to reap tremendous profits , is one of the many publicly traded newspaper companies that have lost well over half their market value in the past two years .
Just this past year , shareholders of publicly traded newspaper companies have lost 83 percent of their investments , according to Alan Mutter , an astute industry analyst , blogger and former newspaper city editor .
Papers are throwing out employees almost weekly , cutting national and foreign bureaus if they have them , and slicing the actual size of the product , since newsprint is a huge cost .
In some cases , entire newspapers are shutting down .
Hearst Corporation is the latest to serve as executioner , announcing the likely demise of the Seattle Post - Intelligencer if a buyer ca n’t be found .
Elsewhere on the Web :
" You Spoke , We Listened "
The Chicago Tribune responds to reader critiques of its redesign .
[ File opens as a large PDF . ] responds to reader critiques of its redesign .
[ File opens as a large PDF . ]
As the seeming death spiral accelerates , a sense of desperation has led some to flashy redesigns aimed at attracting younger consumers .
But little is working , and the diehard readers are left with a sense of getting less .
All this helps explain an extraordinary Chicago Tribune admission in its own pages that a wholesale redesign had met with significant resistance ( “ You Spoke , We Listened ” ) : reader complaints included “ too many ads , ” “ too few stories , ” “ the paper is too loud , ” “ do n’t jump stories to other sections , ” “ it ’s too hard to find things ” and “ bring back my Business section . ”
This was soon followed by the announcement that the Tribune would begin to produce a tabloid version of its traditional broadsheet for single - copy sales ( as opposed to home delivery ) , as if geometry could provide some salvation .
The universe just told me again that I can make dumb mistakes with the best of them ( note to universe : “ you do n’t have to tell me this , I already know ! ” ) .
For the sake of this post , imagine that you need to optimize some code similar to
( defun test - 0 ( y ) ( let ( ( other 2 ) ) ( doit ( lambda ( x ) (+ other x ) ) y ) ) )
where doit is something like
( defun doit ( fn arg ) ( funcall fn arg ) )
I.e. , I need to call some function using a closure that makes reference to an outer lexical variable ( other in this specific case ) .
A problem with the code above is that the closure is going to get re-allocated with every call : if I call ( doit #' test - 0 2 ) a 100,000 times , I ’ll need make space for the closure every time and I ’ll cons more than necessary and take extra time at that .
I decided that I wanted to pull the lambda form out so that I could tell the compiler more about it .
Thus I had :
( defun test - 1 - a ( y ) ( let ( ( other 2 ) ) ( let ( ( fun ( lambda ( x ) (+ other x ) ) ) ) ( doit fun y ) ) ) )
( You gentle readers probably already see the morass towards which I head … keep quiet . )
The intent of separating out the lambda this way is that I can tell Lisp that it needed allocate the closure on the heap ; i.e. , that it can go away once I leave the body of test - 1 - a ; i.e. , that it has dynamic - extent .
This would look like :
; ;; WRONG ( defun test - 1 - b ( y ) ( let ( ( other 2 ) ) ( let ( ( fun ( lambda ( x ) (+ other x ) ) ) ) ;; ;; WRONG - fun is a variable , not a function !
( declare ( dynamic - extent ( function fun ) ) ) ( doit fun y ) ) ) )
If your Lisp does n’t notice your mistake and tell you about it , then you might be like me and wonder why this optimization does n’t help .
Here is table showing the functions and the amount of time and space is takes to call them 100,000 times on misterx , my oldish OS X laptop .
milliseconds conses test -0 46 2,400,704 test -1-a 41 4,800,096 test -1-b 38 4,800,096
As you can see , the declaration does n’t do squat ( I ’m not sure yet why the space needs actually double for the test - 1 variants but that ’s not part of the sad story I ’m telling … ) .
A co-worker more clever than I pointed out that fun is n’t a function , it ’s a variable and that I ’d hopped to the wrong level of abstraction .
The variation I really wanted was
( defun test - 2 - a ( y ) ( let ( ( other 2 ) ) ( flet ( ( fn ( x ) (+ other x ) ) ) ( doit #'fn y ) ) ) ) ( defun test - 2 - b ( y ) ( let ( ( other 2 ) ) ( flet ( ( fn ( x ) (+ other x ) ) ) ( declare ( dynamic - extent ( function fn ) ) ) ( doit #'fn y ) ) ) )
I find these variants more transparent and only wish that I had n’t fallen into my initial lambda trap in the beginning .
As is often the case , once I ’d headed down door # 1 , it became hard to see my mistake until someone else ’s eyes pointed out the obvious .
Does it matter ?
Oh yes !
Here ’s the completion of the table above :
milliseconds conses test -2-a 8 2,400,096 test -2-b 4 96
Not only do we get a speed boost , we also get a big space win from the dynamic - extent declaration .
Two addenda :
A positive outcome of this muck - about is that I found and fixed a bug in bind ‘s handling of some declarations .
It ’ll get pushed out eventually .
I also noticed that SBCL ( version 1.0.20 ) catches the errant declaration and prints a warning .
As of version 8.1 , Allegro Common Lisp does not ( if you want to send reports from others Lisps , I ’ll update this post ) .
Happy New Year ; let ’s make it great one !
One year for my wife ’s birthday , I bought her a book called Ghost Towns of Northern California .
I was excited to find it , because Morgen is not an easy person to shop for .
Ask her about her favorite things , and “ decay ” will be close to the top of the list .
By this she does n’t necessarily mean antiques ; age itself is not the issue .
She likes artifacts with visible signs of the passage of time .
What do you buy for a person who likes decay ?
I figured a book on ghost towns might be just the thing — especially since many of them were close enough that we could actually visit them .
And I was right : the book was a hit .
We decided to rent a car and drive to one of these towns over a long weekend .
After perusing the book thoroughly , we chose Bodie , a day ’s drive east of San Francisco , near the Nevada border .
Bodie was said to be the largest and best - preserved ghost town in the United States , and it seemed like an ideal place to experience decay .
Body Language
Waterman S. Body ( sometimes spelled “ Bodey ” ) and his partner E. S. “ Black ” Taylor discovered gold in the area in 1859 and built a cabin nearby .
But Body froze to death the following year in a snowstorm while on his way back with supplies .
Later that year , Taylor helped to establish a mining camp , which soon took on Body ’s name .
As a frequently told story has it , the spelling was changed when a sign painter who received verbal instructions guessed incorrectly , but everyone liked the spelling “ Bodie ” better because it was less likely to be mispronounced , and the new spelling stuck .
The camp grew slowly into a small town with only 20 miners , and was moderately successful throughout the 1860s and 1870s .
But in 1878 , a huge deposit of gold and silver was found at the Bodie Mine , and news of the strike prompted a rapid influx of miners — along with gold diggers of other sorts , who hoped to profit indirectly .
Within two years , Bodie ’s population had swelled to over 10,000 , making it the second - largest city in California after San Francisco .
At its peak , Bodie had as many as 65 saloons , a popular red - light district , and gunfights in the streets on an almost daily basis .
It was a lively — if notoriously lawless — town .
A young girl whose parents were relocating the family to Bodie was overheard praying , “ Goodbye , God , I ’m going to Bodie . ”
Even as the town was thriving , decadence was its best - known feature .
Life in the Big City
Life was harsh in other ways as well .
For one thing , the climate was extremely inhospitable .
Located in the Sierra Nevada mountains at an elevation just above 8,000 feet ( 2,400 m ) , Bodie experienced nighttime temperatures below freezing on all but a few days of the year .
In the winter , temperatures as low as – 40 ° ( F/C ) were common , along with extraordinarily strong winds and deep snowdrifts .
The thin walls of typical homes provided very little insulation , and wood for heating was expensive .
Because Bodie was above the timber line , there were no trees to be found as far as the eye could see , and lumber had to be transported from a source about 32 miles ( 50 km ) away .
Bodie needed huge amounts of wood , too , as it was used to power the steam - driven mills and mining equipment , besides heating homes .
For years , wood was brought in by wagon , but in 1881 a narrow - gauge railroad was built to haul wood from Mono Mills .
Even ignoring the climate and street violence , life in Bodie was difficult for the hardiest of souls .
The mills , which ran 24 hours a day , seven days a week crushing ore , were incredibly loud , blanketing the town with constant noise and routinely deafening mill workers .
The town also lacked a sewage system , and waste from thousands of outhouses soon tainted all the groundwater in the area , leading to widespread disease .
Fools Rush Out
Within just a few years , however , the gold started to run out , and so did Bodie ’s residents .
By 1882 , the town had shrunk to fewer than 500 people , most of the buildings simply deserted .
The following year , Bodie mine stocks crashed and the town shrank even further .
A few people did stick around , however , hoping to squeeze a bit more gold from the failing mines .
Jim Cain was a local businessman who had made a small fortune transporting lumber to the town .
He bought up many of the mines , as well as the Bodie Bank .
Several years later , Cain ’s investment paid off .
In 1890 , he successfully used a new cyanide process to extract significant amounts of gold and silver from the tailings left over from years of mining .
Thanks to Cain ’s business savvy and modern technology , Bodie enjoyed a minor renaissance .
Currents of Change
But wood was becoming even more scarce , and the high cost of running the steam - powered mills was cutting into Cain ’s profits .
In 1892 , he invested in a new , unproven technology that promised to slash energy costs .
A hydroelectric plant was built on Green Creek some 13 miles ( 20 km ) away , and power lines were strung to one of Bodie ’s mills .
Long - distance transmission of electricity was in its infancy , and some still regarded it as a ridiculous idea .
Nevertheless , engineers persisted — carefully keeping the power lines straight for fear the electricity would fall out of the wires if it had to turn a corner .
The plan worked , making Bodie one of the first towns to receive electricity from a distance .
Sadly , however , a major fire just a few months earlier had wiped out most of the town ’s business district .
And although the mill , with its electric power and cyanide process , remained profitable for decades , the town itself was rapidly fading into obscurity and lifelessness .
By 1932 , Cain ’s bank was among the few businesses still open in Bodie .
In that year , a small boy playing with matches accidentally started another fire .
The town had plenty of water and firefighting equipment , but the fire hoses were clogged with debris because intake screens from the reservoirs had not been replaced when they were cleaned .
This massive fire wiped out the majority of the town ’s remaining buildings , most of which had long ago been vacated .
Cain left Bodie shortly thereafter , but he did n’t abandon it entirely : he hired a watchman to protect the town .
Even though Cain died in 1939 , the town remained guarded , and in 1962 it became a California State Historic Park .
Hold It Right There
California ’s park service maintains Bodie in what it calls a state of “ arrested decay . ”
This means that the buildings are kept just as they were found .
If a building was leaning , it was braced internally so it continued to lean at the same angle — but no farther .
Similarly , any necessary repairs are done as discreetly as possible to preserve the former appearance of the buildings .
Only about 170 buildings remain standing , five percent of the town ’s pre-1892 size .
Of these , most are kept locked to preserve the contents inside just as they were .
If you visit Bodie ( as I ’ve done several times since that first excursion ) , you can walk through the streets , gazing into windows of houses , businesses , and schools .
Many buildings give the appearance that their occupants left quite suddenly , dropping whatever they had been doing .
You ’ll see chips and cards from a poker game in progress , store shelves stocked with goods , and schoolbooks open on desks .
The effect is eerie , and makes the designation “ ghost town ” seem quite apt .
A few buildings , including the only remaining church , allow visitors inside , and a small museum houses numerous artifacts from Bodie ’s heyday .
On some days , docents offer guided tours of the Standard Mill and other delicate areas that are normally off limits to tourists .
Bodie is a wonderful place to go if you ’re fond of decay .
It ’s more than just old buildings , too .
You can feel the emotions that led to the town ’s rise and fall — hope , greed , passion , anger , desperation , sadness .
But more than anything , it is a place of great beauty .
Not striking landscapes or brilliant architecture , but the beauty of human history in progress — both then and now .

Another " History Channel " Disgrace
Reader Dennis Middlebrooks of New York writes :
The History Channel aired a program called " The Next Nostradamus " Sunday night .
The show began by claiming Nostradamus was right on target with his predictions and was " a mortal man with immortal insights into the future . "
Incredibly , the show equates astrology with astronomy and states that Nostradamus developed a method to predict the future by casting horoscopes for the entire globe !
The show also claimed that Copernicus and Galileo were astrologers and described alchemy as the " science of converting lead into gold . "
I kid you not .
No surprises here at all , sir .
That show was obviously written and edited by high school dropouts , who are ignorant of science and easily find employment with the History and the Learning channels ...
The program then highlighted NYU Political Science professor Bruce Bueno de Mesquite , whose " secret algorithm " allegedly predicts the future with 100 % accuracy and who has been used by the CIA to foretell looming disasters .
Among his predictions : unless Israel and Palestine come to an agreement within ten years , there could be dire consequences ; we are facing a severe energy crisis ; North Korea may develop nuclear weapons ;
Al Qaeda will remain a threat , as foretold by Nostradamus ( who also predicted 9/11 ! ) , and the like .
The show says that Nostradamus and the NYU Prof. are " two men with second sight separated by centuries . "
BTW , the Nostradamus predictions cited in the show are all very general and were dealt with in your book on him [ " The Mask of Nostradamus " ] - " fire in the sky , " etc .
In the paragraph above , following " Among his predictions , " we find four startling facts that Professor De Mesquite is said to have determined by using his secret " algorithm . "
Well , I think I 've uncovered that secret : read the news , state the obvious using provisionary terms , et le voilá , the History Channel will scramble to make a show about your " discovery . "
I think Prof. De Mesquite ( aptly named ! ) must have read Isaac Asimov 's " Foundation Trilogy , " in which " psycho- historian " Hari Selden used mathematical models to predict the future .
Those books were written about 60 years ago !
De Mesquite guards his " proprietary algorithm " very closely .
Surprise , surprise !
The man has hoodwinked a lot of people , apparently .
What a disgrace .
I used to respect The History Channel .
What a load of garbage it puts on now .
Do you know anything about this charlatan ?
I must say that I think reader Middlebrooks may have judged the professor far too harshly .
Remember that writers and producers will subvert any and all data in order to create the effect they want , which is to represent this man as a claimed miracle worker .
Mr. Middlebrooks admits that he only watched a small portion of the show , so he does not know what more the professor might have said .
I would hardly label him a " charlatan . "
I still have to see this show myself , so I 'll have further observations when I 've done so .
But , I continue to be astonished at the lack of talent shown by the History Channel 's writers and producers .
They 're unskilled in logic , they know nothing about researching techniques , and what shows up on TV is clear evidence that truth and reason have no part in their protocol .
Sensationalism and sponsor satisfaction is all they aim for .
Ethics , integrity , and responsibility be damned ...
WH Rejected All Advice That Torture Was Illegal
SHERWOOD ROSS ASSOCIATES
Media Consultant
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
War Crimes Report Says White House Rejected All Advice From Government Agencies That Torture Was Illegal ; Report Names 30 High Bush Officials Complicit In Torture
President Bush and his aides repeatedly ignored warnings that their torture plans were illegal from high State Department officials as well as the nation ’s top uniformed legal officers , the Judge Advocates General of the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines , a new published report states .
“ These warnings of illegality and immorality given by knowledgeable and experienced ( government ) persons were ignored by the small group of high Executive officers who were determined that America would torture and abuse its prisoners and who had the decision - making power to secretly require this to be done , ” said Lawrence Velvel , chairman of the “ Steering Committee of the Justice Robert H. Jackson Conference On Planning For The Prosecution of High Level American War Criminals . ”
Velvel is a noted reformer in the field of American legal education .
“ Far from American officials and lawyers authorizing or engaging in torture because it was lawful , they authorized and engaged in it because they wanted to ( and ) kept their actions secret from interested officials for as long as they could lest there be strong opposition to the torture and abuse they were perpetrating , ” Velvel said .
“ They deliberately ignored repeated warnings that the torture and abuse were illegal and could lead to prosecutions , and they ignored these warnings even when they came from high level civilian and military officers . ”
A preliminary Report by the Steering Committee seeking Federal prosecution of American officials “ who ordered , authorized , approved or committed war crimes , ” released January 9th , 2009 , says they are guilty of “ wholesale ” violations of statutes that include Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , the Federal War Crimes Act , the Convention Against Torture , plus numerous other violations of U.S. and international laws .
The Report said prisoners were subjected to savage beatings , sleep deprivation , slow drowning , hanging by chains , being slammed head - first into concrete walls , temperature extremes , food deprivation , burial alive in coffin - like boxes for extended periods , and even threats against their families .
Among other things , the Report charges the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , knowingly approved of at least 117 renditions to torture and that such renditions were “ personally encouraged by President George W. Bush … ”
In addition to President Bush , those named for prosecution by the Steering Committee include :
Vice President Dick Cheney and his former chief of staff and legal counsel David Addington , former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and her predecessor Colin Powell , former Attorneys - General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and his aide Alice Fisher , former deputy assistant Attorney General ; and Tim Flanigan , a deputy White House attorney .
Also named by the Steering Committee is I. Lewis ( “ Scooter ” ) Libby , former assistant to President Bush .
Libby was convicted of perjury , obstruction of justice and making false statements to Federal investigators in the Valerie Plame affair .
President Bush commuted Libby ’s 30 - month prison sentence .
Additionally , Douglas Feith , former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy ; Defense Undersecretary Stephen Cambone , General Michael Dunlavey , and Major General Geoffrey Miller , former commander of Guantanamo prison , Cuba .
CIA officials cited in the Report are former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet ; Cofer Black , head of the CIA ’s Counterterrorist Center ; James Pavitt , former CIA Deputy Director for Operations ; General Counsel Scott Muller ; Acting General Counsel John Rizzo ; David Becker ; contract officer James Mitchell , and an unidentified woman that formerly headed the CIA ’s Al Qaeda unit and also briefed President Bush .
Among the lawyers guilty of war crimes are former Assistant Attorneys General Jay Bybee and John Yoo ; Defense Department chief legal officer Jim Haynes ; Robert Delahunty , special counsel with Office of Legal Counsel , Department of Justice ; Patrick Philbin , deputy assistant Attorney General ; Steven Bradbury , head of the White House ’s Office of Legal Counsel ; Lt. Col .
Diane Beaver , a former Staff Judge at Guantanamo ; Mary Walker , General Counsel of the Air Force and Jack Goldsmith , former head of the Office of Legal Counsel , Department of Justice .
“ Torture and abuse were discussed at meetings of the so - called Principals Committee , where George Tenet presented graphic details of interrogations to a Committee which included some of Bush ’s highest associates , including Rice , Powell , Rumsfeld , Ashcroft and Cheney and , at times , John Yoo .
The above - mentioned Bush officials were involved in shaping or carrying out torture policies despite written and / or verbal warnings given by high government officials in the Pentagon , State Department , FBI , and other agencies .
Among these objectors were :
# William Howard Taft IV , the Legal Advisor to the State Department whose 40 - page memo of January 11 , 2002 warned Bush ’s claim the Geneva Conventions were not applicable to prisoners held by the U.S could subject Bush to prosecution for war crimes .
State Department lawyer David Bowker further warned “ there is no such thing ” as a person that is not covered by the Geneva Conventions .
# The Defense Department ’s own Criminal Investigative Task Force headed by Col. Brittain Mallow warned Haynes that tactics used at Guantanamo could be illegal .
His warnings were ignored by Haynes , whose position was based on statements of Yoo and Chertoff .
# FBI Director Robert Mueller barred FBI agents from participating in coercive CIA interrogations , “ a warning - fact well known to many in the Executive , ” the Steering Committee Report said .
Also , Marion Bowman , head of the FBI ’s national security law section in Washington called lawyers in Jim Haynes ’ office in the Pentagon to express his concern but said he never heard back .
# David Brant , head of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service learned about the torture and abuse at Guantanamo and took the position that “ it just ai n’t right ” and expressed his concern to Army officials in command authority over military interrogators at Guantanamo but “ they did not care , ” the Report said .
# A senior CIA intelligence analyst that visited Guantanamo in 2002 reported back that the U.S. was committing war crimes there and that one - third of the detainees had no connection to terrorism .
The report alarmed Rice ’s lawyer John Bellinger and National Security Council terrorism expert General John Gordon but their concerns were “ flatly rejected and ignored ” by Addington , Flanigan and Gonzales , as well as by Rumsfeld ’s office .
# Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora carried his concern over Guantanamo torture to Haynes and to Mary Walker , head of a Pentagon working group that was drafting a DOD memo based on Yoo ’s work that authorized torture .
Mora said what was occurring at Guantanamo was “ at a minimum cruel and unusual treatment , and , at worst , torture . ”
His warning was ignored .
“ The Judge Advocates General of the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines are the country ’s top uniformed legal officers , ” appointed to Walker ’s working group , “ were appalled at what they were seeing , and each wrote a memo of dissent to torture and abuse , ” the Steering Committee ’s Report said .
“ Their memos warned not just that what was being approved was contrary to the legal and moral training American servicemen have always received , and not just that there would be international criticism , but also that interrogators and the chain of command were being put at risk of criminal prosecutions abroad . ”
But these warnings by the nation ’s top uniformed legal officers were ignored .
“ If Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , and others are not prosecuted , ” Velvel said , “ the future could be threatened by additional examples of Executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences for their actions , including more illegal wars such as Iraq . ”
Besides Velvel , members of the Steering Committee include :
Ben Davis , a law Professor at the University of Toledo College of Law , where he teaches Public International Law and International Business Transactions .
He is the author of numerous articles on international and related domestic law .
Marjorie Cohn , a law Professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego , Calif. , and President of the National Lawyers Guild .
Chris Pyle , a Professor at Mount Holyoke College , where he teaches Constitutional law , Civil Liberties , Rights of Privacy , American Politics and American Political Thought , and is the author of many books and articles .
Elaine Scarry , the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at Harvard University , and winner of the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism .
Peter Weiss , vice president of the Center For Constitutional Rights , of New York City , which was recently involved with war crimes complaints filed in Germany and Japan against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others .
David Swanson , author , activist and founder of AfterDowningStreet.org / CensureBush.org coalition , of Charlottesville , Va .
Kristina Borjesson , an award - winning print and broadcast journalist for more than twenty years and editor of two recent books on the media .
Colleen Costello , Staff Attorney of Human Rights , USA , of Washington , D.C. , and coordinator of its efforts involving torture by the American government .
Valeria Gheorghiu , attorney for Workers ’ Rights Law Center .
Andy Worthington , a British historian and journalist and author of books dealing with human rights violations .
Initial actions considered by the Steering Committee , Velvel said , are as follows :
# Seeking prosecutions of high level officials , including George Bush , for the crimes they committed .
# Seeking disbarment of lawyers who were complicitous in facilitating torture .
# Seeking termination from faculty positions of high officials who were complicitous in torture .

The Report follows :
I. INTRODUCTION .
An extensive complaint seeking federal prosecution of American officials who ordered , authorized , approved or committed war crimes is currently being prepared .
While the complaint is in preparation , the Steering Committee of the Justice Robert H. Jackson Conference is issuing this preliminary memorandum setting forth several of the points to be presented more extensively in the complaint itself .
Such points include the acts of torture and abuse which constitute war crimes , the high level individuals of the American Government who ordered , authorized , or approved these acts plus some of the lower level officials who committed them , and the warnings of illegality and immorality given to the culpable American officials -- as news of their secret actions slowly began to percolate within the Executive branch -- by persons ranging from FBI officials on the ground , to other executive investigative personnel on the ground , to military Judge Advocates General , to general counsels of the armed services .
These warnings of illegality and immorality given by knowledgeable and experienced persons were ignored by the small group of high Executive officers who were determined that America would torture and abuse its prisoners and who had the decisionmaking power to secretly require this to be done .
We note that the information in this preliminary memorandum on criminal acts , officials who authorized them or carried them out , and warnings of criminality and illegality which were ignored , has become available in the last four years in a host of investigatory books , investigatory articles , initially secret government memoranda which have now been publicly released , internal governmental investigations , statements of present and former governmental officials and generals ( e.g. , Dick Cheney and Antonio Taguba ) , investigatory television programs , legal complaints and other legal documents , transcripts of interviews , congressional hearings and congressional reports ( such as the recent report of the Senate Armed services ’ Committees ) .
Among the books which extensively detail the matters written of here are Jane Mayer ’s The Dark Side , Philippe Sands ’
The Torture Team , Jack Goldsmith ’s The Terror Presidency ( Goldsmith is a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel ) , and Steven Wax ’s Kafka Comes To America .
II .
ACTS OF TORTURE AND ABUSE , AND THE LAWS THEY VIOLATED .
There are a large number of “ standard ” acts of torture and abuse that were committed on the order or authorization of this country ’s highest officials .
What the public generally does not realize is that these acts were not committed in isolation , one from the other .
Instead they were committed in combination , with up to ten or fifteen being perpetrated on a single detainee .
Nor were the acts isolated from each other in time .
Rather , many detainees were subjected to combinations of tortures for weeks and months in a row .
One detainee was tortured by combinations for 54 straight days without let up .
Others were tortured by combinations for several weeks in a row .
The torture of sensory deprivation by isolating a detainee in a single small room , sometimes with black - out goggles over his eyes and sound - stopping plugs for his ears , and sometimes with the prisoner being kept in a tiny slot the size of a coffin , was carried on for years with regard to some prisoners , with the prisoners also being subjected to other tortures during this period .
Though torture is illegal whether the victim is innocent or guilty , many of the prisoners upon whom torture was practiced proved to be innocent -- estimates of the innocent run up to 50 percent and higher .
The acts of torture and abuse that were regularly practiced on order or authorization of this country ’s highest officials included :
• Savage Beatings .
Prisoners were severely and regularly beaten with clubs , rifles and fists .
They were beaten to the point that bones were broken , ribs were fractured , and prisoners sometimes were killed .
It is already known that at least two prisoners , one now known to be falsely accused , were beaten to death at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan , that a third savagely beaten prisoner , Manadel al - Jamadi , died , within one hour of entering Abu Ghraib , because of beatings that fractured six ribs and then being hung by the arms , with his arms secured behind him ( not over his head ) in the so - called “ Palestinian hanging ” position .
It is Jamadi ’s corpse , packed in ice , with a grinning female American soldier named Sabrina Harman giving the thumbs up sign , that is in the infamous photograph from Abu Ghraib .
• Peroneal Strikes .
Peroneal strikes are a specific form of savage beating , consisting of blows to the soft tissue and nerves just above the knee .
The falsely accused prisoner beaten to death at Bagram had been given so many peroneal strikes that a coroner testified that his leg tissue had ‘ “ basically been pulpified . ’ ” • Sleep Deprivation .
Though the matter is not widely understood by the public , the effects of sleep deprivation are extremely serious .
In addition to becoming weary , a person ’s electrolyte balance changes , a mental haze forms , balance evaporates and the prisoner wants only one thing in the world : to be allowed to sleep .
The person becomes delusional , and it has been known since the Middle Ages that sleep deprivation produces false confessions because the prisoner will say anything to be allowed to sleep .
An American Bar Association Report has said that ‘“ It has been known since 1500 at least that deprivation of sleep is the most effective torture and certain to produce any confession desired . ’” ( Emphasis added . )
There reportedly were prisoners who were deprived of sleep for a dozen days , and other prisoners deprived of sleep for 96 hours in a row .
Still other prisoners were intermittently deprived of sleep for three months .
One prisoner , while being subjected to numerous other tortures as well , was allowed to sleep no more than a total of four hours a day for 54 straight days .
• Waterboarding .
The water torture , now called waterboarding , has been a torture since the Spanish Inquisition .
It was used by the Americans to torture Filipinos after the Spanish American War ; it was used by the Nazi Gestapo ; Japanese officers committed it upon Americans and were executed for their acts after World War II ; it was used by the French in Algiers , by Pol Pot ’s Khmer Rouge , and by Latin American dictatorships such as Chile and Argentina
It has been used on prisoners held by the Americans , sometimes at the apparently express command of George Bush .
Some of the Americans ’ prisoners have been waterboarded many times .
Waterboarding is not simulated drowning .
It is actual slow drowning .
It usually produces panic and hysteria .
A number of Americans , including Americans who did waterboarding of prisoners , underwent waterboardings themselves to see what it was like : some lasted as few as five second before they broke and none lasted more than ten or fifteen seconds .
When waterboarding prisoners , American torturers would sometimes deliberately bring them to the brink of death .
Waterboarding is so awful that , to avoid this unlawful act being seen , the CIA lied to the 9/11 Commission and to federal Judge Brinkema by falsely telling them it had no videotapes of the waterboarding of prisoners .
The CIA then further obstructed justice by destroying the tapes rather than allowing them to be seen even by officials in the three branches of the federal government .
• Hanging By The Arms .
A highly excruciating “ stress position ” torture used on many prisoners , sometimes every day for two to three months , is hanging them by their arms , often or usually on tiptoe , for up to eight hours at a stretch .
The prisoners ’ wrists and arms are shackled while they hang .
Excruciating pain arises because ankles double in size , blisters erupt , skin “ tenses , ” and shackles cut through the skin of the ankles and wrists .
In the version of hanging by the arms known as “ Palestinian hangings , ” the arms are not stretched directly above the head , but are instead stretched behind the body .
• Slamming A Prisoner ’s Head Into Concrete Walls .
In this torture a towel is wrapped around a prisoner ’s neck and is then used to propel the prisoner head first into a concrete wall .
Subsequently , instead of using a towel , the CIA used a plastic strip around the neck like a dog collar , with the strip being attached to a lead so that the torturer could have better leverage in propelling the prisoner head first into a concrete wall .
This torture was so fraught with risk of serious injury to or death of a prisoner that the CIA kept a doctor on hand at all times to guard against death or crippling injury .
The physician was , of course , violating medical ethics by assisting in the perpetration of torture .
• Additional “ Stress Positions ” And Electric Shocks .
Hanging prisoners by their arms with only their toes touching the ground , and “ Palestinian hangings , ” were only two of the “ stress positions ” used as tortures .
Prisoners were also chained to walls in a way that forced them to maintain a painful crouch .
They were chained to the floor in the same way or in a fetal position with hands and feet chained , and were kept naked and forced to defecate and urinate on themselves .
They were hung by the arms with their feet on a drum through which electric shocks were applied to their feet ; the shocks would cause the feet to “ dance ” so that the prisoners ’ full weight was on their arms , excruciatingly .
They were hung by their arms with their feet and legs in water .
• Extremes Of Hot And Cold Prisoners were subjected to extremes of hot and cold .
Cells would be kept at over 100 degrees , and then switched to freezing temperatures with air conditioners going full blast .
Cold water would repeatedly be thrown on prisoners who were being kept in frigid temperatures for up to a month .
At least one prisoner is known to have frozen to death after he was left in a freezing cell , wet and naked .
( There has been no accounting of the number of prisoners who were killed by American torture , though estimates run to several dozen .
Nor has the prisoner who froze to death ever been identified .
He just “ ‘ disappeared from the face of the earth , ’ ” and the CIA supervisor of his torture was reportedly promoted . )
• Tiny Cages , Hoods And Duct Tape , Lack Of Medical Care And Food , Torture By Continuous Strobe Lights And Continuous Noise , And Other Tortures .
Prisoners were kept in tiny slot - like cells and in small boxes that were like coffins .
They were kept hooded and with duct tape over their mouths .
Their wounds were left untreated , and they were denied medical care and pain killers .
They were denied food .
They were threatened by vicious dogs .
They were threatened with death , with being buried alive , and their families were threatened .
Their cells were flooded with continuous , never ending light , including strobe lights , and they were subjected to never - ceasing loud music .
At other times they were kept in pitch dark .
• Ghost Detainees .
Prisoners known as “ ghost detainees ” were kept “ off the books , ” so that nobody , including their families , would know they were in custody , to avoid any oversight by Congress , the courts , and the International Red Cross , and to avoid any knowledge on the part of the media or public .
Keeping prisoners “ off the books ” in this way is in itself a war crime , and was done to facilitate torture of prisoners .
• Renditions For Torture .
Infamously , prisoners were “ rendered ” to other countries for torture .
Men were kidnapped off the street , hooded , shackled , sedated by anal suppositories or syringe injections , dressed in jump suits , and flown by private Gulfstream jets ( registered to dummy corporations ) to countries such as Egypt , Syria and Uzbekistan to be tortured at the behest of the CIA
These persons were “ disappeared , ” as had occurred in Chile under Pinochet .
Torture practiced by one of the countries they were given to , Egypt , was long known to include beatings with metal rods and whips , being suspended from ceilings or door frames , electric shocks , and dousing with cold water .
The CIA was able to give questions to Egyptian torturers in the morning and get answers by the evening .
In Syria , it was known , torture included electric shocks , “ pulling out fingernails , freezing cells , forcing objects into the rectum ” and “ hyper - extending the spine ” to fracture or near fracture .
Uzbekistan has long engaged in boiling people -- they are placed in water which is raised to boiling temperature
It is not yet known how many people were kidnapped and rendered to other countries for torture , but confirmed cases range from a low of 117 to at least 150 .
Every rendition to torture was approved by the CIA ’s General Counsel , and rendition for torture excited and was personally encouraged by George W. Bush , who wanted to brag about it publicly but was unable to because some of the participating governments were fearful that their own populations might learn what they were doing .
Though the Executive has made every effort to keep renditions secret , information has leaked out .
Thus it is already known , for example , that at least seven of the persons who were rendered and tortured were innocent .
( Sometimes mistaken identity was involved , as when an innocent “ rendee ” had the same Arab name as a possible culprit ( much like two Americans might both be named George Thomas . )
Federal judges such as David Trager and T.S. Ellis , III refused to allow cases brought by innocent but tortured persons to proceed against the federal government , lest the government be forced to disclose information it desires to keep secret .
Such torture - promoting decisions may constitute war crimes in themselves under principles applied against Nazi judges and lawyers at Nuremberg in the Alstotter case .
* * * * * *
The foregoing acts , singly and in combination , violate numerous international treaties and domestic statutes .
In particular they violate Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the federal War Crimes Act , and the federal Antitorture Statute .
These laws outlaw torture , other war crimes , breaches of Common Article 3 , cruelty , infliction of serious physical or mental pain , degrading or inhumane treatment , death threats against the prisoner or his relatives , violence against prisoners or abuse of prisoners , other similar conduct , or grave breaches of Geneva Conventions rules that bar such acts .
The punishments provided for violation of the federal laws range up to life imprisonment , and execution if the tortured prisoner was killed .
These are serious penalties for serious acts , showing the seriousness with which this country has regarded torture and abuse of prisoners prior to the Bush administration .
Nor can there be any legitimate dispute that laws against torture and abuse have been violated -- wholesale .
III .
THE OFFICIALS , POLITICIANS AND LAWYERS WHO ORDERED , AUTHORIZED , OR ATTEMPTED TO FALSELY JUSTIFY AMERICAN WAR CRIMES .
The persons already known to be responsible for ordering , authorizing or carrying out the torture and abuse which constitute war crimes include government officials and politicians who ordered these actions , CIA officials who committed the actions , and lawyers ( who sometimes were also officials and / or politicians ) who carried out the bidding of the politicians and CIA by creating false , professionally incompetent memoranda claiming that acts of torture were legal .
The lawyers acted in the “ tradition ” of the lawyers and judges who were convicted at Nuremberg because they aided the commission of war crimes , or , as has been said , in the “ tradition ” of mob lawyers who invent justifications for the unlawful actions of the mob .
The government officials and politicians who are guilty of war crimes , and violations of both international law and domestic statutes , include George Bush , Dick Cheney , Alberto Gonzales , David Addington , Tim Flanigan , Lewis Libby , Condoleeza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , Douglas Feith , Stephen Cambone , John Ashcroft , Michael Chertoff , Michael Dunlavey , Geoffrey Miller , and to a lesser extent , because he sometimes tried to stop the torture in which he was complicit , Colin Powell .
Gonzales , Addington , Flanigan , Feith , Dunlavey , Libby , Ashcroft and Chertoff are lawyers as well as officials and / or politicians .
The CIA officials who are guilty of war crimes include George Tenet , Cofer Black , James Pavitt , Scott Muller and John Rizzo ( who are lawyers ) , David Becker , and a woman whose name is classified and who is therefore publicly identified only as a spiky - haired , red - headed person who , as head of the CIA ’s Al Qaeda unit , insisted on and for no apparent reason flew abroad to see the waterboarding of a prisoner .
( She also was a CIA briefer of George Bush ) .
The lawyers who are guilty of war crimes , as well as those named above , include Jay Bybee , John Yoo , Jim Haynes , Robert Delahunty , Patrick Philbin , Steven Bradbury , Diane Beaver , Mary Walker and to a somewhat lesser extent , because he at least withdrew the professionally incompetent memo of August 1 , 2002 authorizing war crimes , Jack Goldsmith .
( Goldsmith did not withdraw the torture memo because he was in disagreement with the kind of actions it approved , but because he was appalled by its professional incompetence .
He did not disagree with the recommended actions , and did not withdraw the second memo of August 1 , 2002 , which listed specifically authorized techniques of torture .
Rationalizing his action regarding the second memo , he claimed , among other things , that he did not know if the techniques -- which included waterboarding -- were torture .
Also , he authored a memo unlawfully authorizing prisoners to be removed from Iraq for interrogation in other countries , where they were tortured , and he participated extensively in authorizing illegal wiretapping . )
IV . PROCESSES BY WHICH HIGH OFFICIALS ORDERED AND AUTHORIZED TORTURE , AND KEPT THEIR ACTIONS SECRET .
The ordering of torture and abuse of prisoners was part of a larger view of Executive prerogative held by several leading actors , especially Dick Cheney and David Addington .
Both of them propounded their view since at least the 1980s .
And , when Executive officials showed compunctions about continuing to carry out those views during the administration of G.W. Bush , the very powerful Cheney would vigorously oppose such “ backsliding , ” while the large , physically imposing Addington , who was known to speak as the voice of the powerful Cheney ( his boss ) , would aggressively browbeat those who had qualms about what was being done .
The view of Executive authority imposed by Cheney and Addington , carried out by a group of powerful acolytes who were officials and / or lawyers , and approved by George W. Bush , was that the Executive was all powerful .
The Executive could break the laws of the United States , as with the FISA law and laws against torture .
The Executive could secretly and bindingly opine , through the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) of the Department of Justice , that Congress and the laws of the United States could not stop the Executive from doing whatever it wished , as was exemplified in secret OLC memos , including memos falsely authorizing torture and abuse of prisoners .
The Executive could even announce that parts of U.S. laws would be ignored , as with scores or hundreds of signing statements .
The Executive could refuse to tell Congress what it was doing and could , indeed , even hide its actions from the leaders of Congressional committees with jurisdiction over those actions .
The Executive was , in short , all powerful and Congress was merely a cipher .
As now widely recognized , this Cheney / Addington view -- signed onto by their acolytes , by George Bush , and at least partly endorsed publicly by some individuals whom George Bush has appointed to the Supreme Court -- was an attempted constitutional revolution .
It was , moreover , an attempted constitutional revolution which succeeded for several years ( at least partly because the so - called mass media went along with it ) .
With regard to torture and abuse , the unlawful ordering and authorization of war crimes proceeded on two parallel but intimately related tracks .
One was the civilian track involving the Department of Justice , the CIA and the White House .
The other was the Department of Defense track .
John
Yoo of the OLC was a major point of commonality for both tracks , because his memoranda authorizing torture formed the basis of the false , incompetent and identical legal positions of both tracks .
At all times the false legal memoranda by civilian lawyers such as Yoo and Steven Bradbury , and by military lawyers such as Diane Beaver , and Mary Walker , were kept as secret as possible .
So too the actions of torture and abuse carried out both before and after the false memos were issued .
The memos and actions were hidden not just from the public , but also from Congress and , startlingly , from many , perhaps even most , lawyers in the Executive branch who ordinarily would be expected to vet and opine on the memos and actions .
( Thus , DOD kept only a single copy of a memo from John Yoo providing it with the same unlawful advice he previously gave the CIA -- advice DOD then parroted in its own memo -- and that single copy was kept locked in the safe of the General Counsel of the Air Force , Mary Walker . )
The memos and actions were kept as secret as possible because the Executive Branch actors knew that if word of their authorizing memos and their actions ever became public , there would be a vast outcry among the public , in Congress and in the media , and at least part if not all of the attempted constitutional revolution would be jeopardized .
Such an outcry is , indeed , precisely what happened , with increasing vigor , after the secrecy began to fail and unlawful memoranda and actions began to become public .
To this day , however , it remains true that an unknown ( perhaps large ) number of the memos remain secret .
( For instance , on a related subject , memos authorizing the NSA to violate the FISA laws enacted by Congress remain secret . )
They were kept such a “ close hold ” ( in the culprits ’ own terminology ) that Addington would not even allow the NSA ’s own lawyers to see them when they asked to do so -- that is to say , the lawyers for the agency being told to violate the law were not allowed to see -- and comment on -- the memos authorizing the illegality .
But public pressure has caused some of the unlawful memoranda to be declassified and thereby become public , or has resulted in a significant amount becoming known about memos which remain classified .
So a fair amount is now known about false , professionally incompetent memos by which the Executive Branch actors sought to secretly work a constitutional revolution .
( There are persons who consider their efforts to have been treason .
The Jackson Committee presently takes no position one way or the other on this claim . )
The attempted constitutional revolution seems to have begun with a secret decision , shortly after 9/11 , that was sought by the CIA .
This decision , also sought by George Bush and signed by him on September 17 , 2001 , secretly gave the CIA power -- contrary to Congressional prohibition -- to murder or seize people all over the world .
Subsequently , in January 2002 , Dick Cheney ’s office wrote a memorandum saying that the Geneva Conventions are “ quaint ” and are inapplicable to the war .
This memo implemented views propounded by Douglas Feith , views Feith had been vigorously arguing since the 1980s .
The January 2002 memo was signed by Alberto Gonzales , then the White House Counsel , but was actually written by Cheney ’s attorney , David Addington .
On February 7 , 2002 George Bush then stated that the United States was not bound by the Geneva Conventions .
At a point contemporaneous or near in time to these events , a so - called “ War Council ” of lawyers came into existence .
This “ War Council ” consisted of David Addington , John Yoo , Jim Haynes , Alberto Gonzales , and Tim Flanigan .
These five lawyers met in secret , with their views and resulting memos , written by Yoo , being kept from other lawyers and numerous officials in the Executive Branch .
An early problem arose because members of the CIA were very worried about actions they were taking against prisoners .
From low levels to high , from on - the ground CIA perpetrators of torture to high CIA officials in Washington , there was knowledge that what the CIA was doing -- the torture and abuse of prisoners -- constituted war crimes for which CIA personnel could be prosecuted .
CIA personnel wanted a “ golden shield , ” a “ get out of jail free card , ” that would protect them against prosecutions .
It was hoped that an authorizing legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice would serve this purpose because the OLC opines on legal matters for the Executive Branch .
Thus John Yoo of the War Council and the OLC wrote two opinions on August 1 , 2002 .
One of the opinions became known as “ the torture memo . ”
It was a long document purporting to legally justify torture .
The other was a memo listing approved techniques of torture , such as the techniques listed above .
The second memo remains classified to this day , but much about what it approved has become publicly known , including that it authorized waterboarding .
Yoo ’s work had input from and was signed by the head of OLC , Jay Bybee .
For his actions as head of OLC , Bybee was rewarded with a federal appellate judgeship .
He was nominated and confirmed before any information relating to torture became public .
The first memo -- the “ torture memo ” -- has become infamous , for three reasons in particular .
One is its definition of torture as requiring the pain associated with organ failure or death , a definition that was preposterous and one that was taken , remarkably , from the entirely different context of a public health statute defining when a person must be treated .
The second particular reason for the torture memo ’s infamy was that Yoo falsely said there was no torture if the torturer ’s intent was to obtain information rather than inflict pain .
Since torturers who seek to obtain intelligence always want to gather information , and the torture is only a means to that end rather than an end in itself , no torturer could ever be guilty of torture under Yoo ’s “ principle ” because every torturer ’s primary goal is to obtain information .
Presto : John
Yoo , as if by magic , converted the worst tortures , e.g. , waterboarding , into nontorture .
The final particular reason , and the one which fully carried out the attempted constitutional putsch , was that Yoo ’s torture memo said the President , as Commander - in - Chief , could do anything at all he wants with regard to so - called national security , and Congress can do absolutely nothing to stop him .
All power is his ( and , one day , hers ) .
No power is Congress ’ .
If the President wants to torture , murder , or start wars , as Commander - in - Chief he can do it , and Congress has no say about anything .
The barbaric view of torture , and the Executive hegemony , implemented in Yoo ’s memo were stated dramatically a few years later when Yoo said publicly that if the president wanted to try to force a prisoner to talk by crushing the testicles of the prisoner ’s child , no treaty could stop this and , depending on why the president wanted to do it , neither could any congressional law stop the president from crushing the child ’s testicles .
Yoo ’s memo was secret for years , and the administration , from the president on down to soldiers and CIA officers who tortured people at Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram and in CIA “ black holes ” around the world , acted in accordance with Yoo ’s secret revolutionary principles .
When the memo became public years after
Yoo issued it , it became reviled by some of the nation ’s leading lawyers as professionally inept , even as the single most incompetent piece of legal analysis some had ever seen .
It had , as a reporter said , the veneer of legal scholarship : long , densely written paragraphs , a plethora of citations .
But the veneer was a fraud .
It ignored the cases and points contrary to -- devastating to -- its revolutionary principles , including the leading case in the field , Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer ( the famous Steel Seizure Case ) , and could provide no true authority for its secretly adopted positions .
So professionally inept was
Yoo ’s torture memo that it was later withdrawn by Bybee ’s replacement as head of OLC , Jack Goldsmith ( even though Goldsmith hated to do this because , among other reasons , he was a good friend of Yoo ’s ) .
But the second memo of August 1 , 2001 , the memo which listed the approved techniques of torture , was never withdrawn .
That OLC memo remains on the books , remains operative , remains secret even though much of what it approved ( including waterboarding ) has nonetheless become known , and continues to unlawfully seek to justify war crimes .
One of the reasons it remains on the books is that Cheney , Addington , Gonzales and CIA officials have been very worried that their exposure to war crime prosecutions would increase if it were withdrawn by OLC , and extensive pressure was exerted to compel it not to be withdrawn .
This is the same reason , we note , that Cheney and Addington have conspired with others to exert overwhelming pressure to compel Congressional enactment of laws putatively granting immunity to war criminals in American courts .
Such laws are the self - protective product of a conspiracy to manipulate the law so as to try to immunize from federal prosecution those who organized and ran a conspiracy to commit war crimes .
While the civilian torture track was taking place , a parallel torture track likewise was proceeding in the Department of Defense .
In February of 2002 , Army Reserve Major General Michael Dunlavey , an intelligence specialist who was a judge in civilian life , was appointed to be the first head of interrogation at Guantanamo , where torture and abuse were in progress .
Thereafter Dunlavey flew to Washington every week to brief Rumsfeld personally on intelligence being obtained at Guantanamo , and said in a sworn statement that ‘ “ I got my marching orders directly from the President of the United States . ” ’
Dunlavey ’s comment about where he got his marching orders cannot be considered surprising .
Although George Bush deliberately lied to the American people and media by claiming in public that the U.S. does not engage in torture , it has long been plain that he knew what was being done .
The torture and abuse were discussed at meetings of the so - called Principals Committee , where George Tenet presented graphic details of interrogations to a Committee which included some of Bush ’s highest associates , including Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell , Don Rumsfeld , John Ashcroft , and Dick Cheney .
( At times John Yoo was also at Principals Committee meetings to brief members . )
Bush knew of and approved these meetings , at which Tenet would brief the members of the Principals Committee on the specific details of the torture and abuse that were taking place .
And in September 2006 , after years of ( then still continuing ) torture , Bush publicly admitted that for years the US had been holding secret ( off the books ) prisoners at so - called “ black sites ” ( in countries like Poland , Romania and Thailand ) , and had subjected these secret prisoners to “ ‘ an alternative set of procedures , ’ ” that is , to torture and abuse .
There can thus be no doubt that George Bush knew what was occurring all the while nor can there be surprise that Dunlavey swore his marching orders , at Guantanamo , where torture was regularly practiced , came directly from Bush .
Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver , a lawyer , was also at Guantanamo .
She was commissioned to write a memorandum justifying the torture techniques being practiced there , she willingly complied , and she later was promoted to the Pentagon ’s Office of General Counsel .
( The techniques she approved at Guantanamo were part of a list drawn up there by Lt. Col. Jerald Phifer . )
Beaver placed no limits on the use of techniques , and did not address the legality of using them in combination and over time , as was the actual practice .
Her views were used as a legal basis for torturing and abusing prisoners , specifically including a prisoner who was tortured and abused for 54 straight days .
Beaver also discussed torture with several lawyers / executive officials who visited Guantanamo and personally observed tortured prisoners on September 26 , 2002 .
Those lawyers / executive officials included several of the most culpable of the executive culprits ; they included Addington , Haynes , Gonzales , Chertoff , Philbin , Rizzo , and Goldsmith , as well as a Chertoff aide named Alice Fisher .
The lawyers knew about the prisoner who was undergoing 54 straight days of torture , and wanted to know what the military was doing with regard to “ ‘ managing ’ ” him .
While Beaver was doing her work at Guantanamo , John
Yoo wrote another torture memo , this one for DOD .
The final version was dated March 14 , 2003 , but DOD had a draft at least as early as late January 2003 .
Yoo ’s memo for DOD largely parroted his torture memo of August 1 , 2002 .
It rendered Guantanamo a law - free torture zone for military interrogators , and suggested that even acts such as gouging out a prisoner ’s eyes or “ ‘ dousing him with scalding water [ or ] corrosive acid ’ ” could be lawful .
Yoo ’s memo served as the template for a memo on permissible torture being drafted by a Pentagon working group chaired by Air Force General Counsel Mary Walker .
As noted earlier , the Pentagon kept only one copy of Yoo ’s memo seeking to justify horrendous violations of law ; the copy was kept locked in Walker ’s safe .
Subsequent to Yoo ’s memos for the CIA and the DOD , torture and abuse of prisoners continued , with tortures being used in combinations and for extended periods of time on individual prisoners .
People in the CIA who were perpetrating or authorizing the tortures remained worried despite the “ golden shield , ” “ get out of jail free cards ” that had been issued by Yoo , however .
They remained worried particularly because of the effects of the use of tortures in combination , which Yoo had not covered .
They demanded new , broader attempted “ golden shields , ” golden shields that would cover combinations of tortures .
In 2005 Stephen Bradbury was appointed head of OLC on a probationary basis .
That is , he was made interim head , with promotion to the prestigious position of permanent head , a position he coveted , being dependent on performance that satisfied his political masters , Gonzales , Cheney and Addington .
Bradbury thereupon wrote legal memoranda justifying and seeking to legalize torture , including tortures undertaken in wholesale combinations .
His desire for appointment as permanent head of OLC was then realized
V. WARNINGS GIVEN THE EXECUTIVE ACTORS THAT THEIR ACTIONS WERE ILLEGAL AND MUST STOP -- WARNINGS THAT THEY DELIBERATELY ESCHEWED .
It is claimed by apologists that war criminal culprits should not be prosecuted because they thought what they were doing was lawful .
That claim simply cannot be sustained .
No person , at least no person of sufficient intelligence to have risen to a responsible level of American government , can reasonably fail to know that the imposition of torture is unlawful and that the imposition of horrible pain and fear by beatings , waterboarding , stringing people up by the arms for hours and days on end , etc. , are torture .
Indeed , it was precisely the culprits ’ knowledge that what they were doing was illegal torture which caused CIA officers to demand “ golden shields ” in order to try to escape future prosecutions by pointing to memos authorizing them to commit crimes and giving the President unfettered power to authorize crimes .
Beyond this , with the existence of unlawful torture being obvious to any sensate person , the false legal memos cannot enable the culprits to escape prosecution .
The Nuremberg principles set their face against any argument that one can be excused on the ground that he or she was merely following transparently illegal orders , as here .
There is also the important fact that , when they ultimately found out what was going on , a host of persons in the Executive Branch , including both knowledgeable and experienced lawyers as well as laymen , told the culpable actors that what they were writing or doing was illegal , could lead to prosecutions , and must stop .
But wishing to continue the torture and abuse , the culpable Executive actors deliberately ignored these warnings , and even threatened and verbally abused those who issued them , in order to try to prevent the warnings from continuing .
It is often publicly pretended by the Executive culprits and their apologists , that all the advice they received was in favor of torture .
To the contrary .
We have here a situation in which they received extensive advice -- which they deliberately chose to ignore -- that what they were doing was illegal and could lead to prosecutions .
Such advice came from knowledgeable and experienced persons including FBI agents , agents and officials of other investigative bodies , general counsels of the military services , the Judge Advocates General of the armed services , and State Department officials and lawyers .
The following were among the verbal or written warnings , and facts constituting warnings , given to the Executive culprits :
• In an extensive 40 - page memo of January 11 , 2002 , the Legal Adviser to the State Department , William Howard Taft IV , warned that the Geneva Conventions certainly did apply to the war and that Bush ’s claim that the enemy was not covered by the Conventions could subject him to prosecution for war crimes .
• Another State Department lawyer , David Bowker , warned that “ ‘ there is no such thing ’ ” as a person who is not covered by the Geneva Conventions .
• FBI agents were interrogating a prisoner named Abu Zubayda in early 2002 , were using traditional methods of questioning , not torture , and were getting excellent information .
But because George Bush wanted the “ tough guy CIA ” to take the lead , the FBI agents were replaced by a CIA team headed by a CIA contract officer named James Mitchell .
The CIA team engaged in torture , the FBI unsuccessfully tried to persuade the CIA not to do so , and Zubayda stopped talking .
Appalled by what they were seeing , and fearful that they would be implicated , the FBI agents left Guantanamo .
FBI Director Mueller then barred FBI agents from participating in coercive CIA interrogations , a warning - fact well known to many in the Executive .
• The Counterterrorist Center ( CTC ) of the CIA was headed by Cofer Black and was the terrorist - fighting operation of the CIA .
R. Scott Shumate was its chief operational psychologist from 2001 - 2003 .
He reported directly to Black .
He spoke out against the CIA ’s use of torture and abuse , and left the CIA because of this disagreement with the use of torture .
• Reserve Air Force Colonel Steve Kleinman , who had had years of experience with interrogations , was posted to Iraq in the fall of 2003 to help advise on interrogations there .
He objected to the torture and cruelty he saw there , and pointed out that interrogators were obliged to follow the Geneva Conventions .
His views were rejected by the commanding officer of his special unit and by other officers .
Torture was instead specifically approved , Kleinman was shunned , and he was physically threatened .
•
In approximately October / November 2002 an FBI agent named Jim Clemente ( who had a law degree and had been a prosecutor ) , and other FBI agents , observed horrendous torture and abuse of a prisoner at Guantanamo .
One of the agents accused the military of criminal behavior .
Clemente and colleagues urged Lt. Col .
Phifer to stop the torture , but Phifer ( who had created the Guantanamo list of torture techniques ) was “ ‘ enraged ’ ” by this advice and told the FBI personnel to “ ‘ Lead , follow , or get the fuck out of the way . ’ ”
Clemente then contacted the head of the FBI ’s national security law section in Washington , Marion Bowman , warning that actions in violation of antitorture law were being taken and could lead to prosecutions and convictions .
Bowman in turn called lawyers in Jim Haynes ’ office in DOD and expressed concern .
He never heard back from the DOD lawyers or from their boss , Haynes . •
In the late summer of 2002 , the CIA sent a senior intelligence analyst to Guantanamo to observe and report on what was going on .
( Now retired , he “ declined to be identified . ” )
In a top secret , detailed report , he estimated that one - third of the detainees had no connection to terrorism and said the United States was committing war crimes at Guantanamo
His report , “ written by a tough and highly experienced CIA analyst whose career had been spent fighting terrorists , ” alarmed Condoleezza Rice ’s lawyer , John Bellinger , and retired four star General John Gordon , a terrorism expert on the National Security Council who was also a former Deputy Director of the CIA .
But their concern , stoked by the experienced CIA analyst ’s report , was flatly rejected and ignored by Addington , Flanigan and Gonzales .
Nor was there subsequently an interest in their concern in Rumsfeld ’s office , which likewise ignored the concern and the report underlying it .
• The Criminal Investigative Task Force ( CITF ) of DOD , headed by Col. Brittain Mallow , investigated what was going on at Guantanamo , and became alarmed in approximately the summer of 2002 .
It raised questions about potentially criminal mistreatment of prisoners .
In a meeting , Mallow told Haynes that interrogation tactics being used at Guantanamo could be illegal .
Haynes and DOD ignored CITF ’s concerns , telling CITF that it ( CITF ) had no say in the matter .
Haynes ’ willingness to ignore CITF was stoked by statements of John Yoo and Michael Chertoff .
• David Brant was the head of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service ( NCIS ) .
He learned from NCIS personnel on the ground at Guantanamo , especially an NCIS psychologist named Michael Gelles , and from Brittain Mallow , that torture and abuse were taking place at Guantanamo .
Brant knew such actions were unlawful regardless of contrary legal advice from Jim Haynes ’ Office of General Counsel in the Pentagon , and he would not permit NCIS personnel to participate in the torture and abuse .
His bottom line was “ ‘ it just ai n’t right . ’ ”
“ ‘ It was pretty basic , black and white to me , ’ ” he said .
“ ‘ I did n’t know or care what the rules were that had been set by the Department of Defense at that point .
We were going to do what was morally , ethically and legally permissible . ’”
Brant conveyed his concern to Army leaders , who had command authority over the military interrogators at Guantanamo , but they did not care .
He also conveyed his concern to the Air Force .
But it too did not care .
He found nobody who cared until he spoke to the General Counsel of the Navy , Alberto Mora , on December 17 , 2002 and told him what had been going on ( Mora was deeply upset by what he was told .
His subsequent actions are discussed below . )
• Steven Morello , the General Counsel of the Army , was long aware of and deeply concerned about what had been going on .
He had in his office a DOD collection of pertinent documents , including , among other items in the DOD paper trail , Diane Beaver ’s memo , a document by which Rumsfeld , upon Haynes ’ recommendation , gave the green light to torture and abuse , and a memo from Jim Clemente of the FBI warning that the renditions could be considered a criminal conspiracy in violation of American law .
When Mora came to him after learning what was taking place from Brant , Morello informed Mora that “ ‘ We tried to stop it , ’ ” but could n’t .
His concerns had been ignored .
He had been “ told to shut up . ”
When Mora went to speak to Morello about what he had learned from Brant , Morello showed Mora the DOD paper trail that was in his possession .
But he was so nervous that he made Mora promise not to tell where he had seen the documents .
The documents had , of course , been “ closely held , ” with numerous DOD personnel and lawyers being kept out of the process lest they learn about and object to what was being done .
Such close holding and efforts to limit paper trails were a modus operandi of Haynes .
• Mora was horrified by what he read in the paper trail in Morello ’s office .
He took his concerns to Gordon England , then Secretary of the Navy and later Deputy Secretary of Defense .
Then , with England ’s approval , he met with Haynes on December 20th , three days after Brant had come to him .
Mora warned Haynes that the DOD paper trail permitted torture .
In the next three weeks , Mora ’s warnings against torture and abuse were also put before several of the Pentagon ’s top officials , including Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz , Jane Dalton , who was the legal advisor to the Joint Chiefs , and Secretary Rumsfeld .
Mora ’s warnings were unheeded , and torture and abuse continued at Guantanamo .
Three weeks after first meeting with Haynes on December 20 , 2002 , Mora met with him again on January 9 , 2003 , to once again warn against the torture and abuse , which were continuing .
Mora warned Haynes that criminal charges could be filed against administration officials .
Haynes rejected Mora ’s views .
When he later mentioned Mora ’s views to Rumsfeld , Rumsfeld too rejected them .
Mora warned Haynes yet again on January 15 , 2003 .
Acting contrary to Haynes ’ aversion to paper trails , on January 15th Mora gave him an unsigned draft memorandum saying that what was occurring at Guantanamo was “ ‘at a minimum cruel and unusual treatment , and , at worst , torture . ’”
Mora said he would sign the memo that afternoon -- thereby making it an official document for and permanently available in the DOD ’s historical files -- unless the unlawful interrogation techniques were suspended .
Haynes called Mora by the end of the day on January 15 , 2003 to tell him that the illegal techniques had been suspended .
One week later , however , Mora was shown a draft of an 81 - page memo from John Yoo , which was subsequently finalized in March 2003 .
Mora was shown the draft by Mary Walker , head of the Pentagon working group that was drafting a DOD memo , based on Yoo ’s work , that authorized torture .
Appalled by the barbarism and professional incompetence of Yoo ’s draft , a few days after reading the draft Mora sent an email to Mary Walker warning that Yoo ’s memo was erroneous and dangerous .
Walker wrote back that she disagreed with Mora ’s warning and she believed Haynes did too .
Subsequently , Mora again confronted Haynes , telling him that the draft report being prepared by Walker ’s working group was “ ‘ deeply flawed ’ ” and should be locked up and “ ‘ never let out to see the light of day again . ’ ”
Mora ’s warnings were all ignored .
The torture and abuse continued .
•
The Judge Advocates General of the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marines are the country ’s top uniformed legal officers .
They were appointed to be part of Mary Walker ’s working group .
All four of them were appalled at what they were seeing , and each wrote a memo of dissent to torture and abuse .
Their memos warned not just that what was being approved was contrary to the legal and moral training American servicemen have always received , and not just that there would be international criticism , but also that interrogators and the chain of command were being put at risk of criminal prosecutions abroad .
The views and warnings of America ’s top uniformed legal officers were ignored .
In sum , far from American officials and lawyers authorizing or engaging in torture because it was lawful , they authorized and engaged in it because they wanted to , they kept their actions secret from interested officials for as long as they could lest there be strong opposition to the torture and abuse they were perpetrating , they deliberately ignored repeated warnings that the torture and abuse were illegal and could lead to prosecutions , and they ignored these warnings even when they came from high level civilian and military officers .

NIAGARA FALLS , Ont. - Ontario is looking at relaxing welfare rules to allow more people to apply as jobless numbers point to 71,000 more unemployed workers in the province in January .
Premier Dalton McGuinty said he could n't rule out higher job loss numbers in coming months and the rules around Ontario Works were one of the things Finance Minister Dwight Duncan is looking at as he prepared his budget .
Duncan , who called the jobless numbers " deeply troubling , " said there was a " sharp uptick " in welfare claims in the last couple of months of 2008 .
The current rules mean that recipients can't qualify unless they burn through most of their assets first .
" As part of our poverty agenda , we are looking at those rules , " Duncan said .
" The asset rules really do penalize , in a sense , people . "
The latest jobless numbers will hopefully prompt the federal government to take another look at inequities in employment insurance , Duncan added .
" They did a good job on the infrastructure part in responding to the things we 've been calling for but now I really think they need to look at the qualification on employment insurance . "
Statistics Canada said Ontario shed 71,000 jobs in January - half in the manufacturing sector - as Canada suffered its worst monthly job loss - 129,000 - in at least three decades .
Ontario's unemployment rate rose to eight per cent , above the national average of 7.2 per cent .
Both McGuinty and Duncan expressed concern that Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney was too optimistic in his projections that economic growth will begin to rebound next year .
" There 's a lot of speculation out there in terms of where we 're going to go ( with jobless rates ) , so I do n't know with certainty , " McGuinty said in Niagara Falls , Ont. , while at a Liberal provincial council meeting .
" What I can tell Ontarians is we will find ways to help one another . "
McGuinty declined to provide details of his recovery plan , saying they will come with Duncan 's budget in early March .
In the meantime , he is dealing with " big questions " following a report he commissioned that suggests Ontario 's future depends on developing a new economic model based on brains over brawn .
While it would be easy to fire nurses and cut corporate taxes , McGuinty said , those kind of measures wo n't lead to long - term solutions .
" This is a very big question and it's going to take a lot of work before we come up and answer this , " McGuinty said .
" But what do we need to do to ensure that folks who are losing manufacturing jobs , who are going into service sector jobs - what do we need to do to ensure that they can enjoy a good standard of living ? "
Ontario also plans to spend several billions this year on infrastructure projects to match the recently announced federal program , and introduce new legislation in the coming weeks that would tie jobs and economic growth to green energy .
But Duncan said those and other investments are " not going to fix every problem . "
McGuinty has sounded the alarm bell in recent days about the state of Ontario 's battered economy , warning that the province will face " multi- year " deficits starting with a " significant " shortfall in the upcoming spring budget .
Some have predicted the deficit could reach at least $ 5 billion this year , taking into account a $ 500 - million shortfall the Liberal government forecast in the fall , as well as the billions of dollars that McGuinty has since promised for infrastructure and troubled automakers .
Chrysler LLC said Friday it will temporarily close four assembly plants next week because of weak U.S. sales , including a factory in Brampton , Ont .
Other ways to wrap a method
This is something of a follow - up to Bruce Williams ' wrap - up of " …
The spectrum -- a radio " fingerprint " that revealed radio emission from water masers in the distant quasar MG J0414+0534 .
The background image is an infrared image of the quasar , made with the Hubble Space Telescope .
The quasar appears broken up into four components by a foreground galaxy ( diffuse object in the center ) , acting as a gravitational lens and strengthening the signal by a factor of 35 .
The inset with the galaxy M87 shows how the quasar might be seen from nearby .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Astronomers have found the most distant water yet seen in the Universe , in a galaxy more than 11 billion light - years from Earth .
Previously , the most distant water had been seen in a galaxy less than 7 billion light - years from Earth .
Using the giant , 100 - meter - diameter radio telescope in Effelsberg , Germany , and the National Science Foundation 's Very Large Array ( VLA ) in New Mexico , the scientists detected a telltale radio " fingerprint " of water molecules in the distant galaxy .
The soggy galaxy , dubbed MG J0414+0534 , harbors a quasar -- a supermassive black hole powering bright emission -- at its core .
In the region near the core , the water molecules are acting as masers , the radio equivalent of lasers , to amplify radio waves at a specific frequency .
The astronomers say their discovery indicates that such giant water masers were more common in the early Universe than they are today .
MG J0414+0534 is seen as it was when the Universe was roughly one - sixth of its current age .
At the galaxy 's great distance , even the strengthening of the radio waves done by the masers would not by itself have made them strong enough to detect with the radio telescopes .
However , the scientists got help from nature in the form of another galaxy , nearly 8 billion light - years away , located directly in the line of sight from MG J0414+0534 to Earth .
That foreground galaxy 's gravity served as a lens to further brighten the more - distant galaxy and make the emission from the water molecules visible to the radio telescopes .
" We were only able to discover this distant water with the help of the gravitational lens , " said Violette Impellizzeri , an astronomer with the Max - Planck Institute for Radioastronomy ( MPIfR ) in Bonn , Germany .
" This cosmic telescope reduced the amount of time needed to detect the water by a factor of about 1,000 , " she added .
The astronomers first detected the water signal with the Effelsberg telescope .
They then turned to the VLA 's sharper imaging capability to confirm that it was indeed coming from the distant galaxy .
The gravitational lens produces not one , but four images of MG J0414+0534 as seen from Earth .
Using the VLA , the scientists found the specific frequency attributable to the water masers in the two brightest of the four lensed images .
The other two lensed images , they said , are too faint for detecting the water signal .
The radio frequency emitted by the water molecules was Doppler shifted by the expansion of the Universe from 22.2 GHz to 6.1 GHz .
Water masers have been found in numerous galaxies at closer distances .
Typically , they are thought to arise in disks of molecules closely orbiting a supermassive black hole at the galaxy 's core .
The amplified radio emission is more often observed when the orbiting disk is seen nearly edge - on .
However , the astronomers said MG J0414+0534 is oriented with the disk almost face - on as seen from Earth .
" This may mean that the water molecules in the masers we 're seeing are not in the disk , but in the superfast jets of material being ejected by the gravitational power of the black hole , " explained John McKean , also of MPIfR .
Impellizzeri and McKean worked with Alan Roy , Christian Henkel , and Andreas Brunthaler , also of the Max - Planck Institute ; Paola Castangia of the Max - Planck Institute and the INAF Astronomical Observatory of Cagliari in Italy ; and Olaf Wucknitz of the Argelander Institute for Astronomy in Bonn , Germany .
The scientists reported their results in the December 18 issue of the scientific journal Nature .

U.S. MILITARY ROLE POSSIBLE IN MEXICO DRUG FIGHT
Longtime Concerns Over Joint Effort May Fade
MEXICO CITY - Alarmed by spiraling drug violence along their shared border , U.S. and Mexican officials say they foresee an enhanced U.S. role in the battle against powerful cartels , including joint operations that could involve private American contractors or U.S. military and intelligence personnel .
The U.S. and Mexican officials say their cooperation could go beyond the current practice of " sharing intelligence . "
They say that historical concerns about Mexican sovereignty may be overcome by the challenge in restoring stability to key regions , particularly along the border .

How many pixels are there in a frame of 35 mm film ?
How many pixels are there in a frame of 35 mm film ?
( an FAQ on digital photography )
This is a somewhat controversial question , and there are many possible answers .
Film is an analog medium , so it does n't have " pixels " per se , though film scanners have pixels and a specific resolution .
When this article was written , the number was more than was found in typical digital cameras .
Today most people agree that the top digital cameras , like the Canon 5D Mark II , are superior .
Even those who give film a modest edge will agree that the superb flexibility , convenience and high ISO range of the digitals makes them the winner .
The very short answer is that there are around 20 million " quality " pixels in a top- quality 35 mm shot .
That 's a shot with a tripod , mirror - up , with a top - rate lens and the finest - grained film , in decent light .
12 million are more typical for " good " shots .
There may be as few as 4 million " quality " pixels in a handheld shot with a point - and - shoot camera or camera with a poor lens .
And of course if focus is poor , or light is poor , or the camera was not held steady , the number will drop down below the 1 - 2 million pixels of the modern consumer digicam .
Of course , one can have a bad shot with a digital camera too , not using all its resolving ability .
However , few pick their gear with the plan of shooting badly .
The eye , however , is not as discerning when looking at a picture in the usual context as it can be when looking at things blown up .
So many can also argue that a shot of around 9 million pixels would look as good to the eye as a 35 mm shot , except when blown up very large and looked at quite closely .
It 's important to note another key difference .
Film , as an analog medium , does not record just 256 grayscales or the corresponding 16 million colours .
And film scanners , even doing just 8 bits per colour , get 24 bits of data for every single pixel .
Today 's digital cameras only get 8 - 12 bits of data for each pixel and they guess ( interpolate ) the other 16 .
So the colour accuracy for even a scanned film image is better than the modern digital camera .
Good film scanners can also extract more than just levels from 0 to 255 .
They can often go to 12 bits ( 0 to 4097 ) to detect much more detail in shadows , and provide more contrast .
As such a film scanner gets as much as 36 bits of information for each pixel , instead of 8 .
More modern digital cameras gather 10 or even 12 bits of the single colour pixel , and keep it if they record in RAW mode , but reduce it in JPEG mode .
Foveon digital cameras record all 3 colours per pixel , like film , but their sensors have lower resolution as of now .
As a counter note , the 24 bits of colour from a film scanner , while better than the 8 to 12 bits per sample of a bayer - interpolated digital camera , is nowhere near near 3 times as good as some pretend .
The interpolation algorithms are good , and rely on the fact that to the eye , particularly in natural scenes , position - brightness information is much more important than colour information .
How much better full colour information is is subjective , but it 's not even close to 3 times better .
On the other hand , even the 36 bits from the best scanner is not enough .
The film has more information .
Negative film itself tends to be able to hold around 1000 to 1 contrast range .
Quality slide film projects more levels , though over a slightly narrower exposure range .
( To make this clearer , negative films capture a wider range but can't display it when printed .
Slide films capture a more narrow range , just a bit better than digital , but can display it all when projected . )
Generally one desires at least 12 bits per colour to represent it .
Your eye , by widening and closing the iris , can sample an astounding ( eye - popping ! ) 7 decimal orders of magnitude of range of contrast , which would need at least 24 bits .
So there is a lot of information in film .
However , not all of it is usable information , which causes the debate about the equivalence in pixels .
Film is made up of chemical grains or dye clouds .
The more you blow up film , the more you start seeing noise caused by those grains , and eventually the very clumping of the grains themselves .
Of course some are bothered by the grain more than others .
The finest films ( which are slow and best with sunlight or flash ) have very fine grain , and in many cases , the limits of the lenses blur the image before the grains start causing too much trouble .
However with a decent lens you do n't have to blow up too much before you see the grain .
The better digital cameras are also starting to exceed the quality of most zooms and even some prime lenses .
These films , with good lenses , are capable of resolving as much as 7000 pixels ( 3500 " line pairs " ) over the width of a 35 mm frame -- about 5000 dots per inch .
However , before that point , while they can resolve " line pairs , " the image is pretty noisy .
The lines are not resolved as straight , sharp - edged entities , but you can tell there is a white line next to a black line .
There is more information to be extracted even at this fine resolution , but the deeper you go , the more noise you also extract .
To make the image not look " grainy " and otherwise poor , you need to pull back .
Subjective tests suggest this is to about 4000 DPI , or around 5600 pixels .
For a 3:2 frame , that means around 20 million pixels .
( Of course some people do n't mind grain as much as others , so your mileage may vary .
Also , if you can get a scan that good , digital techniques can reduce the visibility of grain and extend the resolution of film . )
Down at this level , however , you 're reaching the limits of most lenses .
They may be able to resolve high - contrast items at this level but most pixels are a little blurry .
A crop at this level does not look nearly as good as a scaled down full shot .
What this means is that a 5300 x 4000 digital camera can produce a shot equivalent to a scan from a quality 35 mm camera -- provided you could get more than 8 bits per pixel .
You could blow up the 35 mm shot a little bit more and see a little bit more , but only at the cost of producing a grainy image .
Chances are a 3000 x 2000 digital camera would match the 35 mm for a good percentage of shots .
Prints
Prints also are analog output .
In theory a print can have all the information of film , however photographic paper tends to only be able to hold a range of 100 to 1 in contrast .
That 's less than a monitor can .
In addition , the printing process is not perfect , and often blurs an image .
Typical lab prints do n't seem to store much more than 200 - 250 pixels for each inch .
Quality labs can do better -- perhaps up to 500 pixels / inch .
( The paper can , in theory , do more , but there is n't that much more in the negative . )
Thus a 5x7 print probably is similar to a 1400 x 1000 digital image ( if the digital image has enough bits per pixel . )
It 's rarely more than the 2100 x 1500 that 300 dpi would imply .
It 's always better to scan from print film or slide film .
You get far more contrast , and far more detail , and it 's not second generation .
( Though be warned some slide scanners are not up to the range of contrast in a good slide . )
Digital Printing
Makers of digital printers play lots of games with their resolution .
The " dots " they speak of ( when they talk about a 720 dpi resolution ) are dots of single colour ink .
A pixel , on the other hand , is a dot capable of the full colour range .
You need lots of dots to make a specific colour and not look spotty .
To render a pixel well can require scores of ink dots .
In the end , the goal is a " continuous tone " image at a given number of pixels per inch .
Most printers can only simulate continuous or near - continuous tone .
( Digital film recorders , or photographic paper recorders , can do near - continuous tone . )
Getting the scan
Today , high end digital SLRS commonly have over 20 megapixels .
Serious shooters are preferring them to film .
First of all , the resolution is pretty similar to film at its best , and secondly getting everything out of film requires a lot of work with a very good scanner .
Scanning is hard work .
One must deal with dust and fingerprints .
It takes a lot of time .
And it adds another generation to the process , dependent on the optics and scanning elements of the scanner .
Pixel - Mania
Today in digital cameras , marketing departments have created a bit of pixel - mania .
They are working too hard at increasing the number of megapixels they can advertise without always caring about the quality of the pixels .
A small point and shoot with 8 megapixels is probably a lot worse than the old 6 megapixel canon D60 -- it may even be worse due to noise that the 3 megapixel D30 .
Resolution is important but not the only thing .
What would you rather shoot on ?
The real question of course is " which do you want to shoot on ? "
When considering the quality DSLRs from Canon or Nikon , most people switched to preferring the images from the 8 megapixel models compared to 35 mm film , and very few are unsatisfied with the 20 megapixel models .
In fact , they are competing in some minds with medium format shooting .
Can they get a better shot with a 120 chrome than an 20 MP DSLR ?
Probably , but only by a modest amount .
But the DSLR is just so much easier to work with , and so much more flexible that when the final goal is digital ( as it almost always is today ) the choice for these photographers is not very hard .

Inexpensive solar cells , vastly improved medical imaging techniques and lighter and more flexible television screens are among the potential applications envisioned for organic electronics .
Recent experiments conducted by Greg Scholes and Elisabetta Collini of University of Toronto 's Department of Chemistry may bring these within closer reach thanks to new insights into the way molecules absorb and move energy .
Their findings will be published in the journal Science on January 16 .
The U of T team -- whose work is devoted to investigating how light initiates physical processes at the molecular level and how humans might take better advantage of that fact -- looked specifically at conjugated polymers which are believed to be one of the most promising candidates for building efficient organic solar cells .
Conjugated polymers are very long organic molecules that possess properties like those of semiconductors and so can be used to make transistors and LEDs .
When these conductive polymers absorb light , the energy moves along and among the polymer chains before it is converted to electrical charges .
" One of the biggest obstacles to organic solar cells is that it is difficult to control what happens after light is absorbed : whether the desired property is transmitting energy , storing information or emitting light , " explains Collini .
" Our experiment suggests it is possible to achieve control using quantum effects , even under relatively normal conditions . "
" We found that the ultrafast movement of energy through and between molecules happens by a quantum - mechanical mechanism rather than through random hopping , even at room temperature , " explains Scholes .
" This is extraordinary and will greatly influence future work in the field because everyone thought that these kinds of quantum effects could only operate in complex systems at very low temperatures , " he says .
Scholes and Collini 's discovery opens the way to designing organic solar cells or sensors that capture light and transfer its energy much more effectively .
It also has significant implications for quantum computing because it suggests that quantum information may survive significantly longer than previously believed .
In their experiment , the scientists used ultrashort laser pulses to put the conjugated polymer into a quantum - mechanical state , whereby it is simultaneously in the ground ( normal ) state and a state where light has been absorbed .
This is called a superposition state or quantum coherence .
Then they used a sophisticated method involving more ultrashort laser pulses to observe whether this quantum state can migrate along or between polymer chains .
" It turns out that it only moves along polymer chains , " says Scholes .
" The chemical framework that makes up the chain is a crucial ingredient for enabling quantum coherent energy transfer .
In the absence of the chemical framework , energy is funneled by chance , rather than design . "
This means that a chemical property – structure -- can be used to steer the ultrafast migration of energy using quantum coherence .
The unique properties of conjugated polymers continue to surprise us , " he says .
Greg Scholes and Elisabetta Collini are with the Department of Chemistry , the Institute for Optical Sciences and the Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control at the University of Toronto .
The research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
Six years after a fed - up France launched a vigorous crackdown on Islamic extremism , the campaign ’s success is posing new dangers for the United States , which must cope with the potentially lethal spillover .
“ Terrorism is like the weather :
There are zones of high pressure and low pressure , and they change with time , ” one high - ranking French law enforcement official said in an interview .
“ More and more in the future , the United States is going to be a target that will replace the traditional targets , like France . ”
The United States , hated by many radical Muslims as the incarnation of godless evil and Western decadence , has already been bloodied by terrorist violence in Manhattan ’s financial district , sub -Saharan Africa and other locales .
But the recent U.S. arrests of a number of Algerians are regarded by experts in Europe and the Arab world as heralding a new phase in the holy war against America .
“ When Europe started to track down and dismantle the networks , it was clear the GIA [ Algeria ’s Armed Islamic Group ] would move elsewhere , ” Reda Bekkat , editor in chief of the Algerian daily El Watan , said in a telephone interview from Algiers .

Members of the Islamic Salvation Front --a Muslim political party outlawed after it seemed set to win Algeria ’s general election in December 1991 - - who “ had been exchange students in the United States also did what they could to return to the U.S. , ” he said .
France , the former colonial power in North Africa and traditional refuge and operations base for many of its transplanted revolutionaries , began waging a police and judicial war on armed Muslim extremism in 1993 and stepped up the pressure in 1994 and ’ 95 .
More than 1,000 arrests and hundreds of searches were carried out .
In one case last year , 24 people went on trial as alleged members of an Algerian network suspected of a series of Paris bombings that killed eight people and wounded more than 150 others in 1995 .
Neighboring countries , including Belgium , Germany , Italy , Spain and Switzerland , also made key arrests or dismantled cells of Islamic militants .
For France , the crackdown was a success ; the last major terrorist act here in which Islamic radicals are suspected -- the bombing of a Paris rapid - transit train that killed four and wounded 91 - - was more than three years ago .
But for the United States , it turns out , the crackdown was not such good news .

Fleeing the dragnet cast in Europe , a number of Islamic revolutionaries crossed the Atlantic to seek a haven in North America .
The French law enforcement official , an experienced anti-terrorism investigator , estimates the number of known Algerian extremists residing in North America , mostly in the French - speaking Canadian province of Quebec , at “ several hundred . ”
In their odyssey , specialists say , the transplants have been able to benefit from a global and largely covert support network for radical Muslim causes that began during the CIA - financed jihad , or holy war , against the 1979 - 89 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan .
Increasingly , the specialists say , the extremists operate in flexible and quickly changing groups , often made up of people of several nationalities , and they may resort to crime as a fund - raising tool .
“ Banditry and terrorism go together , ” said Bekkat , the editor .
Bin Laden
Is Said to Be at Center of Loose Web

U.S. and European authorities say that at the center of this web , which has been loosely spun from the Philippines to North America , is Saudi militant Osama bin Laden .
A former Afghan moujahedeen , or holy warrior , the 43 - year - old Bin Laden is on the FBI ’s 10 - most - wanted list for allegedly sponsoring the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people .
In a development indicative of Bin Laden ’s esteem among his brothers in arms , after the United States succeeded in obtaining a U.N. Security Council resolution in October demanding Bin Laden ’s extradition from Afghanistan , GIA leader Antar Zouabri issued a letter that condemned the West for persecuting Islamic militants and that vowed reprisals .
French officials said Ahmed Ressam , an Algerian national arrested Dec. 14 in Washington state on suspicion of plotting a bombing in the United States , received his military training at one of Bin Laden ’s camps in eastern Afghanistan .
According to the French , the 33 - year - old North African belonged to the “ Roubaix gang , ” a band of armed robbers of Algerian , Bosnian and French origin who trained in Islamic camps in Bosnia - Herzegovina and carried out a series of holdups in Belgium and northern France in early 1996 .

Judge Jean - Louis Bruguiere , one of France ’s top anti-terrorism investigators , says a flexible , diffuse and worldwide structure makes Muslim extremism a growing problem that demands more intense cross - border cooperation .
In the space of one month , the French judge ’s investigations took him as far afield as Canada and Australia .
“ The Islamic extremist threat is the Internet of terrorism , ” Bruguiere said .
In fact , one sometimes uses the other .
An Algerian physicist living in Switzerland , Mourad Dhina , was fired from his job at the European Nuclear Research Center in 1998 after prosecutors linked him to trafficking in Slovak - made machine guns and he was discovered to be using his center ’s Web connections to contact GIA members in other countries , including the United States .

To many historians of Islamic radicalism , it is an irony of history that the United States may increasingly become a target of attacks .
In a book to be published in English next month , Swiss journalist Richard Labeviere charts what he sees as U.S. complicity in the rise of violent Muslim movements , from the religious brotherhoods that combated nationalist leaders such as Egypt ’s Gamal Abdel Nasser to the foreign recruits sent to Afghanistan during the ‘ 80s and that country ’s present - day rulers , the Taliban .
“ For America , the bill is now coming due , ” Labeviere said .
Skepticism That Arrest Occurred by Chance
In October , Bruguiere and a colleague traveled to Montreal , where Ressam had been living , in a vain attempt to find him and a roommate , Said Atmani .
Advertisement
Paris sources said the French informed U.S. law enforcement officials of their interest in the pair .
In France , there is broad skepticism that Ressam was arrested last month by pure chance .
According to the U.S. Customs Service , the Algerian was chased down after taking a ferry from Canada to Port Angeles , Wash . , in a car whose wheel well turned out to contain nitroglycerin and other bomb - making materials .
One U.S. expert said the ingredients were identical to those used in the February 1993 bombing of New York ’s World Trade Center , for which a number of Islamic radicals , including Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , were convicted .
Ressam ’s arrest and the confiscation of the car ’s contents may have averted a catastrophe , but European law enforcement officials caution that their experience and analysis indicate there will be more attempts on U.S. soil , even if Bin Laden himself is apprehended .
“ We are n’t going to solve the terrorism problem by killing Bin Laden with a Tomahawk ” cruise missile , the French official said .
“ It ’s not Bin Laden , but the networks around him .
He inspires others and finances them much more than he commands them . ”

Paul -ites , still rolling
Here 's a mark of the continuing energy behind Ron Paul , and the parallel lack thereof among other Republican Party structures , particularly online : the Digg - style website set up by Americans for Tax Reform for its Republican National Committee Chairman debate tomorrow has been entirely taken over by Paul supporters .
They 've voted up the following as key questions for possible RNC chairs :
In light of the success of the Ron Paul presidential campaign attracting large numbers of young activists to the conservative cause , what specifically will you do to ensure they become Republicans ?
And :
Austrian economics is the leading advocate for individual freedom in economics .
Individual freedom in economics is an important defense against tyrranny in government .
Seeing now that the predictions of Ron Paul and Peter Schiff were amazingly accurate will the republican party now turn to the Austian school of economics for direction in monetary reform .
Elaborate please
And :
As RNC chairman , what will you do to encourage the devolution of power from the national government back to the state / local governments as dictated by the 9th and 10th Amendments ?
And :
Will you add opposition to fiat money ( including the Federal Reserve system ) to the Republican platform ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The economy faces a slump deeper than the Great Depression and a growing deficit threatens the credit of the United States itself , former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead , said at the Reuters Global Finance Summit on Wednesday .
Whitehead , 86 , said the prospect of worsening consumer credit woes combined with an overtaxed federal government make him fear that the current slump is far from over .
“ I think it would be worse than the depression , ” Whitehead said .
“ We ’re talking about reducing the credit of the United States of America , which is the backbone of the economic system . ”
Whitehead encountered plenty of crises during his 38 years at the investment banking firm and was a young boy during the 1930s .
Whitehead warned the country ’s financial strength is at risk due to the sweeping demand for tax relief and a long list of major government spending plans .
“ I see nothing but large increases in the deficit , all of which are serving to decrease the credit standing of America , ” said Whitehead , who served as chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp after the World Trade Center was destroyed during the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Whitehead , who helped make Goldman a top - tier Wall Street firm and led its international expansion , left in 1984 to become a deputy secretary of state under Ronald Reagan .
He warned that the country ’s record deficit is poised to balloon as the public calls on government for more support .
“ Before I go to sleep at night , I wonder if tomorrow is the day Moody ’s and S&P will announce a downgrade of U.S. government bonds , ” he said .
“ Eventually U.S. government bonds would no longer be the triple - A credit that they ’ve always been . ”
There are at least ten “ trillion dollar problems , ” facing the United States , he said , including social security , expanding health insurance , rebuilding infrastructure and increased spending on green energy .
At the same time , the public does not want to pay for it .
“ The public is not prepared to increase taxes .
Both parties were for reducing taxes , reducing income to government , and both parties favored a number of new programs -- all very costly and all done by the government , ” he said .
Large deficits can weaken the country ’s credit and increase its borrowing costs , which already constitute a significant part of funding to cover expenses .
Whitehead said it could take “ several years ” for the current problems to be resolved .
Whitehead said he is speaking out on this topic because he is concerned no lawmakers are against these new spending programs and none will stand up and call for higher taxes .
“ I just want to get people thinking about this , and to realize this is a road to disaster , ” said Whitehead .
“ I ’ve always been a positive person and optimistic , but I do n’t see a solution here . ”

Mission Statement
Not A Father 's Day is a holiday dedicated to the celebration and commemoration of an oft forgotten segment of our country 's population : the not fathers .
These brave men have chosen to remain childless , despite an avalanche of pressure , expectations , and condemnation , propagated by the Saturday morning cartoon loving elite , the Minivan Clan , and Maury Povich .
So on this day , all of humanity shall pause to remember that it is better to change partners than diapers , that the only thing in a bottle should be beer , and that the only reason to be up at 6 am is because you have n't gone to sleep the night before .
SAM HARRIS It 's All True
It is a pity that people like Jerry Coyne and Daniel Dennett can't see how easily religion and science can be reconciled .
Having once viewed the world as they do , I understand how their fundamentalist rationality has blinded them to deeper truths .
I 've wanted to say to both of these men — " Some things are above reason .
Way above ! "
Happily , George Dyson has done this for me in a brilliant essay on this page .
He demolishes the intellectual pretensions of militant atheists like Coyne and Dennett in the most elegant way imaginable : by merely divulging the title of a 17th century work by the great Robert Boyle .
When I was a militant neo-rationalist , I had a sinking feeling that my colleagues and I had not fully reckoned with Boyle on the argument from Design and were , as a result , risking public humiliation .
Now it has come to pass …
If I have one quibble with Dyson , it is that he has been far too modest in drawing out the implications of his argument .
He is , of course , right to declare that " science and religion are here to stay . "
But magic is here to stay too , George ; Africa is full of it .
Is there a conflict between scientific rationality and a belief in magic spells ?
Specifically , is there a conflict between believing that epilepsy is a result of abnormal neural activity and believing that it is a sign of demonic possession ?
Dogmatists like Coyne and Dennett clearly think so .
They do n't realize , as Dyson must , that the more one understands neurology , the more one will understand — and honor — demonology .
Have Coyne and Dennett read the work of sophisticated magicians like Aleister Crowley or Eliphas Levi ?
Do n't count on it .
Ask yourself , how could matter conflict with spirit in any way ?
Answer : it cannot .
Forgive me , but I find it embarrassing to have to explain these things to people who are supposed be well educated .
Emanuel Derman admonishes neo-secular militants like Coyne and Dennett to " stop wasting … time trying to beat up on the idea of God in the name of science . "
This is so comprehensive a demolition of their work that I suspect Coyne and Dennett will be forever changed .
Derman reminds us , with extraordinary patience , that scientists have no authority outside the narrow focus of the scientific worldview .
Can a biologist harbor any educated doubts about the Virgin birth of Jesus ?
No — because human parthenogenesis has nothing whatsoever to do with biology .
Can a physicist form an educated opinion about the likelihood of the Ascension ?
How could he ?
Bodily translocation into the sky does not require any interaction with the forces of nature .
Can either a biologist or a physicist realistically doubt the coming Resurrection of the Dead ?
Many have tried — all have failed .
( Please understand that any mention of " entropy " in this context is mere posturing . )
As Derman recognizes , it is the sheerest arrogance that has led atheist scientists to overreach in this way .
This Edge exchange has been a feast for the mind !
Consider Lisa Randall 's moving account of having traveled by airplane in the company of a " charming young actor " who just knew in his heart that our species descended , not from apelike precursors , but from the biblical Adam .
I urge readers to linger over these points , as Randall 's prose is condensed nearly to the Planck scale .
Just picture what it must have been like to be at thirty thousand feet in the company of a man who studied molecular biology at the college level .
Next , consider that this prodigy is both a working actor and an enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama .
Finally , realize that the stranger at your side believes evolution to be nothing more than a sinister piece of secular propaganda .
I can dimly imagine how Coyne and Dennett felt upon reading Randall 's tale this far .
But Randall drills deeper : " Empirically - based logic - derived science and faith are entirely different methods for trying to approach truth .
You can derive a contradiction only if your rules are logic .
If you believe in revelatory truth you 've abandoned the rules .
There is no contradiction to be had . "
I am confident that Randall 's airplane adventure will mark a turning point in our intellectual discourse .
Not only has she resolved all the contradictions between science and religion ( and magic , voodoo , UFO cults , astrology , Tarot , palmistry , etc. ) , she has reconciled apparently conflicting religions with one another .
Hindus worship a multiplicity of gods ;
Muslims acknowledge the existence of only one , and believe that polytheism is a killing offense .
Do Hinduism and Islam conflict ?
Only " if your rules are logic . "
Just as paths ascending a mountain slope can seem discrepant at the mountain 's base , and yet once we stand upon the summit , we find that all routes have led to the same destination — so it will be with every exercise of the human intellect !
The Summit of Truth awaits , my friends .
Simply pick your path ....
And yet , there is more to be said against the likes of Coyne and Dennett and Dawkins ( he is the worst ! ) .
Patrick Bateson tells us that it is " staggeringly insensitive " to undermine the religious beliefs of people who find these beliefs consoling .
I agree completely .
For instance : it is now becoming a common practice in Afghanistan and Pakistan to blind and disfigure little girls with acid for the crime of going to school .
When I was a neo- fundamentalist rational neo - atheist I used to criticize such behavior as an especially shameful sign of religious stupidity .
I now realize — belatedly and to my great chagrin — that I knew nothing of the pain that a pious Muslim man might feel at the sight of young women learning to read .
Who am I to criticize the public expression of his faith ?
Bateson is right .
Clearly a belief in the inerrancy of the holy Qur'an is indispensable for these beleaguered people .
How can a militant secularist atheist neo - dogmatist like Coyne not see the plain truth ?
There simply IS no conflict between religion and science .
And even if there were one , it would be an utter waste of time to say anything about it .
Lawrence Krauss has established this second point beyond any possibility of doubt .
Go back and read his essay .
It 'll just take you five seconds .
I 've read it upwards of seventy times , and each perusal brings fresh insight .
Finally , Kenneth Miller , arrives to deliver the perspective of a genuine believer and to defend his work from the callow misreading of Coyne : " I made no argument that this happy confluence of natural events and physical constants proves the existence of God in any way — only that it could be understood or interpreted as consistent with the Divine by a person of faith . "
That 's just the right note to strike with a neo -militant rationalist like Coyne .
These people are simply obsessed with finding the best explanation for the patterns we witness in natural world .
But faith teaches us that the best , alas , is often the enemy of the good .
For instance , given that viruses outnumber animals by ten to one , and given that a single virus like smallpox killed 500 million human beings in the 20th century ( many of them children ) , people like Coyne ask whether these data are best explained by the existence of an all knowing , all powerful , and all loving God who views humanity as His most cherished creation .
Wrong question Coyne !
You see , the wise have learned to ask , along with Miller , whether it is merely possible , given these facts , that a mysterious God with an inscrutable Will could have created the world .
Surely it is !
And the heart rejoices …
Of course , one must n't carry this sublime inquiry too far .
Some have asked whether it is possible that a mysterious God with an inscrutable Will works only on Tuesdays or whether He might be especially fond of soft cheese .
There is no denying that such revelations , too , are possible — and may be forthcoming .
But they do not conduce to joy , chastity , homophobia , or any other terrestrial virtue — and that is the point .
Men like Coyne and Dennett miss these theological nuances .
Indeed , one fears that these are the very nuances they were born to miss .
Miller , on the other hand , recognizes that every scientist is free to see the world as he or she wants to :
If Francis Collins wants to believe that the historical Jesus was actually raised from the dead and still exists in an ethereal form which renders him both clairvoyant and mildly disapproving of masturbation , these beliefs do not even slightly detract from his stature as a scientist .
A man like Dawkins , who was exposed long ago for his rigid adherence to biological naturalism , may choose not to believe these things .
The choice is his .
But given his resolute denial of the risen Christ — and , indeed , of the very existence of a loving and provident Creator — Dawkins has no standing to criticize the approach of Collins , because he simply has no internal sense of how labile the scientific imagination can become once tempered by the Christian faith .
Miller is especially good at separating scientific rationality from every other form of human cognition .
It is crucial that the reader understand that science is a trade : it does not matter what a scientist believes as long as he does his scientific work properly .
This has been a stumbling block for many would - be intellectuals who imagine that science might have something to do with a comprehensive understanding of the universe , or that an awareness of the quantity and quality of evidence may know no boundaries .
Perhaps an analogy will help :
Let us say a cardiac surgeon believes that automobile accidents are caused , not by human inattention , brake failure , and the like , but by the Evil Eye .
Would this reduce his stature as a physician ?
Of course not — because heart surgery has nothing to do with the indiscretions of car and driver .
As Miller states , " the real issue is whether a scientist 's view on the question of God is incompatible with their scientific work .
Clearly , it is not . "
Yes , this is as clear the rising sun .
I would only add that a belief in the Evil Eye is perfectly compatible with modern medicine — with the possible exception of ophthalmology .
Some have called this the " balkanization of epistemology . "
I think words like " epistemology " are overrated .
And so do most Americans .
Finally , Miller arrives at the deepest question of all : " One can indeed embrace science in every respect , and still ask a deeper question , one in which Coyne seems to have no interest .
Why does science work ?
Why is the world around us organized in a way that makes itself accessible to our powers of logic and intellect ? "
I have often wondered why walking works .
Why is the world organized in such a way that we can walk upon it ?
And why should there be limits to our ability to move about in this way , like those imposed upon us at the highest altitudes ?
Indeed , I thought the subject fit for my doctoral dissertation , but was cruelly dissuaded by an unimaginative advisor .
And yet , I think Miller 's question is deeper still .
Clearly , men like Coyne and Dennett have averted their eyes from the answer — an answer that is plainly obvious to over ninety percent of their least educated neighbors .
The universe is rationally intelligible because the God of Abraham has made it so .
This God , who once showed an affinity for human sacrifice , and whose only direct communication with humanity ( in the Holy Bible , through the agency of the Holy Spirit ) betrays not the slightest trace of scientific understanding , nevertheless instilled in us the cognitive ability to subsequently understand this magnificent and terrifying cosmos in scientific terms .
As to why science has been the greatest agent for the mitigation of religious belief the world has ever seen , and has been viewed as a threat by religious people in almost every context , this is a final mystery that defies human analysis .
I have often thought that if God had wanted us to understand the difference between having good reasons for what one believes , and having bad ones ,
He would have made this difference intelligible to everyone .
The universe is whole and without contradiction .
What may appear like a contradiction at one level of physics or biology is always resolved at higher vibrational energies — or perhaps , as Miller points out , by " miracles . "
Needless to say , miracles , are precisely the sorts of occurrences that defy rational understanding and which would cause anyone seeking a comprehensive understanding of the world to doubt their occurrence .
Which is to say that if Jesus had been born of a virgin , had raised the dead , had been so raised Himself after a brief interlude , had then ascended bodily into the heavens , and has subsequently nurtured from on high these two millennia an abiding distrust for Jews and homosexuals — these are precisely the sorts of low probability events that people like Coyne , Dennett and Dawkins would doubt ever occurred .
Therefore , the doubts of fundamentalist atheist rationalist neo-humanistic secular militants actually render the miracles of Jesus ' ministry more plausible than they would otherwise be .
Jerry , Dan , Richard — please give this some thought .

I have recently argued in several posts ( for example this one ) that the decline in Treasury yields ( or in other words the interest rate on U.S. federal government debt securities ) indicate increased monetary inflation .
But at the same time , Mike Shedlock argues that falling Treasury yields are a sign of deflation .
That would at least appear to be contradictory , so who is right ?
At this point , you would naturally expect me to write that I am right , and indeed I do believe that I am right about this .
Still , while I believe that Mish is wrong , it can't be denied that he could be right theoretically ( which is to say under different circumstances , falling bond yields could reflect deflation ) .
To get to the bottom of this , it must be asked what possible reasons could there be for falling Treasury yields .
The answer to that question is that there are broadly 4 possible reasons why Treasury yields may fall : 1) Lower inflation expectations .
This reflects more deflationary ( less inflationary ) conditions and is thus a symptom of deflation .
Though it should be cautioned that expectations are a lagging indicator , and when there is a dramatic increase or decrease in inflation , the turnaround in inflation will happen later .
2 ) An increase in savings / a reduction in the government budget deficit .
This is essentially neutral from the inflation / deflation perspective , though in the long term , the higher production capacity this enables will push down prices .
3 ) An increase in risk aversion / liquidity preference .
As government bonds ( at least in the U.S. ) are perceived as risk free and are the most liquid asset around , increased risk aversion and / or liquidity preference will lower government bond yields .
This is also basically neutral from an inflation / deflation perspective , though it will mean tighter credit conditions for the private sector , which will have a deflationary effect .
On the other hand , the lower cost of borrowing combined with weaker private sector activity could encourage government to expand the budget deficit which would negate much of the aforementioned deflationary effect .
4 ) An increase in the money supply that is used to bid up bond prices .
This is the case where inflation pushed down yields .
So , theoretically , a decline in government bond yields could reflect inflation , be irrelevant from an inflation / deflation perspective , or reflect deflation .
This implies that falling Treasury yields alone can't be used as conclusive evidence of anything .
In order to tell what it implies you have to look at other data as well .
This brings us to the issue of what it is a result from .
Is it a result of falling inflation expectations ?
To some extent , yes , as is suggested in the dramatic decrease in the spread between nominal treasuries and inflation - protected ones ( TIPS ) .
However , much of the decline in that spread reflects the much higher liquidity of nominal treasuries and the increasing liquidity premium .
And there are also other strange aspects of the TIPS market that makes it less reliable as an inflation indicator .
Even so , it seems likely that inflation expectations have declined .
Is it the result of rising savings / a falling budget deficit ?
Hell no !
While private financial savings have increased , the dramatic increase in the budget deficit means that this factor has in ceteris paribus terms acted to raise Treasury yields - and raise it quite significantly .
Had n't it been for the counteracting effect of the other factors , this would have translated into much higher yields .
Is it a result of higher risk aversion / liquidity preference ?
That is clearly a factor given the sharp increase in the yield spread between Treasuries and various others more risky and less liquid bonds .
Though it should be noted that this increase in the yield spread has come in the form of falling Treasury yields , and not higher yields of for example corporate bonds .
Is it the result of a higher money supply ?
Yes , it definitely is .
This evening 's weekly money supply release again confirmed the aforementioned upward trend , with M1 rising another 3 % in just 1 week , while M2 & MZM rose slightly below 1 % each for the week .
The cumulative 9 week increase is 8.3 % ( annual rate of 58.1 % ) for M1 , 3.3 % for M2 ( annual rate of 20.3 % ) and 4.3 % for MZM ( annual rate of 27.5 % .
The monetary base is up 68.5 % in 10 weeks ( monetary base numbers are only published for 2 week periods ) , or 1,408 % at an annual rate .
This means that the inflationary monetary trends I discussed last week continue and are accelerating .
Thus , while the decline in bond yields may to some extent reflect a reduction in inflationary expectations as a result of the monetary contraction earlier this year , the main reason is the massive flood of liquidity unleashed by the Fed , in interaction with the increased risk aversion / liquidity premium .

Erlang ’s heart feature provides a heartbeat - based monitoring capability for Erlang runtime systems , with the ability to restart a runtime system if it fails .
It works reasonably well , but one issue with it is that if an error occurs such that it causes repeated immediate runtime crashes , heart will happily keep restarting the runtime over and over again , ad infinitum .
For yaws 1.80 , released a few days ago on Feb.
12 , I added a check to the heart setup in the yaws startup script to prevent endless restarts .
I thought I ’d share it here because it ’s useful for Erlang systems in general and is in no way specific to yaws .
It works by passing startup information from one incarnation to the next , checking that information to detect multiple restarts within a given time period .
We track both the startup time and the restart count , and if we detect 5 restarts within a 60 second period , we stop completely .
This is not to say that yaws is in dire need of this capability — it ’s extremely stable in general and 1.80 in particular is a very good release — but I added it mainly because other Erlang apps sharing the same runtime instance as yaws may not enjoy that same high level of stability , especially while they ’re still under development .
The command heart runs to start a new instance is set in the HEART_COMMAND environment variable .
For yaws , it ’s set like this ( I ’ve split this over multiple lines for clarity , but it ’s just one line in the actual script ) :
HEART_COMMAND=" $ {ENV_PGM} \ HEART=true \ YAWS_HEART_RESTARTS=$restarts \ YAWS_HEART_START=$starttime \ $ program " $ {1 + " $@ " }
where
$ {ENV_PGM} is /usr / bin /env , which allows us to set environment variables for the execution of a given command .
is , which allows us to set environment variables for the execution of a given command .
HEART is an environment variable that we use to indicate the command was launched by heart .
is an environment variable that we use to indicate the command was launched by .
YAWS_HEART_RESTARTS
is an environment variable that we use to track the number of restarts already seen .
The yaws script initially sets this to 1 and increments it for each heart restart .
is an environment variable that we use to track the number of restarts already seen .
The yaws script initially sets this to 1 and increments it for each heart restart .
YAWS_HEART_START is an environment variable that we use to track the time of the current round of restarts .
This is tracked as UNIX time , obtained by the script via the “ date -u +%s ” command .
is an environment variable that we use to track the time of the current round of restarts .
This is tracked as UNIX time , obtained by the script via the “ ” command .
$ program is the yaws script itself , i.e. , $ 0 .
is the yaws script itself , i.e. , . $ { 1 + " $@ " } is a specific shell construct that passes all the original arguments of the script unchanged along to $ program .
The yaws script looks for HEART set to true , indicating that it was launched by heart .
For that case , it then checks YAWS_HEART_RESTARTS and YAWS_HEART_START to see how many restarts we ’ve seen since the start time .
We get the current UNIX time and subtract the YAWS_HEART_START time ; if it ’s less than or equal to 60 seconds and the restart count is 5 , we exit completely without restarting the Erlang runtime .
Otherwise we restart , first adjusting these environment variables .
If the restart count is less than 5 within the 60 second window , we increment the restart count and set the new value into YAWS_HEART_RESTARTS but keep the same YAWS_HEART_START time .
But if the current time is more than 60 seconds past the start time , we reset YAWS_HEART_RESTARTS to 1 and set a new start time for YAWS_HEART_START .
Look at the yaws script to see the details of this logic — scroll down to the part starting with if [ " $ HEART " = true ] .

It 's one of the most fabled talents in the animal world  elephants ' ability to " talk " via rumbles in the earth .
Now zoologists in Namibia are trying to harness these seismic social calls - to lure rampaging males back to safety .
They played the low rumble of a female on heat to bulls in must ( a state of sexual readiness ) , who turned and headed for the vibration source .
The tool could help save elephants from Etosha National Park from the risk of violent conflicts with farmers .
The trials are being led by Dr Caitlin O'Connell - Rodwell , of Stanford University .
She told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Chicago that park rangers are " very excited " about the prospect of using the technique to protect the endangered animals .
" The bulls in must were very responsive .
We have shown that we can set the elephants on a very specific trajectory , " said Dr O'Connell - Rodwell .
" At the watering hole , we waited for them to arrive , and then used the calls to set them on one path , and then turn them back round again .
" You see the male in the video pressing his trunk against the ground .
He 's on a mission  he 's looking for that female in oestrus , " she said .
" The response was intense and so directed .
We were not expecting such intensity .
" We suggest this could be used as a tool by the park rangers  to help the elephants to stay out of trouble .
" The Namibian Environment Ministry is very interested , " Dr O'Connell - Rodwell added .
Damage Elephants are renowned for their ability to detect vibrations through the ground at great distances .
These include the mating calls of females who are in oestrus  or on heat , a phase which only occurs every five years .
Nobody has really thought of using these calls in this way before
Dr Caitlin O'Connell - Rodwell Dr O'Connell - Rodwell wondered if this could be harnessed to lure stray elephants back into Etosha National Parks , where they are protected .
There have been violent conflicts between elephants and farmers in many regions of Africa .
Elephants damage crops , break water installations and may end up being shot .
" It 's very difficult to get them back into the park .
Someone ends up getting hurt , " said Dr O'Connell - Rodwell " I have been studying elephant behaviour for 15 years and it has always been in the back of my mind  could we use this behaviour to reduce the crisis which is going on out there ? "
" Nobody has really thought of using these calls in this way before , " she said .
Buried speaker
To test her idea , Dr O'Connell - Rodwell used a speaker buried in the ground to play the oestrus call to males .
The call is a low rumble , barely audible to humans , as it falls at the lower limit of our hearing frequency range .
The researchers played the call to 26 bull male elephants in three classes : adults who were in must ; adults who were not ; and sub - adult males .
The bulls in must were " particularly responsive " .
How far away the elephants can sense vibrations is still a mystery , says Dr O'Connell - Rodwell .
The sound travels through their fore - legs and up through their bones to the middle ear bone .
While they can hear mating calls at distances of up to 10 km ( six miles ) , they may be able to sense the vibrations even further .
" In this experiment , we only played the calls at 500 m , but we think it would work at much further distances .
Males have been shown to respond at up to two km , " said Dr O'Connell - Rodwell .
Big difference
She admitted that 500 m " does n't sound like a lot , until you try to corral a bull elephant in must .
" Even if the rangers can move an elephant bit by bit - 500 m , and then another 500 m , and then another , they can make a big difference , " she said .
" We have modelled this in a quiet area of a national park , but we would like to try it in a noisier environment .
" There is evidence that elephants are being increasingly disturbed by noise , " Dr O'Connell - Rodwell said .
" We do n't know how much they rely on vibrations , as compared to audible sounds . "
The research was funded by Utopia Scientific , a non-profit organisation .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Israel will go along with President Barack Obama ’s Iran diplomacy , but try to shorten the deadline for results by signaling its willingness to attack Iranian nuclear sites if need be .
Israel votes on Tuesday and its next prime minister -- the front - runner is rightwinger Benjamin Netanyahu -- is likely to go to Washington within a few months and press Obama to stick to his campaign promise not to let Iran develop an atomic bomb .
Aaron David Miller , a former U.S. Middle East negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , said the visit would entail a “ strategic conversation ” with Obama .
“ It need not be conclusive or threatening , but it will be very serious and ... scare the daylights out of the president that unless the international community mobilizes to address the situation , the Israelis will , ” Miller said .
Unlike his predecessor , George W. Bush , Obama has offered direct talks with Tehran .
But he has yet to define his policy , which officials say is under review .
He has spoken of tougher sanctions if needed and has not excluded military action .
Israelis fret that diplomatic overtures will only give Iran more time to perfect its uranium enrichment program -- which the Iranians say is meant to produce electricity , not bombs .
The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has found no proof of Iranian nuclear bomb - making .
But the West sees as sinister Iran ’s refusal to stop enriching uranium -- an activity it is permitted as a Non-Proliferation Treaty signatory .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called this week for a “ strategic agreement ” with Washington to ensure that any talks with the Iranians “ should be kept short and followed by harsh sanctions and readiness to take action . ”
ONE - YEAR WINDOW
And an Israeli legislator and weapons expert , Isaac Ben-Israel , said his country had a year or so to attack Iranian nuclear sites pre-emptively and could do so on its own , even if such strikes would only delay , not destroy , Iran ’s program .
Iranian officials dismiss the chance of a blitz by Israel , assumed to be the Middle East ’s only nuclear power , but say Iran would retaliate against Israeli and U.S. interests if attacked .
“ We are not worried about an Israeli attack , ” Aliakbar Javanfekr , an aide to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , told Reuters last week , adding that “ wise people ” in the United States and Europe would restrain the Israelis .
Any Israeli bombing would unleash more chaos in the Middle East and global oil markets , inevitably entangling the United States and its Gulf Arab allies , and posing ferocious new challenges to U.S. involvements in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Ali Ansari , an Iran scholar at St Andrews University in Scotland , said an Israeli strike would be catastrophic and that discussion of it aimed at sabotaging any U.S. - Iran dialogue .
“ It ’s extraordinarily unlikely .
It would completely hamstring the Obama administration , ” he declared .
Others are less ready to rule it out .
Mark Fitzpatrick , senior fellow for non-proliferation at London ’s Institute for Strategic Studies , said an Israeli attack was “ a significant possibility , but not a probability . ”
Israel , he said , is focused on a short period before Iran can produce enough low - enriched uranium to store secretly for later enrichment to weapons grade and potential use in a bomb .
“ That point will probably be some time toward the end of this year , ” Fitzpatrick said .
Israel would then have to weigh the efficacy of any attack against its negative consequences .
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said this week Iran would need another two to five years to achieve nuclear weapons capacity , citing CIA and other U.S. intelligence estimates .

GREEN LIGHT
Many analysts argue that Israel could not act without a green light from Washington -- particularly since the direct route to Iran lies through U.S. - managed Iraqi air space .
“ My sense is , on something like this the no-surprise rule will apply , ” said Daniel Levy , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation .
“ America will have the opportunity to red - light it .
Therefore I do n’t think it ’s in any way imminent . ”
Miller concurred .
“ For the Israelis to be the Lone Ranger on this is almost unimaginable , ” he said .
Fitzpatrick said Obama stood a better chance than Bush of achieving early diplomatic progress to stay Israel ’s hand .
“ He is probably more likely to be able to persuade other states to take tougher sanctions measures precisely because it would be coupled with an outreach to Iran , ” he said .
China and Russia , which both wield veto power on the U.N. Security Council , have resisted tighter sanctions , especially after U.S. intelligence agencies said in December 2007 they believed Iran had halted its nuclear arms program in 2003 .
But Miller said he doubted Obama ’s diplomacy would swiftly produce a grand bargain with Iran or prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon “ however nice the music sounds . ”
“ It will not be effective enough to retard that point at which the Iranians will be perceived to have gone beyond the point of no return -- even if they have not , ” he said .
“ The Israelis will be pushing us to ensure that Iran never gets to that point and failing that , they will consider a military strike , ” Miller added .
Israelis are haunted by the Holocaust , alarmed at Iranian rhetoric and enmeshed in the narrow calculus of survival , not the global strategic considerations of their U.S. ally .
And they are determined to maintain the regional military supremacy that a nuclear - armed Iran would threaten .
Israel ’s recent onslaught on Iranian - backed Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip was a message to Tehran , said an analyst for Janusian , a security and political risk consultancy in London .
“ This is the death and destruction they can rain down on anyone who threatens them . ”

PARIS -- Most Americans do n't care what happens in France .
But the oldest country in " Old Europe " remains the Western world 's intellectual capital and one of its primary originators of political trends .
( Google " May +1968 +Sorbonne . " )
The French are reacting to a situation almost identical to ours -- economic collapse , government impotence , corporate corruption -- by turning hard left .
National strikes and massive demonstrations are occurring every few weeks .
How far left ?
This far : the late president François Mitterand 's Socialist Party , the rough equivalent of America 's Greens , is considered too conservative to solve the economic crisis .
A new poll by the Parisian daily Libération finds 53 percent of French voters ( 68 percent of 18 - to - 24 - year - olds ) favoring " radical social change . "
Fifty - seven percent want France to insulate itself from the global economic system .
Does this mean revolution ?
It 's certainly possible .
Or maybe counter - revolution : Jean - Marie Le Pen 's nativist ( some would say neofascist ) National Front is also picking up points .
One thing is certain : French politics are even more volatile than the financial markets these days .
In yet another indication of How Far Left ? , the Communist - aligned CGT labor union is on the defensive for not being militant enough .
" We 're not going to put out the blazing fires [ of the economic crisis ] , " the CGT 's secretary general said , trying to seize the initiative by calling for another strike on February 18th .
" We 're going to fan them . "
Two new entities , a Left Party ( PG ) umbrella organization trying to unify opposition to the conservative government of President Nicolas Sarkozy ( who'd be to the left of Obama in the U.S. ) and the New Anticapitalist Party ( NPA ) , have seized the popular imagination .
The NPA claims to have registered more than 9000 " militants " willing to use violent force to overthrow the government if given the word .
" Only combat pays , " read a banner at the NPA 's first convention .
Communism is dead , most pundits -- the mainstream , stupid ones anyway -- have been telling us since the USSR shut down in 1991 .
As it turns out , the libertarians were wrong .
Half - right , anyway : Human nature may be inherently individualistic , as free market capitalists claim , but it 's also inherently social .
When economies boom , most people are sufficiently satisfied to leave well enough alone .
Who cares if my boss gets paid 100 times more than I do ?
I 'm doing OK .
As resources become scarce , however , we huddle together for protection .
The sight of a small rich elite hoarding all the goodies violates our primal sense of fairness .
" In Soviet times , " a man in present - day Tajikistan told me , " we lived worse than we do today .
But we were all the same .
Now we live a bit better , but we have to watch rich assholes pass us in their Benzes . "
Which would he choose ?
No hesitation : " Soviet times . "
In America , a French cliché goes , people are afraid of the government .
In France , the government is afraid of the people .
With good reason , too : the French have overthrown their governments dozens of times since the Revolution of 1789 .
The French are hard wired with class consciousness .
Strikes , demonstrations and general hell - raising are festive occasions .
Only when things spin totally out of control -- as when Muslim youths rioted in the suburbs of Paris and other cities -- are conservatives like Sarkozy able to make headway .
Riots over police brutality by disenfranchised minorities make the French nervous .
But contempt for American - style " harsh capitalism , " where citizens pay $ 800 a month for healthcare and write nary a letter to their local newspaper to complain , is 100 percent mainstream .
The French do n't think they should have to suffer just because some greedy bankers went on a looting spree .
Even Sarkozy is getting the message .
" We do n't want a European May ' 68 in the middle of Christmas , " he warned his ministers in December .
He shelved proposals to loosen regulation of business .
Arnaud Lagardère , CEO of the Lagardère Group , told the financial daily Les Echos : " We 're seeing , in renewed form , the most debatable aspects of Anglo - Saxon capitalism called into question . "
The French and Americans face similar problems .
But their temperamental differences lead them to different conclusions .
An average working - class Frenchman possesses a deeper understanding of economics , politics , history and economics than most college professors in the U.S.
Go to a bar or café , and sports will be on the television -- but not on people 's lips .
They 're talking politics and how to force their leaders to protect their quality of life .
Americans , on the other hand , do n't expect direct help from their government .
They 're giving Barack Obama time to see whether his economic recovery program will work .
It wo n't , of course ; economists say so .
But indolent hopefulness is less work than chucking Molotov cocktails .
Back in France , the NPA sets off rhetorical bombs Americans would n't dream of .
" We 're not a boutique party out to get votes , or an institutional mainstream party , but a party of militants , " says the NPA 's leader to the Le Monde newspaper .
" We 're real leftists , not official leftists . "
The NPA is currently negotiating a temporary alliance of convenience with the Communists .
A communist revolution in western Europe would be greeted by curiosity and derision in the U.S. state - controlled media .
But if such a social upheaval were to protect French living standards from a global Depression spinning out of control , it might also prove inspiring to increasingly desperate Americans .

One Party Rule Forever !
Because the mainstream press refuses to see anything wrong in the Obama administration , even the most outrageous actions are given astonishingly gentle treatment -- if they get any treatment at all .
So of course we hear almost nothing about the coup d'etat that is under way in the White House .
People have been talking about a " historic realignment , " but of course that is nonsense .
Most Americans report mostly conservative viewpoints on most issues .
That has n't changed .
What will change , apparently , is how many voters the Obama administration can produce out of thin air to swing the next election .
And as many elections as possible after that .
How is Obama going to accomplish this ?
He has just moved the constitutionally - required Census from the Commerce Department to the White House -- specifically putting it under the thumb of his political strategist , Rahm Emanuel .
The Census was n't broke .
So why is Obama fixing it ?
Here 's why it matters :
1 . When the Census takes place in 2010 , the results will be used to determine which states lose seats in the House of Representatives , and which gain .
This also determines which states lose electoral votes , and which gain .
2 . For many decades population has been shifting from the big northeastern states to the sunbelt .
There is no reason to suppose that the trend is changing , except that California may join the ranks of states losing population this time around .
3 . The states that losing seats and electoral votes have been mostly states that Democrats count on to deliver big chunks of their vote .
The states that gain have been , as often as not , those that deliver their votes to the Republicans .
Of course , as liberals move from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt , they bring their voting habits with them , and some states that used to be solidly Republican are now swing states .
But this is not enough for the Democrats .
Remember , the Democratic Party is the one that tried to steal the 2000 presidential election by a highly selective recount in Florida ; and when that did n't work , the solidly liberal Florida supreme court selectively nullified any election law that might prevent the theft of the election .
Only the U.S. Supreme Court put a stop to this openly partisan attempt at election theft .
Well , they 're at it again .
In a nation that is almost evenly divided between Left and Right -- with a slight lean , most of the time , toward the right -- Obama and Emanuel already have the tools that will allow them to do to the country as a whole what was attempted in Florida .
This will be done by the use of statistical manipulation based on highly doubtful premises .
We have been hearing for years about how the homeless , the poor , and illegal immigrants have all been " undercounted " in the census .
Either they can't be found -- or they hide from census officials .
Since these groups tend to vote for the Democratic Party , naturally Democrats have been very concerned to make sure these people are counted in the census .
How many of them are there ?
Millions , say some .
We have no idea , say the honest .
" But if we do n't count them , then the states that bear the biggest burden of dealing with the homeless , the poor , and illegal immigrants do n't get their fair share of federal dollars and programs ! "
Here 's an idea -- adjust those dollars and those programs to target those states .
But no , the Left wants to go after the Census itself .
They want to " adjust " the Census by adding " estimated " numbers of uncounted homeless , poor , and illegal immigrants .
This is functionally identical to the practice of the old Democratic Party machine in Illinois , where dead Democratic voters in Chicago turned out in large enough numbers to counterbalance all the Republican votes downstate .
Now it wo n't matter how many voters there are .
If the Census has been jimmied to give Democratic - leaning states more congressional seats and more electoral votes than the actual count of real people would justify , the Democrats will have their " historic realignment " without having to actually persuade anybody new to vote for their candidates .
And Obama has set himself up to rig all future American elections , not through any democratic process , but by fiat .
Just like a dictator .
Remember how , when the Patriot Act was passed , we were flooded with outraged stories in the press about how Americans ' rights were going to be trampled on ?
None of it came true .
But now we have a genuine attack on the roots of the Constitution and the principle of counting only people who can be proven to exist when apportioning the House of Representatives .
It 's a naked grab for power .
It 's a coup d'etat .
And the so - called freedom - lovers in the Leftist media are absolutely silent about it .
If Bush had put Karl Rove in charge of the Census without so much as asking Congress for permission , the howls and screams would have been deafening .
Obama does the identical thing ... and the freedom - loving Left is fine with it .
Because they do n't love freedom .
They just love having their views prevail , without regard to democracy or human rights .
And just in case the American people might hear about this naked power grab by Obama , the Democratic Party has n't given up yet on their effort to apply the Fairness Doctrine to radio -- and only radio -- so that they can selectively kill free speech and press freedom where it will damage only Republicans and Conservatives .
The Democratic Party has demonstrated , time and time again , their absolute hatred of Democracy .
They hated Bush for bringing democracy to Muslim countries that used to sponsor terrorism .
They hate it when Americans who disagree with them use their Constitutional rights to speak out for their viewpoint .
And , most of all , they hate democracy when it leads to their losing power .
The years of Republican control of Congress made them so insane that they obviously have vowed : Never again .
No matter how stupidly those ordinary Americans vote , they 're going to fudge the Census so that Democrats will always keep the White House and the House of Representatives .
If this is allowed to stand , we will never have an honest Census , or an honest election , again .
What can we do ?
Lobby your state governments to file suit in the Supreme Court , challenging the right of the President to control the Census .
And if that does n't work , lobby your state legislatures to call for a new Constitutional Convention in order to pass a Constitutional Amendment that requires that the Census be conducted by an independent agency , which is allowed to count only living people who are actually located and named , with no " estimates " and no fudging .
Obama and Emanuel and others involved in this coup are counting on the media to sweep this under the rug , so that Americans wo n't get all agitated about something as dull as the Census .
So do n't let yourself get bored or distracted .
Your vote is about to be discounted .
Your most basic freedom as an American -- the right to vote and have a real chance at changing things -- is being taken away .
Check with your friends in Mexico and Cuba and the old Communist bloc about how much they enjoyed generations of one - party rule .
Because that 's what Obama decided to try for in his first month in office .
We ’re almost done with first week in January : the week where more New Year ’s resolutions are broken than any other .
25 % of New Year ’s resolutions are broken in the first week alone .
Within 6 months , over half of New Year Resolvers will have given up .
Why ?
Why is it that so many resolutions are doomed from the start ?
Here ’s one major reason I ’ve found with clients :
You need to learn how to balance these new resolutions with your prior commitments .
You ’re Already Busy
Resolutions usually involve new commitments .
The problem is : you ’re already busy .
Imagine this : if on December 31st , you were already living a life where every moment of the day was filled with something – how can you do everything you ’ve always done , and squeeze in time for new things on January 1 ?
So the change is n’t just starting new resolutions …
You also need to take this opportunity to sharpen your focus , and give up on a few things .
The answer is :
Commit to doing less of some things : so you can do the important things better .
The simplest way I ’ve found of letting go is to actively decide what I will work on right now – and what I ’m going to let fall to “ maybe ” in my life .
How ?
You make two lists :
Your “ Todo ” List – The things you are working on today , this week , this month … anything you are actually working on
– The things you are working on today , this week , this month … anything you are actually working on Your “ Someday ” List – Low priority projects that you know you ca n’t commit time to – and you accept that they wo n’t get worked on until “ Someday ” in the future ( which could be never )
The Someday List
Very briefly , the Someday list is my list of items that I intend to get to “ Someday . ”
So working out may be something that is on my Todo list right now , because I know I am going to do that today and throughout this week .
On the other hand , some books I am planning to write are sitting on the “ Someday ” lis .
They are projects I would like to work on , but they are not important enough to me to make it on my Todo list right now … .
And maybe they never will .
Every week or two , I review the items on that list .
If I decide I am ready to begin a project that week …
I move it from Someday into my normal Todo List .
I can hear the question now …
If it ’s on your Someday list and it never gets done , what ’s the point ?
The Point Is …Prioritizing
If you do n’t explicitly decide what is on your Someday list , you implicitly put everything you are n’t actively working on on it .
Do you have a dream of running a marathon ?
Starting your own business ?
Writing a book ?
If you do n’t actively take action on it then you are already letting it be pushed off into the future – by the day - to - day things that come up and happen .
What To Do Today – Vs “ Someday ”
And truthfully – some of those “ emergencies ” do n’t need to be dealt with today – or sometimes ever .
Save those low - value , time - consuming tasks for “ Someday ” – and make today a day that matters to you .
Do n’t be a statistic – do n’t be one of the 25 % who gives up this first week !
There ’s still time to turn it around .
And do n’t worry if you do n’t feel this moment , or this year , or this week , or this situation is n’t “ exactly right . ”
You do n’t need “ exactly right ” on the outside to make a change – you just need to take action , right now .
“ If we wait for the moment when everything , absolutely everything is ready , we shall never begin . ”

Nobody would have heard the muffled screams as Abid 's interrogators set about their victim with clinical brutality .
Tied to a chair and with his face badly beaten he could only plead for his life and was ready to admit to anything .
" They said if I screamed then they 'd hurt me more .
The pain was unbelievable , " Abid recalls .
It sounds like the testimony of a prisoner in some despot regime 's jail but the reality is that such violent scenes are being enacted undetected in Britain practically every day .
Abid - not his real name - is just one of hundreds of people who are the silent victims of kidnapping each year in the UK .

You are unlikely to hear about their cases in the news because the vast majority are so - called " bad on bad " kidnappings - criminals capturing and torturing others involved in organised crime .
It 's been going on since the days of the Kray Twins and earlier but today 's kidnappers are that much more ruthless and are prepared to ' lift ' or ' jack ' people , as they call it , over the most trivial of disputes .
Over the past few weeks I have heard the stories of seven victims from the West Midlands .
Torture Abid had stolen a few hundred pounds from his drug suppliers and even though he was prepared to pay the money back , they continued to beat him to send out a message to other potential defaulters .
" I must have said ' Let me make a phone call ' about 20 times , " he said .
" But they were intent to teach me a lesson so they would n't look soft if someone else did it .
" Next thing that happened is the guy put a tow rope round my neck and held me down and all three lads , big lads bigger than me , they said if you resist we 'll beat you bad . "
I have been shown round a garage which used to be used as a torture chamber .
My guide was Tariq - not his real name - a former street gang leader with convictions ranging from armed robbery to attempted murder .
They'd be like a choking chicken .
Back arches , eyes roll over , total devastation
' Tariq ' , former gangster He showed me a sun bed which he used to burn victims , and an old car battery with jump leads he used to administer an electric shock .
" This is famous sparky , " Tariq told me .
" We would damp the victim down with a wet sponge , and then the minute we put the electrodes on it would give off sparks .
" They 'd be like a choking chicken .
Back arches , eyes roll over , total devastation . "
Abid survived his four - hour ordeal after calling his mother who agreed to pay his drug debt .
" When she opened the door she just cried , " said Abid , who needed hospital treatment for broken fingers , ribs and a fractured cheekbone .
Victims like Abid are understandably reluctant to go to the police , fearing further reprisals or because they are involved in crime themselves .
" These people were very well connected in the area and it would have only taken a little phone call to get me lifted again .
The area I come from , no - one tolerates a grass . "
Wall of silence
The police know about hundreds of cases of kidnap each year , but they believe there are probably many more cases they do not find out about because the victims are mainly criminals themselves .
Suzanne Williams , the former head of the Metropolitan Police 's kidnap unit and a leading hostage negotiator , says that although those related to the victims are often reluctant to report such kidnappings , when the police get involved they manage to get the hostage back in virtually every case .
She said , " The priority for the police is always the saving of life rather than a prosecution . "
Former police officer Kirk Dawes now works as a mediator between rival gangs in inner city Birmingham and says kidnapping is becoming as fashionable as the gun as the weapon of choice in gangland circles .
" They 've realised that shooting someone is n't going to get them their money back , " he said .
" I 've heard of youths being snatched off the streets in broad daylight and severely beaten over a £ 10 - £ 20 debt .
Or increasingly now there 's not even money involved - it 's about someone disrespecting another .
" The victim may be released after a few hours but the kidnappers will still try and hold sway over him after that .
" That 's how a lot of people get caught up in carrying out a gang 's dirty work .
They are forced to do it because they once owed . "
Innocent victims
But it is not just disputes over money and respect which are being solved through kidnap .
And not all the victims are criminals .
I spoke to an Asian former gang leader who has kidnapped victims in the UK over family feuds and disputes originating in the sub-continent .
The problem is escalating .
I 've heard of innocent girlfriends and sisters being abducted off the streets and sexually assaulted
Kirk Dawes , gang mediator
Tony - not his real name - admits people within his community used to hire him to track down runaway brides and that branching out to kidnapping was just him " diversifying my skills . "
" I had a case once where a councillor in Kashmir was refusing to stand down so his opponents called me and I kidnapped his brothers who lived in the Midlands , " said Tony .
" We held them for a few days until the elections in Kashmir were over and the councillor had resigned . "
Kirk Dawes believes kidnapping is on the rise .
He says it exists in any community where there is organised crime .
" The problem is escalating .
I 've heard of innocent girlfriends and sisters being abducted off the streets and sexually assaulted .
I 've heard of threats being made against children but thankfully I 've not seen it happen yet . "

Occasionally bringing you the most irrelevant and / or irreverent nonsense of our times ... when we feel like it .
Commence reading plebs !
Mere days after Wikipedia put up its new and improved plea for donations , the company has already met its goal of raising $ 6 million .
The campaign , headed up by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales , asked users to dig deep into their pockets and couch cushions to help the Wikimedia Foundation keep the site running .
Now that the organization has met its goal , Wales has posted an update saying that the lights will be kept on through the remainder of the fiscal year ( until June 30 , 2009 ) .
In the letter , Wales says that 125,000 individuals have donated since July 2008 , totaling $ 4 million in personal donations .
The foundation has also received " major gifts " to the tune of $ 2 million .
The money will go towards server costs , bandwidth , and 23 staff members , as well as the development of open source software , outreach events , and other volunteer work .
In a statement sent via e-mail , the Wikimedia foundation said that this year 's campaign has been the most ambitious yet , and that after Wales ' plea was posted to the website just before Christmas , a " surge of more than 50,000 contributions " came in , closing the gap towards the $ 6 million goal .
Jimmy Wales thanks you Jimmy Wales thanks you
Of course , even though the organization is funded for another six months does n't mean it wants people to stop donating .
" Any donations beyond our $ 6 million goal are put in a reserve fund , which will help us to offset operating costs beyond the current fiscal year , " wrote Wales .
" Your continued support will also serve as a much - needed financial safety net if economic conditions continue to worsen globally . "
It 's heartwarming to know that the global online community is helping out a mainstay of the Internet by donating , though some critics still believe the Wikimedia foundation should consider running ads on the site — an option that the organization has been adamantly against for some time now .
There are also others who believe that Wikipedia has especially high administrative costs , but Wales insisted in a recent e-mail to Ars that this is not true .
" We are an astoundingly effective charity with a tiny budget , " Wales told Ars .
" The idea that our budget is ' bloated ' is ludicrous — we run the 4th most popular website in the world for $ 6 million a year . "
While donations have been slower to pour in this year at places like National Public Radio , Wikipedia has clearly shown that its users truly are what keeps the site alive , both financially and through their volunteer efforts .
RAMALLAH  Despite intensive efforts by Israel , the international community and a number of Arab leaders to weaken and destroy Hamas through economic , punitive and military action , the Islamist organization continues to be a force to reckon with .
Hamas won free and fair democratic elections in January 2006 .
The U.S. pushed for these elections , which were monitored by international observers including ex-U.S. president Jimmy Carter , and Israel permitted them to be held .
Hamas has since then been dominant , though it took effective control in June 2007 , more than a year after its election victory .
The Gaza Strip , which the resistance group controls , took a serious battering during Israel ’s 22 - day military assault , codenamed Operation Cast Lead .
The coastal territory has also been economically crippled by nearly two years of an Israeli embargo which has hermetically sealed Gaza off from the rest of the world , preventing the import of all but a tiny flow of humanitarian aid and goods .
Israel purportedly carried out the military operation to stop Palestinian rockets from hitting Israeli cities and towns bordering the Gaza Strip .
However , rocket fire on Israel had virtually ceased in the five months of cease - fire between Israel and Hamas which preceded an Israeli cross - border military operation into Gaza on Nov. 4 .
This operation provoked a barrage of retaliatory missiles on Israel .
Prior to Operation Cast Lead , a delegation of British parliamentarians met with Hamas leaders in Gaza .
The parliamentarians were told that Hamas would be prepared to accept Israel ’s existence , within the internationally recognized borders of 1967 , provided the Jewish state legitimized the rights of Palestinians in return .
Despite the immense scale of death and destruction wrought by Operation Cast Lead , which left over 1,300 Palestinians , mostly civilians , dead , rockets continue to be fired at Israel in spite of disproportionate responses from the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) .
Following the recent cease - fire most of Hamas ’s leadership emerged from underground bunkers unscathed .
The digging of smuggling tunnels for everyday necessities as well as arms has resumed .
Furthermore , there are also growing signs that the Europeans , some Israelis and previous Arab opponents are resigned to factoring Hamas into any political equation to address a resolution of the conflict .
Last week after several days of intensive diplomatic pressure , the Israeli government managed to stymie a French initiative to weaken the Jewish state ’s stance on Hamas .
Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels , France tried to change a pre-written closing statement released by the ministers regarding the cease - fire between Hamas and Israel .
Paris wanted the statement to say that the EU would be prepared to hold talks with a future Palestinian unity government which included Hamas as long as it agreed to honor the principles of the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Additionally , the French delegation to Brussels proposed opening Israeli border crossings into Gaza immediately without any conditions .
A previous agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in 2005 stipulated that the PA had to control the crossings .
However , following intervention by Israel , the Czech Republic  the current holder of the EU presidency  Germany , Italy and the Netherlands pushed the French initiative off the agenda .
Israel viewed the French move as an attempt to get the Quartet for Middle East peace  the UN , the U.S. , Russia and the EU  to soften its conditions for international recognition of Hamas .
A senior Israeli official said that since the end of the Gaza operation , his country was concerned about a possible break in European support for the boycott of the Hamas government in Gaza .
U.S. President Barack Obama ’s Mideast envoy , George Mitchell , met French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in Paris recently .
During the meeting the Gaza cease - fire was discussed and Kouchner stressed the need for inter-Palestinian dialogue and for the border crossings into Gaza to be reopened .
Kouchner again suggested France was open to the idea of a unity government if Hamas softened its stance .
Meanwhile , Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin told reporters in Damascus on Monday that some kind of engagement with Hamas may have to feature in future European Union policy .
Hamas ’s erstwhile foe and bitter rival Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , who controls the West Bank , also discussed the issue with French President Nicholas Sarkozy in Paris on Monday .
Abbas too called for a unity Palestinian government and said Hamas ’s inclusion was imperative as long as it recognized his supreme authority .
On Monday Sarkozy also met Qatar ’s Prime Minister , Sheik Hamad bin Jassem al - Thani , whose Persian Gulf country has emerged as a regional mediator since helping to resolve a political crisis in Lebanon last year .
Al - Thani insisted Hamas should not be sidelined from peace efforts .
" We must work for a government of national unity between the Palestinians .
There should not be efforts to delete or distance one of the Palestinian parties present on the ground , " al - Thani told reporters .
Israeli columnist and analyst Akiva Eldar noted in the daily Haaretz that Israel ’s continual denial of the reality of Hamas as a legitimate political entity was short - sighted .
For 20 years Israel has tried to destroy the movement using carrots and sticks alternately .
The only difference between the ruling Kadima party ’s leader and minister of foreign affairs , Tzipi Livni , and the more right - wing opposition Likud party leader Binyamin Netanyahu is the size of the clubs to be used , argued Eldar .
" Precisely because of the many children killed in Gaza , Cast Lead has been assured a place of honor in the ethos of the struggle of the Palestinian David , armed with primitive Qassams , and the Israeli Goliath , with his F - 16s , " said Eldar .
" When they hear the proud declarations of Israel ’s leaders , to the effect that deterrence has been restored , Hamas ’s leaders certainly laugh themselves to death , and not just because of the rockets that continue to fall on the people of Ashkelon .
" The threat of a few more bombs on Gaza deters them like the death penalty deters a suicide bomber on the way to carry out an attack , " said Eldar .
Only a long - term cease - fire , it seems , accompanied by a real diplomatic context , can pull the rug of popular support out from under Hamas and restore it to its natural proportions .
In his first few weeks in office , sometime between celebratory bill signings and phone calls from foreign leaders , President Obama sat in the Oval Office for the most somber task of his presidency - penning letters to families of troops killed in combat .
“ This was real , it was personal , it was so important to us , ” said Thya Merz , whose son Marine Lance Cpl. Julian Brennan was killed Jan. 24 in Afghanistan .
The letter was signed “ Barack , ” Ms. Merz told The Washington Times .
“ Not ‘ president , ’ just his first name , and it just felt like , OK , my son has been acknowledged , ” she said .
Mr. Obama personalizes each letter , asking staffers to gather details about the service member , such as their hometown and where they were stationed , a White House aide said .
The letters are sent to parents and spouses , and sometimes children of the fallen troops .
The president writes the notes by hand , then the letters are typed before he adds his signature .
Mr. Obama wrote the first few letters for troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan while George W. Bush was president , and has written at least a dozen more since taking office .
The president told NBC News that the duty falls to him , though he did not initiate the wars and opposed the invasion of Iraq .
In those moments of signing the letters , he said , “ you realize every decision you make counts . ”
The White House declined to release any of the private letters or the names of families who received them , but The Times spoke with some who shared the contents of their letters .
Cpl. Brennan , 25 , was supporting combat operations in Afghanistan ’s Farah province when he was killed last month .
Ms. Merz said the president ’s letter to her family in honor of her son was “ lovely ” and added , “ It is meaningful to have Julian ’s death noted personally by him . ”
Six weeks before Cpl. Brennan was deployed , the Brooklyn resident married his fiancee to make sure she would have benefits if he was killed abroad .
Ms. Merz said she and her son often talked about national service .
Like the president , she opposed the war in Iraq .
As for Afghanistan , she described herself as ambivalent , but said that she and her son came to an agreement that “ if our nation was going to engage in military action , everybody should serve . ”
As a parent of someone in combat , she realized , “ I no longer have the privilege of saying I do n’t agree and not paying attention to what our nation was doing , ” she said .
Ms. Merz said she was struck by the personal tone of Mr. Obama ’s letter , which arrived before the official correspondence from Congress , and she was n’t sure whether they were his words or those of a staffer .
When told by The Times that Mr. Obama writes the letters himself , she said the words became more powerful .
“ It says to me that he , too , will be paying attention to more than just the numbers , but the real stories , ” Ms. Merz said .
“ One of the things I felt committed to even though I did n’t agree with our military ventures was reading the names of the troops killed as they were listed , ” she said .
“ I just need to think about these people as individuals , and I hope that as a nation we are doing that and seeing them as real sons and daughters . ”
She added that Cpl. Brennan was “ just beginning to grasp the real life of the Afghanis around him , feeling very committed to the human side of what was happening in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
Their last conversation was on Inauguration Day , four days before Cpl. Brennan was killed by a roadside bomb .
Both supported Mr. Obama ’s election , but they spoke that day about the Afghan people , she said .
Ms. Merz said she had been considering making the trip from New York to Washington for the inaugural festivities , but “ I ’m glad I did n’t .
I was home to get my son ’s call . ”
“ I am so glad the president is trying to do the right thing personally in terms of families and the soldiers , ” she said .
“ He has a monumental task in front of him . ”
As Mr. Obama adjusts to the traditions bestowed upon the president as commander in chief , the duty is far different from saluting the Marine standing next to his Marine One helicopter or getting used to people standing when he walks into the room .
The president said on NBC News that the letters serve as a reminder - “ that you ’ve got hundreds of thousands of people - around the world who are putting themselves in harm ’s way and you are the commander in chief . ”
The White House said copies of the letters are preserved for historical archives .
The aide described the letters as “ very gracious ” but would not share the text because of the sensitive and personal nature of their content .
The letters mention that the president appreciates the service member ’s sacrifice .
While serving as a U.S. senator , Mr. Obama would send families of Illinois service members condolence letters and an American flag that had flown over the Capitol .
Some he would call personally .
Mr. Bush also sent personal letters to the families of every one of the more than 4,000 troops who have died in the two wars , he told The Times in an interview last year .
He said he leaned on his wife , Laura , for support in the gut - wrenching task .
Mr. Bush also met privately with more than 500 families of troops killed in action and with more than 950 wounded veterans , said Carlton Carroll , a White House spokesman during the Bush administration .
“ Everything you do matters , ” Mr. Obama told Fox News a few days after the NBC interview .
“ I ’m now signing letters to the families of troops who have fallen in Iraq or Afghanistan .
“ Every time you sign that , you are reminded that you have enormous responsibilities and so , that ’s why all of these debates - when I ’m talking to Democrats or Republicans , one of the things I try to remind them and something I remind myself every single day is the only criteria for what I do should be - is it working for the American people ?
“ Because this job is too big , too important , to just want to occupy space , ” he said .
“ And if I ’ve spent the next four years , every day , making decisions based on that single criteria , is this going to help the American people achieve their dreams and keep them safe , then I ’ll be able to look at myself in the mirror and say , ‘ You know what , you did a good job . ’ ”

Location : in my bathroom
it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
You ’re just fucking envious .
And well you should be .
It is indescribably wondrous portaging a permanently attached watering hose .
Witness “ Man , Peeing in Garden ” , the epitome of casualness .
Few , if any , locations are off - limits when the urge is felt : parking garage , deck , the sink ... simply too many nouns to list .
Still , while decorum is abused , discretion is not -- more on this point in a moment .
Oh sure , many a woman has pee ’d outside of the pot , though strictly as a matter of urgency and with much reluctance and with great angst .
There is no female example of ‘ whipping it out . ’
In fact , yours is a complete show .
You fret about the location , the preparation , the sundries , minimizing dribble … christ almighty … it ’s a fifteen minute ordeal .
Men can sort of relate to your dilemma , like when we need to poop and there ’s no bathroom in sight .
Anyway , I pee in the sink .
I ’ve been peeing into bathroom sinks for years .
Convenience is my primary reason .
But there are many very good reasons to pee in a sink .
A few among them …I can multitask , which is important to me : both my hands are free to brush teeth , comb hair , apply hygiene products , etc .
I ’ve never done and empirical study , but I am certain in my gut that cumulative hours are saved annually by peeing in the sink .
It ’s environmentally conscientious .
I conserve water when I pee in the sink .
As I wash my hands or rinse my toothbrush , my pee is carried through the p-trap down into the sanitary line .
Toilet , sink — as George Castanza explained , “ It 's all pipes !
” It ’s the ‘ green ’ thing to do .
By peeing on dried toothpaste , solidified lungers , loose hair , and other lingering yuckiness stuck inside the sink , I save still more water and reduce phosphates and other nasty chemicals that might otherwise have been used to clean the sink .
It ’s considerate .
Regardless whether my girlie is sleeping , watching television , reading in silence , I do not disturb her with a cacophonous serenade of “ man - peeing - into - toilet - then - flushing ” .
Peeing into a sink is very quiet .
It ’s clean .
There is no toilet water splash nor urine splatter on walls , seat or in the crannies of the commode .
Here I bandy the duel argument of ‘ less work ’ ( by not scrubbing said surfaces after each use ) and , consequently , ‘ more green ’ ( requires less use of environmentally harmful cleaning chemicals ) .
Pee is , for the most part , sterile when it hits the sink , so no need to use expensive disinfectant .
Thus I submit another good , albeit tenuous , reason I pee in the sink : it saves money .
It builds “ relationship equity ” .
The seat is always down , which appears to my girlie as sublimely considerate and one those ‘ little things ’ I do for her .
This manifests , somehow , in better sex .
It ’s hygienic .
After my stream has diminished to a trickle , I splash a handful or two of water on my dick , thus washing it .
I have a clean dick and I put my dick up against the dick of any ‘ traditional ’ toilet user for some quantitative dick evaluation ; eg. : stiff test , taste test .
Rub my dick against glass and it squeaks .
I can think of violently few disadvantages to peeing in a sink .
Off the top of my head :- peeing into a sink after eating asparagus is very unpleasant ;- fishing a contact lens out of the sink while ‘ multitasking ’ is disturbing ; and , - reflexive tumescence may result from the splash of overly cold or hot water , which can have messy consequences .
I confess that a lifetime of casually whipping it out and lettin ’ go when and wherever has caused my ‘ Emergency Pee Shut Off ’ muscle — assuming it ever existed — to atrophy .
Richard Pryor was correct that a man cannot cut off his stream ‘ just like that ’.
I am aware that this technique d'avant garde might offend the eyeballs of an accidental witness , so I always exercise discretion when I pee in the sink .
That said , peeing in the sink is so routine for me that I am complacent , and I never thought up a contingency plan should someone walk in on me .
Just this morning my girlie busted me peeing in the sink , rather ( as I now understand ) , ‘ her ’ sink .
She fucking had a cow and slapped my dick … hard … like it was a big hairy fucking spider on the countertop .
Thus I know from experience that getting caught peeing in the sink does not garner even the tiniest , wee little bit of appreciation of or for any of those benefits I mentioned above .
Therefore , heed this exhortation : make damn site sure no one will walk in as you pee in the sink .
So there I am this morning , brushing my teeth in front of the mirror and quietly contemplating my day while a night ’s worth of pee drained out of my unlimbered dick laying in the sink .
My girlie sneaked up behind me topless as a playful , sexy morning surprise , and so intended , she was oblivious to my present commitment .
She might as well have tossed a glass of ice water on my back ‘ cause with the sudden and unexpected feeling of her hands around my midriff , I reflexively jerked up and away from the sink .
My flaccid dick tossed about mid-stream until I could completely close down the relief valve .
I was untethered for no more than .. what .. two seconds , but it seemed like I pee ’d on fucking everything , including her jewelry box and her basket of stretchy hair things , both of which she was real unhappy about upon discovery .
Miraculously , I missed her .
She was incredulous .
I sensed a radar - lock on my groin area and my hand moved instinctively to my protect my dick — but I was too slow .
With the speed of a fucking praying mantis , she lashed at my dick and nailed it good .
I hollered “ what the fuck ” , spewing frothy toothpaste on her , which only added to the indignity and intensified her fury .
It was a fucking show this morning in our , rather , her bathroom .
I did n’t learn any lessons this morning ( except maybe to lock the bathroom door ) .
I did learn that my girlie is irrational and uptight about this particular issue .
Frankly , fuck if I know what to do or what to say to her come this evening .
I ’m going to go to the restroom and take a good long look at myself in the mirror — mostly because I ’ll be peeing in the sink , but also to steel my nerve and strategize for tonite .
Britain is dumping its e-waste problem on Africa , with thousands of computers and other items shipped illegally to countries such as Nigeria and Ghana , according to reports .
Despite regulations prohibiting the trade in e-waste , a joint investigation by Greenpeace , The Independent and Sky News claims thousands of old electronic goods and components leave Britain bound for Africa and Asia every day .
In an undercover sting , Greenpeace and Sky took an unfixable TV , fitted it with a tracking device and brought it to Hampshire County Council for recycling .
" Instead of being safely dismantled in the UK or Europe , like it should have been , the council 's recycling company , BJ Electronics , passed it on as ' second - hand goods ' and it was shipped off to Nigeria to be sold or scrapped and dumped , " Greenpeace wrote in its blog .
" For the first time we were able to track the e-waste from door to door , exposing the loopholes in recycling programmes that allow illicit profits to be made by the developed world 's traders by dumping their obsolete and hazardous electronics abroad instead of properly recycling them . "
By law , under the European Union 's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( WEEE ) directive , e-waste must be dismantled or recycled by specialist contractors because of the toxic content of many electrical devices .
The three - year probe found , once dumped in Africa , the computers were stripped of their raw metals by young men and children working on poisoned waste dumps .
" Some will be repaired and reused , but many are beyond repair , meaning that they will eventually be dumped in places where no facilities exist for safe recycling , " said Greenpeace .
Hampshire County Council has launched an inquiry into its waste sites , but insisted that it worked only with dealers who exported functioning equipment .
Computer Aid International has been gathering signatures on an online petition that protests illegal dumping of e-waste .
The petition calls on the government to grant more powers and resources to the Environment Agency , in order for them to effectively police the UK Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( WEEE ) directive .
The non -profit group said : " Cowboy traders are illegally exporting hazardous and toxic electrical waste ( e- waste ) out of the UK , fraudulently claiming consignments consist entirely of electrical equipment destined for productive re-use , and then dumping it in developing countries such as Ghana , Nigeria and China . "

Found : the gene that could grow new teeth
A breakthrough by scientists could see dentures bite the dust .
Researchers have pinpointed the gene that governs the production of tooth enamel , raising the tantalising possibility of people one day growing extra teeth when needed .
At the very least , it could cut the need for painful fillings .
Fillings could become obsolete in the future
Experiments in mice have previously shown that the gene , a ' transcription factor ' called Ctip2 , is involved in the immune system and in the development of skin and nerves .
The latest research , from Oregon State University in the U.S. , adds enamel production to the list .
The researchers made the link by studying mice genetically engineered to lack the gene .
The animals were born with rudimentary teeth which were ready to erupt but lacked a proper covering of enamel , the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports .
Researcher Dr Chrissa Kioussi said : ' It 's not unusual for a gene to have multiple functions , but before this we did n't know what regulated the production of tooth enamel .
' This is the first transcription factor ever found to control the formation and maturation of ameloblasts , which are the cells that secrete enamel . '
The finding could be applied to human health and , if used in conjunction with fledgling stem cell technology , could one day allow people to grow replacement teeth when needed .
Alternatively , the knowledge could be used to strengthen existing enamel and repair damaged enamel , cutting decay and the need for fillings .
Dr Kioussi said : ' Enamel is one of the hardest coatings found in nature .
' A lot of work would still be needed to bring this to human applications , but it should work .
' It could be really cool , a whole new approach to dental health . '
Researchers hope that within ten years we will be able to grow new teeth from stem cells - the so - called master cells which have the potential to be used to grow any part of the body .
Scientists have successfully harvested stem cells from dental pulp - the nerves and tissue inside the teeth - and grown teeth in the lab which have been transplanted into mice .
Other innovations on the horizon include ' drills ' that cut and polish teeth using nothing more than a blast of air and a mouthwash that could do away with the need for fillings .
Around 11 million Britons wear dentures - more than one million of them in their 30s or younger .
The NHS pays for false teeth for around 12,000 six to 24 - year - olds a year .
However , the making of dentures is a dying art .
The British Society for the Study of Prosthetic Dentistry has warned that time spent teaching dental students on the ins and outs of false teeth is now being devoted to lessons on tooth whitening , orthodontics and other techniques behind the much sought - after ' Hollywood smile ' .
Eighty - five per cent of people claim to have good oral hygiene , but just two - thirds brush their teeth twice a day and nearly a third of adults have 12 or more fillings .

TOLEDO --
A former nuclear power plant engineer in Ohio has been sentenced to three years on probation and fined $ 4,500 for helping to cover up the worst corrosion ever found at a U.S. reactor .
Andrew Siemaszko ( si - MAS '- ko ) was sentenced Friday in federal court in Toledo .
He had faced up to five years in prison .
He was convicted of misleading regulators in 2001 in order to delay a safety inspection at the Davis - Besse nuclear power plant along Lake Erie .
Inspectors later found an acid leak that nearly ate through the reactor 's 6 - inch - thick steel cap .
Defense attorneys have said Siemaszko was set up as a scapegoat because he spoke out about safety concerns .
The plant operator , FirstEnergy Corp. , has paid $ 33.5 million to settle civil and criminal cases .
US intel chief : Economic crisis a greater threat than terrorism Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday February 13 , 2009
Print This Email This The Apostle Paul once opined , " the love of money is the root of all evil . "
In 2004 , at the very height of Bush versus Kerry , most Americans would have disagreed with the Biblical sentiment .
An economy on war footing and credit available to almost anyone made such a notion antiquated , it seemed .
So , when an alleged transcript of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden raving about his plans surfaced on Al Jazeera , only a key few took his message seriously .
" We are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy , " he allegedly said .
Though the current state of affairs is the sum of a vast many more contrivances than what bin Laden allegedly launched on Sept. 11 , 2001 , today the words attributed to him float like a prophecy .
In a report to the Senate Intelligence Committee , Dennis Blair , Obama 's intelligence chief , said Thursday that the growing economic crisis has become the greatest threat to US security , outpacing even terrorism .
" And Id like to begin with the global economic crisis , because it already looms as the most serious one in decades , if not in centuries ...
Economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they are prolonged for a one - or two - year period , " said Blair .
" And instability can loosen the fragile hold that many developing countries have on law and order , which can spill out in dangerous ways into the international community . "
" Much of Latin America , former Soviet Union states , and sub -Saharan Africa lack sufficient cash reserves , access to international aid or credit , or other coping mechanism , " he continued .
" Statistical modeling shows that economic crises increase the risk of regime - threatening instability if they persist over a one - to - two - year period . "
Blair also added that " there could be a backlash against U.S. efforts to promote free markets because the crisis was triggered by the United States , " reported the Seattle Times .
" We are generally held to be responsible for it , " he said .
It was " easy for us to provoke and bait [ the Bush ] administration , " bin Laden had allegedly bragged .
In the United States , 7.6 percent of workers are unemployed , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The national economy lost 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 , the worst contraction since 1982 .
In France , more than a million workers took to the streets at the end of January to voice anger and fear of job losses during a one - day strike over President Nicolas Sarkozy 's handling of the economic crisis .
The French authorities are also currently struggling with a " revolt " over poverty on the Caribbean islands .
In Iceland , economic turmoil already swept a government from power as the population protested a lack of insulation from the global crisis .
The new government , led by the first openly gay head of state , promised to begin trying to dig the country out .
Battles between Greek protesters and a government desperate to hold onto power shook and burned the nation 's capital of Athens late last year after a police officer killed a young boy .
Though street battles carried on for days , social unrest boils yet in the country , evident in a recent wave of firebomb attacks authorities blamed on anarchists .
" All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al Qaeda , in order to make generals race there to cause America to suffer human , economic and political losses without their achieving anything of note other than some benefits for their private corporations , " bin Laden reportedly said in the November 1 , 2004 transcript .
" The longer it takes for the [ economic ] recovery to begin , the greater the likelihood of serious damage to U.S. strategic interests , " Blair told the committee on Thursday .
" And it all shows that the real loser is you , " bin Laden allegedly concluded .
" It is the American people and their economy . "
Putting out band - oriented editions of Singstar has proven to be a successful gambit , with the ABBA - focused version of the game proving to be so many folks ' secret guilty pleasure .
In a repeat move , Sony has announced its intent to bring another classic band to the world of Singstar : the often - imitated but never - duplicated Queen .
Singstar Queen , which will be released for both the PS3 and the PS2 , will feature the ten songs that are already available in downloadable packs , as well as fifteen more for the PS3 ; the PS2 version will feature a total of twenty songs .
The track list actually reads like a " best of " list , featuring songs that span the band 's rather impressive career from the ' 70s through the '90s , though I 'm sad to report that " I'm Going Slightly Mad " is not set to make an appearance .
So far , only the announced release dates for the game are March 13th ( for the UK ) and March 18th ( for the rest of the PAL countries ) , though Sony is promising a North American release shortly thereafter .
No price has been announced either , though it will probably sell for $ 39.99 , just like the ABBA version did .

Printer Friendly Version Genocide In Gaza , Ethnic Cleansing
In The West Bank By Ilan Pappe 28 January , 2008
The Indypendent N ot long ago , I claimed that Israel is employing genocidal policies in the Gaza Strip .
I hesitated before using this very charged term and yet decided to adopt it .
The responses I received indicated unease in using such a term .
I rethought the term for a while , but concluded with even stronger conviction : it is the only appropriate way to describe what the Israeli army is doing in the Gaza Strip .
On Dec. 28 , 2006 , the Israeli human rights organization Betzelem published its annual report on Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories .
In 2006 , Israeli forces killed 660 citizens , triple the number of the previous year ( around 200 ) .
Most of the dead are from the Gaza Strip , where Israeli forces demolished almost 300 houses and have slain entire families .
Since 2000 , almost 4,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces , half of them children , and more than 20,000 wounded .
The point is not just about escalating intentional killings but the strategy .
Annexation
Israeli policy makers are facing two very different realities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
In the former , they are finishing construction of their eastern border .
Their internal ideological debate is over , and their master plan for annexing half of the West Bank is gaining speed .
The last phase was delayed due to the promises made by Israel , under the Road Map , not to build new settlements .
Israel found two ways of circumventing this .
First , it defined a third of the West Bank as Greater Jerusalem , which allowed it to build towns and community centers within this new annexed area .
Second , it expanded old settlements to such proportions that there was no need to build new ones .
Creeping Transfer
The settlements , army bases , roads and the wall will allow Israel to annex almost half of the West Bank by 2010 .
Within these territories , Israeli authorities will continue to implement creeping transfer policies against the considerable number of Palestinians who remain .
There is no rush .
As far as the Israeli are concerned they have the upper hand there ; the daily abusive and dehumanizing combination of army and bureaucracy effectively adds to the dispossession process .
All governing parties from Labor to Kadima accept Ariel Sharon ’s strategic thinking that this policy is far better than the one offered by the blunt “ transferists ” or ethnic cleansers , such as Avigdor Liberman .
In the Gaza Strip there is no clear Israeli strategy , but there is a daily experiment with one .
The Israelis see the Strip as a distinct geo-political entity from the West Bank .
Hamas controls Gaza , while Mahmoud Abbas seems to run the fragmented West Bank with Israeli and American blessing .
There is no land in the Strip that Israel covets and there is no hinterland , like Jordan , to which the Palestinians can be expelled .
Ethnic cleansing is ineffective here .
The earlier strategy in the Strip was ghettoizing the Palestinians there , but this is not working .
The Jews know it best from their history .
In the past , the next stage against such communities was even more barbaric .
It is difficult to tell what does the future hold for the Gaza community : ghettoized , quarantined , unwanted and demonized .
Throwing Away the Key
Creating the prison and throwing the key to the sea , as South African law professor John Dugard has put it , was an option the Palestinians in the Strip reacted against with force in September 2005 .
Determined to show that they were still part of the West Bank and Palestine , they launched the first significant number of missiles into the Western Negev .
The shelling was a response to an Israeli campaign of massive arrests of Hamas and Jihad people in the Tul Karim area .
Israel responded with operation “ First Rain . ”
Supersonic flights were flown over Gaza to terrorize the entire population , succeeded by heavy bombardment of vast areas from the sea , sky and land .
The logic , the Israeli army explained , was to weaken the community ’s support for the rocket launchers .
As was expected , by the Israelis as well , the operation only increased the support for the rocket launchers .
The real purpose was experimental .
The Israeli generals wished to know how such operations would be received at home , in the region and in the world .
And it seems the answer was “ very well ; ” no one took interest in the scores of dead and hundreds of wounded Palestinians .
Following operations were modeled on First Rain .
The difference was more firepower , more casualties and more collateral damage and , as expected , more Qassam missiles in response .
Accompanying measures ensured full imprisonment of Gazans through boycott and blockade , with which the European Union is shamefully collaborating .
The capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in June 2006 was irrelevant in the general scheme , but it provided an opportunity for the Israelis to escalate even more .
After all , there was no strategy that followed the decision of Sharon to remove 8,000 settlers from Gaza whose presence complicated “ punitive ” missions .
Since then , the “ punitive ” actions continue and have become a strategy .
First Rain was replaced by “ Summer Rains . ”
In a country where there is no rain in the summer , one can expect only showers of F - 16 bombs and artillery shells hitting the people of the Strip .
Summer Rains brought a novel component : the land invasion into parts of the Gaza Strip .
This enabled the army to kill citizens and present it as an inevitable result of heavy fighting within densely populated areas and not of Israeli policies .
Summer Rains , Autumn Clouds
When the summer was over came the even more efficient “ Autumn Clouds : ” beginning on Nov. 1 , 2006 , the Israelis killed 70 civilians in less than 48 hours .
By the end of that month , almost 200 were killed , half of them children and women .
Some of the activity was parallelled the Israeli attacks on Lebanon , making it easier to complete the operations without much external attention , let alone criticism .
From First Rain to Autumn Clouds there is escalation in every parameter .
The first is erasing the distinction between “ civilian ” and “ non-civilian ” targets : the population is the main target for the army ’s operation .
Second is the escalation in the means : employment of every possible killing machine the Israeli army possesses .
Third is escalation in the number of casualties : with each future operation , a much larger number of people are likely to be killed and wounded .
Finally , and most importantly , the operations have become a strategy — the way Israel intends to solve the problem of the Gaza Strip .
A creeping transfer in the West Bank and a measured genocidal policy in the Gaza strip are the two strategies Israel employs today .
From an electoral point of view the policy in Gaza is problematic , as it does not reap any tangible results ; the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas is yielding to Israeli pressure and there is no significant force that arrests the Israeli strategy of annexation and dispossession .
Gaza Fights Back
But the Strip continues to fire back .
This would enable the Israeli army to initiate larger genocidal operations in the future , but there is also the great danger that , as in 1948 , the army would demand a more drastic and systematic “ punitive ” action against the besieged people of the Gaza Strip .
Ironically , the Israeli killing machine has rested lately .
Its generals are content that the internal killing in the Strip does the job for them .
They watch satisfied the emerging civil war in the Strip that Israel foments and encourages .
The responsibility of ending the fighting lies of course with the Palestinian groups themselves , but U.S. and Israeli interference , the continued imprisonment , the starvation and strangulation of the Strip all make such an internal peace process very difficult .
Cutting Israel ’s Oxygen
What unfolds in Gaza is a battleground between America ’s and Israel ’s local proxies most unintentional but who dance to Israel ’s tune nonetheless — and those who oppose their plans .
The opposition that took over Gaza did it in a way that one finds very hard to condone or cheer .
Once fighting there subsides , the Israeli Summer Rains will fall down again on the people in the Strip , wreaking havoc and death .
There is no other way of stopping Israel than that of boycott , divestments and sanctions .
The only soft point of this killing machine is its oxygen lines to “ western ” civilization and public opinion .
It is still possible to puncture them and make it at least more difficult for the Israelis to implement their future strategy of eliminating the Palestinian people either by cleansing them in the West Bank or genocide in the Gaza Strip .
Dr. Ilan Pappé is an Israeli historian and author of numerous books , including The Modern Middle East and The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine .

When you look back through American history , Liberals have been at the forefront of change in America .
Our founding fathers were liberals in the classical sense .
Washington , Adams , Madison , Jefferson and the other founders were moving away from a centralized government to form a government of the people .
Sure , they were n't perfect , but their ideals were liberal and the liberal values that formed America changed the world .
Lincoln was a liberal .
Yes , he was a Republican .
But Republicans in Lincoln 's time were considered the liberal party .
Despite Lincoln 's upbringing and the world around him , Lincoln put forth the ideals of equal opportunity for all and his legacy lives on today .
Teddy Roosevelt was a liberal .
How do we know ?
Because one of his greatest legacies was the busting up of corporate monopolies .
TR took down this country 's greatest corporations in order to help the common man .
Need more evidence , TR was the first political environmentalist and is the reason why so much of America 's natural resources are well preserved today .
Franklin Roosevelt was a liberal .
FDR guided this country through the Great Depression and the Second World War , all from the seat of his wheelchair .
FDR 's policies lifted millions of the elderly out of poverty and provided healthcare to millions as well .

On a particularly bad evening , my roommate , sister , and I spent three hours cajoling , feeding , and calling to a very loud and lonely kitten .
We grabbed him and whisked him away to a land of Not My Attic .
Since we 're nerdy and made partially from the internet , we promptly named him Ceiling Cat .
Ceiling Cat , pictured here , hates me .
That weekend ( Thanksgiving weekend , I was 500 miles away but heard of the incident in texts and frantic phone calls ) , another kitten fell from the attic support beams and into the walls of the house .
My landlord , ever loving and sane , nixed our idea to saw through the walls .
Putting their heads together , the roommates managed to find access to the kitten through the basement .
Now , we have Ceiling Cat and Basement Cat .
This is a crappy cell phone picture .
Basement Cat is the black one .
S/he has little white paws and a white chest .
I am a dog person .
Above all , I will always be a dog person .
However , I will no allow a helpless dog , cat , parakeet , or raccoon to die in my house when I can prevent it .
These kittens had been abandoned by their mother .
They were starving and lonely and cold and scared .
They 're in my bathroom now .
They eat and I hang out with them and they are slowly warming to me .
I have n't been able to touch them yet , but they 've come close to sniff me .
These kittens need a new home .
I have a rescue dog , and permanent dogs .
My roommates have a cat who hates kittens .
I do n't have time to tame near - feral kittens .
This is where you come in .
Maybe you live in the country and need a cat for your barn .
Maybe you like taming feral kittens .
Maybe you 're just a nerd like me who is intrigued by the idea of having cats named Ceiling Cat and Basement Cat .
Aside from being impossibly cute , absolutely precious in fact , these kittens are litter trained .
Yeah , I can't believe it either .
They poop and pee right where they 're supposed to .
So , that part 's sorted .
The only thing you 'll need to do is make them love you .
I live in East Nashville , but I like car rides so I can come to you .
These little guys have n't had any vet care .
I 'd like to ask for a $ 20 adoption fee to weed out jerks , and that $ 20 will go straight to the Humane Society , or another charity of your choice .
If you represent an animal shelter , there would n't be a fee .
Come on , get a LOLcat .
I hear they 're all the rage this year .
LOLCats are the new black , or something .
Ah , the last part , I do n't check craigslist very often , so do n't reply here .
Reply to my email address instead , as I check that compulsively .

STARTING in 1965 with the DB5 in “ Goldfinger , ” Aston Martin has been linked at the tuxedoed hip with James Bond ; gadget - packed Astons have been driven by Connery , Lazenby , Dalton , Brosnan and Craig .
But given the economy , anyone who can still afford a $ 270,000 Aston Martin DBS might inspire a real - world film , with enough supervillains and world domination to make 007 quiver .
Call it “ The Man with the Golden Parachute . ”
Wafting above the crowd is certainly the point .
With 510 burbling horsepower from the V - 12 power plant , angry stockholders vanish in the mirror .
Seething mobs of the unemployed are drowned out by the 1,000 - watt Bang & Olufsen sound system .
C.E.O. - envy aside , the roughly 300 Americans who will drive home a DBS this year need to know the score .
First , ignore the self - appointed accountants who have questioned why the DBS costs $ 100,000 more than the Aston DB9 .
I mean , these people drive Hondas .
A woman has been charged with fraud after she allegedly claimed to have lost a relative in the Victorian bushfires .
Police allege the 31 - year - old woman from the Melbourne suburb of Sunshine tried to claim the $ 10,000 bereavement grant from the bushfire appeal fund and a $ 5,000 payment from Centrelink 's funeral fund .
It is alleged she claimed one of the men killed in the fires was her father .
The claim was denied after the appeal 's checking processes found she was not related to a deceased man .
She has been charged with obtaining property by deception and attempting to obtain property by deception .
The woman has been released on bail and is expected to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court in April .
The chairman of the fund , John Landy , has assured people who have made donations , that careful checks are in place to protect the money .
Shepard Fairey , the controversial street artist riding a roller coaster of publicity with his red , white , and blue posters of President Barack Obama , was arrested last night on his way to DJ an event kicking off his exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art .
Fairey , a 38 - year - old known for his countercultural style , was arrested on two outstanding warrants and was being held at a police station , according to a police official with knowledge of the arrest who requested anonymity .
Police could not describe the nature of the outstanding warrants last night , but said they were based in Massachusetts .
Fairey has been arrested at least 14 times , he has told the Globe .
The artist was arrested at about 9:15 p.m. as he was about to enter a sold - out dance event at the Institute of Contemporary Art on Northern Avenue , known as " Experiment Night . "
The event is geared toward a younger - age crowd , with techno - style music , and more than 750 people were waiting for him , some of whom had bought tickets for the event on Craigslist for as much as $ 500 .
Fairey was supposed to appear as a guest DJ for the kickoff of his exhibit , Supply and Demand , which will run through Aug. 16 .
He was scheduled to go on stage at about 10:30 p.m. , and an hour later organizers reported to the crowd that he was arrested .
" We 're very disappointed , " said Paul Bessire , deputy director of the Institute of Contemporary Art .
" Shepard Fairey is a wonderful artist who created some positive work and we were very pleased to present his work here and around the city .
We feel he is an influential artist . "
Fairey , a street artist , graphic designer , and political activist , is best known for his " Obey Giant " campaign of stickers , stencils , and posters in the early 1990s .
Most recently , he has achieved fame with the red , white , and blue posters of Obama , emblazoned with the words " Hope , " " Progress , " and " Change . "
The president used the posters during his campaign , and one of the displays in Fairey 's exhibit includes a typed letter from Obama that read : " I am privileged to be a part of your art work and proud to have your support . "
Fairey was recently seen with Mayor Thomas M. Menino in an event to promote his show , and banners raised at City Hall also announce the exhibit .
At the same time , however , anti-graffiti activists complained that a street artist was going to be the subject of a museum show .
But Bessire said , " We feel he is an influential artist .
We were just very pleased and felt fortunate to show his work . "
The arrest of Fairey -- who cites linguistic theorist Noam Chomsky with a poster that reads , " I lived with the system and took no offence / until Chomsky lent me the necessary sense " -- helped maintain his counterculture reputation .
" I would n't say it 's cool he was arrested , but I think it shows he has integrity , " said Bill Galligan , a graphic designer .
Some in the crowd last night speculated the incident may have been a publicity stunt .
Ginny Delany , a 27 - year - old graduate student from Cambridge , said , " It makes him even more of a hero to me .
" The fact that he is arrested for his art shows that it is meaningful tohim and he cares about what he is doing . "
David Rosen , a 19 - year - old from Allston , said last night that he was disappointed with the arrest , but " I understand that his art requires him to take risks . "

( CNN ) --
When you get angry , the stress is n't restricted to your head .
New research shows that anger actually triggers electrical changes in the heart , which can predict future arrhythmias in some patients .
Anger management may be key for patients with heart problems , researchers say .
The study , published in the March 3 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , may demonstrate a link between mental stress and sudden cardiac arrest , which causes more than 400,000 deaths every year .
Arrhythmias , which are heart rhythm problems , happen because of a malfunction in the electrical impulses in your heart that coordinate heart beats , according to the Mayo Clinic .
The result is that your heart beats too fast , too slow or irregularly .
Some arrhythmias may increase a person 's risk of stroke or congestive heart problems .
This study is relevant to people who have heart disease already , said study author Dr. Rachel Lampert , associate professor at Yale University School of Medicine .
" Perhaps if we treat them with something like stress management or anger management , we may decrease the likelihood of arrhythmias , " she said .
Previous research has shown that the rate of sudden cardiac death increases when the population is collectively stressed , such as during an earthquake or war , Lampert said .
Other studies have also shown that if you ask patients about what happened before a heart attack , they 'll most frequently say they were angry , said Dr. Charles Raison , psychiatrist and director of the Mind / Body Institute at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
" It is just indisputable that negative emotionality -- especially anger and misery , depression -- are terrible for your heart , " he said .
Researchers looked at 62 patients with implantable cardioverter - defibrillators , devices that monitor heart rhythms and emit painful shocks in response to dangerous rhythms .
The patients were asked to describe a time in the previous couple weeks when they felt angry or aggravated , and were prompted with questions to describe the moment vividly .
Researchers looked at the heart 's electrical stability through a measure called T - wave alternans .
" Overall in the group , when we did the anger recall protocol , the group as a whole showed an increase in electrical instability , " Lampert said .
Researchers then compared the top 25 percent of people -- those who showed the most instability -- with the others in the group and found that the the ones with the highest instability in the lab were 10 times more likely to experience an arrhythmia sometime in the next three years .
The idea could be used as a predictive test for people who are unable to take an exercise - induced electrical stability test , Lampert said .
More study is needed to see how the mental stress test relates to traditional exercise testing , said Dr. Eric Rashba , professor of medicine at Stony Brook University Medical Center in Stony Brook , New York .
Rashba was not involved in the study .
The new test may be useful in combination with the exercise test , he said .
While this is an early study with a small sample size , it is the first time this type of anger or emotional stress testing has been shown to correlate with future arrhythmias , he said .
Exercise elevates heart rate much more than mental stress does , meaning the effects of mental stress on the heart may be caused by adrenaline impacting the heart cells , the study authors said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Heart arrhythmias
In a follow - up study , Lampert and colleagues are taking patients with implantable defibrillators and giving them stress management therapy to see if the likelihood of arrhythmias decreases .
Anger management has two major components : behavioral and pharmacological , Raison said .
Within the behavioral approach , one strategy is to help people understand the reasons behind their anger , including the anger that they had in childhood , which may carry over to adulthood .
After going through this therapy , people have a better sense of what happened to them in their lives and stop associating everything with upsetting events from the past .
" They stop looking at the present constantly through the eyeglasses of the past , and when that happens , the things in the present do n't anger them that much , " he said .
Another strategy involves exploring ways to more constructively deal with anger .
The Mayo Clinic offers these anger management tips , which include taking a " time out , " working with the person who made you angry , forgiving others and keeping an anger log to identify circumstances that make you angry .
Meditating and exercise are other ways to reduce anger , Raison said .
There is also evidence that certain drugs that work for depression , called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , make people who do n't have depression less irritable , Raison said .
Still , more work needs to be done to demonstrate an underlying causal relation between heart problems and anger , or , alternatively , if there is a third factor that causes both -- for example , inflammation plays roles in both cardiac disease and anger , he said .

BEIJING 
A legal advocate who was arrested after applying to hold a protest in Beijing during the Olympic Games in August has been sentenced to three years in prison , said a lawyer who has been asked to represent the man in the appeals process .
The advocate , Ji Sizun , 58 , was sentenced on Jan. 7 by a judge in the city of Fuzhou for forging official seals and documents , the lawyer , Lin Kaihua , said Thursday .
Mr. Ji was one of many victims of a tactic employed by the central government during the Beijing Olympics that has angered human rights advocates and has raised questions about whether the International Olympic Committee should have put more pressure on the Chinese government to respect human rights and freedom of speech .
In the prelude to the Games , the government announced that it had designated three parks in Beijing as legal protest zones and that anyone could apply to hold protests in them .
When people did apply , however , their requests were ignored or they were detained and arrested .

Gaza .-
Al menos sesenta personas , en su mayoría civiles , murieron hoy por fuego israelí en una jornada en la que por primera vez el Estado judío ha hablado de la posibilidad de alcanzar una " solución diplomática " a la guerra que ha lanzado en Gaza .
La principal matanza se produjo al impactar un disparo de artillería en el colegio Al Fakhoura de la Agencia de las Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados ( UNRWA ) , en el campo de refugiados de Yebalia y que albergaba a cientos de desplazados por la invasión terrestre que Israel inició el sábado en la franja palestina .
Moaweya Hasanein , jefe del servicio de emergencias y ambulancias de Gaza , dijo a Efe que el proyectil mató a 46 personas y causó heridas a más de un centenar que en ese momento se encontraban dentro y fuera de la escuela , todas ellas civiles .
La UNRWA cifra en 30 el numero de muertos .
Se trató de la segunda vez en veinticuatro horas que el Ejército israelí bombardea una escuela de esa Agencia , que en los últimos días ha habilitado once centros para cobijar a la población civil .
" No hay ningún sitio seguro en Gaza .
Todos están aquí aterrorizados y traumatizados " , dijo John Ging , uno de los máximos representantes de la ONU en la franja , a la agencia palestina independiente Maan .
Testigos presenciales indicaron que el ataque se produjo poco después de que , desde esa misma zona , milicianos palestinos disparasen con sus morteros contra las fuerzas israelíes .
Ese fue el argumento del Ejército israelí para justificar el ataque .
" No es esta la primera vez que Hamás dispara morteros y cohetes desde escuelas , usando a civiles como escudos humanos " , dice un comunicado militar israelí .
La UNRWA asegura que para evitar este tipo de errores comunicó a Israel las coordenadas GPS de todas sus instalaciones en Gaza , y que éstas están claramente identificadas , sin excepción , con las letras " UN " , iniciales en inglés de " Naciones Unidas " .
La masacre se sumó a las muertes horas antes de doce palestinos de una misma familia , entre ellos seis niños de entre uno y nueve años , a causa de otro proyectil de artillería israelí que alcanzó una vivienda en el barrio Zeitún de Gaza capital .
Según Hasanein , son ya alrededor de 650 los palestinos muertos desde que comenzó la Operación Plomo Fundido , hace once días , y más de 2.600 los heridos .
Hoy también murió el sexto soldado israelí desde que comenzó la ofensiva , en un tiroteo con milicianos palestinos en los alrededores de Gaza capital , que sigue cercada por el Ejército .
Las fuerzas israelíes , que tienen dividida la franja , avanzaron en las últimas horas hacia los núcleos urbanos de Jan Yunes y Dir El Balah , en el sur , aunque no han tratado de ocuparlas .
En medio del incesante derramamiento de sangre , los esfuerzos para un posible alto el fuego podrían estar dando sus primeros resultados , a juzgar por unas declaraciones del primer ministro israelí , Ehud Olmert , en las que por primera vez se muestra abierto a una " solución diplomática " .
En una entrevista con el diario Haaretz , Olmert reconoció que hay " distintas ideas para una solución diplomática " , y afirmó que las " estoy tratando con muchos líderes del mundo " .
" El resultado debe ser un bloqueo efectivo de la Ruta Filadelfi , con supervisión y seguimiento " , explicó en alusión a ese corredor fronterizo entre Egipto y Gaza , bajo el que hay decenas de túneles por los que Hamás se aprovisiona de armas , municiones y cohetes .
" No comenzamos todo esto para ocupar ( de nuevo ) Gaza , o matar a todos los terroristas .
Emprendimos ( esta operación ) para generar un cambio para el sur ( de Israel ) " , dijo el primer ministro israelí .
La posible solución puede llegar de manos del presidente francés , Nicolas Sarkozy , según el primer ministro de París , François Fillon .
" Hay una vía , aunque es muy estrecha , para obtener , gracias a la presión del conjunto de actores , un alto el fuego sobre el terreno " , dijo Fillon en la Asamblea Nacional francesa .
Are you worried about the digital TV transition ?
Concerned about whether consumers will be confused now that Congress has switched the last day of analog broadcasting from February 17 to June 12 ?
Nervous that the government 's set - top box coupon program has run out of money despite having a waiting list of 3.7 million people ?
Well , here 's something else for DTV nail biters to chew on : a top retailing expert says that the nation 's electronic appliances stores could sell out of analog - to - digital converter boxes around , roughly , this month .
" The worst case scenario is that there only 3 million boxes in current inventory and daily redemptions stay at 115,000 , " Consumer Electronics Association Vice President Michael Petricone told the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday .
" We will then run out of box inventory by the end of February . "
Maybe even sooner , he suggested .
But that 's probably not what will happen , Petricone assured the FCC .
Chances are that the stores will run out of the boxes in 52 days ( from when Petricone spoke on Thursday ) .
Then , around the Ides of April , new product will start showing up the shelves .
How does Petricone figure this latest cliffhanger ?
Most converter box manufacturers , bless their souls , actually believed the government when it passed a law making February 17 the last day of analog broadcasting .
So they stopped producing the boxes around January of this year .
CEA estimates that , at present , there are about three to six million boxes in the stores .
At this point , Petricone warns , " it is extremely difficult for manufacturers and retailers to anticipate demand levels for boxes between now and June 12 . "
That 's the new last day of analog broadcasting , as established by the recently enacted DTV Delay Act .
Unknown variables include when Congress will pass the White House 's proposed stimulus package , which contains $ 650 million to replenish the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 's ( NTIA ) coupon program .
The Delay Act also lets the NTIA issue replacements for expired coupons , but only after the program is refunded by Congress .
If the NTIA suddenly gets funded and issues all its coupons , consumers could deplete the stores within weeks .
But Petricone predicts that manufacturers will probably be able to fast track the production of the boxes , in large part because the recession has shut down demand for other products .
The economic downturn has created " a virtually unprecedented level of excess manufacturing capacity , " which means that " manufacturing lines can be turned on immediately " for set top boxes .
" Therefore , " Petricone concludes , " we believe that new converter boxes will arrive on store shelves in mid-April . "
As of this writing , the Senate is expected to pass its stimulus bill on Tuesday .
It will then have to be reconciled with the House package .
Reader Doug tried a little experiment ( a la Omar Call ) where he stood on a street corner in New Orleans during Mardi Gras and “ preached ” atheism .
Maybe preached is n’t the right word .
He stood with a sign ( which read “ Atheism : All of the Mardi Gras , None of the Lent ” ) — on the other side of the street from the Christian preachers — and spoke with people about atheism rather than yelling at them about the horrors that would befall them if they remained religious .
I ’m sure the fundamentalists were thrilled .
So how do you think this little experiment went down ?
Doug says in an email that the response was better than you might expect :
… The overwhelming response was extremely positive .
Many people told me that they were glad I was there to counteract and generally piss off the Christian fundamentalists .
This message was true even for people that said they were devout Christians .
I was also confronted by many fellow atheists with the general response of “ I thought I was the only one ! ”
I would say about 80 % of people that talked to me loved my sign and thought it was very funny .
I had my picture taken many times with people , got given many beads , a guy bought me a beer , and one woman even flashed me her boobs !
The remaining 20 % of people did n’t understand the sign , and I would guess that half of them did n’t even know what atheism was .
( I was also wearing a shirt that said ‘ Atheist ’ across the chest . )
I ’m not in favor of pissing off the fundamentalists despite their rhetoric and beliefs , but I ’ll admit feeling a bit satisfied that they ’ve had a taste of their own medicine .
It was n’t all fun and games .
There were several serious discussions had — with people who rarely think about religion .
If that was the norm rather than the exception , I ’d be advocating this type of stunt a lot more .
Is this something I see myself doing ?
No .
I do n’t think it ’s worth the time and I do n’t know many people who would enjoy being stopped on the street to discuss religion — even with someone they agree with .
But I do n’t mind someone trying it out just to see what could happen .
Would you have spoken to someone like Doug if you ran into him on the street ?
What advice would you give him if he tried this again ?
What could he do to have the most positive interactions possible with Christians ?
In the current economic situation , social media has emerged as a powerful tool for the newly jobless .
There have been countless posts about the coming of social media and what it means , mostly in the abstract .
But right now , social media provides a practical use job hunting .
Your social networking activity is basically your own personal cloud that you can pluck for your own benefit .
Most of the jobs that you will get in your life will not be from a classified ad or a job ad .
You will have found out about them from your personal network – virtual and physical .
Social media creates a bigger network , allowing you to connect with more people and to find out about more job opportunities .
Many Web 2.0 pundits have been decrying the loss of privacy in the Web 2.0 age , as well as sending out warning signs to control how much information you allow out there about yourself .
Now , the focus is shifting to how you can mange your personal brand message on social media sites and use them to grow your career .
So , how can you use social media to find a job ?
1. Connecting
On the most basic level , social networking communities allow you to connect with your friends and co-workers .
This is your closest network and the most valuable in a job search .
Keep your friends close and your former friends closer .
2. Reconnecting
Social networking allows you to reconnect with former co-workers and friends that you have n’t heard from for awhile .
This widens the net from just staying connected with a close network of friends .
I call it the ‘ beer factor . ’
If it ’s someone you ’d be willing to go out and get a beer with and shoot the breeze about a former job or company , then they are worth reconnecting with .
3. Profiles
Take the time to fill in the details on all of your social networking accounts .
Your goal should be transparency so people can know who you are immediately and see a pattern across all your accounts .
Fill in your Facebook profile , Twitter account profile and Linkedin profile .
Potential employers and connections want to find out as much about you as they can .
Control the message .
You ’ve got the time on your hands .
4. Squeeky Clean Image
If you ’re using social networking to find a job , it is probably a good idea to take the pictures off your Facebook profile from your bender a few weeks ago .
Companies want you to appear to be above reproach .
That means your online persona needs to reflect this .
So , polish all your social media profiles and remove anything that might offend even the slightest of sensibilities .
5. RSS Feeds
One of the best ways to keep up on the latest job postings is to find job websites that have RSS feeds of the latest jobs .
For example , all Craigslist job boards have an RSS feed .
There are many other second tier job sites that have this feature .
The big boys like Monster.com and Careerbuilder have failed at this .
There are many many niche job websites that feature a wide array of jobs in specific industries .
Do a search for them , they are out there .
Also , create free Google Alerts to notify you whenever a job matching your criteria comes on the net .
6. Twitter
Twitter can help you greatly in a job search .
First ,
Twitter allows you to directly connect with your network .
I have gotten many job leads from people I follow on Twitter .
Second , Twitter allows you to widen the net of your network .
If you ’re looking to relocate to another city or already live in a big one , follow players in your field and then engage directly with them .
You build a reputation and increase the likelihood that you ’ll find out about a job first .
Third , there are many Tweeps out there that solely list jobs ( such as @ukseojobs or @seojobs ) so you can be notified as soon a job goes on the market .
7. Linkedin
Linkedin should be the center of any job search .
It ’s been said that Linkedin is the Facebook for professionals and that ’s exactly what it is .
Linkedin allows you to have a professional online presence that shows your work experience .
You can also connect with co-workers and former co-workers , who can recommend each other .
Linkedin is also becoming a great place to list jobs and also find out about jobs before they go on the major job sites .
8. Facebook
Most people think that Facebook is just for fooling around but it has many good uses on a job hunt .
Your friends will be a good source of job leads .
Also , you can join many Facebook groups related to your industry that will allow you to network with potential colleagues .
9. Blogging
Running a blog is a great way to prove your knowledge .
Who would you rather hire ?
A person with a polished resume and years of experience ?
Or the person with a polished resume , years of experience and a successful blog about his / her industry ?
It ’s a no brainer .
If you can paint yourself as an expert in your field , it will only help your career prospects .
10 . Casting a Wide Net
The main goal of using social media to get a job is to get your personal brand in as many places as possible .
The more you engage fellow professionals the more likely you are to find out about of job or get a good recommendation .
11 . The Desperation Factor
Do n’t be a social network spammer .
Do n’t just connect with people to extract job leads from them or bug them about needing a job .
Connect with them to connect with them .
You will get no where complaining about your life situation or acting like you deserve help .
People come onto social networks to get away from the negative forces in life , do n’t become one .
12 . Do n’t Burn Bridges
Do n’t start trashing your former employer on the social networks .
This will alienate your former co-workers and poison the possibility of your bosses giving you a good recommendation .
Bad social media PR is very damaging to a company in this day and age .
Anything you say on a social network will get indexed by the search engines and it will take a very long time to remove .
Your anger could damage your job prospects for years .
13 . Social Media in the Real World
Start getting involved in local , in person gatherings that are organized on social media sites .
Visit the local tweet - up or industry gathering .
Establishing a person to person relationship will be infinitely more valuable than connecting online .
So , next time you see a Tweet - up in your area , it ’s a good idea to go , even if you feel secure in your job .
14 . Pay it Forward
If you get a job lead for something that ’s out of your field of expertise , then by all means spread it across your social network accounts .
You ’ll spread goodwill and also have connections in the future that will only help you .
15 . Professional Blog Commenter
You ’ve got time on your hands , do n’t you ?
Become a prolific commenter on blogs in your industry .
Become a recognized name .
This can fit well into a regular blogging strategy .
Getting yourself noticed will only help you in a job hunt and will ingratiate you to bloggers who enjoy engaging with their commenters .
16 . Engagement
Do n’t just try to connect with people , engage with them .
If you see a controversial discussion going on across your Twitter feed , participate in it .
If someone has a question that you can answer , by all means answer it .
Do n’t spend all your time talking about yourself , engage others and talk with them not AT them . ’
17 . Leave No Connection Unturned
Connect with everyone in your industry .
You may think it ’s a waste of time connecting with a secretary or an entry level person , but those are people you want to be in your court .
The first rule of job interviewing is always be nice to the receptionist when you arrive .
There is no reason why this should not count in the virtual realm .
Using social media to find a job will take time and you will get out of it , what you put into it .
It ’s going to be hard work and your going to have spend a lot of time doing it .
But the potential rewards are huge .
Not only can you find a new job , but you can also make new lifelong friends .

Former British resident Binyam Mohamed arrives back in Britain tomorrow after his release from Guantanamo Bay .
British and US lawyers claim that sustained beatings - which have only recently stopped - have left him with severe psychological and physical problems .
Defence correspondent Mark Townsend reports
Binyam Mohamed will return to Britain suffering from a huge range of injuries after being beaten by US guards right up to the point of his departure from Guantánamo Bay , according to the first detailed accounts of his treatment inside the camp .
Mohamed will arrive back tomorrow in the UK , where he was a British resident between 1984 and 2002 .
During medical examinations last week , doctors discovered injuries and ailments resulting from apparently brutal treatment in detention .
Mohamed was found to be suffering from bruising , organ damage , stomach complaints , malnutrition , sores to feet and hands , severe damage to ligaments as well as profound emotional and psychological problems which have been exacerbated by the refusal of Guantánamo 's guards to give him counselling .
Mohamed 's British lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , said his client had been beaten " dozens " of times inside the notorious US camp in Cuba with the most recent abuse occurring during recent weeks .
He said : " He has a list of physical ailments that cover two sheets of A4 paper .
What Binyam has been through should have been left behind in the middle ages . "
Lieutenant colonel Yvonne Bradley , Mohamed 's US military attorney , added : " He has been severely beaten .
Sometimes I do n't like to think about it because my country is behind all this . "
The former attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , who campaigned for Guantánamo Bay to be closed , said any allegation of US abuse against a British resident inside the prison should be urgently raised by the foreign secretary , David Miliband , with the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
" If there are credible accounts of mistreatment then they need to be pursued , " said Goldsmith .
Claims that Mohamed was beaten during the period after President Obama announced Guantánamo's closure in January risk harming diplomatic relations between the administration and the British government .
Prime minister Gordon Brown is believed to have raised Mohamed 's case with the US president during their first talk following Obama 's inauguration two months ago .
Stafford Smith , the director of legal charity Reprieve , said yesterday that Mohamed had been routinely beaten by Guantánamo 's notorious emergency reaction force , a six - strong team of guards in riot gear who have been the subject of previous abuse allegations .
The alleged beatings were routinely administered against Mohamed " for no reason " and some were " recent " according to Stafford Smith .
Upon his return to England after more than four years inside Guantánamo , Mohamed will be taken to a secure , secret location in order for him to be fully rehabilitated by a team of volunteer doctors and psychiatrists .
Mohamed will be kept under a " voluntary security arrangement " which involves reporting to the authorities , but he will not be subject to an anti-terror control order .
His lawyers reiterate that he has nothing to hide after US terror charges against him were dropped last year .
Mohamed will not be debriefed upon his arrival by the British authorities or face any interview from the British security agencies .
At least one MI5 officer is currently waiting to hear whether he will face a criminal investigation over alleged complicity in the torture of Mohamed , who settled in Kensington , west London , after arriving from Ethiopia as a teenage asylum seeker .
Mohamed 's eventual testimony may also shed light on MI5's alleged complicity in his interrogation and alleged torture .
One likely step will involve suing the British government and its security services over potential allegations of complicity in his illegal detention , abduction , treatment and interrogation .
Lord Carlile of Berriew , the independent reviewer of the anti-terrorism laws , warned yesterday that , once settled , Mohamed 's possible legal action against the US or British authorities could force them to disclose vital evidence relating to the torture allegations .
Following his arrest in Pakistan more than six years ago , Mohamed has claimed he was told by British government officials that everything would be done to help him .
Lt Col Bradley , who is staying in England until Thursday to welcome Mohamed , said the most crucial issue was stabilising his health .
Mohamed 's weight has fallen from 170 lbs to about 125 lbs .
" He needs to get his weight back on and start eating , " she said .
Mohamed 's return to England coincides with signs that the government is preparing to accept more detainees from Guantánamo in the face of increasing US pressure to help shut the camp .
The Foreign Office appears to be softening its stance towards accepting more detainees from the prison after last month insisting there were " no plans " to accept more inmates .
The position has now shifted to a statement explaining that " no formal decision has been made " on the UK accepting detainees from other countries .
A Foreign Office source added that all cases were now being reviewed on an individual basis by the home secretary Jacqui Smith .
This comes amid intensifying pressure from the US authorities , with the Observer learning that direct requests for Britain to accept more detainees have now been lodged by the Obama administration .
Sources at the US department of defence said talks were ongoing with countries , including the UK , to re-house inmates .
Dean Boyd , spokesman for the US department of justice , said : " We will undoubtedly need the assistance of our close friends and allies as we work towards closing Guantánamo . "
Goldsmith said Britain should accept prisoners from the camp if it would help Obama to close it down .
British citizens and residents mentioned in the report is Rangzieb Ahmed , 33 , from Rochdale , who claims he was tortured by Pakistani intelligence agents before being questioned by two MI5 officers .
Ahmed was convicted of being a member of al - Qaida at Manchester crown court , yet the jury was not told that three of the fingernails of his left hand had been removed .
The response from MI5 to the allegations that it had colluded in Ahmed 's torture were heard in camera , however , after the press and the public were excluded from the proceedings .
Ahmed 's description of the cell in which he claims he was tortured closely matches that where Salahuddin Amin , 33 , from Luton , says he was tortured by ISI officers between interviews with MI5 officers .
Zeeshan Siddiqui , 25 , from London , who was detained in Pakistan in 2005 , also claims he was interviewed by British intelligence agents during a period in which he was tortured .
Other cases include that of a London medical student who was detained in Karachi and tortured after the July 2005 attacks in London .
Another case involving Britons allegedly tortured in Pakistan and questioned by UK agents involves a British Hizb ut - Tahrir supporter .
Rashid Rauf , from Birmingham , was detained in Pakistan and questioned over suspected terrorist activity in 2006 .
He was reportedly killed after a US drone attack in Pakistan 's tribal regions , though his body has never been found .
Hasan said : " What the research suggests is that these are not incidents involving one particular rogue officer or two , but rather an array of individuals involved over a period of several years .
" The issue is not just British complicity in the torture of British citizens , it is the issue of British complicity in the torture period .
We know of at least 10 cases , but the complicity probably runs much deeper because it involves a series of terrorism suspects who are Pakistani .
This is the heart of the matter .
" They are not the same individuals [ MI5 officers ] all the time .
I know that the people who have gone to see Siddiqui in Peshawar are not the same people who have seen Ahmed in Rawalpindi . "
Last night the government faced calls to clarify precisely its relationship with Pakistan 's intelligence agencies , which are known to routinely use torture .
A Foreign Office spokesman said that an investigation by the British security services had revealed " there is nothing to suggest they have engaged in torture in Pakistan " .
He added : " Our policy is not to participate in , solicit , encourage or condone the use of torture , or inhumane or degrading treatment , for any purpose . "
But former shadow home secretary David Davis said the claims from Pakistan served to " reinforce " allegations that UK authorities , at the very least , ignored Pakistani torture techniques .
" The British agencies can no longer pretend that ' Hear no evil , see no evil ' is applicable in the modern world , " he added .
Last week HRW submitted evidence to parliament 's Joint Committee on Human Rights .
The committee is to question Miliband and Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , over a legal loophole which appears to offer British intelligence officers immunity in the UK for any crimes committed overseas .
It has also emerged that New York - based HRW detailed its concerns in a letter to the UK government last October but has yet to receive a response .
The letter arrived at the same time that the Attorney General was tasked with deciding if Scotland Yard should begin a criminal investigation into British security agents ' treatment of Binyam Mohamed .
Crown prosecutors are currently weighing up the evidence .
Hasan said that evidence indicated a considerable number of UK officers were involved in interviewing terrorism suspects after they were allegedly tortured .
He told the Observer : " We do n't know who the individuals [ British intelligence officers ] were , but when you have different personnel coming in and behaving in a similar fashion it implies some level of systemic approach to the situation , rather than one eager beaver deciding it is absolutely fine for someone to be beaten or hung upside down . "
He accused British intelligence officers of turning a blind eye as UK citizens endured torture at the hands of Pakistan 's intelligence agencies .
" They [ the British ] have met the suspect ... and have conspicuously failed to notice that someone is in a state of high physical distress , showing signs of injury .
If you are a secret service agent and fail to notice that their fingernails are missing , you ought to be fired . "
Britain 's former chief legal adviser , Lord Goldsmith , said that the Foreign Office would want to examine any British involvement in torture allegations very carefully and , if necessary , bring individuals " to book " to ensure such behaviour was " eradicated " .
Peanut butter  that culinary cause célèbre  may contain approximately 145 bug parts for an 18 - ounce jar ; or five or more rodent hairs for that same jar ; or more than 125 milligrams of grit .
In case you ’re curious : you ’re probably ingesting one to two pounds of flies , maggots and mites each year without knowing it , a quantity of insects that clearly does not cut the mustard , even as insects may well be in the mustard .
The F.D.A. considers the significance of these defects to be “ aesthetic ” or “ offensive to the senses , ” which is to say , merely icky as opposed to the “ mouth / tooth injury ” one risks with , for example , insufficiently pitted prunes .
This policy is justified on economic grounds , stating that it is “ impractical to grow , harvest or process raw products that are totally free of non-hazardous , naturally occurring , unavoidable defects . ”
The most recent edition of the booklet ( it has been revised and edited six times since first being issued in May 1995 ) states that “ the defect levels do not represent an average of the defects that occur in any of the products  the averages are actually much lower . ”
Instead , it says , “ The levels represent limits at which F.D.A. will regard the food product ‘ adulterated ’ and subject to enforcement action . ”
Bugs in our food may not be so bad  many people in the world practice entomophagy  but these harmless hazards are a reminder of the less harmless risks we run with casual regulation of our food supply .
For good reason , the F.D.A. is focused on peanut butter , which the agency is considering reclassifying as high risk , like seafood , and subjecting it to special safety regulations .
But the unsettling reality is that despite food ’s cheery packaging and nutritional labeling , we do n’t really know what we ’re putting into our mouths .
Soup merits little mention among the products listed in the F.D.A. ’s booklet .
But , given the acceptable levels for contaminants in other foods , one imagines that the disgruntled diner ’s cri de coeur 
“ Waiter , there ’s a fly in my soup ! ”  would be , to the F.D.A. , no cause for complaint .
Hi again ! 🙂
A path tracer is very simple in theory ( and indeed a specialized path tracer producing good looking pictures can be written in few lines of code ) , but a powerful general one is not an easy task .
Currently I ’m doing heavy researches on the sampling area that is the core of the path tracer since smart sampling will make life easier and pictures look the right way while raw sampling only worsen things .
Fig. 1 – 160 sample per pixel ( spp ) – render time : 4 min 58 s
Fig. 2 – 550 spp – 17 min
Fig. 3 – tone mapping
Fig. 4 – 160 spp – 3 min 43
Fig. 5 – 550 spp – 11 min 20
I cannot give any dates yet , but as soon as the sampling core is stable enough I implement a few more features and make a public release before the code starts getting heavy .
One of the good things of a Monte Carlo render method is its low coupling with Blender structure , allowing very easy plug - n - play !

19 days in , the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip passed another major milestone , with over 1,000 Palestinians killed in the attack .
The Gaza - based Palestinian Center for Human Rights , which has been tracking the toll , said 673 of those killed were civilians , with 225 children and 69 women .
13 Israelis have also been killed , three of them civilians , though at least four of those soldiers were killed by the Israeli military .
Red Cross President Jakob Kellenberger described the situation in the Gaza Strip as “ shocking ” and called for the Israeli military to make more provisions to ensure that ambulances could rescue wounded civilians from the attacks .
Surveyors say that the attack has done at least $ 1.4 billion in damage to the infrastructure of the tiny strip .
Securing the funds will likely be difficult , particularly in the global economic downturn .
So far the United Nations has allocated $ 7 million ( less than $ 5 per Gazan ) to provide for them during this time of emergency .

The Coleman campaign released their reply to the Franken Motion we recently covered ; the Election Contest Court has yet to issue an official order on the subject , but a lot of insight can be gleamed from the exact wording of Coleman 's answer :
Contestants agree that Contestee should be granted leave to amend his counterclaims to include additional wrongly rejected absentee ballots so long as all similarly situated rejected absentee ballots -- that is , those that reasonably fall within the same category -- are subject to review by the Court to determine if they too are legally cast votes .
Contestants have endeavored to include all similarly situated ballots within each and every category presented to the Court , in their summary judgment motion and at trial , and welcome all efforts to ensure that legally cast votes are counted .
As to the timing of any amendment , Contestants respectfully request that Contestee be required to identify any additional rejected absentee ballots before the Court makes any rulings regarding which , if any , of the rejected absentee ballots identified by Contestants should be counted .
Dated : February 6 , 2009 Source : Contestants ' Response to Motion to Amend Answer and Counterclaim via MNCourts.gov
The Coleman campaign has conditionally accepted Franken 's request , contingent upon their inclusion of additional absentee ballots .
This response by the Coleman campaign reveals the dreary prospect of an absentee ballot inspired comeback ; they have internally realized that the origin of any given absentee ballot is irrelevant .
The Coleman campaign has shifted their focus to quantity , in the hopes that each wrongfully rejected absentee ballot inherently tends toward Norm Coleman .
An analysis of the rejected voter list [ csv ] posted on Norm Coleman 's website seems to verify this premise .
The ballots listed on Coleman 's site belong to the C1 region of our absentee ballot universe diagram .
Using the aforementioned data , an extrapolation can be performed :
Download the complete table : PDF 113 KB
The extrapolation uses the final recount result , as certified by the Minnesota State Canvassing Board on January 5th , and assumes that any subsequent absentee ballot , in any county , will follow the trend established by the recount .
All candidates were considered .
A brief synopsis of our results is available below :
Scenario Coleman Net ( 1 ) 100 % of Coleman 's List Accepted : - 84.18 ( 2 ) Only Counties that Coleman Won : 269.98 ( 3 ) 100 % Accepted with 5 % Coleman Bias : 138.72 ( 4 ) Coleman Counties with 5 % Bias : 368.73 Listed from Franken Counties : 2,490 Listed from Coleman Counties : 1,968 Total : 4,458
The results listed above can be used to determine the complete set of potential absentee ballot results .
To determine what would happen if just 20 % of listed ballots were counted with a 10 % uniform bias toward Coleman , above and beyond the recount result , the following calculations can be used :
100 % Accepted with 5 % Coleman Bias = 138.72 x 20 % -----------------------------------------------
20 % Accepted with 5 % Coleman Bias = 27.74 x 2
-----------------------------------------------
20 % Accepted with 10 % Coleman Bias = 55.49
Now that you understand where the data came from and how it can be used , we can discuss what it actually means .
Norm Coleman has essentially two options , they are not mutually exclusive , but they are strongly correlated :
A . Try and cherry pick absentee ballots that come from statistically favorable counties .
B. Hope that the set of currently rejected absentee ballots systematically favors Norm Coleman .
Scenario ( 1 ) represents a complete failure , on the part of the Coleman campaign , to implement either option ( A ) or ( B ) ; scenario ( 2 ) represents the successful implementation of option ( A ) ; scenario ( 3 ) , option ( B ) and scenario ( 4 ) encompasses both options ( A ) and ( B ) .
At this juncture , the Coleman campaign seems to be keeping their options open , but in including more ballots from Franken territory , they seem to be relying more heavily on option ( B ) , despite the lacking quantitative evidence .
The only empirical data pertaining to option ( B ) stems from the testimony of three county election directors ; Joe Mansky representing Ramsey , Kevin Corbid from Washington and the Election Manager of Anoka County , Rachel Smith .
Rachel Smith 's testimony covered the vast majority of the 107 ballots presented by the Coleman side ; from my non-scientific observation of the trial proceedings , Ms. Smith stated that less than five of these ballots were improperly rejected .
Mr. Mansky and Mr. Corbid covered a much smaller and unequally distributed set of the proposed ballots , thus making any reasonable estimate impossible .
With the possible exception of Anoka , any projection of a wrongful rejection rate is a complete shot in the dark .
Regardless of the odds , there are still ballots meriting inclusion and it's entirely possible for Norm Coleman to retake the lead , although not necessarily probable .
To expedite the investigative process , it would make sense for the Election Contest Court to categorize and count the remaining absentee ballots meriting reconsideration .
If upon this categorization and subsequent counting , the Coleman campaign still has a mathematical opportunity to win , the court should proceed by analyzing the category 's most favorable to Coleman first .
If a crucial category is eliminated from contention , the litigation ends and the candidate currently in the lead is issued an official election certificate .
I have not studied the legality of this proposed resolution .
Sixty percent of Americans questioned in a CNN - Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning say they approve of how George H.W. Bush handled his job as president , and 64 percent give a thumbs up to former President Carter .
ON THE eve of his electoral defeat in 1980 , Jimmy Carter 's approval rating hovered around 30 % .
In late 1992 , George Bush Sr saw his approval ratings drop down to the mid-30s .
His son , of course , has been called the most unpopular president of all time .
But as George W Bush hosts the three living ex-presidents and the president - elect today , he can take some heart in the latest poll from CNN
The approval rating for the younger Mr Bush stood at 27 % in late December , according to CNN .
But some on the right foresee a similar turnaround , though the president they often look to as an example is Harry Truman .
For example , yesterday Ishmael Jones said , " If democracy takes root in Iraq and spreads in the region , I think [ Mr Bush ] will be viewed by history as a visionary . "
That is obviously a very optimistic hypothetical .
But if the events set in motion by Mr Bush do eventually result in sustained positive change for the Middle East , it will be interesting to see what becomes of the president 's legacy .
Will historians give him credit for being a visionary , or will they argue , as George Packer has , that a democratic Middle East is merely " the salvaging of a tragedy , not the fulfillment of a vision " ?

The 2008 political cycle was absolutely huge for web design .
With Obama leading the charge , political campaigns finally began to embrace the internet as a critical aspect of a complete campaign strategy .
This change in mindset could be seen in all levels of elections .
Here at New Media Campaigns , we had the wonderful opportunity to look closely at hundreds of campaign websites through our own work as a political web design firm and while building our successful microsite Vote the Site .
This site matched up every U.S. House or Sentate candidate with their rival and allowed people to vote on the better campaign website .
As we looked at the voting results for that project as well as the many sites themselves , design trends began to pop out at us .
Below is a list of the key trends that emerged during the 2008 cycle .
Landing Page for Email Signups
As designers and enthusiastic users of the web , it is easy to be offended by a Flash intro page or interstitial advertisement .
What is clear though , is that having an introduction page to a political site that called for email registration is now standard practice because it is so effective .
The best registration landing pages are well tuned to match the design of the rest of the site , make an email signup as painless as possible , and introduce the candidate through a high quality photo and brief message .
Web 2.0 Style Principles and Politics are a Perfect Match
No , this does n't mean that pastel gradients , bubbly fonts and vowel elimination should be used in political web design .
Rather , campaigns are embracing the core principles of the web 2.0 design movement on their campaign websites .
These key principles are Simplicity above all else , Fewer Columns and a Distinct Header that has Simple Navigation .
Naturally these are also principles for good design in general , but their emphasis in the Web 2.0 movement has made the ideas much more mainstream .
As recent as just two years ago it was rare that one of our clients would specifically ask for " simplicity " to be a component of their web design , but we now get that requirement on nearly every project .
These principles are especially beneficial in politics for two big reasons :
Campaign websites must reach everyone .
When web pages are implemented with standards as well as all browsers in mind , they can reach the widest audience , a critical requirement for a campaign website .
Even voters who live in areas without broadband access need to be able to comfortably browse a candidate 's website .
The best campaigns have a clear message .
With simplicity as a design goal , a candidate 's message can be strongly featured throughout a website .
The most important messages and announcements can be made front and center , without the chance of being missed .
The Action Center
As campaigns learned that they could leverage the internet to engage people online , they also developed the ' Action Center ' as a standard way to quickly show people how they could get involved .
Our internal analytics show that this is an extremely effective way of calling attention to registration pages and social media pages .
We expect this to be used even more frequently in future cycles .
Central , Rotating Announcements Box
Another design element that has become commonplace in campaign websites is the announcements box .
This is usually updated at least weekly in larger campaigns with a news story or announcement .
It also typically includes a photo or custom designed graphic to call attention to the announcement .
This box is typically the first things visitors see when they head to the site .
Again , with standards in mind , this box is usually best achieved through JavaScript rather than Flash .
Blue ( the color )
Since the 2000 and 2004 election cycles , the county has been obsessed with the notion of " Red States " and " Blue States " .
Even as Republicans have clung closer to red in print advertising and general themes , the color blue has dominated web design .
It is probably for this reason that the color blue has been extremely popular with candidates of both parties .
Even John McCain 's website had a strong blue background .
So there are the five big design trends that we saw for the 2008 cycle .
We 're sure there are many more out there -- if you 've spotted one be sure to leave it in the comments .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Business may be slow for the nation 's big banks -- but their public relations departments sure are busy !
Several recipients of government bailout money have recently put out flowery press releases , and in one case , even an advertisement , about their efforts to save the economy .
Last week , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) unveiled what it called the Lending & Investing Initiative , which the bank described in gushing terms as " a comprehensive plan to track and report on Bank of America 's business activity in 10 areas key to reviving the nation 's economy . "
Included in the release was this nugget of information , which does n't exactly inspire confidence , if you ask me .
" [ CEO Ken ]
Lewis will receive regular reports on economic trends and implications for each of the segments housed under the Lending & Investing Initiative . "
Really ?
Was n't Lewis , whose firm has received $ 45 billion in funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , staying on top of economic trends before ?
He 's the CEO of a bank for crying out loud !
This is supposed to be something new ?
On Monday , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) felt the need to point out in a press release that it will soon pay the government $ 371.5 million in dividends on the $ 25 billion in preferred shares that the Treasury invested in the bank last fall .
That 's all well and good .
But paying the dividend is something that the bank is required to do .
In fact , a spokesman for the Treasury Department said late Tuesday that five other banks had already paid their dividends on preferred shares .
So big whoop .
Should I put out a release to tell the world that I paid my mortgage on time ?
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) takes the prize for sheer brazenness .
The bank on Tuesday issued its first of what it is dubbing a quarterly progress report on its use of TARP capital .
The bank , which had to be convinced by the Obama administration that buying a new $ 50 million corporate jet was not a good idea right now , had the audacity to title its report , " What Citi is Doing to Expand the Flow of Credit , Support Homeowners and Help the U.S. Economy . "
In Citi's 43 - page report , CEO Vikram Pandit talked about the bank " working in partnership " with the government and that the bank understands TARP is " about helping the American people , and supporting U.S. businesses and our communities . "
Wow .
What gall !
Citi has received $ 45 billion in bailout money as well as federal guarantees on more than $ 300 billion in loans .
Its stock has plunged 90 % in the past year .
It has laid off more than 50,000 workers .
Meanwhile , it may stick with a $ 400 million , 20 - year naming rights deal for a new baseball stadium in Queens .
Perhaps it should have named the report " What Citi is Doing to Expand the Cash Flow of Short Sellers , Support Pawn Shop Owners and Help the New York Mets re-sign Oliver Perez . "
( Note to aforementioned PR folks , who inevitably will take issue with that previous paragraph : I am aware that Citi said no TARP money is being used for marketing .
So that last part about the Mets is a joke .
But not the stuff about the short sellers and pawn shops ... although Citi definitely is n't supporting one particular pawn shop in Brooklyn , N.Y. )
Now do n't get me wrong .
It 's nice to see that banks are in fact using bailout money to lend .
That 's been one of the biggest criticisms of the bailout by members of Congress and many taxpayers .
Citi said in its release Tuesday that it made $ 75 billion in new loans during the quarter , with $ 36.5 billion backed by TARP funds .
Wells said that it made more than $ 70 billion in loans , most of which were mortgages , in the fourth quarter .
And last week , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which received $ 25 billion from TARP , pointed out in a full - page ad in The New York Times that it loaned more than $ 100 billion in the fourth quarter .
But are n't the banks merely confirming to everyone that they are still banks , i.e. that their business is to lend money ?
All this reminds me of a great bit in a Chris Rock stand - up special from a few years ago .
His response to people who bragged that they take care of their kids was this :
You 're supposed to !
What do you want , a cookie ?
Credit still tight , despite what press releases say
What 's more , one expert said it 's difficult to pinpoint with certainty what any specific amount of money is being used for in a bank 's day - to - day activities .
" Clearly , these [ press releases ] are designed to make a political case so people should have somewhat of a jaundiced eye , " said Daniel Alpert , managing director of Westwood Capital , a New York - based investment bank .
" These institutions receive cash everyday .
If they choose to say that a certain amount of cash went here or there , that 's somewhat manufactured . "
And what 's even more troublesome is that there is a disconnect between what these banks are touting in their press releases and what loan officers at banks across the country told the Federal Reserve about lending activity in the fourth quarter .
According to the Fed 's latest survey , released on Monday , credit is still extremely tight .
For example , almost 80 % of all banks responding to the survey indicated that standards for approving commercial real estate loans got tighter .
Nearly half of the banks said their standards for approving mortgages to prime borrowers ( i.e. people with good credit ) were tougher , while about 60 % of the banks disclosed that they were more stringent in approving credit card applications .
Finally , the Fed said that lending standards for commercial and industrial loans to large and mid-sized businesses remained above the peak levels they hit during the last recessions in 1990 and 2001 .
In other words , you have some big banks putting out press releases that essentially are saying , " Hey .
Look at us !
We 're still lending !
Honestly ! "
But the data from the Fed paints another picture entirely .
I am not suggesting that banks go back to the days of approving anything with a pulse for a no - money - down option ARM that 's destined for default .
But until banks start to lend more freely to responsible individuals and businesses that deserve credit , we will remain in this recession .
" Every metric we look at shows that loan standards are tightening now , which is kind of like closing the barn door after the horses have gone , " said Barry Ritholtz , CEO and director of equity research at research firm Fusion IQ and author of the soon - to - be- published book " Bailout Nation . "

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
An Australian undertaker who got drunk and followed a woman in his hearse , honking the horn and shouting threats , was making a “ cry for help , ” his lawyer told a Sydney court Tuesday .
Adam Lee ’s life revolved around Caring Funerals and his work for the Rotary club , lawyer Roland Bonnicci told the magistrate .
But he acknowledged that Lee , 37 , did binge drink on weekends and his “ mental state is deteriorating , ” the Australian Associated Press ( AAP ) reported .
The prosecutor , Sergeant Paul McGirr , was unimpressed with the man ’s defense .
“ The only cry for help on that evening was the cry for help by Maureen Wyer , who was the victim , ” he said .
The court heard that Wyer was followed through inner-Sydney streets one night in December 2004 and became gravely concerned for her safety because the driver was sounding his horn and yelling , AAP reported .
Lee was found guilty earlier this year of driving while disqualified , drunken driving , driving in a menacing manner and not obeying police instructions .
In sentencing submissions Tuesday , Bonnicci urged the magistrate to place Lee on a psychiatric treatment plan .
Sentencing was set for Thursday .

Update 2
A possible theory has been constructed about what the three main modes could be .
Game —
Play through the game normally .
Hint system is available but not forced .
So hardcore gamers could just play the game regularly and enjoy the challenge while more casual gamers can get hints if they get really stuck
Digest —
The game goes through important scenes ( both movie and gameplay ) in order .
Essentially the game plays itself in this mode if you will .
But you have the option of stopping the digest at any time and playing from that exact point .
Plus when you choose to take control you are given the appropriate equipment and stats for that part of the game .
No saving though , but it seems to be unneeded
Scenes — essentially playthrough any puzzle or scene again .
Like digest you are given the appropriate equipment and such .
If it works this way , both casual and hardcore gamers will see benefits .
The game wo n’t exactly be bogged down by easiness , but casual gamers find it easier to complete it .
Update : Head past the break for a ton of descriptions that may fill in some of the blanks of the patent images .
A patent was discovered today that was apparently filed away with Shigeru Miyamoto as the inventor .
There has been no confirmation that this patent is anything new , and if not , there ’s no clear indication about how old it is ( nor is it confirmed that this will appear in any game at all ) .
A few people have been doing a bit of investigating though .
Interestingly , the details may be related to Zelda and might show that the series will take a more casual approach .
In one image , a picture of what we assume the television screen is .
In the image , a hint button can be seen .
So was Nintendo considering a hint system for a Zelda title ?
Or , are they willing to incorporate hints into the next Zelda ?
There are a few other tidbits as well .
In another one of the patent images , based on the information provided , it looks as though Nintendo had ideas about skipping ahead through the game granted the adventure became too difficult .
This , coupled with the detail about , could possibly show how / if Nintendo plans to make the Zelda series more casual – Remember , Miyamoto stated that he the Zelda series needs to be accessible for casual gamers .
However , keep in mind that , again , this could all amount to nothing .
This news may be something new , or it might not .
Lastly , read the patent information below which originally led to this entire story :
Computer - readable storage medium having game program stored therein , and game apparatus User saved - data storage means S19 stores user saved - data which is generated as a result of a game play performed by a user .
Digest saved - data storage means S48 stores a plurality of pieces of digest saved - data which are previously generated so as to be associated with predetermined scenes , respectively , in a game .
Game start means S14 starts the game process without using the user saved - data and the plurality of pieces of digest saved - data .
Game resuming means S12 , S13 starts the game process by using the user saved - data .
Digest game start means S4 starts the game process by using any of the plurality of pieces of digest saved - data .
Saving means S19 generates the user saved - data , only in the game process started by the game start means or the game resuming means .
[ 0165 ] Further , the use of the digest saved - data may not be allowed for a certain initial time period ( immediately after the game is purchased ) .
For example , although the digest saved - data cannot be used immediately after the game is purchased , a plurality of pieces of the digest saved - data may be gradually used in accordance with a time period in which the game has been played .
In this case , the digest saved - data are set so as not to be used when the game is shipped .
The flash memory 17 [ internal memory ] of the game apparatus body 3 [ Wii ] purchased by a player stores the total cumulative time period obtained by adding the time periods [ EARTH HOURS ] in which the game has been played .
[ 0158 ] As described above , in the present embodiment , when a player cannot find how to solve the “ puzzle ” which is set in the game , the player is allowed to view , in the scene , moving images for indicating how to solve the puzzle when the player desires to .
Therefore , a player that cannot find how to solve the “ puzzle ” may not become stuck with the game , and reduction , due to the puzzle being unsolved , in motivation for clearing the game may be prevented .
Thus , a player unaccustomed to a game or a player that does not have a lot of time for game play is allowed to play and clear the game to the end .
Further , how to solve the “ puzzle ” is indicated as “ moving images ” by using an actual example in which the puzzle is actually solved , and therefore a player knows , for certain , how to actually move ( operate ) the player character .
Therefore , for example , a player that cannot know , from a hint represented by only character information , how to solve the puzzle may not become stuck with the game , and may be allowed to play the game to the end .
Furthermore , the flash memory 17 or the like stores an operation history of a game play of each player , and each player may be allowed to create his / her own “ approach movie ” based on the operation history .
The “ approach movie ” created by each player may be uploaded to the server .
When the hint button 102 is pressed , the server may be accessed so as to view the “ approach movies ” created by various players .
Thus , when , for example , a plurality of methods may be considered as a method for approaching a scene in the game , a plurality of approach methods including an approach method for which a skilled operation is required , a method in which an approach is made in a relatively easy operation , and the like may be viewed .
It is possible to provide each player with information about an approach method which meets , for example , a skill of the each player for game play .
As a result , a player may be prevented from becoming stuck with the game for increased certainty .
Further , when it is possible to create and upload his / her own “ approach movie ” , a player can enjoy introducing his / her skill in the game approach to another player , and the game becomes more enjoyable .
In another exemplary embodiment , a gyro - sensor incorporating , for example , a rotating or vibrating element may be used for a movement sensor for detecting for a movement of the controller 7 .
Exemplary MEMS gyro-sensors that may be used in this embodiment are available from Analog Devices , Inc .
Unlike the acceleration sensor 701 , a gyro - sensor is capable of directly detecting rotation ( or angular rate ) around at least one axis defined by the gyroscopic element therein .
Thus , due to the fundamental differences between a gyro - sensor and an acceleration sensor , corresponding changes need to be made to the processing operations that are performed on the output signals from these devices depending on which device is selected for a particular application .
[ 0099 ] More specifically , when the tilt or attitude is calculated using a gyro - sensor instead of the acceleration sensor , significant changes are necessary .
Specifically , when using a gyro - sensor , the value of the tilt is initialized at the start of the detection .
Then , data on the angular rate which is output from the gyro - sensor is integrated .
Next , a change amount in tilt from the value of the tilt initialized is calculated .
In this case , the calculated tilt corresponds to a value represented by an angle .
In contrast , when the acceleration sensor calculates the tilt , the tilt is calculated by comparing the value of the gravitational acceleration of each axial component with a predetermined reference , and therefore the calculated tilt can be represented as a vector , and an absolute direction can be determined with an acceleration detection means without initialization .
The type of the value calculated as the tilt is also very different between a gyro sensor and an acceleration sensor ; i.e. , the value is an angle when a gyro sensor is used and is a vector when an acceleration sensor is used .
Therefore , when a gyro sensor is used instead of an acceleration sensor or vice versa , data on tilt also needs to be processed through a predetermined conversion taking into account the fundamental differences between these two devices .
Due to the fact that the nature of the gyro sensor is known to one skilled in the art , as well as the fundamental differences between the acceleration detection means and the gyro sensor , further details are not provided herein .
While a gyro - sensor is advantageous in that a rotation can be directly detected , an acceleration sensor is generally more cost effective when used in connection with the controller described herein .

In the scene shown in FIG .
11 , when a player cannot find how to open the door 103 , a player may press the hint button 102 .
In this case , as shown in FIG .
12 , a relatively small window 104 is displayed in a portion of the upper right area of the screen so as to reproduce moving images ( hereinafter , referred to as an approach movie ) indicating how to open the door 103 .
In FIG . 12 , an approach movie representing a state where the player character 101 moves onto a switch 105 provided on the floor for opening the door 103 , and stands on the switch 105 ( that is , presses the switch 105 ) is reproduced .
By viewing the approach movie , the player can know how to open the door 103 .
Therefore , the player moves the player character 101 to the switch 105 provided on the floor , and causes the player character 101 to stand thereon , as indicated by the approach movie , so as to open the door 103 , thereby continuing the game .
[ 0109 ] Next , an outline of a process performed when the “ digest ” is selected from the title menu shown in FIG .
8 will be described .
When the “ digest ” is selected , a digest movie , which has been previously set , is reproduced .
FIG .
13 shows an exemplary game screen displayed when the “ digest ” is selected .
In FIG .
13 , a digest movie is displayed in a movie area 110 , and a scene name 111 representing a current scene is displayed below the movie area 110 .
The digest movie includes , for example , a “ played moving image ” representing a recorded image of a game screen obtained by a game developer having actually played the game , an “ event movie ” which is inserted in the game as necessary , and the like .
For example , the game is played in accordance with a scenario having a storyline representing the order of “ forest ” .
fwdarw . ” cave ” .
fwdarw .” tower ” . fwdarw .” temple ” .
In this case , the content of the digest movie is reproduced as a digest such that the game starts with a scene of “ forest ” and advances to “ cave ” .
fwdarw . ” tower ” .
fwdarw .” temple ” .
A player is allowed to know a main game story and scenario , and a game plot by viewing the digest movie .
[ 0110 ] Further , in a case where a player presses a predetermined button , for example , the operation button 72d while the digest movie is being reproduced , the player is allowed to play the game from the scene being reproduced at this time .
For example , it is assumed that , when fifteen minutes has passed from the start of the reproduction of the digest movie , a played moving image for “ temple ” corresponding to one of stages of the game is being reproduced .
At this time , when a player presses the operation button 72d , an inquiry message 112 for inquiring whether or not the game is to be played from this scene is displayed as shown in FIG .
14 .
When a player responds positively to the message , the saved data ( hereinafter , referred to as digest saved - data ) for digest , which has been previously set , is read .
As described below , the digest saved - data are saved data which is previously set so as to correspond to the scenes , respectively , in the game .
In a case shown in FIG .
14 , based on the assumption that the game has been played up to the moment immediately before the temple , the saved data having been previously set is read .
Therefore , a level and various statuses ( parameter such as HP ) of the player character are advanced to some degree as compared to those provided when the game is started .
Further , items which may belong to the player character when the game has been normally played and advanced to the temple are set as items belonging to the player character .
Specifically , saved data to be used when attacking against the temple is ready is read .
It is possible to start the game from the scene of “ temple ” by reading the digest saved - data described above .
However , in this game , data of the game which is started in this manner is not saved .
That is , only the data of the game obtained by a user performing attacking by him / herself are stored , so that a user who performs attacking by him / herself may not reduce his / her interest in the game .
Hereinafter , a game play in which the game is started , while the digest movie is being reproduced , in a state where no data of the game is saved , is referred to as a game played in a “ digest mode ” .
However , data may be saved in the digest mode when it is unnecessary to consider that the interest in the game is maintained .
[ 0111 ] A difference between the user saved - data and the digest saved - data will be described .
The user saved - data can be “ loaded ” when the “ game ” is selected from the title menu , and the user saved - data is generated and stored when a player issues an instruction for the saving while playing the game .
On the other hand , the digest saved - data is different from the user saved - data in that the digest saved - data is previously set based on the game storyline as described above , and is stored as a part of the game program in the game disc 4 .
As described above , the saving is not allowed in the digest mode , whereas the user saved - data to be stored is obtained only when a user plays the game from the beginning , and performs attacking by him / herself

One of the most used features in any programming language is a Hash .
Today we are going to talk about some of the Ruby ’s Hash features , which are well documented , but rarely used — parameters of the Hash constructor .
In the second part of this article we will take a look at the arguments of the Array class ’ constructor .
Take a look at the following example .
1
2
3
4
5
6
a = % w ( apple banana apple )
h = a. inject ( { } ) do | h , fruit |
h [ fruit ] || = 0
h [ fruit ] + = 1
h
end
Here we have an array of fruits and we need to calculate a frequency of each fruit .
As you can see , in the line 3 we are initializing frequency value to 0 if there are was no fruit with this name before .
We can simplify this code :
1
2
3
4
5
a = % w ( apple banana apple )
h = a. inject ( Hash .
new ( 0 ) ) do | h , fruit |
h [ fruit ] + = 1
h
end
In line 2 we are creating a new hash , which default value is 0 .
This means that if we would try to retrieve value for a non-existing key , 0 would be returned .
Let ’s check another example :
1
2
3
4
5
6
a = % w ( apple banana apple )
h = { }
a. each_with_index do | fruit , i |
h [ fruit ] || = [ ]
h [ fruit ] << i
end
Here we are collecting indexes of each fruit in the source array .
But now we ca n’t just create a new hash and pass [ ] as the default value , because all keys in this hash will refer to the same array , so in result we will get an array [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] for each fruit .
So let ’s try the following :
1
2
3
4
5
a = % w ( apple banana apple )
h = Hash .
new { | h , key | h [ key ] = [ ] }
a. each_with_index do | fruit , i |
h [ fruit ] << i
end
In this case we are creating a new array object for any non-existing key , that was accessed .
So
1
h [ ' some non-existing key ' ]
will return [ ] and save it in the hash .
When you will hit this key next time , previously created array will be returned .
You can pass a block to Array constructor too .
For example , you need an array with 10 random numbers :
1
2
a = [ ]
10 . times { a << rand ( 100 ) }
You can simplify it using map method :
1
a = ( 1 .. 10 ) . map { rand ( 100 ) }
But you can do it even easier :
1
a = Array . new ( 10 ) { rand ( 100 ) }
Next Memo will cover managing Ruby Gems , so stay tuned .
" The next president may have to deal with a nuclear attack , " averred ABC ’s Charles Gibson at Saturday night ’s Democratic presidential debate .
" The day after a nuclear weapon goes off in an American city , what would we wish we had done to prevent it and what will we actually do on the day after ? "
It ’s a question that frightens everyone , and one to which there is no easy answer : none of the candidates really rose to the occasion , and most seemed baffled .
Hillary Clinton made sure she used the word " retaliation " with unusual emphasis , and when pressed on the question of how she would retaliate against " stateless " terrorists nevertheless insisted that she would indeed retaliate against someone , because the perpetrators had to have a " haven " somewhere within a state .
Yes , well , that ’s not necessarily true , but what if that " haven " is right here in the U.S. ?
Or , perhaps , in a NATO country , say , Turkey ?
Say what ?
Impossible , you say ?
Not if you believe Sibel Edmonds , a former translator for the FBI who listened in on hundreds of telephone intercepts and has now told the London Times that several top U.S. government officials conspired with foreign agents to steal U.S. nuclear secrets and sell them on the black market .
The Times reports :
" Edmonds described how foreign intelligence agents had enlisted the support of U.S. officials to acquire a network of moles in sensitive military and nuclear institutions .
" Among the hours of covert tape recordings , she says she heard evidence that one well - known senior official in the U.S. State Department was being paid by Turkish agents in Washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers , including Pakistan .
The name of the official  who has held a series of top government posts  is known to The Sunday Times .
He strongly denies the claims .
However , Edmonds said : ‘ He was aiding foreign operatives against U.S. interests by passing them highly classified information , not only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon , in exchange for money , position and political objectives . ’
" She claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior Pentagon officials  including household names  who were aiding foreign agents .
‘ If you made public all the information that the FBI have on this case , you will see very high - level people going through criminal trials , ’ she said . "
Edmonds brought all this to the attention of lawmakers , as well as the American media , and several news organizations filed reports  until a federal judge issued an unprecedented gag order .
Edmonds ’ story was deemed too hot to handle : if the public were allowed to know what she knows , according to our government , America ’s national security would be severely impaired .
Yet now she is speaking out , and what she has to say is unsettling , to say the least .
Edmonds has named at least one of the officials : he is Marc Grossman , a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey , assistant secretary of state for European affairs under the Clinton administration and undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2001 - 2005 .
Grossman is now vice chairman of The Cohen Group , a consulting firm founded by Bill Clinton ’s defense secretary , William S. Cohen .
Edmonds contends that an international nuclear smuggling ring , associated with the intelligence agencies of Pakistan , Turkey , and Israel , has been permitted to operate in the U.S. with impunity .
Our government , she claims , knew all about it yet , in order to placate the foreign governments involved , allowed a vast criminal enterprise to carry out its activities , including money laundering , narcotics trafficking , and espionage involving efforts to steal U.S. nuclear technology .
As a translator for the FBI , Edmonds had the task of translating many hours of intercepted phone conversations between Turkish officials and Pakistanis , Israelis , and Americans who were targets of the FBI ’s counterintelligence unit .
Thousands of hours of intercepted calls revealed a network of moles placed in various military installations and academic venues dealing with nuclear technology .
Edmonds gives us the details , via the Times :
" Edmonds says there were several transactions of nuclear material every month , with the Pakistanis being among the eventual buyers .
‘ The network appeared to be obtaining information from every nuclear agency in the United States , ’ she said .
" They were helped , she says , by the high - ranking State Department official [ Marc Grossman ] who provided some of their moles  mainly Ph.D. students  with security clearance to work in sensitive nuclear research facilities .
These included the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory in New Mexico , which is responsible for the security of the U.S. nuclear deterrent . "
And " while the FBI was investigating , " says Edmonds , " several arms of the government were shielding what was going on . "
An entire wing of the national security bureaucracy , associated with the neoconservatives , has long profited from representing Turkish interests in Washington : this group includes not only Grossman , but also Paul Wolfowitz , chief intellectual architect of the Iraq war and ex-World Bank president ; former deputy defense secretary for policy Douglas J. Feith ; Feith ’s successor , Eric Edelman ; and Richard Perle , the notorious uber - neocon whose unique ability to mix profiteering and warmongering forced him to resign his official capacity as a key administration adviser .
Edmonds draws a picture of a three - sided alliance consisting of Turkish , Pakistani , and Israeli agents who coordinated efforts to milk U.S. nuclear secrets and technology , funneling the intelligence stream to the black market nuclear network set up by the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan .
The multi-millionaire Pakistani nuclear scientist then turned around and sold his nuclear assets to North Korea , Libya , and Iran .
This was no " rogue " operation , but a covert action executed by Gen.
Mahmoud Ahmad , the chief of Pakistan ’s intelligence service , the ISI , at the time .
The Turks were used as intermediaries because direct ISI intervention would have roused immediate suspicion .
Large amounts of cash were dropped off at the offices of Turkish - American lobbying groups , such as the American Turkish Council in Washington , which was reportedly picked up by at least one top U.S. official .
This Pakistani -Turkish - Israeli Axis of Espionage , operating through their respective embassies , systematically combed Washington officialdom for potential moles , compiling lists that , according to Edmonds and the Times , “ contained all their ‘ hooking points , ’ which could be financial or sexual pressure points , their exact job in the Pentagon and what stuff they had access to . ”
Nice work , there .
This sounds a lot like the setup the handlers of convicted spy Larry Franklin worked with to glean information from the rabidly pro-Israel Franklin and pass it off to Israeli embassy officials , including former Israeli ambassador Danny Ayalon ; Naor Gilon , the former political officer at the embassy ; and Rafi Barak , the former deputy chief of mission .
And there is indeed a connection to the Franklin case , according to the Times ,
" One of the Pentagon figures under investigation was Lawrence Franklin , a former Pentagon analyst , who was jailed in 2006 for passing U.S. defense information to lobbyists and sharing classified information with an Israeli diplomat .
‘ He was one of the top people providing information and packages during 2000 and 2001 , ’ [ Edmonds ] said . "
Franklin delivered his " packages " to AIPAC officials Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman and their Israeli handlers for ideological reasons , but others , such as Grossman  according to Edmonds  did it for money .
Grossman angrily denies the charge .
In any case , apparently large cash transactions were recorded on the tapes Edmonds translated , in which U.S. officials were heard selling the nation ’s nuclear secrets .
As the Times relates :
" Well - known U.S. officials were then bribed by foreign agents to steal U.S. nuclear secrets .
One such incident from 2000 involves an agent overheard on a wiretap discussing ‘ nuclear information that had been stolen from an air force base in Alabama , ’ in which the agent allegedly is heard saying :
‘ We have a package and we ’re going to sell it for $ 250,000 . ’ "
A vast criminal enterprise supported by at least three foreign intelligence agencies acting in concert with top U.S. officials , including some " household names "  if true , it ’s the story of the decade .
Yet that is n’t all .
The really scary aspect of this labyrinthine network of foreign agents , and their American dupes and collaborators , is its connections to terrorist organizations , specifically al - Qaeda .
To begin with , Gen .
Ahmad is suspected of having wired a large amount of money into Mohammed Atta ’s Dubai bank account shortly before the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
More ominously , the Times reports : " Following 9/11 , a number of the foreign operatives were taken in for questioning by the FBI on suspicion that they knew about or somehow aided the attacks . "
Pakistani and / or Turkish operatives arrested or held for questioning in the wake of the 9/11 attacks ?
Well , that ’s the first I ’ve heard of it .
However , the U.S. authorities did round up a large number of Israelis , including these guys , and held them for several months before extraditing them back to their home country .
Even more alarming is the reason Edmonds approached the Times with the story , " after reading about an al - Qaeda terrorist who had revealed his role in training some of the 9/11 hijackers while he was in Turkey . "
That ’s a reference to this Nov. 2 story in the Times , which details the career of a top al - Qaeda kingpin , one Louai al - Sakka , who claims to have trained several of the 9/11 hijackers at a camp situated outside Istanbul in the resort area of the Yalova mountains .
Now that ‘s curious : a Muslim fundamentalist training camp in a country run by a fanatically secular military that would normally not tolerate such activities .
As the Times puts it : " Turkish intelligence were aware of unusual militant Islamic activity in the Yalova mountains , where Sakka had set up his camps .
But they posed no threat to Turkey at the time . "
Not a threat to Turkey , eh ?
All too true : the terrorists ’ target was the U.S.
The al - Qaeda recruits trained by Sakka were specifically chosen by the top leadership of al - Qaeda  i.e. , bin Laden  to carry out the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center .
That they were nurtured and steeled for their mission under the noses of our NATO allies in Ankara seems bizarre  until one begins to take Sibel Edmonds seriously .
Then the whole horrifying picture starts to fall into place .
The darkest secrets of 9/11 are buried at the end of the trail laid out in Edmonds ’ testimony .
As Luke Ryland , the world ’s foremost expert on the Edmonds case , writes :
" The Times article then notes something that I reported 18 months ago .
Immediately after 911 , the FBI arrested a bunch of people suspected of being involved with the attacks  including four associates of key targets of FBI ’s counterintelligence operations .
Sibel heard the targets tell Marc Grossman : ‘ We need to get them out of the U.S. because we ca n’t afford for them to spill the beans . ’
Grossman duly facilitated their release from jail and the suspects immediately left the country without further investigation or interrogation .
" Let me repeat that for emphasis : The # 3 guy at the State Dept. facilitated the immediate release of 911 suspects at the request of targets of the FBI ’s investigation . "
Corruption and a massive cover - up organized at the highest levels of government 
America ’s nuclear secrets and technology looted on a massive scale , and sold to our enemies via a network set up by our alleged foreign " friends , " while the threat of nuclear terrorism hangs over our country like a thick fog of fear , and warmongering politicians scare us into going along with the program  if even half of what Edmonds alleges turns out to be true , then we are all in some very big trouble .
In light of the Edmonds revelations , we have to reconsider the implications of the question Charles Gibson opened with during the ABC Democratic debate :
" The day after a nuclear weapon goes off in an American city , what would we wish we had done to prevent it and what will we actually do on the day after ? "
Perhaps congressman Henry Waxman , who solemnly pledged to launch a public investigation into the allegations made by Edmonds , will wish he had kept his promise .
Maybe even the national news media , which has been offered this story repeatedly , by Ms. Edmonds and her supporters , will wish they had covered it .
Fortunately , we do n’t need the " mainstream " media to get the truth out to the American people .
With the new technology of the computer age , we can do an end run around the media .
This YouTube video is shocking :
As Edmonds says , " we have the facts , we have the documents , we have the witnesses .
Put out the tapes , put out the documents , put out the intercepts  put out the truth . "
If a nuke ever goes off in an American city , it will probably have been stolen from our own arsenal  once the American people wake up to that scary fact , the rest will follow automatically .
How social are these mega social networks ?
Well social enough for Facebook to have courted Twitter most recently ... to only be rebuffed as a lustful suitor too eager to get to third base before the first pitch was thrown .
Back in fall of 2008 , Facebook offered Twitter $ 500 million in stock to wed and bed her .
However , the deal broke down when Twitter assessed that the dowry Facebook was presenting might not actually be worth the paper it was written on .
While some sources at Facebook said CEO Mark Zuckerberg was becoming envious of the buzz Twitter was attracting , across the Internet–a space that heretofore was dominated by Facebook .
On the flip of things , if Facebook was so enamored with Twitter 's cache how did it overlook some its obvious flaws ?
After all , Twitter for all its success in viral marketing is still floundering in the red .
In fact , presently there are more expenses on the balance sheet than there is revenue .
For those not familiar , the premise of Twitter is based on the simple business mode of microblogging where , a registered user logs onto the Internet or a mobile phone and answers only one basic question : “ What are you doing ? ”
The only requirement for the sender is that they accomplish that " tweet " in 140 characters or less !
The onus then falls on their brethren tweeps whether they respond favorably or otherwise …or just ignore it altogether !
And based on that very basic premise , investors are very enthusiastic about Twitter , and have already handed over $ 20 million for the start - up .
Twitter now valued at $ 98 million includes investors such as Union Square Ventures , Charles River Ventures , Digital Garage , Spark Capital , Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and Silicon Valley guru Marc Andreessen , founder of Ning.com .
Interestingly , Andreessen is also on Facebook ’s board …. talk about having your cake and eat it too !
On the revenue side , Twitter has been exploring options like charging business customers and adding advertising onto their consumer platform .
One of the most recent examples of companies benefiting commercially from Twitter is Dell Computes who reportedly made $ 1 million in sales during the holidays by microblogging on Twitter , and recently started giving discounts exclusively to its Twitter followers .
Seems to me , the executive board at Twitter would be anxious to get a cut of that action !
Lack of revenues was an issue for Facebook , said sources referring to what Twitter pays for delivery of its messages to cell phones .
So if Twitter 's 6 million users were to merge with Facebook ’s 175 million active users , Facebook execs estimated that it might have to deal with huge SMS fees–up to $ 75 million annually .
At first blush , with the numbers so high on the Facebook side , it appears that Facebook may actually be the Goliath to Twitter ’s David .
However , if that be the case , the slingshot that Twitter is wielding might actually be a disguised WMD , based on the recent traffic numbers .
Over the course of the last year , traffic to Twitter , used by celebrities as famous as US president Barack Obama , has increased by 1191 per cent , while visitors to Facebook paled in comparison with a 110 % rise ( according to industry analysts Hitwise ) .
With stats , like these , it begs the question :
Is Twitter in the passing lane , with Facebook in its rearview mirror ?
No one knows just where Facebook is headed or whether it 's serious about dominating the social media landscape , particularly after the outrage it caused when it tried to change its Terms Of Service .
It 's easy for bloggers to speculate that with every new app and every incremental change to its platform , that such a plan has been set in motion , but to date there is no concrete evidence .
Mike Butcher at TechCrunch UK believes that Facebook has a fundamentally different relationship model than Twitter .
On Facebook , you create a simple two - way friendship with someone .
On Twitter , you can choose to follow someone and you can be followed , but the subsequent relationship does n't have to be bidirectional .
In my humble opinion , Twitter has a leg up on Facebook in its control over the media .
To me , I view Twitter as the 21 Century version of the town crier .
Where Facebook , does n’t break the news , Twitter is fast becoming the place to be to get your most updated news blurbs before it hits the mainstream media outlets .
News stories like the recent “ Google malware fiasco ” or the “ imposter Dalai Lama ” are prime examples of how the buzz starts with Twitter and then spills over into the traditional channels .
Why … some people are irreverent enough to believe that God needs to start following Twitter !
For now , a marriage between Twitter and Facebook does n’t spell out kismet .
Perhaps , the courtship between the two Web 2.0 sweethearts could be rekindled sometime in the future .
After all , when one party is only 5 years old and the other is just turning 3 , an arranged wedding might be a wee bit premature .
Maybe the match - up between the two Goliaths is in its early stages of a " Harry Met Sally " relationship , and it needs time to mature before it can become a true and lasting bond .
As in Twitter , you can be " followed " and you can be a " follower " , but it takes a true seasoned member of the twitterati to be both !
Refuted economic doctrines # 1 : The efficient markets hypothesis
Over at my blog , I ’ve started a series of posts on economic doctrines and policy proposals that have been refuted or rendered obsolete by the financial crisis .
There will be a bit of repetition of material I ’ve already posted and I ’ll probably edit the posts in response to points raised in discussion .
I ’m crossposting here in the hope of getting more discussion , but readers who are n’t interested in econowonk stuff may want to skip this series .
Number
One on the list is a topic I ’ve covered plenty of times before ( in fact , I was writing about it fifteen years ago ) , the efficient ( financial ) markets hypothesis .
It ’s going first because it is really the central microeconomic issue in a wide range of policy debates that will ( I hope ) be covered later in this series .
Broadly speaking , the efficient markets hypothesis says that the prices generated by financial markets represent the best possible estimate of the values of the underlying assets .
The hypothesis comes in three forms .
The weak version ( which stands up well , though not perfectly , to empirical testing ) says that it is impossible to predict future movements in asset prices on the basis of past movements , in the manner supposedly done by sharemarket chartists .
While most of what is described by chartists as ‘ technical analysis ’ is mere mumbo- jumbo , there is some evidence of longer - term reversion to mean values that may violate the weak form of the EMH .
The strong version , which gained some credence during the financial bubble era says that asset prices represent the best possible estimate taking account of all information , both public and private .
It was this claim that lay behind the proposal for ‘ terrorism futures ’ put forward , and quickly abandoned a couple of years ago .
It seems unlikely that strong - form EMH is going to be taken seriously in the foreseeable future , given the magnitude of asset pricing failures revealed by the crisis .
For most policy issues , the important issue is the “ semi- strong ” version which says that asset prices are at least as good as any estimate that can be made on the basis of publicly available information .
It follows , in the absence of distorting taxes or other market failures that the best way to allocate scarce capital and other resources is to seek to maximise the market value of the associated assets .
Another way of presenting the semi-strong EMH is to say whether or not markets are perfectly efficient , they ’re better than any other possible capital allocation method , or at least , better than any practically feasible alternative .
The hypothesis can be tested in various ways .
First , it is possible to undertake econometric tests of its predictions .
Most obviously , the weak form of the hypothesis precludes the existence of predictable patterns in asset prices ( unless predictability is so low that transactions costs exceed the profits that could be gained by trading on them ) .
This test is generally passed .
On the other hand , a number of studies have suggested that the volatility of asset prices is greater than is predicted by semi-strong and strong forms of the hypothesis ( note to readers – can anyone recommend a good literature survey on this point ) .
While econometric tests can be given a rigorous justification , they are rarely conclusive , since it is usually possible to get somewhat different results with a different specification or a different data set .
Most people are more likely to form their views on the EMH on the basis of beliefs about the presence or absence of ‘ bubbles ’ in asset prices , that is , periods in which prices move steadily further and further away from underlying values .
For those who still believed the EMH , the recent crisis should have shaken their faith greatly .
But , although the consequences were less severe , the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s was , to my mind , are more clear - cut and convincing example of an asset price bubble .
Anyone could see , and many said , that this was a bubble , but those , like George Soros , who tried to profit by shortselling lost their money when the bubble lasted longer than expected ( perhaps long - dated put options would have provided a safer way to bet on an eventual bursting of the bubble , but Soros did n’t try this , and neither did I. )
More important than asset markets themselves is their role in the allocation of investment .
As Keynes ( allegedly ) said in his General Theory of Employment Interest and Money , , this job is unlikely to be well done when it is a by - product of the activities of a casino .
So , if the superficial resemblance of asset markets to gigantic casinos reflects reality , we would expect to see distortions in patterns of savings and investment .
The dotcom bubble provides a good example , with around a trillion dollars of investment capital being poured into speculative investments .
Some of this was totally dissipated , while much of the remainder was used in a massive , and premature , expansion of the capacity of optical fibre networks ( the fraudulent claims of Worldcom played a big role here ) .
Eventually , most of this “ dark fibre ” bandwidth was taken up , but in investment allocation timing is just as important as project selection .
The dotcom bubble was just one component of a massive asset price bubble that began in the early 1990s and is only now coming to an end .
Throughout this period , patterns of savings and investment made little sense .
Household savings plunged to zero and below in a number of developed countries ( including nearly all English - speaking countries ) and the resulting current account deficits were met by borrowing from rapidly growing poor countries like China ( standard economics would suggest that capital flows should go in the other direction ) .
The massive growth of the financial sector itself , which accounted for nearly half of all corporate profits by the end of the bubble , diverted physical and particularly human capital from the production of goods and services .
Finally , it is useful to look at the actual operations of the financial sector .
Even the strongest advocates of the EMH would not seek to apply it to , say , the Albanian financial sector in the 1990s , which was little more than a series of Ponzi schemes .
They would however want to argue that the massively sophisticated global financial markets of today , with the multiple safeguards of domestic and international financial regulation , private sector ratings agencies and the teams of analysts employed by Wall Street investment banks is not susceptible to such systemic problems , and is capable of correcting them quickly as they arise , without any need for large - scale and intrusive government intervention .
I ’ll leave it to readers to make their own judgements ( maybe with some links when I get around to it ) .
Once the EMH is abandoned , it seems likely that markets will do better than governments in planning investments in some cases ( those where a good judgement of consumer demand is important , for example ) and worse in others ( those requiring long - term planning , for example ) .
The logical implication is that a mixed economy will outperform both central planning and laissez faire , as was indeed the experience of the 20th century .

FAQ On Alcohol
Page 1 of 2
There 's hardly a man who does n't enjoy his drink , but few among us know what the happy elixir does to the body and the mind .
This FAQ on alcohol is not meant to turn you away from your beer , but to let you know what happens when you throw a few ones back .
Why does alcohol lower inhibitions ?
Can we develop a higher tolerance to alcohol ?
Why do we sometimes get sick when drinking ?
Is it bad to drink alcohol on an empty stomach ?
Why do we get dehydrated from alcohol ?
Alcohol acts as a sedative on the central nervous system , which explains the impaired speech , vision , coordination , and concentration .
But the part of the brain it affects the most is the part responsible for behavior and emotion .
Your sense of judgment is weakened , and suddenly speaking your mind does n't seem so bad .
You feel braver since your socially conditioned safety stops or filters are circumvented .
This is why drunken people sometimes think they 're OK to drive .
Any fast - living college dude will tell you that it 's getting more and more expensive for him to get drunk .
No kidding .
Prolonged alcohol use does increase your tolerance to the stuff .
The body becomes more efficient at metabolizing the alcohol — the process is up to 72 % faster in alcoholics — so it takes more booze to achieve the same drunken state .
But beyond that , your organs simply become less sensitive to alcohol , so you do n't feel it as much .
Be careful ; this is a precursor to permanent tissue damage .
Good thing you read this FAQ on alcohol before you skin blisters yellow .
Like many of us , you 've probably had an upset stomach or thrown up at one point after drinking .
A byproduct of alcohol breakdown by the liver is acetaldehyde , a toxic substance .
It is , in fact , this molecule that causes impairment , not the ethanol in your drink .
In high concentrations , acetaldehyde attacks the liver , the brain and the lining of the stomach .
This is what causes the familiar upset stomach and heartburn .
If it 's too much for the body to handle , it forces the stuff out , resulting in a make - out session with a toilet bowl .
Acetaldehyde poisoning is compounded when different alcohols are mixed .
It 's bad only if you plan on enjoying your night to its fullest .
When you drink on an empty stomach , there 's no food to slow the absorption of the booze .
Result : the alcohol gets absorbed faster ( within five minutes ) and you get intoxicated more rapidly .
You 'll get just as drunk as if your stomach was full , but it will hit you harder .
On the other hand , drinking alcohol on a full stomach allows you to go through a gradual ascent into tipsiness .
The body starts breaking down alcohol as soon as you take your first sip , in order to safely excrete it .
To properly dispose of it , your liver needs water to dilute the toxins , so it pulls water reserves from other parts of the body .
But since alcohol is a diuretic ( it stimulates urination ) , water leaves your body at a higher rate , so your liver must obtain water from other organs , including your brain , which essentially leaves you high and dry .
Our FAQ on alcohol continues with more questions , such as : Can alcohol can kill you ?
Why does alcohol make you emotional ?
Can you drink alcohol while taking antibiotics ?

This is the twelfth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review a trilogy of lectures on graph and shortest path algorithms .
They are lectures seventeen , eighteen and nineteen .
They 'll cover Dijkstra 's Algorithm , Breadth - First Search Algorithm and Bellman - Ford Algorithm for finding single - source shortest paths as well as Floyd - Warshall Algorithm and Johnson 's Algorithm for finding all - pairs shortest paths .
These algorithms require a thorough understanding of graphs .
See the previous lecture for a good review of graphs .
Lecture seventeen focuses on the single - source shortest - paths problem : Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , we want to find a shortest path from a given source vertex s ?
V to each vertex v ?
V .
In this lecture the weights of edges are restricted to be positive which leads it to Dijkstra 's algorithm and in a special case when all edges have unit weight to Breadth - first search algorithm .
Lecture eighteen also focuses on the same single - source shortest - paths problem , but allows edges to be negative .
In this case a negative - weight cycles may exist and Dijkstra 's algorithm would no longer work and would produce incorrect results .
Bellman - Ford algorithm therefore is introduced that runs slower than Dijkstra 's but detects negative cycles .
As a corollary it is shown that Bellman - Ford solves Linear Programming problems with constraints in form x j - x i <= w ij .
Lecture nineteen focuses on the all - pairs shortest - paths problem :
Find a shortest path from u to v for every pair of vertices u and v.
Although this problem can be solved by running a single - source algorithm once from each vertex , it can be solved faster with Floyd - Warshall algorithm or Johnson 's algorithm .
Lecture 17 : Shortest Paths I : Single - Source Shortest Paths and Dijkstra's Algorithm
Lecture seventeen starts with a small review of paths and shortest paths .
It reminds that given a graph G = ( V , E , w ) , where V is a set of vertices , E is a set of edges and w is weight function that maps edges to real - valued weights , a path p from a vertex u to a vertex v in this graph is a sequence of vertices ( v 0 , v 1 , ... , v k ) such that u = v 0 , v = v k and ( v i - 1 , v i ) ?
E. The weight w ( p ) of this path is a sum of weights over all edges = w(v 0 , v 1 ) + w(v 1 , v 2 ) + ... + w( v k- 1 , v k ) .
It also reminds that a shortest path from u to v is the path with minimum weight of all paths from u to v , and that a shortest path in a graph might not exist if it contains a negative weight cycle .
The lecture then notes that shortest paths exhibit the optimal substructure property - a subpath of a shortest path is also a shortest path .
The proof of this property is given by cut and paste argument .
If you remember from previous two lectures on dynamic programming and greedy algorithms , an optimal substructure property suggests that these two techniques could be applied to solve the problem efficiently .
Indeed , applying the greedy idea , Dijkstra 's algorithm emerges .
Here is a somewhat precise definition of single - source shortest paths problem with non-negative edge weights : Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , and a starting vertex s ?
V , find shortest - path weights for all vertices v ?
V .
Here is the greedy idea of Dijkstra 's algorithm :
1. Maintain a set S of vertices whose shortest - path from s are known ( s ? S initially ) .
2 . At each step add vertex v from the set V - S to the set S. Choose v that has minimal distance from s ( be greedy ) .
3 . Update the distance estimates of vertices adjacent to v .
I have also posted a video interview with Edsger Dijkstra - Edsger Dijkstra : Discipline in
Thought , please take a look if you want to see how Dijkstra looked like . :)
The lecture continues with an example of running Dijkstra 's algorithm on a non-trivial graph .
It also introduces to a concept of a shortest path tree - a tree that is formed by edges that were last relaxed in each iteration ( hard to explain in English , see lecture at 43:40 ) .
The other half of lecture is devoted to three correctness arguments of Dijkstra 's algorithm .
The first one proves that relaxation never makes a mistake .
The second proves that relaxation always makes the right greedy choice .
And the third proves that when algorithm terminates the results are correct .
At the final minutes of lecture , running time of Dijkstra 's algorithm is analyzed .
Turns out that the running time depends on what data structure is used for maintaining the priority queue of the set V - S ( step 2 ) .
If we use an array , the running time is O ( V2 ) , if we use binary heap , it 's O ( E·lg ( V ) ) and if we use Fibonacci heap , it 's O ( E + V·lg ( V ) ) .
Finally a special case of weighted graphs is considered when all weights are unit weights .
In this case a single - source shortest - paths problem can be solved by a the Breadth - first search ( BFS ) algorithm that is actually a simpler version of Dijkstra 's algorithm with priority queue replaced by a FIFO !
The running time of BFS is O ( V+E ) .

Lecture 18 : Shortest Paths II : Bellman - Ford Algorithm
Lecture eighteen begins with recalling that if a graph contains a negative weight cycle , then a shortest path may not exist and gives a geometric illustration of this fact .
Right after this fact , it jumps to Bellman - Ford algorithm .
The Bellman - Ford algorithm solves the single - source shortest - paths problem in the general case in which edge weights may be negative .
Given a weighted , directed graph G = ( V , E ) with source s and weight function w : E ?
R , the Bellman - Ford algorithm produces the shortest paths from s and their weights , if there is no negative weight cycle , and it produces no answer if there is a negative weight cycle .
The algorithm uses relaxation , progressively decreasing an estimate on the weight of a shortest path from the source s to each vertex v ?
V until it achieves the actual shortest - path weight .
The running time of Bellman - Ford algorithm is O ( VE ) .
The lecture also gives a correctness proof of Bellman - Ford algorithm .
The other half of the lecture is devoted to a problem that can be effectively solved by Bellman - Ford .
It 's called the linear feasibility problem that it is a special case of linear programming ( LP ) problem , where there is no objective but the constraints are in form x i <= w ij .
It is noted that Bellman - Ford is actually a simple case of LP problem .
The lecture ends with an application of Bellman - Ford to solving a special case of VLSI layout problem in 1 dimension .

Lecture 19 : Shortest Paths III : All - Pairs Shortest Paths and Floyd - Warshall Algorithm
Lecture nineteen starts with a quick review of lectures seventeen and eighteen .
It reminds the running times of various single - source shortest path algorithms , and mentions that in case of a directed acyclic graphs ( which was not covered in previous lectures ) , you can run topological sort and 1 round of Bellman - Ford that makes it find single - source shortest paths in linear time ( for graphs ) in O ( V+E ) .
The lecture continues all - pairs shortest paths problem , where we want to know the shortest path between every pair of vertices .
A naive approach to this problem is run single - source shortest path from each vertex .
For example , on an unweighted graph we 'd run BFS algorithm | V| times that would give O ( VE ) running time .
On a non-negative edge weight graph it would be | V| times Dijkstra 's algorithm , giving O ( VE + V2 lg ( V ) ) time .
And in general case we 'd run Bellman - Ford | V| times that would make the algorithm run in O ( V2E ) time .
The lecture continues with a precise definition of all - pairs shortest paths problem : given a directed graph , find an NxN matrix ( N = | V| ) , where each entry a ij is the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j .
In general case , if the graph has negative edges and it's dense , the best we can do so far is run Bellman - Ford | V| times .
Recalling that E = O ( V2 ) in a dense graph , the running time is O ( V2E ) = O ( V4 ) - hypercubed in number of vertices = slow .
Lecture then proceeds with a dynamic programming algorithm without knowing if it will be faster or not .
It 's too complicated to explain here , and I recommend watching lecture at 11:54 to understand it .
Turns out this dynamic programming algorithm does not give a performance boost and is still O ( V4 ) , but it gives some wicked ideas .
The most wicked idea is to connect matrix multiplication with the dynamic programming recurrence and using repeated squaring to beat O ( V4 ) .
This craziness gives O ( V3lgV ) time that is an improvement .
Please see 23:40 in the lecture for full explanation .
After all this the lecture arrives at Floyd - Warshall algorithm that finds all - pairs shortest paths in O ( V3 ) .
The algorithm is derived from a recurrence that the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j is minimum of { shortest path from i to j directly or shortest path from i to k and shortest path from k to j } .
Finally the lecture explains Johnson 's algorithm that runs in O ( VE + V2log ( V ) ) time for sparse graphs .
The key idea in this algorithm is to reweigh all edges so that they are all positive , then run Dijkstra from each vertex and finally undo the reweighing .
It turns out , however , that to find the function for reweighing all edges , a set of difference constraints need to be satisfied .
It makes us first run Bellman - Ford to solve these constraints .
Reweighing takes O ( EV ) time , running Dijkstra on each vertex takes O ( VE + V2lgV ) and undoing reweighing takes O ( V2 ) time .
Of these terms O ( VE + V2lgV ) dominates and defines algorithm 's running time ( for dense it 's still O ( V3 ) .

Wood Collecting IWCS Resources Available : A Guide for Developing A Wood Collection
order form with complete details as of 06/18/2020
Buy , sell or trade wood specimens : Member Listings and Requests IWCS Booklet : IWCS Wood Specimen Kit order form with complete detailsBuy , sell or trade wood specimens :
The Formidable Challenge Can you picture how complex it would be if you decided to collect samples of as many of the woods of the world as you possibly can ?
For a start , did you know that there are over 50,000 species of wood ?
What a formidable job , even if they were easy to find and collect .
Next , practically all countries in the world have trees and therefore wood species .
Even if you could just travel to each country and have samples of that country handed to you , it would be an expensive and formidable job .
However , it is not that easy .
Wood species collectors must find and make their own samples .
For one person using their own efforts , it would become a full time pursuit .... and you had better be a multi-millionaire , too !
You would have to travel to just about every region of the earth where trees exist --- to the frigid arctic , the hottest bug infested forests teaming with poisonous snakes and wild animals .
You would find yourself in politically hostile countries , swamps , vast scorching deserts and every harsh element of the earth just to collect your samples !
Does it start to sound like collecting wood samples is impractical , even impossible ?
Not for the Academically Faint Even if you could accomplish such an amazing venture , how would you identify the trees to get the wood samples you want ?
Just being able to identify a tree may be a difficult job even for professional dendrologists , and it is harder for a piece of wood .
This leaves aside the matter of names .
Most people can cope with wood names like oak , pine , walnut and balsa , and this will do for those who are content to craft with a small percentage of the world 's woods .
However , to collect properly you have to use scientific names of species , such as Fagus grandifolia ( American beech ) , Haematoxylum campechianum ( logwood ) and Sideroxylon foetidissimum ( false mastic ) .
Wood collecting is not for the academically faint !
But it is rewarding for those that persevere .
Some members have been able to amass collections of up to a few thousand species after many years of collecting and trading .
Experience has shown that it gets tough to exceed this number , even though this represents only a few percent of the world 's woods !
How much harder this would be if the attempt was unaided .
Where IWCS Shines Through Wood collecting would be impossible if it were not the join co-operation of hundreds if not thousands of IWCS members scattered around the world .
It is through the efforts of each dedicated wood collector in countries everywhere that makes collecting wood samples even remotely practical .
Having an IWCS membership means that you can also now tap into the vast combined intellectual resources of wood professors , educational institutions , foresters and many other professionals and skilled people worldwide .
Wood collecting takes a lot of resources to even be possible at all .
IWCS brings that possibility into being a reality .
The Joys and Benefits of Collecting Wood People have heard of coin collections , stamp , butterfly and doll collections but even though wood is around us every day , you will find people look with astonishment when they are told that you collect ---- WOOD !
It has to be one of the most unique hobby interests that you could ever pick .
Collecting samples of woods from around the world has to be as rewarding as just about any other collecting type of endeavor .
With over 50,000 different woods in existence , collectors soon learn that wood exists in practically every color , weight , hardness , texture and grain pattern imaginable .
Polished wood samples can play with light in an iridescent manner much like jewels , reflecting patterns back in fancy grained samples that make them look like their surfaces resemble holograms .
For dedicated collectors , receiving the next package of samples from other members or perhaps a foreign forestry service is an exciting time --- just to see what the next batch will look like !
Looking for Adventure ?
Perhaps no one person is likely to take on the massive tale of travel described above .
However , many of the most exiting stories in World of Wood are about real adventures of IWCS members as they travel to Costa Rica , Hawaii , Mexico and countless other countries in their quest for wood .
The efforts of some of our members to collect wood are as thrilling and true as any documentary you are likely to watch on television .
The hunt , the chase for the bounty of wood can be even more compelling than having the wood itself .
A content wood collector is one heading home with his or her treasure of wood piled so high that their vehicle is almost bottoming !
That treasure is often shared in part with other members , by trade or sale , each person contributing to the rich inventory that members have .
Samples are made from such wood hunts but the lure of making unique and beautiful items from such exotic woods is so strong that many wood collectors also have their homes filled with both their academic collections and years of crafting , too .
The Fellowship Finally , being a wood enthusiast means that you have an automatic common interest with every other member in IWCS .
Members find their personal rewards multiply the more active they are and the more they strike up friendships with other members .
Friendship and fellowship is by no small means a major part of collecting wood , whether academically or for crafting .
How Can I Get Started ?
First , make sure you have an IWCS Membership .
Sign up .
Then , unless you are already in a wood related profession , rely on other members at first .
Get to know who else is into academic species collecting .
Correspond with them .
Many have lists of spare samples that they keep for trading or sale to other members .
Also , reference to lists of spares of specimens for trade or sale are regularly published in World of Wood and on this website on the Member Listings and Requests page .
Most samples cost from $ 2.00 - $ 3.50 with very rare ones or samples with fancy figure usually being available for under $ 10.00 .
Make sure that you keep to the conditions and payment of the member supplying you .
Where possible , samples are in a " standard sample " size of 6 " x 3 " x 1/2 " .
This makes storing , shipping and handling samples far easier than random sizes .
Interested in getting a jump start on wood collecting ?
IWCS offers a box of 40 different specimens shipped to any of the 50 states for only $ 100.00 for members and $ 160 for non-members .
Please see the IWCS Wood Specimen Kit order form shown at the top of this page for a list of specimens available and complete details .
Members can also provide a lot of advise on books on wood .
Some can even offer to sell you copies .
Books on trees are as important , too .
Study the trees of the area in which you live and other areas that you are likely to travel .
You can decide just how much investment in equipment you care to make .
The most enthusiastic end up with axes , chain saws , and even portable sawmills .
If you do venture out looking for wood , take great care to protect the ecology of every area you visit .
Do n't cut indiscriminately .
Wood needs to be carefully dried once you collect it .
Books and members can help you in learning how to do this properly .
Where practical , attend meetings .
Promote IWCS to other people , too .
Finally , be generous with other members --- and you will see them be generous to you !
Happy Wood Hunting !

It was not supposed to be like this , I thought to myself as I entered the three story cement underground car park .
This pregnancy was supposed to be OK .
Emily had been slightly early , but Alexandra had come into this world without a hitch .
I had even given away my preemie clothes .
There were no spaces in the dimly lit car park — not unusual at this time in the morning when the staff was changing over .
I spotted a heavy set dark haired woman in a blue uniform , probably a nurse just getting off her shift .
She pointed to a small red Honda ahead and I raised my hand in thanks , though I did n’t feel thankful .
All I had felt since last Tuesday was a heavy shadow following me that would n’t go away no matter how hard I tried , like the time I had impulsively taken a pair of ruby red Barbie shoes from my best friend when I was eight .
I knew it was wrong , and when my mother found out , she grabbed my hand and marched me next door and made me apologise in front of my friend and her mother .
I pulled into the spot and started to get out of the car , then remembered the blanket and turned round to get it .
Head down , I made my way to the lift on autopilot .
“ Sorry , ” the words popped out without thinking .
In my haste I had nearly ran into a heavily pregnant woman on my mission .
“ I did n’t see you , ” I said trying not to stare at her tummy , which looked as if a basket ball were neatly tucked beneath .
“ No worries , ” she said , putting a hand on her bump , the annoying way that heavily pregnant woman do .
She was wearing a brightly coloured cotton floral “ Stage 3 ” dress from the Gap .
I had seen the same one on the web , and had ordered it , thinking it would look nice for Easter .
It was still hanging in the closet , tags on .
We both got into the lift and I pressed the button for the 2nd floor , which housed the baby ward .
On the left was the wing for mothers who had their babies tucked neatly next to them in a cot or suckling on their breast , I could just see their husbands coming to take the new family home , hands full of flower arrangements and a pink mylar ballon imprinted with “ It ’s a girl , while the mother eagerly waited with the infant in a cute outfit she had received as a gift from a baby shower .
On the right was the NICU .
“ Are you visiting a newborn ? ” the heavily pregnant woman asked brightly .
“ That ’s a cute blanket , ” she carried on without wanting an answer making polite conversation , her eyes on the bundle in my hands , “ Handmade , is it ? ”
I stared at her blankly , then I remembered what I was holding .
“ Yes , my mother made it for my daughter . ”
“ You ’re so lucky , ” the pregnant woman droned , her hand still protective on her bump .
“ My mother ca n’t knit .
I wish she could , those handknit blankets are so expensive … ”
Thankfully the lift stopped and I nodded goodbye and walked the 10 steps to the entrance of the Neo Intensive Care Unit .
I stopped to read the memo on the door , though I had read it every day the past week .
The Center for Disease Control has informed us that RSV season has officially started .
Visitors to the NICU will be limited to immediate family only .
RSV , I have learned , is a particularly brutal virus .
It is also very common .
Though its symptoms are similar to a common cold , it is more serious for premature infants , starting as a runny nose , but then quickly turning into breathing problems in infants whose lungs are not yet fully developed .
I caught the eye of the receptionist , and she buzzed the door .
I paused slightly , took a deep breath and opened the door .
I entered a sort of holding room , a small room partitioned off from the ward by a large glass pane .
I washed my hands with the surgical soap in a large double chrome sink , and then squirt the antibacterial wash into my hands .
As I rubbed the cool liquid between my fingers , it evaporated , as if by magic , reassuring me that any lurking bacteria would be stopped dead in its tracks .
The lights in the NICU are always bright , no matter what time of the day .
Proper lighting is needed in case of a procedure .
I was not sure how the babies could sleep , the ward sounding more like a video arcade , with simultaneous muted conversations mingled with the constant beeping of monitor alarms .
Looking down the long row of isolettes , I could see a sea of multi-coloured baby blankets draped over the incubators to shield the babies from the harsh lights and the noisy room .
Kept at 97 F , the babies wear nothing but diapers and a cross - tie T - shirt inside , carefully chosen because the spider web of wires can easily slip through .
A few of the babies bizarrely looked like they were sunbathing , wearing what looked like sunglasses with IVF lights blaring from three sides .
These babies had jaundice .
Their little livers not working properly , their red blood cells breaking down and the resulting billiribin not leaving their gut , leaving their skin slightly yellow .
I know this because yesterday Hannah was under the lamps with a billiribin score of 16 .
I squeezed the nobby knit blanket in my hands and my eyes stopped where Hannah was yesterday .
I could feel my stomach in my throat .
The baby there was under a heat lamp but it was not my dark - haired Hannah .

At the end of June 2020 , at least 357 Palestinians - including two minors and at least one woman - were held in administrative detention in Israel Prison Service ( IPS ) facilities .
Due to IPS policy as of May 2020 not to provide B'Tselem with figures under 5 , the overall number of detainees and prisoners , as provided B'Tselem , may not match the sum total of detainees and prisoners in the various categories .
B'Tselem petitioned the Central District Court to revoke this policy .
According to the IDF Spokesperson , on occasion , the military also holds in custody a handful of administrative detainees for several days , until room becomes available in IPS facilities .
The following tables show the number of Palestinians held by Israel in administrative detention on specific dates from 2001 to 2020 , one date given per month .
The data were provided by the military and the IPS .
We do not have figures on the overall number of Palestinians held in Israel in administrative detention during this period .

From the beginning of the intifada ( December 9 , 1987 ) until today , thousands of Palestinians have been held in administrative detention for periods ranging from six months to several years .
The following table details the number of Palestinian residents of the Occupied Territories who were held by Israel in administrative detention on particular dates since November 1989 .
B'Tselem does not have summary statistics on the total number of Palestinians held in administrative detention during each year .

If you 're not a regular on sites such as reddit.com you might not know about a certain musician located in Pensacola , Florida , that goes by the name of Mark Gormley .
Nine days ago there was a thread on Reddit that received over 900 votes that you can see here ; the title is SO INTENSE JUST SOOOO FUCKING INTENSE .
So what 's that about ?
Well , it 's this video :
You 'll notice that the thread on Reddit was submitted to the WTF subreddit , where as the name implies , every link is something that made the submitter think ... WTF is this ?
And to be sure , that 's the first reaction one has when seeing the video .
It starts out with a guy claiming that the upcoming video is super intense , when it turns out to be a video with a background that looks like something you 'd see in a karaoke / norae - bang room in Japan or Korea , sung by a guy that looks like a math teacher or maybe an astronomer ( note the observatory and moonbase background later in the video ) .
That 's not the whole of it , however , which is where the sudden popularity behind this video and others lies .
Taking a look at the comments you can see the following among the standard " WTF is this a joke ? " comments :
__david__ :
I 've never had such a huge disconnect between what someone looks like and what they sound like .
I do n't particularly care for that falsetto , it kind of sounds like what you 'd hear on a bad American Idol audition .
But the songwriting is n't half bad at all , really .
With a better singer and better production it could be a pretty good song .
My mind is reeling .
look
Mark Gormley is the exact opposite of what we 're used to in music and entertainment , and this does n't occur in just one country either .
Take a look at the actors for a drama currently on air here in Korea for example :
Two questions : taking a look at the characters ' faces alone , which one do you think is :1 ) The evil president of the modeling agency that only cares about money ?
2) The kind - hearted but kind of goofy reporter that serves as a kind of sidekick to the main characters ?... Now for the answers : 1) The evil president is the guy on the left , third from the top .
That 's right , he 's the chubbiest and least good - looking guy of the bunch so of course that makes him evil .
Plus you know it 's not the one just above him because that one is n't wearing a suit .
2 ) The kind - hearted but goofy reporter is on the top left .
Of course the goofy character has glasses , but the other guy with real glasses on the left does n ' tgoofy enough , so of course he 's not the goofy one .
You could probably conduct tests like this with maybe about 80 % accuracy for most tv shows and movies , because that 's what we 're used to .
Mark Gormley blows these preconceptions out of the water though , and that 's what makes him so popular .
He does n't look the part at all ; no one would ever guess as they walk by him on the street that he 's a pretty good songwriter that has been writing and playing music since the 70s .
On top of that , it 's been about a decade and a half since the Internet first took off , and the population using it is now much older than it used to be , and there are probably a lot of people out there that identify pretty strongly with Mark Gormley ; people that played in a band or wanted to , finished university , got a regular job , now do n't look like someone that plays music or writes poetry or anything else but still has n't changed on the inside no matter how much time has passed since then , and the fact that Mark Gormley just up and created a few videos for the music he wrote regardless of what anyone might think a musician or a video is supposed to look like is pretty amazing .
I think user robeph on Reddit.com summed it up the best , so I 'll close with his comment :
al - Razi ’s attitude towards reason and passion is one that discourages passion and encourages reason .
He encourages reason to be the only mode of thinking required for all our actions .
According to al - Razi , God has bestowed reason upon man so that we can be controlling and profitable from it .
He cites the example of man ’s progress as proof , claiming that reason has endowed man with the capability of building ships , navigating the seas , and using medicine for healing .
al - Razi cites reason as the most profitable endeavor in acclimating man with the Almighty .
Passion , he says , is a blemish on reason .
It is something that diverts man from his proper path and rightful purpose .
Speaking in the same tones as passion as he does about pleasure , al - Razi says that passion causes man to look for immediate gratification , regardless of the consequences .
As a result of this need , in all cases , man will seek immediate gratification , unless he learns to control his passions and use reason to deliberate the cause and effects of actions before they are taken .
al - Razi also emphasizes the need to suppress pleasure .
Continuous immediate gratification can lead to a habitual need for the pleasure , he says .
The continuous pleasure attained from immediate gratification will disillusion man from the purity of pleasure .
Once habituated , man will continue to seek pleasure , placing himself in dangerous positions while putting others at danger so that he can seek it out .
This need , al - Razi says , is beastly .
Wild beasts and animals act in the same manner as humans when seeking continuous gratification .
The only difference between humans and beasts is that the gratification needs of beasts ’ are tied to the acquisition of food .
He says that they will seek gratification everywhere , and that man cannot get in the way of a hungry animal without putting itself in danger , since the animal is only concerned with seeking that instant gratification .
Thus , pleasure , according to al - Razi , should be avoided .
al - Razi also speaks on two states of being .
These states of being are either being in pain or in a ‘ state of nature ’ ( a form of equilibrium ) .
He states that pleasure is simply the transitory state between pain and this ‘ state of nature ’ .
Thus , for one to experience pleasure , they must experience pain .
Ironically , al - Razi ’s reasoning seems to lead to a flaw in his argumentation of the acquisition of pleasure , since he states that we are seeking immediate gratification .
If one is to seek immediate gratification while putting off pain , then pleasure is not transitory , even though he claims for pleasure to be the effect of the cause of pain .
If pain is absent at the time of the acquisition of pleasure , than pain is not causal in the gratification of pain .
Another flaw in al - Razi ’s rationale towards pleasure and pain is that he dichotomizes pleasure and reason with the concept of self - deliberation , with respect to the ‘ calls of nature ’ .
He states that by deliberating and being a person of great reason means to remove oneself from the shackles that bound man to some of his most primitive biological responses .
He states that to improve reason removes one from being a slave to the calls of nature .
However , it is unquestionable that man cannot divulge himself from the calls of nature and from certain necessities , like eating .
al - Razi compares the pleasure of eating to the pain of defecating .
He Claims that animals look towards their instant gratification of eating without deliberating on the consequential pains of defecation .
However , the flaw in this argument can easily stem from the idea that one may also feel pain from not defecating .
One may also feel pain from not eating .
One must eat to live .
Should one not eat , one may feel pain without any consequential pleasure .
Thus , continuous pain may ensue , and no amount of reason can dispel this innate necessity .

An informed observer writes in a guest op - ed for IC :
I am troubled by the publication of Uri Dromey ’s piece in today ’s Guardian .
My reaction to the content is that the piece attempts to blame the victims – which is a well known sophist technique .
As for the misleading explanations of what seems to be the use of legitimate weapons in inappropriate ways and contexts , my reaction can be summarised as “ what absolute bollocks ! ”
The pictures of airburst phosphorous being used to set areas on fire are conclusive evidence of misuse .
Smokescreens use ground burst .
If I had ever wanted a smoke point to cover a flanking movement then I wanted the smoke as a dense cloud on the ground at a height that exceeded the height of my people .
Armoured Fighting Vehicle also have small smoke dischargers on the turrets and hulls designed to put a cloud of smoke in front of the vehicle to give time to reverse out of danger or to debus and engage the enemy .
Flechettes are used in claymore mines and so called beehive rounds and are used to counter attacks by massed infantry .
I had no expectation that the few hundred Hamas fighting men in Gaza would do a human mass Banzai charge against any Israeli unit .
That would have achieved the Israeli objective in a few minutes , in a manner similar to Picketts Charge at Gettysburg .
The only mass of humans I could see were the women children and old men taking shelter in schools and hospitals and UN premises .
I would have used claymores to cover the killing zone in any ambush I was planning particularly in jungle ambushes , as they cut through the undergrowth and foliage and kill indiscriminately anyone and anything in the KZ .
Wikipedia gives us a useful introduction to Flechette based weapons :
‘ Beehive is an anti-personnel round fired from an artillery gun , packed full of metal darts , flechettes , which are ejected from the shell in front of the target by the action of a mechanical time fuze .
It is so - called because of the ‘ buzzing ’ sound the darts make when flying through the air and in the manner of numerous bees around an actual beehive .
It is deadly when used against concentrations of enemy troops due to its shotgun effect in similarity to claymore mines .
The beehive round can be considered an evolution of shrapnel artillery ammunition .
The first round actually termed “ beehive ” was first fired in combat in 1966 , to great success , [ 1 ] and was thereafter used extensively in the Vietnam War , though the later development of the Killer Junior air burst technique eventually usurped beehive ’s role .
Beehive rounds were extensively used in the Vietnam War , for defence of firebase perimeters against massed enemy attacks , and because it could penetrate the thick canopy of the jungle and “ pad ” [ jargon ] it out .
The primary beehive round for this purpose was the M546 APERS -T ( anti- personnel tracer ) shell which projected 8000 flechettes and was direct fired from a near horizontally levelled barrel of a 105 mm howitzer [ 2 ] . ’
If this savage assault on the population of Gaza had been planned during the six months of the preceding ceasefire , then whoever selected ammunition loads of flechette weapons must have been planning for a massacre .
The point about Fallujah is misleading .
In a manner similar to the evacuation of the women and children from the Alamo , the non combatants in Fallujah were given a week or ten days to leave .
Anyone who stayed identified himself as a fighting man .
The unfortunate inhabitants of Gaza had nowhere to escape to because the border crossings were closed .
The idea that phone calls warning them to leave buildings was adequate is misleading because it is widely reported by reliable sources that this was used as a weapon of psychological warfare to spread fear and confusion .
I find Amnesty ’s report provides enough evidence to convince me that something similar to a Wannsee Protokol may exist somewhere in Tel Aviv and that Senior Israeli officers and politicians have a case to answer at the International Criminal Court .
Doubtless
I will be accused of anti-semitism for saying it , but I find myself in the company of Sir Gerald Kaufman , Mary Robinson and a glittering array of QCs and eminent jurists in doing so .
I find the Guardian giving this piece of Newspeak a platform without identifying at the end of the piece that the author is closely linked to the Israeli forces worrying .
The Guardian used to be a newspaper that could be relied on to present a point of view that was an antidote to the authoritarian and right wing point of view expressed in newspapers like Daily Telegraph , Times , Jerusalem Post .
It is unsettling to find them giving a platform to someone who Professor Avi Schlaim denounces as a propagandist .
If the Independent , whose editorial independence is vouched for by the integrity of Robert Fisk as a correspondent , were to succumb to its financial problems , along with Channel 4 TV– and The Guardian were to have been subverted we would be left with a biased set of mass media that channel to us Israeli propaganda .
Perhaps the Editor of the Guardian might need to examine his conscience .

Connell declared emergency before fatal crash Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday December 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican IT consultant Michael Connell , who was killed on December 19 when his Piper Saratoga crashed near the Akron - Canton Airport , had declared an emergency shortly before losing contact with air traffic control .
According to a preliminary incident report filed by the safety division of the Federal Aviation Administration on December 22 , " The plane was on ILS ( Instrument Landing System ) approach to runway 23 .
Tower noted plane left of course .
Tower directed plane to climb and maintain 3000 feet and didnt comply .
When advised to climb a second time , the pilot declared an emergency and was lost from radar shortly thereafter . "
The National Transportation Safety Board has now posted a more complete report , but one which still leaves unresolved both the exact nature of Connell 's emergency and the cause of the crash .
According to the NTSB , Connell initially contacted air traffic control ( ATC ) at the Akron - Canton Airport to ask whether there were any reports of icing and was told there were none .
His approach was then uneventful until ATC noted that he was left of his course and asked if he would like to be resequenced .
Connell replied " correcting . "
ATC then advised him again that he was " well left of the localizer " and Connell responded that he would " like to correct . "
The report continued , " N9299N [ Connell 's plane ] was about 2 ½ miles from the airport when it then transmitted if it could execute a 360 - degree turn .
ATC then instructed N9299N to climb and maintain 3,000 feet and queried N9299Ns present heading .
N9299N transmitted , ' heading due north and climbing . '
N9299N then declared an emergency . "
NTSB spokesperson Bridget Serchak told RAW STORY on Monday that she had spoken with Senior Air Safety Investigator Mitchell Gallo , the NTSB investigator on the case , and could confirm that " the pilot asked for assistance landing . "
When reached by RAW STORY on Tuesday , Gallo , who had reviewed a tape of the full radio exchange , explained that the Connell had not elaborated when declaring the emergency .
" He did n't describe the nature of it , " Gallo stated , " but then following that ... I do n't remember what the actual verbiage was ... you 'd have to again refer to the actual report . "
The NTSB report further cites an eyewitness who " was outside of his home when he first heard a ' loud ' engine sound from a small aircraft .
The sound was coming from the north and sounded as though the pilot was trying to accelerate ' rapidly . '
Suddenly , the witness saw two bright lights coming almost nose first toward the ground with the engine ' roaring . '
Based upon the witness  view of the lights , he assumed the airplane was flying west to east .
He lost sight of the airplane when it descended below a tree line . "
The eyewitness , who wishes to remain anonymous , has spoken with Raw Story and provided a copy of the statement which he wrote up immediately following the crash .
( See image below )
According to the witness 's statement , when the plane vanished from his sight , " I was certain it was going to crash and was actually waiting for the sound .
However , once again there was a tremendous roar of the engine and I thought it was just the pilot doing a stunt over their house .
It was almost instantly after I once again heard the engine that I heard the thud as it hit the ground .
Approximately 1 second later , the sky became orange and there was no doubt what had happened . "
Connell was the founder of New Media Communications , which created official websites for the Republican National Committee and the Bush - Cheney ' 04 campaign that provided the email accounts used by White House aides involved in the US Attorney scandal .
New Media also spun off GovTech , under Connell 's wife 's name , which was hired by Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell to set up an official state election website that presented the 2004 presidential returns as they were received .
This site has been of particular interest to some who suspect possible election fraud in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election , and Connell 's testimony was recently sought in a case alleging fraud .
Building work is going on - for now - at Vancouver 's Olympic village
The global financial crisis is hitting preparations for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Canada , officials say .
Vancouver city authorities are seeking emergency powers to borrow up to C$ 458 m ( US$ 380 m ) to finish the construction of the main Olympic athletes ' village .
Private financing is stalled but to complete the project on schedule , residents may have to pay .
Vancouver 's Mayor Gregor Robertson has been quoted as saying : " It 's a bitter pill for taxpayers to swallow . "
Money running out The plan for the athletes ' village was for a private developer to build 1,100 up - market flats on Vancouver 's picturesque waterfront .
These would then be sold , after the games , at a healthy profit .
But now a drop in housing prices , a sharp rise in construction costs and the global economic situation mean funding for the project is in trouble .
The Olympic village is a billion dollar project and the city 's on the hook for all of it
Gregor Robertson
Mayor of Vancouver
The developer and the private American firm financing the project have yet to agree on the next instalment of money needed to keep the construction going .
In the meantime , city officials have loaned money to the developers to keep the builders on site - but that cash is due to run out .
Guarantees that Vancouver will finish the project on time mean that if the building stops , the council will have to fund the construction itself .
" The city is not authorised to borrow , particularly amounts of this significance , without the consent of taxpayers , " Mr Robertson told reporters .
" The Olympic village is a billion - dollar project and the city 's on the hook for all of it . "
The BBC's Ian Gunn in Vancouver says that several years ago , when the housing market was red hot , everyone involved thought there was money to be made and no - one foresaw the softening of the market .
Now , the people behind the financing are asking some difficult questions about whether they should really be putting more money into the project , our correspondent says , and a number of residents are not happy with the way things are shaping up .
Even when Vancouver was awarded these Olympics , our correspondent adds , a significant minority of people felt there were likely to be problems and that costs would run over .
As a result , they were not convinced hosting the Games was a good idea for the city .

Israeli aircraft dropped hundreds of tons of explosives on Gaza , not all of which exploded
A large stockpile of unexploded weapons has disappeared in Gaza , before United Nations experts were able to dispose of it safely , the BBC has learned .
The explosives , including aircraft bombs and white phosphorus shells , were fired by the Israeli military during its recent offensive in the Gaza Strip .
UN officials said they were urgently trying to establish where the arms had gone and have called for their return .
Israel has accused Hamas of taking the stockpile , which was under Hamas guard .
' Extremely dangerous ' Richard Miron , the senior UN spokesman in Jerusalem , said : " We are anxious to get the return of this ordnance .
It 's clearly extremely dangerous and needs to be disposed of in a safe manner .
" This is our primary concern . "
A UN Mines Action Team has been in Gaza since the end of the war , last month , its job to locate unexploded Israeli ordnance and to organise its safe disposal .
Two weeks ago , on 2 February , the UN team was given access to a storage site in Gaza City where more than 7,000kg of explosives was being housed .
It included three 2,000 - pound bombs and eight 500 - pound bombs , which had all been dropped from aircraft but failed to explode .
There was also a large number of 155 mm shells for delivering the incendiary chemical white phosphorus .
Safe areas Many of the explosives had been collected by the Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip .
The UN staff had been waiting for the Israeli army to allow them to bring specialist equipment into Gaza so they would be able to destroy the explosives safely .
In particular , the team needed explosives or flares to set off a controlled explosion and they needed tools to allow them to extract fuses from some of the bombs .
The UN staff were also waiting for permission from the Israeli military to use two safe areas to dispose of the munitions .
At a meeting last Thursday with the Israeli army , two areas were identified : one in the north , in a no - go area close to the border with Israel and the other near Khan Younis in the south , in a former Hamas training area .
On Sunday , when UN officials returned to the warehouse , which was under a Hamas police guard , they say they found most of the explosives had gone missing .
Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner said the stockpile had been " commandeered by Hamas " .

Some things are so ridiculously awesome that they simply defy belief , and when the logical mind encounters them , it can do naught but shut itself down in numb , slack - jawed shock .
These are a few moments in time so incredible that they should rightfully only exist within the pages of comic books , so insane they 're more like jump - cuts in Heavy Metal videos , and so badass that they instantly make everything youâve done seem worthless by comparison .
So settle in , enjoy , and say goodbye to every sense of pride or accomplishment that youâve ever had :

This appears to be a photograph of a man attacking a van with his tremendously explosive forehead - but is in actuality of Dennis Pinto , a stuntman from North Carolina .
Dennis seems to have misunderstood exactly what stuntmen are supposed to do which , ideally , is to simulate incredibly dangerous scenarios while in reality remaining safe and secure , because Pintoâs âstuntâ  here is not actually a photo of a spectacularly destructive failure .
This is what wassupposed to happen !
And thatâs why Mr. Pinto is easily the hardest motherfucker on earth :
The man sees this horrific orgy of flame and steel , this outtake from a Die Hard movie , this screencap from the biggest budget snuff film in history , and thinks â Total success !
That went down exactly how I wanted it to.â 

The plan was to race a motorcycle at 60 MPH into the side of a parked van , which would then explode , sending him flying through the flames and out the other side where he would cushion his landingâ ¦with a couple of cardboard boxes .
And because Dennis Pinto is apparently the Highlander , he also insisted that he be set on fire before they could even start .
This manâs typical work day consists of him dying a more catastrophic death than aBatman villainâ ¦then getting up and taking a bow .
So , next time your jobâs got you a little down , just think of olâ Dennis Pinto here , and realize that any complaints you might have can only serve to make you look like kind of a pussy in comparison .
Really , the only way he could make you look worse is if he was doing like , the Kid 'n Play Shuffle or something while flying through that explosion .
Peanut company whistleblower warned of rodent infestation RAW STORY
Published : Monday February 16 , 2009
Print This Email This Don't eat that peanut .
ABC 's Dan Harris recently talked to a manager at a peanut factory in Plainview , Texas , who warned of the squalor the snack food is produced in .
Kenneth Kendrick told ABC that he became aware of rodent infestation while he was working at Peanut Corporation of America .
The company is at the center of a salmonella outbreak that took place between September 1 , 2008 and January 9 , 2009 , with 550 people infected in 43 states and at least one more person in Canada .
Kendrick said he brought his concerns to the attention to Peanut Corp.
President Stewart G. Parnell , but the problems were n't addressed .
" The owner did n't give us the money to do what we needed to do , " said Kendrick .
" The concern for Mr. Parnell was the money issues . "
" We desperately at least need to turn the raw peanuts on our floor into money " Parnell wrote in an e-mail discussed by members of Congress .
" Mr Chairman and members of the committee on advice of my counsel , I respectfully decline to answer your questions based on the protections afforded me under the US constitution , " he told the hearing .
Bart Stupak , chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee looking into the case , said the evidence painted a " very disturbing picture . "
" Since June 2007 , PCA 's products tested positive for salmonella on 12 different occasions , " he said , adding that " the company continued to produce and distribute its peanut butter products without consequence .
" Peanut Corp. of America knew about salmonella contamination for over a year and a half , but did nothing to address it . "
Testifying before the committee Charles Deibel , director of Deibel Laboratories -- which tests industry samples for bacteria -- said it was not unusual for firms to ask for positive samples to be retested .
But he added , " what is virtually unheard of is for a company to disregard those results and place potentially contaminated products into the stream of commerce " .
The company is also the subject of a criminal investigation by the US Justice Department .

Short of opening a Radio Shack in an Amish town , Dubai is the world ’s worst business idea , and there is n’t even any oil .
Imagine proposing to build Vegas in a place where sex and drugs and rock and roll are an anathema .
This is effectively the proposition that created Dubai – it was a stupid idea before the crash , and now it is dangerous .
Dubai threatens to become an instant ruin , an emblematic hybrid of the worst of both the West and the Middle - East and a dangerous totem for those who would mistakenly interpret this as the de facto product of a secular driven culture .
The opening shot of this clip shows 200 skyscrapers that were built in the last 5 years .
It looks like Manhattan except that it is n’t the place that made Mingus or Van Allen or Kerouac or Wolfe or Warhol or Reed or Bernstein or any one of the 1001 other cultural icons from Bob Dylan to Dylan Thomas that form the core spirit of what is needed , in the absence of extreme toleration of vice , to infuse such edifices with purpose and create a self - sustaining culture that will prevent them crumbling into the empty desert that surrounds them .
Dubai is a place for the shallow and fickle .
Hormones ' complex role in human sexuality Prairie vole study suggests hormones a key to sexuality
A male and female prairie vole with their babies are pair - bonded for life under the influence of oxytocin , a hormone also important in human sexual relationships like trust and monogamy A male and female prairie vole with their babies are pair - bonded for life under the influence of oxytocin , a hormone also important in human sexual relationships like trust and monogamy Photo : Todd Ahern / Emory University , Courtesy To The Chronicle Photo : Todd Ahern / Emory University , Courtesy To The Chronicle Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Hormones ' complex role in human sexuality 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
In the spring a young man 's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love ... but whither when the year is young ?
It matters not , for as long as the hormones are in tune , love can bloom at any time , say scientists who study the genetics and neurobiology of animals whose family lives shed new light on human sexuality .
Larry J. Young , a Georgia neurobiologist , studies the genes and hormones of the cute but often pestiferous little beasts called prairie voles , which mate and bond for life .
Those genes and hormones exist in humans , too , and in a uniquely literate essay in today 's issue of the journal Nature , Young points to the role they play in animals and humans .
" Poetry it is not .
Nor is it particularly romantic .
But reducing love to its comprehensive parts helps us understand human sexuality and may lead to drugs that enhance or diminish our love for another , " he said .
Young , a professor in the psychiatry department at Auburn University in Atlanta and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center there , has discovered that two closely related peptide hormones called oxytocin and vasopressin play powerful roles in both animal and human sexuality .
" I call oxytocin the motherly hormone , " Young said in an interview , " because its release in the body of female voles is involved in uterine contractions , in lactation and in the mother 's early bonding with vole babies .
It 's also the hormone responsible for lifelong pair bonding between males and females .
" Vasopressin is closely related to oxytocin , but it 's dependent on testosterone - so it's the macho version of oxytocin . "
In the Bay Area , scientists say Young 's research of togetherness in prairie voles is proving valuable to understanding many disorders in the human condition .
" Oxytocin is the hormone of monogamy , " said neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine , who directs the Women 's Mood and Hormone Clinic at UCSF which also takes male patients .
" If you give men nasal squirts of oxytocin , it increases their trust in others , their ability to be affectionate - it brings out their feminine side , is how I 'd put it .
" Years ago a man I was seeing said to me , ' Give me some of that oxytocin - I just want to love someone ! ' "
Because monogamy and love are examples of powerful human interactions , Brizendine believes the hormones involved could also prove important for people with disorders like autism , Asperger 's syndrome and even schizophrenia , because the symptoms mean they can rarely find close relationships .
Young 's primary research shows the effects of the hormones on prairie voles , but he also discovered that oxytocin has similar effects on mountain voles , a different species that are not monogamous and do not pair - bond for life .
When mountain voles are exposed to doses of oxytocin in the lab , the males will bond with females in a close and sometimes lifetime relationship like their cousins , Young said .
The varied genes that trigger the release of oxytocin and the testosterone - dependent vasopressin in both voles and humans , Young said , have obviously had a long evolutionary history , as it is also found in other , more primitive pair - bonding animals - even though monogamy is extremely rare throughout the animal kingdom .
" In all my work , " Young said , " I 'm trying to understand how we humans interact with each other - to understand the genetics and biochemistry of the social brain , and how it may go wrong in profound disorders like autism and schizophrenia . "
Brizendine called Young 's work " deeply important because it clearly correlates the phenomenon of pair - bonding in his voles with monogamous relations in humans . "
As for the vasopressin , Brizendine said , one variation in the gene that controls the hormone can make a man " more prone to long - term bonded relationships , " while a man with another variation of the gene " will be prone to infidelity . "
Dacher Keltner , a psychologist and director of the Berkeley Social Interaction Laboratory at UC Berkeley , calls Young 's vole research - along with work by Sue Carter at the University of Maryland and Thomas R. Insel at the National Institute of Mental Health - " unbelievably influential in showing us that there 's a physical , biological basis to long - term monogamy , love , devotion and feelings of trust with each other . "
The new awareness of the role of hormones in human relations is underscored in new books being published this year by both Keltner and Brizendine .
" Born to Be Good : The Science of a Meaningful Life " by Keltner is out next week , and " The Male Brain " by Brizendine will be published in September .
Oxytocin , meanwhile , is sold commercially as a " trust hormone " to be used in nasal sprays .
One ad claims it can " produce significant increase in charisma , which creates a highly trustworthy appearance , " while another calls its brand " a great female seducer . "
But all three scientists - Young , Brizendine and Keltner - agree that it 's much too early to be peddling the hormones that way .
" We 're only at the beginning of our laboratory studies , and people should be extremely careful , " Young said .
LATE last year , when the federal government kept General Motors and Chrysler afloat with some $ 17 billion in loans , Ford demurred , saying that it was in reasonably good shape and could get by with no more than a government credit line , which it has yet to tap .
Hard to believe that will remain the case .
Ford reported a larger than expected fourth - quarter loss of nearly $ 6 billion and said that it blew through $ 5.5 billion in cash during the quarter ( though its " cash burn " rate is down from nearly $ 8 billion in the third quarter , and I appreciate that we 're no longer dancing around the fact that these firms may as well just be setting their money — or the government 's money — on fire ) .
Ford says it can make it without help ( though plenty of others are sceptical ) , and the firm says the road to profitability in 2011 is still clear .
But something is going to have to give .
Every carmaker in the world is hurting .
And just about every other major industry out there is contracting .
There is an enormous inventory overhang , and way too much productive capacity , given the near - term outlook for car sales .
Somebody has to go down .
And I suspect that when one or several of the American carmakers are forced to return to the government for aid , the reaction may be somewhat different than it was last year .
If the American economy was on a knife edge in December ( and really , it was n't ) , then it has already tumbled off , and the possibility of a million lost jobs is , well , it does n't have the same scary sound in a world where multiple companies are announcing tens of thousands of layoffs every day .
Everyone is in trouble , government resources are scarce , and there are better things to do with taxpayer money than keep crumbling enterprises alive for a few more months .
And so despite this bad news , Ford must feel all right about itself .
Billion dollar losses or no , it 's still the healthiest American carmaker .
And if ( when ) its competitors go down , Ford will find itself in a much improved market position .

Contradicting Northcom denial that troops would be engaged in law enforcement , dealing with “ civil unrest ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , January 8 , 2009
Following Northcom ’s denial that U.S. Army combat teams would be used to deal with “ civil unrest ” after the announcement that thousands of active duty military personnel were being moved inside the United States , an Army.com report now concedes that more than 400 Marines assigned to one unit includes a “ security force ” that would operate within the homeland .
A September 8 Army Times report stated that active duty troops from the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team returning from Iraq would be on call as a “ federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks , ” for a period of 12 months from October 1st .
This preceded a December 1 Washington Post article which reported on plans to station 20,000 more U.S. troops inside America for purposes of “ domestic security ” from September 2011 .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
According to the Army Times article , their duties would include dealing with “ civil unrest and crowd control ” .
This admission was later denied by Northcom ’s operations division chief Army Col. Michael Boatner , who told Homeland Security Today , “ This response force will not be called upon to help with law enforcement , civil disturbance or crowd control , but will be used to support lead agencies involved in saving lives , relieving suffering and meeting the needs of communities affected by weapons of mass destruction attacks , accidents or even natural disasters . ”
However , a January 7 American Forces Press Service story posted on Army.com confirms that at least some units operating inside the U.S. will rely on a “ security force ” to provide protection for troops responding to a mass casualty event in America .
Marines assigned to the Chemical , Biological Incident Response Force ( CBIRF ) operating out of the Naval Support Facility in Indian Head , Maryland are “ tasked by the Defense Department with responding to disasters that require federal assistance , ” according to the article , a job that mandates “ the squad ’s weapons were replaced with metal pry bars , Kevlar helmets with construction hard - hats , and combat uniforms with coveralls . ”
“ The commandant of the Marine Corps set in place the guidelines for designing a highly trained and specialized unit designed to respond to such a threat in the event that state and local authorities need Defense Department assistance , ” we read .
“ The 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force led the operational efforts of the unit until October 2008 when , in a historic move , the U.S. Northern Command pulled into its ranks nearly 5,000 active - duty forces designated to respond to homeland emergencies . ”
“ Now , the CBIRF is associated administratively with the 2nd MEF , but can tap into the extensive medical , aviation , transportation and logistical support of the other units within Northcom ’s response force . ”
Although Marine Col. John M. Pollock states , “ Security for our forces operating within the homeland is a law - enforcement issue , and I would much rather leverage local and state law enforcement to provide that security , ” the article does reveal that a “ security force ” tasked with protecting Marines during their duties is a component of the unit .
“ The unit has specialists in bomb disposal , technical rescue decontamination , chemical identification and detection , medical and casualty extraction .
It also has a security force , ” states the article .
Pollock also stated that the unit was in position at the Republican National Convention in Minnesota , an open violation of Posse Comitatus , the law that restricts the military from undertaking law enforcement operations except in times of declared national emergency .
Just who do the Marines need protecting from if all they will be doing is aiding rescue efforts and saving people ’s lives ?
The only conceivable scenario in which Marines would need other Marines to protect them in a law enforcement guise would be if the tasks they were undertaking were highly unpopular and risked reprisals from the general public .
The fact that the original Army Times report of September 8 let slip that Marines would have access to non-lethal weapons to be used domestically , a revelation that was later retracted after it stoked media controversy , perhaps offers a not too subtle hint about what the real mission of the Marines will be in anticipation of a total economic collapse or the dreaded mass casualty terror attack that is constantly being hyped by the establishment and the corporate media .

( Natural News ) Borage and flaxseed oil appear to act internally to improve skin health , according to a study conducted by researchers from Laboratoire Oenobiol in France and Heinrich - Heine University and the University of Witten - Herdecke in Germany , and published in the Researchers assigned 45 healthy , non-smoking women to receive a daily supplement consisting of 2.2 grams of either borage oil , flaxseed oil , or a medium - chain fatty acid placebo .
The researchers regularly induced skin irritation ( inflammation and reddening ) in every woman by means of topically applied nicotinate .
All participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 .
Women who had been taking borage oil for several weeks were found to experience 35 percent less skin reddening than they had at the beginning of the study , while those taking flaxseed oil experienced 45 percent less .
There was no change in the degree of reddening experienced by the placebo group .
Women receiving borage or flaxseed oil also exhibited lessened blood flow to the skin in response to irritation .
After six weeks , those taking either oil supplement experienced a 10 percent decrease in water loss through the skin , and another six weeks showed even further improvement among the flaxseed group .
Both groups showed significant decreases in skin roughness and scaling after 12 weeks , while no change was observed in the placebo group .
Borage oil consists of large amounts of the omega - 6 fatty acids gamma- linolenic acid ( GLA ) and linoleic acid ( LA ) , and the monounsaturated fat oleic acid .
Flaxseed oil consists mostly of the omega - 3 fatty acid alpha- linolenic acid ( ALA ) , along with smaller quantities of omega - 6 fatty acids and oleic acid .
Blood levels of GLA were observed to increase in the borage oil group after six and 12 weeks , as were ALA levels among the flaxseed group .
The current study was not designed to uncover the specific mechanism by which the oils improve skin health .

A team of researchers in Canada have made a bold stride in the struggle to detect dark matter .
The PICASSO collaboration has documented the discovery of a significant difference between the acoustic signals induced by neutrons and alpha particles in a detector based on superheated liquids .
Since neutron induced signals are very similar to dark matter induced signals , this new discovery could lead to improved background suppression in dark matter searches with this type of detector .
So far , alpha particles have been an obstacle to the detection of dark matter 's weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) in PICASSO .
This detector , which is based on the operation principle of the classic bubble chamber , is sensitive to alpha particles over exactly the same temperature and energy range , therefore making it very difficult to discriminate between the two types of particles .
Alpha particles are relatively common on Earth , emitted by radioactive nuclei such as uranium , and thorium , and are therefore also present in traces in the detector material itself .
WIMPs are thought to fill the large spaces between galaxies , concentrating around them in gigantic clouds .
As the Earth moves together with the sun through the Milky Way 's dark matter cloud , researchers hope to detect occasional collisions of a WIMP particle with an atom in their detectors .
Teams of researchers around the globe work deep underground to create the best conditions to isolate WIMPs from their travelling companions , namely neutrons , which are created by cosmic rays .
Underground , teams in the US , Canada , England , Italy , Japan , Korea and Russia have long been sparring over the best detection methods for WIMPs .
The Canadian - American - Czech team based at SNOLAB , using their PICASSO detector , experimented with very sensitive Fluorine - based superheated liquids and analysed acoustic signals following phase transitions induced by alpha particles and WIMP like , neutron induced recoil nuclei .
To their surprise they found a significant difference in amplitudes of the acoustic signals , which has never been observed before .
As experiment spokesperson Viktor Zacek ( Université de Montréal ) said , " When we looked at our calibration data taken with neutrons and compared them with our alpha background data we saw a peculiar difference which we attributed first to some detector instabilities or gain drifts in our electronics .
However when we checked the data and refined the analysis the discrimination effect became even more pronounced . "
Detection of WIMPs is the first challenge in the struggle to understand dark matter .
Much of our understanding until now has been hypothetical .
There is convincing astronomical evidence to suggest that 23 per cent of the Universe is made up of dark matter – different from the matter with protons , neutrons and electrons that we are accustomed to .
This dark matter is between a hundred to a thousand times heavier than a proton and interacts extremely weakly with itself and ' ordinary ' matter .
It is believed it was created during the Big bang and that it now surrounds most galaxies , and also our Milky Way in gigantic clouds .
In The Iron Wall ( 2001 ) , Israeli historian Avi Shlaim shows that in July 1981 , US diplomat Philip Habib brokered a ceasefire between the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel .
For the next year , the PLO infuriated Israel by refusing to violate the ceasefire and thereby provide an excuse for Israel ’s long - planned attack on PLO refugee camps and bases in Lebanon .
Then , on 3 June 1982 , a member of the Abu Nidal organization shot and wounded Shlomo Argov , the Israeli ambassador in London .
Abu Nidal , or Sabri Khalil al - Banna , was a Palestinian , but he was anything but a PLO stalwart : “ Abu Nidal was supported by Iraq in his struggle against Arafat ’s ‘ capitulationist ’ leadership of the PLO .
Abu Nidal customarily referred to Arafat as ‘ the Jewess ’s son . ’
The PLO had passed a death sentence on Abu Nidal for assassinating some of its moderate members who advocated a dialogue with Israel . ”
The next day , Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin called an emergency cabinet meeting .
When his advisor Gideon Machanaimi and Avraham Shalom ( the head of the General Security Service ) began to discuss the nature of the Abu Nidal organization , Begin cut them off : “ ‘ They are all PLO . ’ [ Army Chief of Staff ] Rafael Eitan was equally dismissive .
Shortly before entering the conference room , an intelligence aide told him that Abu Nidal ’s men were evidently responsible for the assassination attempt .
‘ Abu Nidal , Abu Shmidal , ’ he sneered ; ‘ we have to strike at the PLO ! ’ ”
Two days later , Israel invaded Lebanon , which would kill over 18,000 people , including the massacres of Palestinian refugees at Sabra and Shatila , and push Lebanon further into a morass of imperial and sectarian violence .
Of course , the lying excuse endlessly proffered for the invasion , enshrined in its nickname “ Operation Peace for the Galilee , ” and obligingly circulated by the American media , was that Israel could no longer be expected to tolerate a constant barrage of PLO rockets across its northern border .
In Israel ’s recent rush to invade Gaza , we witness the same predisposition to violence , the same aching aggravation with Palestinian peace offensives , and the same willingness to conflate all resistance , all frustrations , into a single enemy : “ They are all Hamas ! ”
And we see that Hamas , like the PLO , refused to oblige Israel with a single provocative act .
For more than four months after 19 June 2008 , Hamas refrained from any military actions that might endanger the negotiated truce or “ calm ” with Israel .
The evidence for this is ready to hand .
For example , the Wikipedia entry on the events of the summer , “ List of rocket and mortar attacks in Israel in 2008 ” ( revised 4 January 2008 ) , based almost exclusively on Israeli newspapers and government sources , confirms that there were no rocket or mortar attacks claimed by or plausibly attributed to Hamas during the calm .
This can also be verified by surveying archives of news reports from the period .
The few that were launched , none of them causing any casualties , were claimed by the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , by Islamic Jihad , by “ the Badr Forces , ” or by nobody .
Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh called repeatedly for a cessation of rocket fire , and denounced those factions who broke the truce .
A Hamas spokesman criticized Fatah for allowing the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , which is affiliated with Fatah , to fire rockets .
Meanwhile , Israeli occupation forces ’ murders and settler pogroms continued unabated on the West Bank .
They included an attempt by a settler to fire a homemade rocket toward the Palestinian village of Burin , which nearly killed another settler .
During the lull , then , Israeli settlers fired more rockets ( i.e. , one ) than did Hamas .
In a document entitled “ The Hamas terror war against Israel , ” The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides striking visual evidence of Hamas ’s good faith during the lull .
It reproduces two graphs drawn up by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage & Commemoration Center :
Monthly distribution of rockets hit
Monthly distribution of mortar shells
The graphs show that the total number of rocket and mortar attacks shrank from 245 in June to 26 total for July through October , a reduction of 97 percent .
Even this was not enough for Israel , which violated the truce by imposing a terror - famine in Gaza for most of these months .
But despite these violations , Hamas refrained from launching rockets until Israel definitively cancelled the truce on the night of 4 - 5 November by sending an Israeli commando squad into Gaza , where it killed six Hamas members .
Hamas responded with 30 rockets .
These charts proved too revealing for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
On the night eve of 4 January 2008 , as Israeli occupation forces launched a ground assault on Gaza , the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs removed them from its website , substituting an almost illegible graph in which the labels obscure the data , while the caption does all it can to hide the de facto end of rocket and mortar fire during the calm , until 4 November .
This document was also titled “ The Hamas terror war against Israel . ”
But a Korean webpage has cached the original document , preserving the evidence of Israel ’s sticky - fingered hasbara , or propaganda .
Clearly , the Israelis violated the truce in order to increase the number of Qassam attacks , not to end them .
Qassams provide Israel with its best shot at its favorite media role of plucky little David fighting the Palestinian Goliath .
And by nimble revision of its webpage , the Israeli MFA is able to turn cause into effect — turning the retaliatory Hamas Qassams of 6 November into the cause of Israel canceling the truce on 4 November , and smashing it flat on 19 December .
We have heard , and we will continue to hear , a droning litany of “ Qassams !
Qassams ! Qassams ! ”
The repetition will be difficult to resist , but for all of us who remember the reiterated US lies about Iraq of 2002 - 2003 , whether with pride for our skepticism or shame for our credulity , a good first step might be for us to think “ WMDs ! ” every time they say “ Qassams ! ”
Like the US Coalition of the Willing , Israel ’s Operation Cast Lead has not let the absence of actual provocation get in the way of a good bloodbath .
Indeed , chronology itself proves no obstacle , as Israeli commandos , Apaches and F - 16s retaliate for rocket attacks that have n’t occurred yet .
In the immortal , influential and profoundly depraved words of neoliberal crusader Michael Ignatieff , “ Against this kind of enemy … it makes sense to get our retaliation in first . ”
When the history of the war on Gaza is written , Hamas ’s remarkable restraint during the lull , as Israel attempted to starve Gaza into submission , will form an important prelude to what Joseph Massad has called the heroic Gaza Ghetto Uprising .
But for the moment , it ’s vital to remember that what we are witnessing in Gaza is not Israeli retaliation , but an act of unprovoked Zionist genocide using American - made weapons , based on a bloody lie about Qassam barrages obligingly circulated by American media .
The question for Americans to ask now is this : what must we do , with our American - made mouths , brains , and bodies , to stop it ?

Dollhouse Season 1 B+ " The Target " Episode 2
Advertisement
Okay , so I was talking to Eliza Dushku earlier today .
( How ’s that for shameless name - dropping ?
It ’s like we ’re old chums or something . )
Our discussion will run later in the week , but the line she was pushing on the show was that it really kicks into gear starting with the sixth episode , which is written by Joss Whedon .
She was quick to add that she ’s not at all dissatisfied with the episodes before it , but the overall impression is that the first five were constructed more as standalone episodes that might hook the casual viewer while the back half of the season unfolds in more serialized fashion .
( She also said that Whedon ’s voice as a writer comes through more clearly than it has so far , which is great news given how little of it was evident in the premiere . )
In the meantime , I think we ’re supposed to be patient until the show finally hits its groove — provided that FOX is similarly patient , of course , and the network has spotty history at best .
( Looking at the ratings , there ’s reason to feel both hope and dread .
For more on that , check out a Newswire post I wrote about it earlier in the week . )
Advertisement
If the episodes leading up to # 6 are anything like tonight ’s very entertaining “ The Target , ” I for one have all the patience in the world .
Once again , the episode did n’t have the feel of a Whedon show , exactly , but advanced the overall story arc further than I expected and the standalone subplot , a twist on The Most Dangerous Game , was tightly plotted , exciting , and full of genuinely unexpected turns .
At a minimum , it confirms my belief that the Dollhouse formula is fundamentally sound , flexible enough to go wherever it wants with the one - off “ imprints ” while constantly posing and addressing questions about the place itself and the varied motivations of the actives and their keepers .
The main thread pairs Echo with an outdoorsman named Richard ( Matt Kesslar ) who appears at first to be another in a line of extravagantly wealthy men looking for the perfect date , with no attachments .
Right away , this raises an issue that I had with the opening of the first episode :
That the Dollhouse functions often , if not primarily , as an escort service , which makes it an awfully icky and exploitative operation .
For a second tonight , I thought that maybe the romantic aspect of these dates was relatively chaste and that boundaries had been established , but Echo goes all Faith on her client in his tent .
Anyway , Echo does what she ’s supposed to do and fulfills all the nature - loving fantasies ( whitewater rafting , rock - climbing , bow - hunting ) that girlier girls presumably would n’t do for him .
But alas , Richard turns on Echo and makes her his prey .
Advertisement
That ’s a solid enough twist , but even better was having Echo ’s handler Langdon ( Harry Lennix ) nearly neutralized by a thug - for - hire posing as a police officer .
It was nice bit of misdirection to have Langdon and his partner successfully talk themselves out of trouble by pretending like press members seeking direction , only to have the friendly local cop plug holes in them with a handgun .
You expect them to be taken off surveillance duty , not put in the line of fire themselves , and it ’s a fun pre-commercial shock .
It also underlines a major theme of this episode :
The intimate , surrogate father / daughter relationship between an active and her handler , which of course Whedon explored to great effect with Buffy and Giles in Buffy The Vampire Slayer .
How clever , then , to intercut Echo and Langdon ’s misadventures with the hunter with Langdon ’s introduction to Dollhouse three months earlier , in the aftermath of a mass slaughter perpetrated by a former active with the codename “ Alpha . ”
Among other things , we get to see the coding process that bonds Langdon to the childlike Echo ; it ’s an artificial , machine - dictated bond , of course , but what makes the moment so poignant is that Echo accepts it much like a duckling coded to follow its mother while Langdon reads from a script , uncertain that he ’s made the right choice even being there , much less feeling a deep connection to a total stranger .
“ From this point on , she ’ll always trust you , ” says tech super - nerd Topher ( Fran Kranz ) to him .
“ You ’re about to become the most important person in her life . ”
Advertisement
So what a great payoff when we see that three months later , in this sticky situation with the hunter , that Langdon ’s feelings for Echo have clearly deepened while hers have basically stayed the same .
Yes , she ’s as ( artificially ) trusting of him as she was when Topher worked his magic , but she goes “ tabula rasa ” after every mission , so there ’s no real growth on her end of the relationship .
But he remembers everything and has already become a father - figure to her ; whatever his feelings about the organization itself — and he definitely seems ill at ease — it ’s more than a job for him at this point .
Echo ’s got him hooked .
Grade : B +
Stray observations :
• The dialogue is still mysteriously workmanlike for a Whedon production , save for Echo ’s awesome zinger about knowing how to use a gun : “ Four brothers , none of them Democrats . ”
Advertisement
• Ballard has n’t shown many layers yet beyond his capacity as super - determined FBI guy , but tonight ’s episode did a nice job of thickening the plot on that front by having him discover things about Dollhouse and about Echo ’s true identity while also setting up Dollhouse ’s all - seeing top brass ( Olivia Williams and Reed Diamond ) as more active adversaries in the future .
• Very happy to see the show reaching back into the dark history of Dollhouse itself .
The “ Alpha ” arc will be in development all season , I imagine , but there ’s plenty of room to get into the origins of the place down the line .
I thought the chronology of this episode was handled very well .

The “ shoulder to the wheel ” move .
• Dushku very much in her element this week : A spunky tomboy who kicks ass ?
Yep , she can handle that .
In THE ASCENT OF MONEY , Niall Ferguson traces the evolution of money and demonstrates that financial history is the essential back - story behind all history .
President Obama is under the impression that history owes him $ 1 trillion right now to spend on whatever he wants .
His language is strident and full of irritation that anyone would question his right to live out his personal dream of being Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush ’s Hoover .
This , he says , is what the election was all about .
The arrogance reminds me of George Bush after 9 - 11 , who similarly believed that history owed him a gargantuan war in the tradition of FDR .
And look how that arrogance led to disgrace and loss , as he unwittingly presided over the destruction of American prosperity while searching for bugbears abroad .
It just goes to show you that the presidency is something like a drug .
It makes people lose all connection to reality .
Part of the reality that Obama needs to recognize is that the New Deal was a calamity far worse than the initial market downturn that began it .
He needs to stop basing his policies on dumbed - down civics texts versions of events and consider the economic logic .
With his rhetoric and policies , he has decided to demonize private enterprise , just as FDR did , as a way to present government as the great savior .
Now , think about this .
If there is a way out of the recession , it will have to be provided by private enterprise .
It will come by new businesses , business expansions , entrepreneurship , new technology , and this will be the source of lasting jobs and prosperity .
You cannot make a country rich by looting taxpayers and paying people to pound nails into siding at public schools !
These activities amount to capital consumption .
They are not sources of investment .
You can say that they are stupid tasks or wonderful tasks , but it is not a matter of ideology as to whether such public projects will make us all wealthier .
They will not .
They drain the sources of wealth from society .
They represent a cost , not a blessing .
That was also true of Bush ’s dumb stimulus program .
He was only bailing out his friends at our expense .
The effect was to give a little longer life to institutions that were failing anyway .
It ’s pathetic that the Republicans ever went along with it .
You will notice that the scheme did n’t actually work .
Well , Obama is doing the same thing , though rewarding a different set of friends .
This is not wealth production .
This is wealth consumption .
Do enough of this nonsense and you can destroy the livelihoods of an entire generation .
Americans are proud of their system of government , but consider what it has given us this time around .
We had an outgoing president who thought it was his right to grab as much as he could while leaving .
Now we have a new president who thinks that the election entitled him to grab as much as he can , right from the beginning .
We get looted by the state coming and going .
It all amounts to one massive war on prosperity and freedom .
Particularly culpable here are the official historians who have for generations heralded FDR as the great savior .
It is a case study in how a civic lie can appear and fester for decades .
The fact is that the New Deal did not work .
It prolonged what might have been a troubling two - year downturn into a horrifying blow to world prosperity that ended up in a war that killed countless millions .
It was one of the greatest acts of wreckage in world history .
And Obama is inspired by this ?
He wants to repeat it ?
I ’m not so cynical about human affairs that I believe that errors must be endlessly repeated .
Obama can put a stop to his madness .
He needs to know — someone must tell him frankly and openly — that his current path is going to lead not to recovery , but to an extension of suffering , and untold amounts of it .
The biggest threat facing the American economy right now is rarely even discussed .
It is the massive buildup of paper bank reserves in the last quarter of 2008 .
This was Bush ’s doing .
He ordered the Fed to print like mad .
Fortunately for us , the banks are still holding on to these reserves .
When they start lending again , the result could be hyperinflation of Confederate dollar proportions .
Hence the priority of the Obama administration should be to first do no evil , and second to find some means for withdrawing those reserves from the banking system before they wash through the economic structure and destroy the dollar .
There is still time .
He must act .
Yes , that will lead to bank failures .
That ’s good !
It will lead to business failures .
That ’s good and essential too .
There simply is no choice .
If he acts now , he could find that recovery will come before his second term .
This is precisely what happened with Reagan .
He was fortunate to have advisers who insisted that he let the liquidation happen rather than attempt to fix the recession of 1981 — 82 with huge new government spending programs .
In any case , the hardest work to do here is intellectual .
Obama ’s head is filled with myths and lies , not only about FDR and the New Deal , but also about the government ’s power to repair the existing economic problems .
With this model in his head , he can only do evil .
This must change .
Nothing is inevitable .
He can turn on a dime .
The main message : do not repeat the actions of FDR , lest you destroy what is left of American liberty and prosperity .

Hundreds wait for hours to buy S.F. ID card SAN FRANCISCO
Foes see them as making life easier for illegal immigrants

Hundreds of people stood in line for hours at San Francisco City Hall on Thursday to be among the first in the nation to receive municipal identification cards regardless of their immigration status .
The cards , also available in New Haven , Conn. , and being considered in other cities , have sparked fury among advocates of stricter immigration laws .
They argue cities have no business declaring people residents if they are not in the country legally .
But San Francisco officials and recipients of the cards hailed the new program as a way to connect undocumented immigrants with banks , businesses and city services , such as obtaining health care and checking out library books .
They also said it will encourage card holders to report crimes to the police without fear of being arrested or deported .
" I really need the identification card , " said Marvin Martinez , 50 , who arrived in the city five months ago from Florida and is originally from Mexico .
Martinez , who did n't say whether he was a legal resident , stood in a long line - one made up mostly of Latino men - that snaked down the marble hallway outside the county clerk 's office .
" I 'll use it to look for jobs and for school and when the police stop me , I 'll have ID to show them , " he said .
" It 'll improve things . "
The clerk 's office expected to create 30 cards on the first day of the program , and signed up hundreds of people for appointments in the coming days .
The clerk 's office eventually will hand out about 50 cards per day .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , who as a supervisor wrote the legislation creating the card program , was the first to receive a card - though he initially thought he could do so with just his driver 's license and had to return with a utility bill .
Even his Assembly ID card did n't count , he pointed out with a laugh .
People must show proof of identity like a driver 's license or foreign passport , as well as proof of residency such as a utility bill or proof of having a child enrolled in the city 's public schools .
" Mr. Ammiano forgot to bring his residency documents , " County Clerk Karen Hong said .
" Education is key . "
Ammiano , Hong and many other city officials gathered in the North Light Court on Thursday morning to announce the program .
Notably absent was Mayor Gavin Newsom , who aides alternately said was running late or was busy in a meeting upstairs .
The widespread assumption at the news conference was that Newsom - often criticized for holding too many news conferences - was avoiding the controversial issue because it may not play well in his bid for governor in 2010 .
" He ducked it , " Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi said .
" My take is whatever his larger aspirations are , they seem to be eclipsing the local gains like this .
He should be proud of this , and I 'm sure quietly he is . "
After an unrelated event to announce the expansion of a free Wi-Fi program for public housing residents , Newsom said he had been meeting with his budget director during the identification card event .
He said he 's not worried about how the program will affect his run for governor .
" This would go at the end of a very long list of things that will be points of consternation that will be targeted against me , " he said .
There had been earlier talk of him joining Ammiano to get a card himself to promote the program , which he also rejected .
" I 've got more IDs than I need , " he said .
" This is for other people .
This is not for the mayor of San Francisco .
In fact , with respect , I appreciate some city employees getting it , but I wish it was going to the people it was intended for in the first day or two . "
Newsom supported identification cards when Board of Supervisors approved the program in 2007 .
But he put the program on hold last summer following a series of Chronicle articles about how the city was shielding youth in the country illegally from deportation after they were found guilty of committing felonies .
That practice was stopped , and Newsom said he wanted to ensure the identification cards complied with state and federal laws before going forward .
The Immigration Reform Law Institute of Washington sued to block the cards on behalf of four San Francisco residents who said the program would aid illegal immigration .
San Francisco Superior Court Judge Peter Busch tossed the suit in October .
Ira Mehlman , media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform - a national group that wants immigration laws enforced more strongly - said it 's ridiculous to create a program to attract more illegal immigrants when most U.S. cities are struggling financially .
" Maybe San Francisco is the exception to the rule , and they have money to burn - who knows ? "
Mehlman said .
City Administrator Ed Lee said the machinery to produce the cards cost $ 700,000 and staffing will cost $ 150,000 annually .
Supporters said the program is n't just for illegal immigrants .
Homeless people often have trouble obtaining ID cards because they have no fixed address .
And transgender people are sometimes stigmatized if they show a driver 's license that indicates their legal sex is different from how they appear ; the city cards have no sex designation .
WASHINGTON --
The new chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was a top lobbyist for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. until last year , and will have to recuse himself from some government duties under new White House ethics rules .
The appointment of Mark Patterson runs into an executive order President Barack Obama signed to limit the ability of officials to move between industry and government .
The order , part of a campaign promise to curb the influence business , allows lobbyists to join the administration as long as ...

All arrangements are performed by me without permission – but trust me , I ’m no threat to the original artist ’s income stream …
Most songs are recorded on either on my Lowden D - 32 , or a Papoose travel guitar , which is a pretty cool little instrument in its own right .
Lament for Limerick / It ’s Not Yet Day
This short arrangement of Lament For Limerick is based loosely on Duck Baker ’s version from the CD Irish Jigs , Reels , Airs and Hornpipes ( SHANACHIE 97011 ) .
The Arrangement of It ’s Not Yet Day is completely my own .
My debut arrangement – be gentle with me .

Last Farewell to Stirling
A very simple arrangement of a very simple tune .
Supposedly a Scottish transportation ballad which comes by way of Australia .
I heard this on the Battlefield Band CD reissue of Stand Easy and Preview ( Temple Records COMD2052 ) .
This arrangement could still use a lot of work , especially at the break in the middle .

Simpson is really an incredible musician and teacher .

Actually , the Papoose is tuned 5 steps up from a regular guitar – so on a standard guitar , tune to DGDGCD ( Gsus4 ) and Capo V to get this same effect .

March of the King of Laoise
An approximation of Duck Baker ’s version of this stately tune from Mel Bay ’s Complete Celtic Fingerstyle Guitar Book ( by Stefan Grossman , Duck Baker and El McMeen ) available from Mel Bay Publications .
I find the rhythmic playing on this one somewhat difficult , so I have cheated a bit in my playing .
I also added substantial echo effects to the track which fill things out a bit and help mask the occasional playing error .
Dropped - D tuning : DADGBE , capoed at the third fret , which makes some of the awkward finger stretches in this tune less so .
This is my first attempt at recording with an actual mike ( Audio Technica ATM - 35 ) , rather than simply going with the output from my Fishman Acoustic Matrix , and the results are MUCH better than before .

Lament for Owen Roe O’Neil
I learned this one from the John Renbourn solo guitar cd The Hermit ( SHANACHIE 97014 ) .
I added a couple of shortcuts to the original arrangement , however .
This cd is a terrific showcase for Renbourn ’s talents and includes a tab booklet for about half the songs on the cd .
Tab for much of Renbourn ’s work , as well as a set of three instructional videos ( produced by Stefan Grossman ’s Guitar Workshop ) , is available through Mel Bay Publications .

Lament for Owen Roe O’Neil ( Papoose Version )
As above , but played on the Papoose .
This version is recorded on the Papoose Travel Guitar .
One of the few tunes recorded here which illustrates some shortcomings of the Papoose .
The high notes played against open bottom strings in the variation on the A part of the tune sound a good bit off .
This is because the intonation of the guitar begins to get pretty dicey above he 10th - 12th fret .
Moreover , I found that the shorter scale length and stiffer action on the Papoose made playing the B part , which utilizes a couple of very cramped barre chords , much harder than on a conventional guitar .

The O’Carolan tune “ Blind Mary ” , more or less as arranged by Duck Baker in The Mel Bay Complete Celtic Fingerstyle Guitar Book ( by Stefan Grossman , Duck Baker and El McMeen ) available from Mel Bay Publications .
The book also includes arrangements by Dave Evans of traditional Celtic tunes .
Another recommended buy , The Complete Celtic Song Book also has an optional companion CD which includes a subset of about 25 tunes from the book recorded by Baker , McMeen and Evans .

A Personal Story
When I started my first online business , I completely lacked confidence .
And I was n’t willing to take any risks whatsoever UNLESS I knew that I was going to succeed .
As a result , I hesitated on the sidelines for many years until my wife became pregnant and decided to quit her job .
Finally , the threat of losing half of our income gave me the kick I needed to just say F!@ # $ it .
Let ’s do this !
So with just $ 630 , my wife and I started an online store selling handkerchiefs that made over 100 K in profit during our first year .
HANDKERCHIEFS !
How insane is that ?!?
Today , this same store makes well over 7 figures and to be honest , it still feels completely ludicrous to me .
And with MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , if you told me that I was going to make over 1 million dollars blogging last year ?
I would have told you to get the heck out of town !
Editor ’s Note :

Also if you ’re curious , you can click here to check out my little online shop .
In fact , the mere premise of making significant money selling handkerchiefs ( or blogging for that matter ) is so ridiculous that I ’m often challenged by my readers as to whether my success was a direct result of luck and circumstance as opposed to skill .
Did I just happen to stumble upon a small niche that no one else was into ?
Did I just get lucky that no one was selling these types of linens online ?
And the answer is yes .
Luck certainly did play a part .
It always does .
But you have to put yourself out there in order to take advantage of it .
Today , I want to address the readers of MyWifeQuitHerJob.com who are currently on the sidelines with very little money .
I want to address those of you who have no idea where to begin but want to start your own business someday .
How do you convince yourself to begin ?
How do you lay the groundwork for your future business if you do n’t feel ready ?
Today , I ’m going to teach you how to start a business with no money .
And here ’s how I would do it .

Before I started my blog , I used to think that no one would care about what I had to say .
And as a result , I had extremely low expectations when I first decided to start a blog over at MyWifeQuitHerJob.com .
To put things in perspective , I did n’t think that anyone would read my blog except for close friends .
But then something surprising happened .
Very few of my friends took an interest in my writing .
And instead , complete strangers started emailing me about my experiences and my philosophies on life .
I started having conversations with random people and these random people and I started to become friends .
And before long , I had a bunch of regulars reading my blog .
Note :
This was the complete opposite of what I expected to happen !
I expected many of my friends to take an interest in what I was up to .
many of my friends to take an interest in what I was up to .
I expected my friends to be 100 % supportive of everything I was working on .
my friends to be 100 % supportive of everything I was working on .
But I did NOT expect total strangers to care at all .
After all , why would people care about some random Chinese dude on the Internet ?
The truth is that people care about what you have to say !
You just have to find the right people to talk to !
Put Yourself Out There
But the only way to find these people is to put yourself out there !
Even if you have no money , there are a variety of ways to create a following .
For example , there ’s this Asian kid I follow on YouTube who has over 1 million subscribers to his channel .
His name is KevJumba .
Kevin started out by posting silly videos of himself dancing online .
Then , he used a cheap webcam to record himself talking about his beliefs and his philosophies on life .
Things started out slow but year after year , he started gathering more and more followers to his channel .
And over time , he developed a huge following .
Because of YouTube , he now makes a living creating his own films and producing his own movies !
Here ’s one of his very early videos below which I found hilarious !
As you can tell , it ’s not professional .
And the quality of video is n’t amazing .
But the guy put himself out there !
Here ’s the thing .
Kevin was only 18 years old when I started watching him online .
And you would think that a 30 year old dude would have no interest in what an 18 year old would have to say .
But Kevin was spunky , funny and I liked his attitude .
Not only that , but the reason I followed Kevin had nothing to do with the production quality of his videos ( which were pretty bad early on ) .
There was just something about him that resonated with me and I wanted to know what he was up to .
This is exactly what you need to do !
Choose Your Medium
Even if you have no clue what business you want to start later on in life and even if you have no money , you need to put yourself out there .
I started MyWifeQuitHerJob.com by writing on a consistent schedule about life , family and ecommerce .
People found me via search , social media , word of mouth and my readership gradually grew over time to where it is today .
Once I developed an audience , making money became an afterthought .
When you have a large group of raving fans interested in what you have to say , the money will come .
Trust me on that .
The hard part is finding and gathering your fans .
Today , we live in a day and age where you have lots of options depending on what you want to do .
I personally chose to start a blog but there are many other low cost options to choose from .
Gather And Retain Your Followers
Once you ’ve developed your fan base , it is essential to retain them as you continue to build your brand .
In the case of MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , 99 % of my early readers would come , read a single article , and then leave forever .
So instead of missing out on a potential regular , I started gathering email addresses using a service called Aweber .
Editor ’s Note : I am no longer using Aweber and if you are looking for a good email provider , read my post on Drip Vs ConvertKit Vs Aweber Vs MailChimp
In return for a reader ’s email address , I would give away a free 6 day mini course on ecommerce .
And 9 times out of 10 , that reader would stick around after the mini course to check out my new articles and updates .
In fact , I have readers on my blog who have stuck with me for over 8 years ( you know who you are ) and I ’m very thankful !
The key is to retain your existing audience while simultaneously attracting new fans .
This way , your audience count has no where to go except up .
One thing that I like to tell my friends is that my blog is like a stock that only increases in value .
As long as I keep doing what I ’m doing , it can only get better , not worse .
I ’ve Got An Audience Now So What ?
Once you ’ve gathered a small group of raving fans is when the fun begins .
And it is infinitely easier to start a business when you already have an established base of potential leads .
Using my blog as an example , if I ever wanted to develop an ecommerce plugin for Shopify or BigCommerce , I could instantly gather a user base of customers by sending word out to my email list and blog .
I could also leverage my audience to gather ideas for products to sell even if I had no idea what to create .
When I launched my annual ecommerce conference , The Sellers Summit , I instantly sold out of tickets because my loyal fans wanted to attend .
The possibilities are endless !
Case Study : How To Make $ 4 K Without A Product To Sell
Here ’s a real life case study of a student in my Create A Profitable Online Store course who built a small audience and started making money right away with online webinars
Arree Chung is an artist who writes and illustrates children ’s books for a living .
And as we all know , you ca n’t make real money as an artist right ?
Wrong !
First off , Arree is Chinese and I have no idea how his parents allowed him to become an artist as opposed to an engineer , lawyer or doctor but that ’s besides the point : )
Arree is a talented artist with a unique skill that other people want to learn .
So one day he decided to give an online tutorial on how to create a children ’s picture book from scratch .
He simply emailed his list of less than 100 people , gave a one hour long online webinar and made over $ 4000 in one shot .
He did n’t have a product but his presentation was so compelling that people were willing to pay him for a course that he had n’t even created yet .
Crazy right ?
Here were his exact numbers for the webinar that day …
Arree emailed a list of 80 people
a list of 80 people 60 % of the people who attended his live webinar purchased his class
who attended his live webinar purchased his class
He generated $ 4315 WITHOUT a post followup sequence
WITHOUT a post followup sequence
He did n’t have a website
What ’s funny is that when he first told me about his webinar , I was very skeptical .
I did n’t believe that there were people out there willing to pay hundreds of dollars to learn how to create a children ’s picture book .
But apparently I was wrong .
If you stop and think , there are over 7 billion people in this world and somewhere out there is someone who will pay to learn from you .
But you ’ll never reach these people unless you try .
Remember , you do n’t have to be an expert to charge for your services .
You just have to be helpful and provide a benefit .
After all , what does it mean to be an expert anyway ?
As far as I know , there ’s no “ expert ” credential or placement test : )
We are all “ expert enough ” and that ’s what matters .
So take some time to document your skills and start spreading your knowledge .
A Veteran Entrepreneur ’s Take On The Fastest Way To Make $ 5 K Starting From Scratch
Recently , my buddies Greg Mercer , Mike Jackness , Scott Voelker and I got together on my podcast to discuss how we would personally make $ 5000 as quickly as possible starting from complete scratch .
And guess what ?
All of our answers were all over the map which just goes to show that there are many different ways to make money online .
Enjoy the episode !
Having An Audience Is The Key
Overall , making money is infinitely easier if you have an audience and it does n’t cost any money to build one .
So if you take away anything from this post , please remember this …
Start creating something today and put yourself out there !
It does n’t have to be anything fancy .
Take your smart phone and start recording videos about your philosophies on life .
Find something that you are good at and start talking about it .
Put together some tutorials about a recent skill you have acquired !
At first , you will be skeptical that anyone will be interested in what you have to say .
But there is always someone out there who will care .
You just have to find the right audience .
( I ’ll bet KevJumba had no idea that he’d be attracting people almost twice his age to his YouTube channel ) .
The point is that you ’ll never know unless you try .
Start gathering an audience now and you will have the courage to start your own business someday .
I guarantee it !

Congressional investigators recently outlined 13 issues for President - elect Barack Obama to focus on without delay .
Most are obvious , such as military readiness , homeland security , financial regulation and Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The 2010 census also made it onto the urgent 13 .
It deserves to be there .
As with any huge undertaking , the census requires years of planning , but preparations have been systematically sidetracked during the Bush years .
The most plausible explanation , beyond incompetence , is that the administration aimed to make it even more difficult than usual to count hard - to - count groups , like minorities , immigrants and the poor , who tilt Democratic .
Their numbers , if accurately gauged , could reshape electoral maps .
The White House , with the early support of a Republican - led Congress , shortchanged and delayed financing for the Census Bureau .
The administration left top bureau positions unfilled for long stretches and allowed political judgment to dominate bureau management , which damaged morale and impaired performance .
The Census Bureau is currently on its third director in eight years , its third deputy director and its third decennial director , the point person for the 2010 census .
None of those senior managers have ever led a nationwide census , and two of them  the deputy and the decennial director  assumed their posts last October .
The lack of experience is especially disturbing given that test runs and other preparatory steps for the upcoming census have been scaled back or canceled in the past year .

Surgeons at Johns Hopkins carried out what is believed to be the first ever operation of removing a healthy kidney through a tiny cut in the back of the donor 's vagina .
The surgery called transvaginal donor kidney extraction is now considered to be historic .
According to Robert Montgomery , M.D. , Ph.D. , who holds the position of chief of the transplant division at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , the surgery went well and both patients felt fine .
He was the one to lead the team of doctors .
The operation was carried out on January 29 .
Kidney was removed from a 48 - year - old woman living in Lexington Park , Md. Instead of performing a 5 - to - 6 - inch abdominal incision doctors only made a small cut on her abdomen , leaving just 3 pea-size scars on it , one of them being hidden in the patient 's navel .
" Removing the kidney through a natural opening should hasten the patient 's recovery and provide a better cosmetic result , " says Montgomery , who added that the surgery lasted for 3.5 hours , which is just as long as the common laparoscopic procedure .
This operation is just one from a whole family of latest surgical methods called natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgeries ( NOTES ) .
These procedures involve the extraction of organs and tissue through natural body openings .
Anthony Kalloo , M.D. , Gastroenterology Division director at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the first to carry out NOTES , mentioned that tissues and organs could be extracted through such natural openings as the mouth , anus and vagina , reports Science Daily .
Surgeons have registered successful NOTES since 2004 .
They managed to remove unhealthy gallbladders and appendixes through the mouth .
In addition , doctors were able to remove appendix through vagina , and the current operation also proved to be successful and revolutionary .
Kalloo stated that natural orifice translumenal endoscopic operation represents the final frontier to study in carrying out scarless surgeries , which would be less painful and safer for overweight patients .

MPs are calling for a full account of arms exports to Israel amid growing concerns that British military equipment was used during the bombardment of Gaza – contrary to Israeli assurances and UK export guidelines .
The government was adamant UK exports were not used in drone aircraft that helped the Israeli air force target missile strikes that killed more than 1,000 people and demolished thousands of homes and other buildings and infrastructure .
Now , however , ministers say they are unsure what equipment was used .
Attention has been focused on two critical weapons in Israel 's frontline forces : the F16 ground attack fighters and the Hermes 450 drones , which pinpoint the sites for attack .
British arms control officials have admitted they are unable to say whether UK - made aircraft engines were fitted to drones .
And ministers say they have been unable to ascertain whether the planes were fitted with the pilots ' electronic kit for launching missiles , which was controversially – but legally – sold by BAE Systems to Israel , via the US , in 2002 .
MPs on the joint committee currently examining arms controls have expressed their frustration at the lack of information .
At a hearing , they also complained that for three months the foreign office had failed to respond to questions about UK equipment in the naval blockade of Gaza last year .
A Labour member of the committee , Richard Burden , who is also chairman of the Britain - Palestine parliamentary group , told the Guardian the government should provide " chapter and verse " on the use of all British arms exports to Israel , including critical components for the F16s .
" It should be possible for the government to establish the end - use of these exports .
And if they cannot do that through independent checks , then that suggests that Israel is not a reliable trading partner for arms and components , " he said .
He recalled that in 2002 Israel was found to have broken its written assurance that no UK equipment would be used in the occupied territories when it was disclosed that Centurion tanks had been converted by the IDF into armoured personnel carriers .
Describing Israel as a " country of concern " , the UK says it refuses to export military goods that can be used for internal repression or external aggression .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , has twice been challenged on the issue of the engine drones in the Commons since Amnesty International and the Guardian three weeks ago pointed to evidence suggesting engines made by an Israeli - owned factory in Staffordshire had been fitted to the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle . .
Miliband told MPs who have been calling for an arms embargo the allegations were false .
The engine , he said , " was not being used by the IDF but had in fact been for export .
I am happy to stick with that . "
The Israeli company that imported the engines , Elbit Systems – the owners of the British manufacturers UAV Engines Ltd ( UEL ) – has denied they were fitted to military drones in Israel , saying they were incorporated into aircraft for export only to third countries .
But at the committee hearing Jane Carpenter , a senior official with the export control section of the business and enterprise department , said that had not been checked .
Sitting with Ian Pearson , the responsible business and enterprise minister , Carpenter said : " We cannot categorically confirm that we have physically checked that the engines have been incorporated .
We only licensed them to Israel for onward export . "
She added that , had the engines stayed in Israel , " that would be a contravention of the licence condition , and that would be an offence " .
Pearson explained what checks had been made to allow Miliband to deny the allegations .
" My understanding is , we have spoken to this exporter and they have confirmed what we already know from our own database : that while they export UAV engines to Israel , the engines are a particular variant which is not used in Israel but is incorporated into UAVs for onward export .
So they would not have been involved in the current conflict . "
Pearson also said that the UK government had no clear idea whether the F16s had used the BAE Systems gunsight technology .
Israel is a major exporter of UAVs , and the Hermes 450 has been sold to the US , Singapore and Georgia .
Britain 's sensitivity about its military relations with Israel are acute since the Hermes is also the basis for the drone being developed by Elbit and the French company Thales for the £ 900 m Watchkeeper UAV programme for the British army .
The UK version , fitted with UEL engines , is due in service next year .
The Hermes programme , like all the Israeli - developed drones , is classified as a state secret ; the IDF has refused to confirm or deny reports , which first surfaced during the second Lebanon war in 2006 , that they were armed with missiles .
The evidence accumulated by the Guardian and Amnesty from academic and specialist aerospace public sources , as well as from Elbit 's website and filings to the US security and exchange commission , suggested that the IDF Hermes had used engines made in the UK .
The IDF first acquired these in 1997 , three years after UEL Engines was bought by Elbit 's drone subsidiary , Silver Arrow .
The authoritative industry journal Jane 's Defence Weekly reported at the time : " It is powered by a 52 hp UEL AR - 80 1010 rotary engine with propeller . "
Despite repeated requests , government departments have been unable to say whether they know what engines are used on the IDF 's drones .
Oliver Sprague , Amnesty International 's UK arms control programme director , said : " Available evidence suggests these drones are powered by UK engines .
Until someone from the UK government goes and physically inspects the drones , it 's hard to see on what basis they are dismissing these serious allegations . "
" Until a robust system of end - use monitoring is in place , the UK will forever be reliant on assurances from other countries , and from arms companies , that British - made equipment is not being used to abuse human rights . "
Dear Alan Moore ,
Hi .
How are you ?
We hope Northampton is nice this time of year .
I mean , obviously it's not , but unlike Zack Snyder , at least we 're aware that it is n't in London .
In fact , that Snyder fellow is the reason we 're writing to you .
We 're sure you 're aware his adaptation of your timeless graphic novel Watchmen is about to hit the big screen , and though you got in a huff and claimed the world did n't need any more " shitty movies " when it was announced - quite rightly , given the treatment of your other comics - we think you might want to check this one out .
Because it 's actually really great .
Before you start grumbling , hear us out .
The plot is largely lifted from the pages of your , and artist Dave Gibbons ' , novel : it 's still set in an alternate 1985 where the Doomsday clock stands at five minutes to midnight .
We still follow ' costumed heroes ' aka vigilante crime - fighters who are forced to retire - in fact , you must be pretty pissed The Incredibles ripped you off so blatantly .
But more importantly Mr. Moore , the adult themes of war , peace and identity are still as prevalent as ever - this is no flash - in - the - pan movie of the week .
Whereas your comic became known as one of the finest ever written , Watchmen the movie will likely be one of the most critically acclaimed and adored superhero movies ever - apart from that brute Batman , obviously .
Alan , relax - we know you were n't happy with Snyder as director .
Like us , you probably saw what he did with Frank Miller 's 300 - buckets of style , precious little substance .
With Watchmen , however , it 's the reverse - drawing from your own hand , he 's gifted with an abundance of character and story , something which he seems a little uneasy with at first but ultimately weaves together into a feature that 's worthy of carrying your name .
Well , if you 'd let him .
His additions to the story - sacrilege !
- are obvious : a few slo - mo fight scenes here , a bit of ropey dialogue there ( " You are such an asshole ! " ) and so on .
In truth , they 're nothing more than concessions to a younger audience : the lure of lycra is strong and , well , you 've got to give the kids something .
The opening scene - a scene - setting montage cut to Bob Dylan 's ' Times They Are A - Changin ' - is actually the perfect introduction to your universe and proves Snyder was a worthy choice to adapt a classic .
Otherwise , Snyder is slavishly faithful to your words , almost to a fault .
At around two and a half hours , he 's attempted to cram as much of your 12 - part series as possible into a feature - length running time .
Broken up into chapters , your book flowed seamlessly from one page to the next .
On film , it 's a little trickier - the first half is a fairly frenzied splurge of information as we attempt to acclimatise ourselves to your novel 's dense plotting .
Flashbacks flush with flashbacks , characters flit into one another 's storylines , murderers and sociopaths and demigods come and go .
But that 's how it was written : it builds towards an apt and thrilling finale , which - if we 're being honest - drags a little towards the end .
Do n't shoot the messenger , Alan : we all knew that squid bullshit only flies in comic - books .
You might not be impressed , but we 're willing to bet Dave Gibbons is over the moon : his panels transfer effortlessly to the screen , breathing life into some of the most fascinating and multi-layered characters ever drawn .
Hyper - stylised , even lesser scenes are framed to perfection , while action scenes play out in sumptuous slow - motion , and the eighties style gives it a unique flavour that immediately singles it out as something special .
Though you 'll probably never see it , the movie drips with detail ; scenes are packed full of easter eggs and nods to the comic .
It 's definitely one to watch on DVD .
If you have DVD .
The cast do a fine job of fleshing out your costumed heroes .
Stand - out is Jackie Earl Haley 's take on inkblot nutjob Rorschach , who nails the gravelly snarl that Bat - Bale fumbled and inhabits the wiry physicality that makes the character so fierce and threatening .
Jeffrey Dean Morgan is outstanding as the loathsome Comedian , a beast who thinks nothing of gunning down pregnant women and raping his colleagues , yet Morgan brings added depth to a part that could easily have been two - dimensional .
Only Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II is a little shaky , but given her youth and relative inexperience , perhaps that 's expected - she looks awesome in a PVC jockstrap , anyway .
Perhaps the most influential character , the nuclear - charged Dr. Manhattan , makes for an instantly iconic protagonist and lights up the screen both literally and figuratively .
With bright phosphoric eyes burning endlessly in his blue skull , he 's at once eerily calm and immensely terrifying - his semi-permanent nakedness just adds another layer of unease .
We just feel for the poor animator who pulled wang duty - you were lucky Mr. Moore , you had Gibbons to pencil Manhattan 's schlong .
On film , this thing jiggles .
As bizarre as it may seem , Manhattan 's atomic cock is pretty symbolic of Watchmen the movie as a whole - this is for adults only .
There 's tasteful nudity , gratuitous gore and weighty themes that at first seem alien in a mere ' superhero movie ' - even The Dark Knight seems frivolous compared to your apocalyptic narrative .
Everything in Watchmen matters : there are no small characters , no false leads , no flab .
Alan , you might think of Hollywood as a cancer eating away at the true creative arts , like ... erm , comic - book writing .
But after sitting through two and half twisted hours of Watchmen , people are going to need the assurance of your printed words to fill the gaps .
It 's a movie that compliments its source material , and vice versa - sales of your book are going to sky - rocket after its release .
You 've every right to be indifferent , outraged even at its existence .
But the fact is , Mr. Moore , Watchmen is a very fine film - engrossing , thought - provoking and unique .
Hate all you like , but that never got Rorschach anywhere .
Yours enthusiastically ,

Bay Area homeowners owe more than home 's worth THE ECONOMY IN TURMOIL 1 in 5 Bay Area owners owes more than the market value
Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Bay Area homeowners owe more than home 's worth 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Twenty percent of Bay Area homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth , according to a study being released today .
This dubious distinction has entered the American lexicon as an all - too - familiar term - being underwater .
As home values continue to plunge , the real estate valuation service Zillow.com said that 20.76 percent of all homes in the nine - county Bay Area are underwater .
The rate is much higher than the national average of 1 in 7 homes , or 14.3 percent .
That 's because the Bay Area - like most of California - was a classic bubble market , where buyers in recent years paid overinflated prices for homes that now are rapidly losing value in the market downturn .
Having negative equity , as the phenomenon also is called , can increase the likelihood of a home falling into foreclosure and limits a homeowner 's mobility and financial reserves .
It also motivates people to spend less because they feel less wealthy .
But it does not necessarily spell doom - unless it is accompanied by another financial problem , such as loss of a job or a mortgage payment that resets higher .
" Negative equity is essentially unrealized loss for a lot of homeowners , " said Stan Humphries , vice president of data and analytics for Zillow in Seattle .
" Unless you plan to buy , sell or refinance , it is more of an academic issue .
But for people who do need to make financial decisions related to the equity in their homes , negative equity significantly constrains their choices .
When there is any major financial stress to a household - death , divorce , job loss - it is much harder to rebound because it is harder to refinance , sell or get out from under the mortgage .
( Being underwater ) is highly correlated with foreclosure because it eliminates a variety of avenues people have for addressing financial stress . "
Locally , the underwater rate ranged from 7.31 percent in San Francisco to 38.63 percent in Solano County .
Nationwide , 16 of the 25 metropolitan areas with the greatest share of " upside - down " homes - another term for the problem - are in California , Zillow said .
Dale Hirschkorn , a medical researcher in San Francisco , is among the almost 400,000 Bay Area homeowners with negative equity .
He and his partner , Tom Joseph , owe about $ 610,000 on their bungalow in Oakland 's Maxwell Park neighborhood ; the home now is worth about $ 100,000 less .
In their 94619 ZIP code , 23.8 percent of the homes are underwater , according to Zillow .
" There is less of a safety blanket , " he said .
" If a tree fell on the house , we 'd have trouble finding the cash to repair it . "
Hirschkorn , 61 , had planned to retire next year , until the combination of his swooning equity and the stock market collapse that wiped out some of his retirement accounts .
Now , he 'll wait until he 's 65 - but some other plans may be on hold , too .
" When we retired , we wanted to run a bed & breakfast , maybe in San Luis Obispo , " he said .
" We were counting on the equity in the house to give us the down payment .
Now that dream is on the very back burner . "
Humphries said Zillow 's estimates are " definitely conservative " because they looked only at original purchase mortgages compared with a home 's current value .
These estimates did not consider cash - out refinances , which have become commonplace and would have made the underwater percentages higher .
" Particularly in the past few years , there has been a tendency for people to use their homes as an ATM , pulling out money in a refinancing , " he said .
" For homeowners who did that , the amount of equity in their homes is even less than we calculated . "
First American CoreLogic , a research firm for the real estate and mortgage market , did a separate survey of negative equity last month that did take refinances into account .
It found that 7.5 million homes , representing 18 percent of all U.S. homes with mortgages , are underwater .
An additional 2.1 million are close to being upside down .
About 30 percent of all U.S. homes are owned outright , and those were not taken into account in the First American statistics .
The Zillow figure of 1 in 7 homes nationally , or 14.3 percent , being underwater , represents a percentage of all homes , including those that do not have a mortgage .
Mark Fleming , chief economist for First American in Washington , said that being underwater combined with an inability to pay one 's mortgage - either through personal circumstances such as job loss or through higher payments when a mortgage resets - is a recipe for foreclosure .
As the economic crisis causes more people to lose their jobs and the share of underwater homes rises , so does the likelihood of more foreclosures .
There are a variety of other consequences at both the micro- and macroeconomic levels .
" The last recession in 2001 - 02 coincided with an upswing in housing market values so one could use home equity as a source of money to get them through , to smooth over volatility in their income stream , " Fleming said .
" That ability to use home equity as a source of income in times of economic stress now is removed " for many people .
Then there is the wealth effect .
" If people feel poor , behavioral changes occur , such as less willingness to spend , less eating out , less buying of goods and services , " he said .
" We see these ripple effects happening around the country . "
Another consequence is that it is much harder to pull up roots and relocate when a home is underwater .
" Individuals ' mobility will be hampered due to their inability to sell their houses , " Fleming said .
" That makes the labor market more ' sticky ' because people wo n't be able to move as easily for jobs out of their home areas . "
Zillow also looked at all homes that changed hands in the past 12 months to see how many were sold at a loss .
It found that 46.68 of all Bay Area homes were sold for less than the last recorded transaction .
The number ranges from 17.2 percent being sold at a loss in San Francisco to 62 percent in Solano County .
A significant number of the homes sold at a loss were foreclosures , but they also include short sales - homes sold for less than is owed on the mortgage - and homes where the homeowner had a lot of equity because they had made a big down payment , for instance .
TORONTO , Jan. 6 ( UPI ) -- A Toronto - area man who won $ 135,000 on four scratch - off lottery tickets has been told they were printing mistakes , and he wo n't be given the prizes .
Thomas Noftall , 27 , told the Toronto Sun he scratched the four tickets on New Years 's Eve and was ecstatic to see his winnings .

He contacted the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. in Toronto by telephone , and a claims representative said he would be paid , but that he had to come to the lottery headquarters , the Sun said .
That 's when Noftall 's luck turned sour .
" One guy pulled me into his office and said , ' Between me and you , they 're going to void your tickets .
They 're not going to pay , ' " Noftall told the newspaper .
A lottery spokesman told the Sun there were 1,000 misprinted tickets distributed throughout the province .
Noftall did n't disclose his intentions concerning the tickets .
" I 've gone from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in the past few days , " he said .

EIDOS are suffering – they have had some pretty bad news about Tomb Raider ( one of their favourite games ) as it has become pretty clear that the world has had just about enough of Lara Croft .
But wait a minute , EIDOS have decided they have n’t had enough of Lara Croft and instead of giving her an arguably due memorial and shed a goodbye tear , they have decided to look at how they can give her a makeover and reinvent the whole Tomb Raider package .
Apparently poor sales figures are n’t good enough for EIDOS to move on from The Croft as the chief financial officer of EIDOS , Robert Brent , announced that , “ We need to look at everything as we develop the next game .
Look at how Batman changed successfully , from the rather sad character of the Michael Keaton era to the noir style of The Dark Knight . ”
Maybe that is just the angle that EIDOS should be taking .
Batman went downhill from Keaton to Kilmer to an all time low with Clooney , but now Bale ’s Batman has turned the joke into a legend all over again .
But let ’s be honest , we ’re talking about two different mediums here , video gaming and film .
The two do n’t exactly work together hand in hand , as many crappy games have proven .
Whatever happens EIDOS needs to do something .
The company ’s share prices took a 30 per cent dive last week as Christmas sales results came in and showed that sale for the Tomb Raider latest version , Underworld , had not sold as many copies as EIDOS had hoped .
EIDOS have been quoted as saying that they are not worried about the uneventful sales figures , stating that they have pinned all love and hope to the coming release of their Batman game .
Still , the company has now announced that they are looking at changing Lara Croft and reinventing her whole world .
There is even talk of making Miss Croft a little more family friendly and it is being said that one of the first operations that she must undergo is a little breast reduction .
Another change for Lara is that perhaps the developers might look at giving her slightly more clothing .
The BBC claims that the gaming developer behind Lara Croft “ is considering revising the look and play of her Tomb Raider adventures , which may see efforts to make her more female - friendly . ”
However , EIDOS have remained extremely tight lipped on the subject , clearly wanting to give absolutely nothing away .
The failing success of Lara Croft has caused 30 job cuts at EIDOS and has put the company into disarray .
Amongst those who have lost their jobs is the creative director of the company , Eric Lindstrom .
EIDOS have spoken out about the job cuts , claiming that the company has had to start focusing more on the success of Lara Croft .
EIDOS said , “ We have increased the focus on the Tomb Raider franchise at Crystal Dynamics , regrettably this has resulted in the reduction in headcount . ”

Beating someone over Xbox Live usually results in nothing more than a string of expletives , but some users are reporting that they 're now getting kicked off the network by sore losers using a denial - of - service attack , which bombards your Internet connection with bogus data until it drops out .
Worse still , hackers are selling DOS on demand to disgruntled players , the BBC News reported today .
That means anyone with a few bucks and a lack of morals can attack players who are simply too good at Street Fighter IV .
In a statement given to Ars Technica on Friday , a Microsoft representative responded by saying , " In our continued effort to help provide a safer and more secure experience for our community of more than 17 million members , we are investigating reports involving the use of malicious software tools that an attacker could use to try and disrupt an Xbox Live player 's Internet connection . "
" This problem is not related to the Xbox Liveservice , but to the player 's internet connection , " the representative added .
" The attacker could also attempt disrupt other internet activities such as streaming video or web browsing using the same tools . "
Fair enough .
Since Xbox
Live games connect to the Internet like everything else , using an IP address , it 's possible for hackers to discover your address using underground packet - sniffing software , then flood the Xbox port with incoming data to boot you off .
Other offenders are reportedly asking for an IP address by sneaky means before opening the denial - of - service floodgates .
More disturbing , however , is that the uninitiated are paying skilled hackers to set up the whole process for them , to be run anytime they feel like being nasty , and thereby inflating the number of attacks .
The BBC said these services go for a one - time fee of $ 20 .
The immediate solution to avoid reoccurring attacks would be to refresh your IP address , but it 's only a matter of time before a persistent pest decides to try again .
In that case , Microsoft says to call your ISP to report an incident , and hopefully , get heightened security .
The company did not say how often these attacks occur , only that it is looking into the matter and banning any malicious offenders from Xbox Live .

Will loan guarantees suffice , or will it need to partially nationalize the brand ?
It 's an issue that could end up shaking the country 's economic system to its core .

This past summer , Steven Chu , the Nobel Prize - winning physicist who currently heads Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory — and who has been tapped to be the next Secretary of Energy — delivered a talk on climate change and how to combat it .
Consider , Chu said , the refrigerator .
Refrigerators consume a lot of energy ; all alone , they account for almost fifteen per cent of the average home ’s electricity use .
In the mid nineteen - seventies , California — the state Chu now lives in — set about establishing the country ’s first refrigerator - efficiency standards .
Refrigerator manufacturers , of course , fought them .
The standards could n’t be met , they said , at anything like a price consumers could afford .
California imposed the standards anyway , and then what happened , as Chu observed , is that “ the manufacturers had to assign the job to the engineers , instead of to the lobbyists . ”
The following decade , standards were imposed for refrigerators nationwide .
Since then , the size of the average American refrigerator has increased by more than ten per cent , while the price , in inflation - adjusted dollars , has been cut in half .
Meanwhile , energy use has dropped by two - thirds .
The transition to more efficient fridges , Chu pointed out , has saved the equivalent of all the energy generated in the United States by wind turbines and solar cells .
“ I can not impress upon you how important energy efficiency is , ” he said .
Chu is an inspired choice to lead the Energy Department , but he ’s clearly going to have his work cut out for him .
Among the many groups that have failed to absorb the lessons of the refrigerator are Congress and its new ward , the American auto industry .
The same day that word of Chu ’s appointment began to leak out , Congress backed away from a provision of the auto - bailout package that would have forced the automakers to abide by new efficiency standards that California — once again — is trying to set .
California ’s Clean Car rules would require vehicles sold in the state to become roughly twenty per cent more efficient by 2020 .
The U.S. automakers have been fighting the standards in court for years .
Some drafts of the bailout bill would have forced them to drop these lawsuits in return for federal assistance ; the Bush Administration , however , said that it would not agree to any package with that provision .
At this point , it looks like the legislation does n’t have enough votes in the Senate to pass .
But the saga is n’t over .
Even if the measure is approved , Congress will almost certainly have to return to the issue next year , as the money in it — fourteen billion dollars — falls far short of what nearly every knowledgeable source says is needed to keep the automakers out of bankruptcy .
One can only hope that , by that point , Chu has had more success getting his message out .
If taxpayers are going to foot the bill for the automakers , at the very least their dollars ought to be going to the engineers , instead of to the lobbyists .

I ’m in therapy .
A lot of therapy .
I see a therapist for my personal issues ( binge drinking and rage being just two of my many problems ) .
And the girlfriend and I see a couple ’s counselor for our relationship issues ( she does n’t vocalize her feelings and I think my penis is too large ) .
And I wonder – are my therapists legitimately interested in my problems ?
Most of the time when I work , I ’m just going through the motions for a paycheck .
I ’ve had quite a few writing assignments where I cranked out uninspired genre films in order to collect my delivery money .
Right now , I ’m getting paid for this blog post and I could n’t care less about it .
So it ’s quite conceivable that my therapists sit there , listening to me ramble on about how my parents never loved me , bored out of their minds , passing time until they can collect my fee .
But the problem comes in that I ’m talking about what ’s wrong with me so much – to my friends , to my girlfriend , to two therapists now – that even I ’m sick of my crap .
I ’ll find myself in the middle of a heartwrenching story about how my dad almost punched out a bus driver at LAX and my worry that I ’m inheriting those same anger issues , and I ’ll start to tune out .
I ’ll forget if I covered this in personal therapy or brought it up to my girlfriend before .
And that ’s odd .
I ’m at least as self - centered as anyone else .
It ’s why I became a writer .
It takes a certain amount of misplaced self - confidence ( the Jews call it “ chutzpah ” ) to believe that not only do other people want to read or watch what you scribble down , but that they should pay you for the privilege of doing so .
So I ’ve started making up new problems off the top of my head .
I ’ll go into therapy and tell my doc that I tried heroin for the first time .
In recounting the latest fight my significant other and I had to my best friend , I ’ll mention that I cheated on her with a Mexican transsexual .
It tests my improv skills , and I can tell when people are paying attention .
Plus , it ’s far more interesting than my real , stale problems .

The year is 1982 and Star Trek is all but finished — the first Star Trek movie was a disaster of bland storytelling and had no life at all .
Yet Paramount decides to take a chance and allows Nicholas Meyer to direct Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan .
To be blunt about it :
The movie was so damn good that not only did it turn the film series into a franchise — but it ’s now over 25 years later and there have been four additional series and a new set of films in the works .
A huge part of that is due to the screen performance of Ricardo Montalbán ( November 25 , 1920 – January 14 , 2009 ) .
Firstly in 1982 to all of America he was known as Mr. Roarke from Fantasy Island — and maybe lesser known for selling automobiles that featured “ soft Corinthian leather ” .
Meyer could have cast anyone for the part , but the fanboy in him ( and God bless him for doing it ) made him go back to Montalbán .
In fact it was Montalbán ’s performance in the original 1967 episode of Space Seed that played a role in him coming up with the story in the first place .
We now live in the 21st Century which is after well after a race of genetic superman were suppose to have driven Earth to the brink of World War III .
Clearly this notion is laughable ( and it was in 1982 ) yet Montalbán made it believable .
If you look at the 1967 episode Khan Noonien Singh is still a young man at heart — yet Montalbán was able to take that very same character and transform him into something much bigger .
The brilliance of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan is that it is a retelling of the classic novel Moby Dick — and that worked perfectly with William Shatner ’s over the top acting style which Nicholas Meyer brought out and encouraged instead of playing down .
And the reason that Shatner ’s performance is still memorable with fanboys yelling KHANNNNN !!!!
all these years later is that Montalbán was also playing his role over the top — and damn it but it was brilliant to watch on the silver screen .
But what makes that performance so amazing is that if you look at every other role that Montalbán played they were always latin lover characters who were laid back and smooth , which makes his performance as the ultimate foil all the more amazing .
The other thing that made that role believable was that the character had a backstory which was already known to fans walking into the theater .
So many Star Trek films ( and Star Wars and James Bond films ) bring in the bad guy for one movie and then kill him off — the Darth Maul effect if you will .
This never works well with the audience because in less than two hours they never get to know the character on any level .
Yet Montalbán took this backstory and made you slightly sympathize with his plight —
Kirk just left him on that damn planet and his wife was killed .
Montalbán was brilliant because he was making you root for the Moby Dick over the beloved crew that you grew up with .
A cinematic performance well done sir …
' Unknown sources ' helped post ex-BART cop 's $ 3 million bail Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday February 7 , 2009

The killer of 22 - year - old Oscar Grant is out of jail .
During a crowded Jan. 30 hearing , Alameda County Superior Court Judge Morris Jacobson set Mehserle 's bail at $ 3 million .
Exactly one week later , Mehserle has posted that amount through the help of a bail bond company and " unknown sources . "
" ' We dont know who paid it , ' said JD Nelson , spokesman with the Alameda County Sheriffs Office said Friday , " in a report by the San Francisco Examiner .
" ' We only know that it was issued through a bondsman . ' "
" Typically , defendants using bail bonds companies must pay 10 percent of their bail in addition to having collateral worth the same as the bail , " noted Mercury News .
Mehserle 's freedom comes seven days after it was announced that an outside agency would take over the shooting investigation , displacing BART Police Chief Gary Gee after he circulated a memo describing how BART employees might go about sending money and material comforts to Mehserle .
" Mehserle 's release came the same day as some of those arrested in protests were arraigned in Oakland , " reports the San Francisco Chronicle .
" As he was driving from the jail , several dozen protesters were gathering at Frank Ogawa Plaza for a march down Broadway with a heavy police escort . "
An early January protest triggered by Grant 's slaying turned violent , resulting in over 100 arrests , injuries and vandalism .
Mehserle , who had been in police custody since Jan. 13 , pleaded not guilty to the murder of Oscar Grant .
Court documents filed by his attorney indicate the officer 's defense will claim the killing unintentional :
That Mehserle intended to draw and fire his Taser at Grant , not his firearm .
Grant 's killing was was captured on camera by numerous civilian bystanders .
In the videos , Grant is clearly pinned by two officers and completely immobile .
Then , without any apparent provocation , Mehserle draws his weapon and fires a single round into Grant 's lower back , the bullet ricocheting off the concrete and into the victim 's lung .
Grant died in a hospital several hours later .
" John Burris , the attorney for Grants family , said he and Grants family hope there is no social unrest as a consequence of the former officer being released on bail , " notes the Examiner .
" 'I have spoken with the family about this , and they are disappointed about his release , ' he said .
' But they respect the constitution ... that was [ Mehserles ] call . ' "
A prior version of this story said the sources helped " pay " the bail , as opposed to help " post " it .

The long - awaited UN - backed trial of a former Khmer Rouge leader in Cambodia has opened at a Phnom Penh court , 30 years after the murderous regime fell .
Kaing Guek Eav - better known as Duch - was head of a notorious prison camp and is accused of presiding over the murder and torture of at least 15,000 inmates .
The trial is the result of a decade of painstaking and often ill - tempered negotiations , a BBC correspondent says .
People queued for hours to attend the hearing and see the ex-prison chief .
For the survivors , the opening day of the hearing offered the first opportunity to see a leading figure in the Khmer Rouge face justice .
WHO WERE THE KHMER ROUGE ?
Maoist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 - 1979 Founded and led by Pol Pot , who died in 1998 Abolished religion , schools and currency in a bid to create agrarian utopia
Up to two million people thought to have died from starvation , overwork or execution
In pictures : Cambodia tribunal
In quotes : Khmer Rouge trial Cambodians watch Khmer trial Presiding judge Nil Nonn said the first hearing represented " the realisation of significant efforts to establish a fair and independent tribunal to try those in leadership positions and those most responsible for violations of Cambodian and international law " .
But Francois Roux , for the defence , said it was " unacceptable "
Duch had been held without trial for more than nine years .
The first days are mainly procedural , with witness testimony expected to be heard only during hearings next month , says the BBC's South East Asia correspondent , Jonathan Head .
' Satisfaction '
Duch was driven by bulletproof car from a detention centre to the specially - built court - room .
Duch ( left ) ran a Khmer Rouge prison where almost all inmates were killed
He is one of five former Khmer Rouge leaders who will face trial and is unusual in that he has expressed regret for what he did , and asked the forgiveness of his victims .
He wanted another chance to express his remorse , Mr Roux told reporters .
" Duch wishes to ask forgiveness from the victims but also from the Cambodian people .
He will do so publicly .
This is the very least he owes the victims . "
The courtroom was packed with people , many of them survivors of the Khmer Rouge or relatives of victims of the regime .
" It was really amazing to see victims of Duch sitting there in front of him in a courtroom confronting their perpetrator of 30 years ago , " said Theary Seng , the director of the Centre for Social Development in Phnom Penh .
Her parents were killed by the Khmer Rouge and she spent five months in prison as a child .
" I 'm certain there was satisfaction and I 'm certain there was a large degree of empowerment , " she told the BBC .
' Killing fields '
Duch , a former teacher , was commander of the Tuol Sleng interrogation centre , also known as S - 21 , in the capital Phnom Penh for four years after the Khmer Rouge victory in 1975 .
He is accused of personally overseeing the systematic torture of more than 15,000 prisoners .
Those who survived the ordeal were sent for execution in the so - called " killing fields " .
KHMER ROUGE YET TO FACE TRIAL Khieu Samphan : former president Ieng Sary : foreign minister Ieng Thirith : minister for social affairs ( and wife of Iengy Sary ) Nuon Chea : chief ideologue
Brutal Khmer Rouge regime Key figures in Khmer Rouge Many of the inmates were loyal party members who were caught up in the frenzy of paranoid killing that accompanied the Khmer Rouge 's final months in power , our correspondent says .
Duch , 66 , has been in detention since 1999 , two years after he was discovered by a British photographer .
A born - again Christian , he is said to have co-operated with investigating judges - and is expected to reveal important information about the decisions made by the organisation 's leadership .
His information could help in the trials set for later this year of four other defendants , analysts say .
They include the surviving top leaders Nuon Chea , Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan , who are all elderly and in poor health .
All four have denied any knowledge of the atrocities that took place under their rule .
If preparations for their trials get bogged down , as seems likely , Duch may be the only man ever held to account for the Khmer Rouge atrocities , our correspondent adds .
Drawn - out negotiations
But the man most wanted for crimes against humanity in Cambodia will never be brought to justice .
Symbol of Khmer Rouge horror Pol Pot , the founder and leader of the Khmer Rouge , died in a camp along the border with Thailand in 1998 , the same year his few remaining guerrillas agreed to finally abandon their fight .
As many as two million people are thought to have died from starvation , overwork and execution as the Khmer Rouge emptied the cities to send people to work on collective farms during its four years in power .
Cambodia originally asked the United Nations and international community to help set up a tribunal into the genocide more than a decade ago .
A joint tribunal was finally set up in 2006 following long drawn - out negotiations between the Phnom Penh government and the UN .
Bail hearings , appeals and pre-trial procedures have contributed to further delays .

How Real Men Cook
Let ’s be honest – real men hate cooking .
Do n’t get me wrong – we like grilling , barbequing and marinating , hell ; we do n’t even mind occasionally boiling a pot of water .
But when it comes to aprons , whisks and words like ‘ béchamel ’ , ‘ demi-glace ’ or ‘ flambé ’ , we want no part of it .
Unfortunately for mankind everywhere , we get hungry .
In fact , we get really hungry several times a day .
Since a man ’s got to eat , we ’ve come up with a few creative ways you can cook some grub and still keep your manliness intact .
After all , we do n’t care how it ’s cooked as long as we can eat it .
1 ) Iron Grilled Cheese
Somewhere along the line , we ’re sure a friend , a girlfriend or your mom gave you an iron .
We suggest taking it out of the box , dusting it off and putting it to good use making a classic grilled cheese sandwich .
Just make sure the steam setting is n’t on .
2 ) Torched Leftovers
Still got some Mushu pork from House of Hong leftover in the fridge ?
Grab the blowtorch , throw it in a non-plastic dish ( we ca n’t stress this part enough ) and give that take - out a good searing .
It ’s much cooler than using the microwave and who does n’t like a good excuse to play with fire ?
3 ) Electrofried Hot Dogs
Hot dogs are a staple in any man ’s home since they ’re so damn easy to cook .
You can boil ‘em , fry ‘em , grill ‘em and for the man who loves a dangerous challenge , you can electrocute ‘em , too .
All you need are few simple tools like a power cord and wire strippers , and you can enjoy a delicious hot dog and maybe even a 220 v shock .
4 ) Radiator Eggs
Every man likes eggs in the morning and that goes double if you ’re hung - over .
So when you wake up on a cold morning feeling like a bus hit you , turn up the heat and throw a pan of eggs on the radiator .
It ’s the ultimate in lazy cooking and if the radiator is next to your couch , you do n’t even have to get your hurting ass up .
5 ) Cooking with 500 Horsepower
One of man ’s most prized possessions is his car .
They ’re reliable , easy to fix and even help pick up the ladies , so it makes sense they can cook our grub too .
Whether you ’re taking a road trip with the guys or just feel like showing off , you can cook an entire steak and potato meal on your car ’s engine .
Dirt and grease wo n’t help the flavor so make sure you have some tin foil on hand .
6 ) Caveman Cooking
There is no more sacred or manly method of cooking food then over a roaring , open flame .
When the iron is broken and the car ’s in the shop , get in tune with your ancient cavemen and make a fire pit in your back yard .
Grab a lawn chair , open a cold one and you wo n’t even feel like you ’re cooking when the smell of the outdoors and charred beef hits your nostrils .
Bonus :
No meal is complete without a frothy brew to wash it down so for the ultimate beverage dispensing machine , hook up a keg of beer to your fridge ’s water dispenser .
This gentlemen , is what we like to call a ‘ culinary masterpiece ’ .

Introduction
Image viewers belong to a software category where the quantity and quality of free programs makes it difficult to select just one product as a top pick .
So , personal convenience will unavoidably appear as the ultimate factor for this review of free applications .
And there 's also the question of what exactly we mean by an image viewer .
Digital photography has become so widely available that most pictures these days will linger in a memory drive and will never be printed , because we can visualize them on screens .
As a consequence , hundreds of tools are developed for the task , ranging from the ones that offer just the most basic handling to others with loads of features nobody will ever use .
However , nowadays ' average users are likely to demand some additional capabilities apart from the simple viewing and browsing functions .
Thus , many imaging applications overlap categories and we have a perfect example in photo organizers , where a viewer is obviously needed to manage picture collections .
Therefore , the key points for this review should be based mainly on the aspects of loading speed , image quality , zooming capabilities , sorting options and other operations not directly related to image editing , tagging or organizing , although this is a definite advantage in most cases like the current Editors ' Choice and a few competitors .
But no program is perfect and if you need to make certain changes to your photos , you might find yourself using more than one app at the same time to meet specific requirements .
JPG is the most widely used file format for images today because of its quality / size ratio and is supported by every viewer I know of .
Actually , it 's the only file type allowed by some of them unless you pay for extras .
Though it is quite old and others seem to do the job better , it has managed to prevail overwhelmingly , both online and in digicams .
But there 's a steadily increasing amount of people who shoot RAW in their quest for better image quality .
Unfortunately , most camera manufacturers use their proprietary RAW formats , of course not supported by the others .
Then , after being processed , those files are usually saved as TIF or other lossless formats , including Adobe DNG , Photoshop PSD , etc .
On the other hand , we need a way to view those PNG or GIF files we download from the Internet occasionally .
Therefore , compatibility is a point which can't be overlooked , since we have a variety of files that our ideal program should handle for viewing — and possibly converting them , too — without having to open a different application for each or the specific software bundled with the camera .
Perhaps the most important feature anyone could require from a viewer is an acceptable speed when loading and displaying images .
In my opinion , any program that needs over 1 second to display JPGs like the ones produced by an average modern camera or smartphone is not worth the time to download and install it nor the disk space it takes .
Note that file size ( in bytes ) as well as image dimensions ( in pixels ) all have an influence on speed , and hardware is another important factor .
Obviously , the better your machine , the better the performance and loading times .
Some of these programs support video viewing , either by using their own player or your system 's default player .
The subject goes beyond the scope of this review , but I 'll say you must have the proper codecs for the various video formats installed on your computer and this might be somewhat tricky to get done because you 'll have to download and set up additional plug-ins , codec packs or even a separate application sometimes .
Full HD , 4 K and certain video formats usually require a lot of processing power to be displayed .
The articles Understanding Codecs and Best Free Media Player are good readings to learn more .

I 've tested a large number of other viewing applications ( too many to be mentioned ) , but none of them made it to the top .
Our readers have suggested many of those .
When this is the case , I usually post a reply in the comments section with my reasons .
Maybe your favorite program has already been discarded here , but feel free to submit any product you think might deserve a try .
But please , try it yourself before and tell me what you like about it , instead of just posting a link .
We have a lot of good apps here already , maybe too many for a readable article .
Sometimes letting ones in and others out feels like splitting hairs .
There are many decent ones out there and even Windows ' built - in viewer performs acceptably when browsing through average images , although it is so limited .
Now that everybody has lots of photos to deal with , one would expect some improvements in Microsoft 's viewing app over the old W98 and XP in the successive OS 's , but it 's been very disappointing to find out neither Vista nor Windows 7 , 8 or 10 were significantly better for the task so many years later , and such a bleak background is another spur for software developers .
This article is going to be lengthy but it would n't be fair to end the review without mentioning some other freebies that offer quite remarkable features .
( Thanks to everyone who let me know about them . )
Users who just want a very simple replacement for the default Windows photo viewer have a good alternative with Pictus ( thanks to mrin for the suggestion ) , kind of what could be called a " pure viewer " .
I used to recommend ACDSee Free for this position , mainly because of its impressive speed , but it has been discontinued , although it can still be found at several download sites .
Anyway , Pictus has a few better features than ACDS , apart from being practically just as fast , and that 's a lot to say !
It displays pictures nearly instantaneously , no matter the image size , without needing lots of processing power , which makes it perfect for use in low - end computers .
Even hard files like those huge PSDs or LZW - compressed TIFs are shown in a breeze , when they are usually a pain for other viewers to open .
The interface is clean and the backdrop color can be customized in the settings menu , along with mouse behavior , rendering algorithm and a few other options .
Since the program has no menu bar nor icons , it 's operated mainly by right clicking and selecting the functions from the context menu , but it 's quite user - friendly because there are n't many of them and they 're clearly understandable .
These include ( very ) basic sorting , picture orientation , renaming , wallpaper , and adjustments for brightness , contrast or gamma .
You can use a few shortcuts , too .
It supports 11 common formats , including animated GIF and PSD ( no RAW ) , and adds the interesting ability to show their respective thumbnails in Windows Explorer , which is a very nice plus that might make some people ( myself included ) install the program even if they wo n't be using it .
Besides , it can be made portable by placing a .ini file in the same folder as the main executable .
Pictus has a few drawbacks , however .
It 's just a sequential viewer like many others and it relies on Windows Explorer to access folders and files .
No thumbnails or image lists are provided within the program and that means a limited navigation experience .
I miss some more customization and an inexplicably lacking option to sort images by file type , apart from being able to use the arrows on the keyboard to browse through pictures without having to press the Alt key .
Being a " pure viewer " , no changes or adjustments such as orientation or brightness can be made permanent because the program does not allow to save the modified files as any format whatsoever .
On the contrary , those adjustments are always kept from one image to another and to the rest of them when browsing and they have to be reset manually ; this may be convenient or not , but there should be an option to control that behavior .
Another personal inconvenience is that the Esc key always closes the program .
Apart from that , it seems the program has n't been updated in a long time .
Nevertheless , many users will consider these drawbacks as minor because what they really want is simplicity and good speed .
Pictus is a champion at both .
Simplicity and speed are also key features in a very nice program called Nexus Image .
This one was suggested by one of our readers ( choifamilyipad ) and it has turned out to be probably the most appealing of all the " simple " viewers to me because of its outstanding image quality and beautiful interface .
Its opacity and color can be changed and a vertical thumbnail strip on the right makes browsing easier than in most other simple apps , where a linear previous / next file navigation must be followed .
Folders are quickly accessed by double clicking the viewing window , selecting one from the tree and opening an image .
Then you can use the functions either by right clicking and selecting them from the context menu or by means of conventional shortcuts , although mouse wheel zooming requires pressing Ctrl .
Captions can be added to pictures , it can show EXIF information , supports common formats ( not RAW , but does PSD and animated GIF ) , is available in many languages , has a light footprint on your system and is fully portable , with just a 2 MB download .
On the downside , being so simple means there are n't many features to talk about ( " Nothing to say .
It 's just a simple image viewer ! " , in its dev's words ) .
I miss some of them in particular , namely some kind of sorting options for the thumbnails , basic cropping , and permanent rotation applied to pics , as it is just temporary with this software .
Again , if you 're used to pressing Escape to close a fullscreen view of an image in other viewers , then you 'll find it a personal annoyance in Nexus , because doing so here closes the program with no prompt and you just can't help pushing the damn key ...
Well , anyway , that 's something you can live with , I guess .
And this program is worth the trouble .
Honeyview , suggested by our reader Pliskin , is also one of those simple viewers sparing in features and focused on the basic viewing experience .
It has a pleasant interface and a small set of intuitive controls for navigation .
Most functions are accessed via right - click menu or keyboard shortcuts , and you can configure up to seven hotkeys to your liking .
There are a few basic sorting options available and a slideshow mode .
You will love its great speed even with big files and formats such as PSD or LZW - compressed TIF , which the majority of viewing programs take longer to open .
Its image quality is also wonderful and RAW files are beautifully rendered if you choose not to display the embedded JPG , although this method is obviously slower .
What is not slow at all is the rendering of images using the ICC color profile they may have attached ; this is a remarkable aspect where nearly all the competitors are extremely weak , even the top ranking ones .
Quite a lot of settings can be tweaked to fit your preferences , including background colors , mouse buttons ' behavior , etc .
The wheel can apply zoom in 10 or 1 percent steps .
It supports 15 common file types ( including animated GIF , which you can visualize frame by frame ) as well as the main RAW formats , and is able to view images directly from compressed files without extracting them .
It works on Win XP through W10 ( 32 - and 64 - bit ) and a portable version is available .
The drawbacks are very few , assuming that the program is sparing in features .
There 's a thumbnail strip that shows a small preview but it 's inside a menu and the design is awkward , as it wo n't let you click on a thumbnail to open the image .
There are just two editing functions : rotate and resize , both sharing the same panel under the ' Convert ' heading .
The output conversion can only be saved as JPG or PNG .
There 's no cropping whatsoever nor a desirable TIF output that would be really handy to save the program 's nice rendition of RAW files .
When you are browsing , any eventual rotation is just temporary , but if you use the rotation commands , whatever pics you display after that will appear rotated , a peculiar all - or - nothing approach .
Anyway , you can always set the preferences to autorotate based on EXIF info .
Xlideit is the fancy name of another product that can be included in that somewhat blurry category of " simple " viewers ( thanks to Bhat59 for the suggestion ) .
I guess such a name is a pun for its ability to go to the next or previous file in the folder when you click on a picture and slide it left or right .
It 's fast enough and very user - friendly .
The first time you open the program it presents you with the settings , which are quite a lot and let you customize such aspects as window transparency , background color , mouse behavior , zoom options , thumbnail size and position , toolbars , slideshow , etc. , although the default ones are perfectly good to go .
If you 've read this article so far , it should be evident by now that having thumbnails available is one of my favorite features for a good browsing experience .
Xlideit has a thumbnail strip at the bottom of the window by default , though it can be placed on either side or set to auto mode , when it will just pop up with a touch of the mouse .
Likewise , a built - in folder tree is another useful item to have and there 's one here , saving us unnecesary clicks to find a desired folder .
Right - click menus are very complete too and most functions can be accessed this way or by means of icons .
I also like that resizable detached zoom window , a very interesting concept that could be considered as the reverse of the navigator that is found in many imaging programs , where a little rectangle moving over a reduced version encloses the portion of the picture that you 've zoomed into in the main window .
Xlideit does the opposite : you have the whole image in the main window and the zoomed version in the detached view , and moving the mouse around shows the corresponding section blown up .
Of course , you can also use the zoom in the main window , and even with animated GIFs and videos !
The most common image formats are supported , along with video , audio and several document formats with text and pictures , and they can be sorted in many different ways .
Image files can also be rotated , resized and cropped , and this can be done in a batch .
In addition , it 's very lightweight and portable .
Although I have n't found many inconveniences in Xlideit , as a power user the main drawback for me is what it can't do , but this is something not applicable to unpretentious average users who just want a simple way to browse through their photos .
Some of the few flaws include the following : no RAW or PSD formats are supported , zooming out wo n't go further than the ' fit to window ' size until you write the exact percentage inside the zoom widget ( this one is not the same as the zoom window mentioned earlier ) , the delete button erases files with no prompt ( they are sent to the recycle bin , fortunately ) , the Esc key always exits the program , and I miss a quick way to access a previously visited folder .
As you can see , these are very minor drawbacks and then whether you like the program or not is just a matter of personal taste .
Oh yes , and it's only available in English , but if you 're reading this , it wo n't be a problem , I guess .
One of our former anonymous users suggested cam2pc and , after giving it a try , it has proved to be an excellent program in many aspects .
As the name suggests , cam2 pc provides a handy way to download pictures and videos from your digicam to your drives , allowing you to use lots of options for renaming , saving , etc. , and has specific support for the widely used Canon EOS cameras ( separate download ) .
The interface is intuitive and easy to use , with a folder and thumbnail view that resembles FastStone .
As with this , I recommend to turn the preview panel off , though thumbnail generation is really fast .
Actually , speed is outstanding in almost every aspect of this app .
The feature that impressed me most was its ability to quickly display LZW - compressed TIFs , something unusual in its competitors , although these perform better with Photoshop PSDs .
The only reason why I do n't include cam2 pc along with the top programs is that the freeware version lacks quite a lot of features that can only be found in its commercial sibling and which the others offer for free .
But I guess most users could perfectly do without those .
Imagine is a very fast viewer vaguely resembling Irfan in its simplistic interface , though the number of features is lower .
Wheel zooming also needs pressing the Ctrl key .
Several instances of the program can be open at the same time , it lets you customize various mouse modes with different configurations and select any of them instantaneously to fit your workflow , allows frame extraction from animations , reads inside zip , rar and 7z archives , has multilanguage support , 64 - bit versions , and is portable .
On the downside , it 's quite limited in other areas ; for instance , the editing and batch processing options .
No RAW or video formats are supported .
Sometimes a few Photoshop PSD files can't be read and an ' out of memory ' message appears when trying to open them , irrespective of their size and my lots of free RAM and processing power .
But the app is an AWSOME performer with the PSDs that load properly and displays them nearly instantaneously once the thumbnail has been generated ; an outstanding feature that not many viewers , free or commercial , can boast .
Picture Information Extractor Free ( PIE ) comes to this article after Panzer 's suggestion and because it has nearly everything I think a viewer must have .
Anyway , the developers insist mainly on the ability to visualize all the metadata embedded in pictures , which is undoubtedly another way of viewing them .
EXIF , IPTC , XMP , keywords and other data are conveniently shown on a pane to the right of the screen when a file is selected .
The main interface also displays a folder tree with a preview pane and the files can be sorted in various types of lists or thumbnails .
The features include wheel zooming in fullscreen view , custom thumbnail size , powerful search , excellent import options , wonderful renaming capabilities , it reads RAW and PSD formats , deletes RAW +JPG files with one click , supports color management and has good image quality .
As an outstanding plus , PIE is one of the very few programs that can rotate RAW files permanently and for some users this feature alone would make it worth the installation .
On the other side , this free version of PIE cannot save any changes to the metadata , which is the only cut compared to the commercial one , but quite significant .
There are also a couple of flaws in important areas such as speed or zoom .
No problem when you 're surfing through average JPGs , TIFs , etc. , but it takes some time to even change directories and access a folder full of big RAWs , and then another while to display each file in full screen .
The zoom can't reach pixel level and , along with pan , it 's a bit sloppy .
Moreover , the wheel turn for zooming in or out works in the opposite way to the rest of viewers I 've tried so far .
I miss animated GIF support as well .
But many users wo n't even notice these drawbacks .
Although their names look nearly identical , Imagina has nothing to do with Imagine , reviewed above .
Actually , that 's where similarities end .
This application ( ' a next - generation image viewer and editing tool ' , the developers claim ) is a good representative of newer trends in this category , which pay greater attention to " fancy " interfaces and presentations to improve user experience .
The main drawback with this is the usually high resource consumption and graphics card requirements .
Imagina is a perfect example of the new concepts based around 3 - D simulation , but much lighter on resources than others of this kind .
Browsing speed is n't as fast either , even compared to " normal " viewers , and this is especially noticeable with bigger files .
For instance , when opening some 18 - megapixel JPGs the program clearly stays behind the top performers , though this should n't be an issue with most users .
There may be some things I really miss ( more customization for certain basic aspects , a built - in folder tree , support for PSDs , more straightforward management of some files like TIFF , etc. ) and many other reasons why my workflow as a photographer wo n't fit what Imagina proposes .
But photo pros are only a few among the vast lot of digicam users who just shoot JPG .
And these will love it !
User experience is excellent and no other viewer I 've seen shows that image quality or that zoom and pan smoothness .
Both 2 - D and 3 - D graphics are amazing and even videos can be watched in this environment ( with zooming and panning ! ) .
It offers state - of - the - art RAW support by using David Coffin 's DCRAW along with its own algorithms , top quality editing functions , real color management and other useful tools .
So many good things make it at least a must - try .
( Requires . NET 3.0 or higher )
But the problem is that Imagina 's development has been discontinued .
Since it is an outstanding app , I 'll keep it here for a while linking to the alternative download from Softpedia .
After some debate in the comments section , I decided to mention FastPictureViewer , but just because of one single feature .
This product claims to be ( and it might be ) the fastest viewer ever , especially indicated for quick browsing and culling .
It uses hardware to speed things up and requires a lot of system resources and graphic capabilities .
It has a nice interface as well .
Anyway , the program offers very few functions once the initial trial period expires and actually becomes limited to viewing JPGs and not much more than screening and tagging .
It does support full color space awareness , though , and the unbeatable speed is a very strong argument in its favor .
Finally , one of our site users , Mythril , suggested two programs which work with a very different approach , but with a special focus on speed .
These are Vjpeg and Osiva .
I 'll just quote Mythril 's comments because they are right on spot ( original 06/02/09 ) : " Both work by opening images in a borderless window that you can drag around and zoom in / out at will , practically without any lag , and you can open as many images as you want at the same time .
Both programs load very quickly , but do n't have any features to speak of .
Another drawback is that there does n't even seem to be a way to cycle through images in a directory ...
Osiva is slightly better in that you can easily drag and drop a bunch of images and have it open all of them for a superquick overview " .
I 'll add they support very few file formats and feel a bit awkward to use precisely because they 're so different .
Another reader , Bziur , also put forward First Impression , which works in a similar way without an apparent interface , just by using right - click menus and offering pretty much just what the name of the program suggests .

BOEHNER ….
In the first weekly Republican radio address under the new administration , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) touted the GOP ’s vision for an economic recovery .
“ Our plan is rooted in the philosophy that we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity , ” Boehner stated .
The minority leader said the package authored by congressional Democrats was “ chock - full of government programs and projects , ” noting a Congressional Budget Office report that projected less than half of the $ 355 billion that House Democrats would spend to create jobs through infrastructure programs and other efforts is likely to be used before the end of fiscal 2010 .
Let ’s see , where to start .
First , the CBO report Boehner is so fond of does n’t really exist .
Second , Boehner has supported nothing but “ borrow and spend ” policies since the moment he arrived in Congress , which helps explain his votes in support of budgets that produced the largest deficits in American history .
Third , if the administration and the congressional majority listened to Boehner and relied on weak - stimulus tax cuts to improve the economy , is n’t that necessarily a “ borrow and spend ” policy ?
And if tax cuts were the magic bullet , and Bush and Boehner cut taxes over the last eight years , should n’t the economy be in great shape ?
( Indeed , it ’s this thinking that led the National Republican Congressional Committee to argue , as recently as yesterday , “ Thanks to Republican economic policies , the U.S. economy is robust and job creation is strong . ” )
And fourth , of course the Democratic plan is “ chock - full of government programs and projects . ”
That ’s the point .

December 22 , 2008
WMR has learned from knowledgeable sources in Ohio that Republican Party computer networking guru Mike Connell was warned not to fly in anonymous warnings conveyed to principals in the ongoing federal civil lawsuit of King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v.
Blackwell , stemming from GOP - engineered vote fraud in the 2004 Ohio presidential election , as well as a potential Ohio racketeer - influenced criminal organization ( RICO ) criminal proceeding against former Bush White House aide Karl Rove and Blackwell , in the conspiracy to illegally steer Ohio ’s 20 electoral votes to the Bush column in 2004 .
Connell ’s Piper Saratoga single - engine plane crashed during the evening of December 19 in Uniontown , Ohio , as it was preparing to land at Akron - Canton airport .
There were no other passengers and Connell was killed in the crash .
Connell had flown to College Park , Maryland , the previous day .
Connell , who lived in Akron with his wife Heather and four children , often flew to Washington for activities related to his IT businesses .
Connell ’s name surfaced as a key player in Rove ’s election fraud conspiracy after this year ’s July 17 Columbus news conference hosted by Cliff Arnebeck , the Ohio attorney who has been representing plaintiffs in the federal civil suit against former Republican Secretay of State J. Kenneth Blackwell .
On the phone at the conference was John McCain campaign adviser and computer security specialist Stephen Spoonamore who identified Connell as a key player , as well as potential trial witness , in the GOP ’s conspiracy to flip Ohio votes in the 2004 election .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Spoonamore and Connell had reportedly worked together on foreign elections in programs sponsored by the International Republican Institute ( ISI ) and the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) .
Both had traveled abroad together on special election projects to ensure “ fair voting ” procedures .
For the first time , WMR has learned that the GOP vote flipping conspiracy was in place earlier than the November 2004 general election and was used to deny votes to Democratic candidates John Edwards and Dennis Kucinich in the March 2 , 2004 , Democratic primary .
John Kerry won the primary with 52 percent of the vote to 34 percent for Edwards and 9 percent for Kucinich .
After Connell was identified as a potential witness in the civil case against Blackwell and a possible criminal Ohio RICO case against Rove , Blackwell , and perhaps others , the plaintiff attorneys received a tip from a high - level source in the McCain presidential campaign that Rove had issued a threat against Connell .
Connell had worked for the 2008 McCain presidential campaign on the development of its web pages .
WMR has learned from our Ohio sources that five threats against Connell were conveyed to the election fraud plaintiff attorneys with the last tip being “ Connell is in danger . ”
One of the threats reportedly made by Rove to Connell was that Connell could forget about a pardon from President George W. Bush if he did not “ take the fall ” in the event criminal charges were brought and that his wife Heather , who was used as a majority stockholder for one of Connell ’s web design companies , GovTech Solutions , would be prosecuted for illegal lobbying .
Connell ’s other company is New Media Communications , Inc .
Wayne Madsen
We have also learned that one additional tip was relayed to Connell ’s wife and it was to the effect that Connell “ was in danger and he should not fly his plane . ”
Connell ’s firms received contracts to place its servers behind the House of Representatives firewall courtesy of then - House Administration Committee Chairman Bob Ney ( R - OH ) , later jailed for his role in the Jack Abramoff lobbying - influence peddling scandal .
Connell also designed and ran the web sites for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee .
WMR has learned that through effective GOP control of these web sites , the Bush White House was able to monitor all committee e-mails and documents , including planning documents for House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
We have also learned that Connell ’s IT firm did classified web site development work for the CIA .
Based on the threats against Connell , the federal judge hearing the civil suit King Lincoln v. Blackwell , conveyed to Connell that the court would protect him if he came forward .
On October 17 , 2008 , Connell ’s attorneys attempted to quash an October 8 , 2008 , plaintiff subpoena for his court appearance .
On October 31 , U.S. Judge Solomon
Oliver denied the motion to quash the subpoena and ordered Connell ’s deposition to proceed on November 3 , the day before Election Day .
WMR has learned that on Friday , October 31 , Connell was nervous and “ beet red ” during the hearing to quash the subpoena .
On Monday , November 3 , Connell was composed and it is believed that his top shelf law firm had been selected by Rove to represent Connell for the deposition .
Rove ’s intent was to ensure that there would be no deposition from Connell before the November 4 election .
WMR has also learned that Connell was prepared to testify before the House Judiciary Committee about the election fraud in Ohio and other states but that the offer of testimony was not acted upon senior staffers for House Judiciary Committee Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
A source in Columbus told us that some of Conyers ’ senior staffers on his committee and in is office are not to be trusted on issues related to election fraud .
In addition , Rove and the Bush White House attempted to forestall testimony by election officials in Mahoning County and Youngstown , Ohio , on election fraud in 2004 by promising to have former Rep. James Traficant ( D - OH ) , who is currently imprisoned after being convicted of corruption , released early in return for their silence .
Traficant is not scheduled for release from federal prison until Sept , 2 , 2009 .

The author in prison : worse than a bad review
“ IS THE truth , the truth ? ” asks the cover of “ Verisimilitude ” , a novel by Harry Nicolaides .
On January 19th a Thai criminal court ruled that it was a little too close for comfort .
Citing a paragraph in the book on the lurid private life of an unnamed crown prince , the court convicted its author of dishonouring Thailand 's royal family .
By the standards of the country 's lèse - majesté laws , Mr Nicolaides , an Australian , got off lightly .
He was sentenced to three years in jail , reduced from six years , after he pleaded guilty .
He is now seeking a royal pardon and deportation to Australia .
He will not be the last in the dock .
Police already have a bundle of lèse - majesté cases on the go .
A left - wing academic , Giles Ungpakorn , was charged this week for defaming the monarchy in a book on the coup in 2006 that deposed Thaksin Shinawatra , then prime minister .
Thailand 's new government says defending the crown is a priority .
Pirapan Salirathavibhaga , the justice minister , is creating a 24 - hour “ war - room ” to monitor online threats .
Thousands of websites have been blocked for alleged lèse - majesté , though anti-censorship groups say the net is cast wide to stifle political debate .
Some
Thai bloggers have been detained after posting rebellious comments .
The political background to this frenzy is hard to miss .
During last year 's protracted street rallies , a rowdy mob known as the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) pinned its royalist colours firmly to the mast .
It was rewarded , at a critical juncture , by the appearance by Queen Sirikit , wife of King Bhumibol , at the funeral of one of its supporters .
The subsequent change of government appeared to seal a royalist victory for the PAD and its blue - blooded backers .
A backlash may be brewing , though , and not just among Bangkok 's chattering classes .
Conventional wisdom holds that public reverence of Bhumibol , 81 , is genuine and deeply felt .
The same patently does not apply to the heir apparent , Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn .
Palace propagandists have struggled to burnish his image .
Indeed , private gossip on the foibles of royals has never been sharper .
Some intellectuals are pushing at the margins for freer speech .
A petition signed by 128 academics from several countries calls for charges against Mr Ungpakorn to be dropped .
But the biggest shift ( though the hardest to measure ) appears to be under way among ordinary Thais who are tiring of the royal charade .
Repressive laws may not be enough to stop a tidal wave of straight talk .
Amid this soul - searching , Mr Nicolaides makes for an unlikely martyr .
His self - published 2005 novel , a turgid English - language romance spiced with commentary on Thailand , sold fewer than ten copies .
Its author , a former lecturer at a Thai university , says that it was later withdrawn from circulation in Thailand , on the orders of the Ministry of Justice .
Case closed , or so he believed — until he was detained last August at Bangkok airport on a lèse - majesté charge .
He says he meant no offence to the monarchy and was unaware of the law .
He described his trial as an “ Alice in Wonderland ” experience .
Thais who run foul of the law can expect worse .
A female activist was sentenced in November to six years in jail for a speech at a rally in Bangkok .
A fellow speaker whose fiery digs at the crown were cheered by onlookers is awaiting trial .
Both have been denied bail , as was Mr Nicolaides .
If this were Myanmar , governments like Australia 's would line up to denounce the arbitrary use of archaic laws and defend the rights of dissidents .
Instead , it is meekly waiting for a royal pardon so it can spirit its citizen back home .

Let ’s be concrete here .
There ’s a reasonable chance  not a certainty  that Citi and BofA , together , will lose hundreds of billions over the next few years .
And their capital , the excess of their assets over their liabilities , is n’t remotely large enough to cover those potential losses .
Arguably , the only reason they have n’t already failed is that the government is acting as a backstop , implicitly guaranteeing their obligations .
But they ’re zombie banks , unable to supply the credit the economy needs .
To end their zombiehood the banks need more capital .
But they ca n’t raise more capital from private investors .
So the government has to supply the necessary funds .
But here ’s the thing : the funds needed to bring these banks fully back to life would greatly exceed what they ’re currently worth .
Citi and BofA have a combined market value of less than $ 30 billion , and even that value is mainly if not entirely based on the hope that stockholders will get a piece of a government handout .
And if it ’s basically putting up all the money , the government should get ownership in return .

Still , is n’t nationalization un-American ?
No , it ’s as American as apple pie .
Lately the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been seizing banks it deems insolvent at the rate of about two a week .
When the F.D.I.C. seizes a bank , it takes over the bank ’s bad assets , pays off some of its debt , and resells the cleaned - up institution to private investors .
And that ’s exactly what advocates of temporary nationalization want to see happen , not just to the small banks the F.D.I.C. has been seizing , but to major banks that are similarly insolvent .
The rovers keep on rolling across the dusty surface
The US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Mars rovers are celebrating a remarkable five years on the Red Planet .
The first robot , named Spirit , landed on 3 January , 2004 , followed by its twin , Opportunity , 21 days later .
It was hoped the robots would work for at least three months ; but their longevity in the freezing Martian conditions has surprised everyone .
The rovers ' data has revealed much about the history of water at Mars ' equator billions of years ago .
" These rovers are incredibly resilient considering the extreme environment the hardware experiences every day , " said John Callas , project manager for Spirit and Opportunity at Nasa 's Jet Propulsion laboratory in Pasadena , California .
" We realise that a major rover component on either vehicle could fail at any time and end a mission with no advance notice , but on the other hand , we could accomplish the equivalent duration of four more prime missions on each rover in the year ahead . "
Together , the rovers have driven more than 20 km , and returned more than 36 gigabytes of data .
This has included a quarter of a million images .
Spirit is exploring a 150 km - wide bowl - shaped depression known as Gusev Crater .
It has found an abundance of rocks and soils bearing evidence of extensive exposure to water .
Opportunity is on the other side of the planet , in a flat region known as Meridiani Planum .
Some of the rocks seen by Opportunity were once " drenched " in water Its data has shown conclusively that Mars sustained liquid water on its surface .
The sedimentary rocks at its study location were laid down under gently flowing surface water .
The rovers are now showing some serious signs of wear and tear .
Spirit has to drive backwards everywhere it goes because of a jammed wheel ; and Opportunity 's robotic arm has a glitch in a shoulder joint because of a broken electrical wire .
There have been times also when the vehicles have been dangerously short on power because of the dust covering on their solar panels .
The vehicles continue to return breathtaking panoramas
When Spirit and Opportunity do eventually fail , Nasa will have to wait awhile for its next surface mission .
It recently delayed this year 's planned launch to 2011 of a much more capable vehicle , known as the Mars Science Laboratory ( MSL ) .
The rover project has been beset by technical and budgetary problems .
The decision was taken not long after Europe also put back its rover venture known as ExoMars .
Officials cited cost concerns .
It is likely all surface missions in future for Nasa and the European Space Agency will be joint affairs because of the high cost of getting spacecraft down on to the planet .
Nasa lost contact with its static Phoenix lander in November .
It was operating in much more difficult conditions at a high - latitude location .
The rovers succeeded where some other missions failed

Cute Maalim the rescued black rhinoceros calf trots after his keeper all day , scared to let him out of his sight .
Not yet one - month - old and still too weak to even climb a simple low wall , Maalim is under 24 - hour care and supervision .
He was named after the warden who found him abandoned in Kenya 's famous Tsavo National Park in December .
Under 24 - hour care : A warden feeds Maalim the three - week - old rescued rhino
Maalim was brought to the country 's premiere animal orphanage at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust , just outside Nairobi .
Found frightened and alone , at first he was confused for an infant warthog because he was so small .
However , the staff at Tsavo quickly realised that the eight - inch high infant was in dire need of help .
Putting a call into the Sheldrick Trust , they immediately mobilised a plane to collect the rhino calf and give him the life saving milk formula that the trust produces .
Maalim was assigned a specialist keeper who has been with the rhino calf day and night , even sleeping with him in the specially designed enclosure .
When Maalim was first found , he was confused for an infant warthog because he was so small
" He is really just incredibly sweet , " said one observer to Maalim 's recent progress .
" He walks very gingerly and lightly and is clearly building his strength day by day . "
So small and frail was Maalim that staff at the Sheldrick trust commented that he was the smallest rhino they had ever seen .
This led them to conclude that he was born prematurely .
Trust patron Dame Daphne Sheldrick and her grandchildren are also big fans of Maalim .
The centre specialises in elephant orphans , but a rhino in this much need could not be turned away .
Maalim is fed by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust patron Dame Daphne Sheldrick 's eight - year - old grandson Roan
He now weighs almost double what he did when he was first brought into the park and in now almost two feet tall .
In a few years this vulnerable young rhino will be one of the kings of the African bush at around 11 feet long , 5 foot tall and weighing close to 3,00lbs .
" Ironically , Maalim must never come into contact with the elephants here at the Sheldrick Trust , " said his keeper .
" Elephants in the wild are not too keen on rhinos and Maalim was to get it into his head that elephants were his friends then an very dangerous situation for both animals could arise . "
The eventual plan for staff at the Sheldrick Trust is for him to be rehabilitated into the wild in The Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary , which is an area within the Tsavo park that has electric fences to keep rhinos in .
White House tapped interns to fill seats after few reporters show up for Bush John Byrne
Published : Tuesday January 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Various television personalities -- from Anderson Cooper to Campbell Brown -- expressed dismay or outright shock at President George W. Bush 's final press conference , particularly his responses regarding Hurricane Katrina .
Bush took umbrage with a reporter 's question :
Why did the government take so long to respond ?
But perhaps the most significant measure of Bush 's diminished media earning power was the lack of reporters who actually showed up for the event .
According to a story by former Washington Post White House correspondent Dana Milbank , who now writes a snarky tongue - in - cheek column , the White House ordered interns to fill two rows of empty seats in the press briefing room .
" With seven days left until he surrenders power , Bush will have to do a heck of a sales job to convince the nation of this , " Milbank wrote .
" Further complicating his last - minute legacy rehabilitation : Nobody seems to be paying attention .
The White House had high expectations for yesterday 's final , historic news conference .
' ONE CORRESPONDENT PER ORGANIZATION , ' proclaimed the bulletin sent to reporters .
' STANDING ROOM ONLY FOR NON - SEAT HOLDERS . '
But when the appointed hour of 9:15 a.m. arrived , the last two rows in the seven - row briefing room were empty , and a press aide told White House interns to fill those seats . "
" In his own way , the outgoing president acknowledged that the past five years have , by many measures , been one long pratfall , " Milbank wrote .
" But he spoke as though he were an innocent bystander , watching the mishaps rather than having any culpability for them .
To Bush , they were not mistakes -- just disappointments .
' Abu Ghraib obviously was a huge disappointment during the presidency , ' he said .
' Not having weapons of mass destruction was a significant disappointment -- I do n't know if you want to call those mistakes or not , but , they were -- things did n't go according to plan , let 's put it that way . ' "
Speaking Monday night , CNN's Anderson Cooper and analyst David Gergen appeared flummoxed by Bush 's claim during his press conference that his Administration had reacted appropriately in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
" It 's sort of a red herring to talk about the flyover , " Cooper said .
" To talk about what the Coast Guard did , which was valiant and courageous and brilliant , and totally forget about ... on Friday , days after the storm had passed , not even remembering people in the convention center -- it just boggles the mind . "
Analyst David Gergen agreed , calling Bush 's response on Katrina " the most stunning thing , I think , that happened in the press conference . "
" I thought maybe that people would have some sense of warmth about George Bush as he leaves office , " Gergen continued .
" I think I was wrong .
... I do n't think we 've had a time since Richard Nixon left office ... when people were so relieved to see the end of a presidency . "

Why are photographers compelled to suffer the discord of RAW formats ?!
During the last 10 to 15 years , digital photography forced the film out of nearly all the domains .
End users purchased hundreds of millions of digital cameras ; and that is not including the cameras sold integrated with cellular phones .
Such a huge industry can't exist without standards and such standards appear to exist .
They cover the storage media ( various flash cards ) , and image format which happens to be JPEG .
Currently JPEG is the most widely used image format and its image quality and size satisfy the overwhelming majority of users .
However it is not always what professionals want .
By professionals we do not mean just professional photographers .
The list includes designers , pre-press staff , archivists , photo banks and many others .
It often happens that JPEG format is also deemed less than appropriate by advanced amateurs .
That is why nearly all digital cameras that are positioned by manufacturers as professional or semi- professionals models ( as well as all current dSLR cameras ) suggest an alternative format , the so - called RAW .
For a casual onlooker it may appear that RAW is also some kind of a standard format that delivers better quality quality for pros .
This small article is to show that the matter is much more complicated .
At the current stage the situation with RAW format is not just bad but really dreadful and continues to spiral downwards rapidly .
This affects mostly professionals while less demanding amateurs simply enjoy the progress of digital .
RAW and JPEG : what is the difference ?
When a photo is saved in JPEG all the processing is done in the camera before the image file is written to the storage media .
On the contrary , when we shoot in RAW mode the data recorded is pretty much unchanged data read from the camera sensor .
Using classical photography terminology JPEG is pretty much a finished product , like an exposed Polaroid film is ; while RAW is more like a latent , hidden image on a film before the film is developed .
Such development for RAW files is often called RAW conversion .
The programs used to perform such RAW conversion are often referred to as RAW converters .
However there is a huge difference between undeveloped film and RAW data .
The film can be processed only once .
RAW data can be processed as many times as necessary using different RAW converters and experimenting with settings until the desired result is achieved .
Of course in order to record an image in JPEG format the camera itself performs the necessary RAW conversion .
The RAW converter is a part of camera intellect .
In case the conversion performed in the camera itself turns to be less than satisfactory because of a poor contrast , bad colour , plugged shadows , blown out highlights , moir or any other reason it is very difficult and often impossible to recover the image .
This is because the image , after conversion to 8 - bit bitmap suitable for viewing , is already stripped of a lot of initial image data that was captured by the camera in RAW .
This information is gone , lost past recovery .
On top of that , saving it in a lossy format such as JPEG further complicates adjusting the image during post - processing .
While recording data in RAW format no digital processing is normally applied .
The conversion of RAW data for viewing and printing is performed after the shooting using a powerful computer with a decent monitor .
This allows to employ much more complex algorithms of RAW conversions , to monitor the process of the conversion , and to verify the results of the conversion visually .
As a rule , this allows substantially better quality of the image ; moreover , the conversion parameters can be tuned to a good degree without running into posterization , excessive noise levels , and other artefacts , that is without destroying the image .
Processing of RAW files demands certain additional skills and habits as well as additional time .
This is why RAW format is used by a minority of photographers , mostly by advanced armatures and professionals and mostly when the quality of the result is more important that the speed of getting to it ; or , when the shooting conditions do not allow the use of JPEG because of its limited ability to maintain dynamic range as compared to RAW .
Another important case for RAW is when the customer explicitly demands for it .
Quite often , RAW is used as a kind of a safety net .
However it should be mentioned that the minority we referred to above are millions of users around the world .
The benefits that that are presented when using RAW format are by much overshadowed by the absence of well thought - out standards for the format .
Because of this we deal with tens ( or even hundreds depends on how you count ) of varieties of this format .
Data formats and compatibility
Photography is one of those industries where much depends on the transparency and one - to - one biunic data exchange between the players .
Sometimes these expectations are met , especially when a well - established formats such as JPEG , TIFF , EPS and others are used in a consistent workflow .
But that is definitely not the case with RAW .
For instance , take a photographer who has completed the shoot in RAW , and then browsed through the results and finally selected the keepers .
Obviously this photographer is using the RAW converter of choice to evaluate the images .
Unfortunately , selected RAW files can not be blindly submitted to the customer or to the pre-press bureau .
The other party may be using a different RAW converter or a different version of the same converter , hence , the results of their conversion may be different to the point of being unacceptable and that is even if the photographer submits conversion parameters with the RAW file .
As of today we do not have any RAW standards that are recognized by all parties involved .
Historically , the RAW format is defined by the camera s manufacturer .
In most cases some extension of TIFF format is used .
All camera manufacturers add their own extensions .
Some manufacturers use several incompatible RAW formats .
Sometimes it goes as far as one camera can record data in several incompatible formats .
Conveniently , the formats are not documented publicly .
Some manufacturers enforce additional measures to protect data , for example , Nikon ciphers some data fields but this is not the only case of data concealment .
The manufacturers explain why they prefer not to disclose the RAW formats .
Usually their explanations add up to the following simple reasons :
Reserved and new data fields can reveal some trade secrets to competition .
Quite often the data fields are added just in case ; as soon as the camera design allows to get this information it should be preserved and it may be used later to improve RAW conversion .
Such fields include for example diagnostics and service fields .
To document all these fields means to take responsibility for their contents and to maintain their presence in future releases of firmware and even future cameras .
To open a format means to trigger an unnecessary public discussion .
Let 's say users can access the information that registers the focusing distance .
The immediate reaction of certain users will be to get a ruler to check the focusing accuracy to motivate his claims that the camera doesn t focus correctly .
In the recent case over the out - of - focus problems with 1D MkIII moral damage and financial losses of Canon could be much worse if only the respective field in RAW data would be officially documented .
And of course such claims would not be limited to just Canon .
Some camera manufacturers are trying to get additional money out of RAW converters .
Not long ago native RAW converters had no competition at all to the extent of monopolizing the market .
Of course they prefer to maintain a competition at minimum .
It is not unusual to hear from camera manufacturers that only their converters do the justice to their cameras while third party converters only compromise their cameras decreasing image quality , distorting colours and sacrificing resolution and on top of that adding noise .
Manufacturers claim sometimes that encoding of data fields is done in the best interest of the users , that only such encoding allows to ensure data integrity and also to prove authenticity and authorship of the original shot .
Those of our readers who are familiar with the modern state of cryptography will surely smile here .
It looks like the manufacturers are not overly concerned with providing us with convincing and satisfactory arguments .
All other parties except the manufacturers are genially interested in open formats as well as in reducing the current manifold of formats .
Photographers want to process the images taken with different cameras through only one or two standard processing workflows ( as it was with films ) .
Photographers benefit from the competition between the developers of different image processing programs .
With the competition there is a hope for better processing quality and lower price for image processing programs .
Another important consideration for photographers is an interaction between different programs to allow using best features of each of those .

Program developers are also suffer from multiple formats and lack of documentation .
They spend an awful lot of time studying alien formats and decoding the meanings of the fields .
Such a waste of time and labour could be easily avoided with a little help and good will from the side of manufacturers .
In the absence of such support from the camera makers their new cameras remain unsupported by the third party products for many months .

Archivists , in the broad sense of this word , and that includes photo banks , advertising agencies and individual photographers , can t sleep well .
The pandemonium of formats gives them nightmares .
They need to store not only the RAW images but also the programs that can open those files , manuals for those programs , their own notes on using the programs and the sequences of user actions needed to set processing parameters to render the necessary result .
Today we have at least one case when the compatibility between versions was lost .
Processing parameters , if set in an older version of the program , are ignored by a newer version .
Sometime setting those parameters in an older version can cause a crash of a newer version .
This is because the RAW format was changed between those two versions .
We mean Nikon Capture here .
Maybe this is not the only case .
We were not running especial investigation of this problem because even one case is more than enough .
The speed of development of digital cameras doesn t allow creating such a universal data format that would last forever .
However the chaos that exists today is not inevitable .
One of the reasons for the current situation is that distinct and agreeable attempts of introducing standards are absent .
The photo industry hasmodern photography always enjoyed diversity , sometimes even too much of it .
New film formats emerged and vanished ( 828 , 110 , 126 , APS , disk film ) ; different recipes of film processing felt into decay or went into oblivion ( Polacolor , C - 22 , K - 14 , E - 4 ) .
Many are not aware of the reasons of such excessive diversity ( and by the way , such diversity was caused not only by economical or technological factors , but to a certain extent raison d tre was just an attempt to hook the consumer up and to get some additional revenue from selling the rights to use the format or the process to other manufacturers ) .
But pretty much everybody knows the results : the archives of images taken with a use of ill - fated formats can be maintained only by professional archivists but not by the individuals or small companies .
It would be just horrible if the current archives of digital photos will follow the pattern .
It is even more so if we are taking into account that during the last 10 years the amount of photos captured nearly equals the amount captured during previous 30 years .
Data , metadata and meanings
One of the most important achievements of modern photography is storing not only the image data but metadata as well .
Data is the image , captured by the camera .
That is , it contains information about the level of brightness for each sensel .
If the image is recorded in RAW format , very little is done to this data ( usually only normalization and some noise reduction are applied ) .
If the image is recorded as JPEG data is processed through multiple color and tone corrections , and also sharpened .

If the image is recorded as JPEG data is processed through multiple color and tone corrections , and also sharpened .
Metadata is the information about the image .
It contains exposure parameters , time the shot was taken , possibly geographical location of the shot , information on lighting conditions ( white balance ) , make , model , and serial number of the camera , information about the lens , and so on .
The description of data format ( parametadata ) should include ; details of the method used to store image data ( bit width , compression scheme , etc. ) but also define metadata in full detail .
Parametadata ( that is data format of a RAW - file ) is exactly that , which brings meaning to stored bits sequences ( this field contains focal distance expressed in one tenth portions of inch ) .
Since manufacturers do not document format , the quest for bits meaning is to be fulfilled by hackers ( in a good sense of this word ) , who , using different methods , make their own definitions of formats ( we will talk about it hereinafter ) .
With a view of a further discussion lets divide data and metadata into the following groups :
Those which are necessary to get a good quality image from RAW - file : the manufacturer , the camera s model , light sensitivity while taking the shot , image size , white balance data , the use of flash while shooting , as well as some other critical parameters , and of course , the image data that is the brightness map registered by sensor .
Those , which might be used while processing a RAW - file : camera s presets ( contrast - saturation - tone curve - sharpening - colour space ) , optics , and focusing parameters .
Those , which are not necessary for processing but useful for demonstrating , cataloguing and search : like date and time , GRS coordinates , author , description of photo etc .
One cannot say that no standard for metadata exists , there is an EXIF standard and the most of cameras manufacturers follow it .
But EXIF , which in a first place was established to support ready , viewable images , describes fields prerequisite for cataloguing ( the third group in our classification ) and provides no help to the RAW - processing software developers .
It is also not true to say that data and metadata are completely not documented .
They are , but in accordance with the grievous joke affirming that ' FreeBSD kernel is very well documented , unfortunately it is all on C ' .
Data and some part of metadata are documented in well - known program dcraw by Dave Coffin , the program , which currently supports ( that is able to unpack ) formats of 312 of digital cameras .
Metadata are documented in the ExifTool program by Phil Harvey .
This program deals with a much broader spectrum of information than just the EXIF .
The program also recognizes and deciphers a number of utility fields , among them those which some converters include in RAW file if the file is not just out of camera , but modified and saved in the raw converter .
It is interesting to mention that the size of program code of ExifTool exceeds the size of program code of dcraw by nearly a whole order of magnitude ( 75 thousands of lines against 8 thousands ) .
This proportion quite adequately reflects the ratio of laboriousness of data deciphering to metadata deciphering : metadata are much more diverse .
Of course this documentation is not enough .
Despite of all hackers efforts , mistakes happen and completeness of description is far from perfect .
Sometimes the correct deciphering of a data field of some camera becomes possible only when this camera has already been discontinued .
As a result even developers of RAW processing software can t declare with any degree of certainty that they do everything in a correct way .
Funny consequence is that , any attempts to compare the quality of RAW processors based on 1 or 2 examples , are completely meaningless .
Revolutionary situation in digital photography
According to herein - above in the digital photography industry a revolutionary situation is emerging in compliance with its definition given by nobody else but Vladimir Lenin himself :
Photographers ( and the whole industry , which uses the results of their work ) cannot live as of old : the variety of non-documented formats suits nobody , especially taking into account that the quantity of new modifications of formats is increasing nearly exponentially .
Cameras manufacturers cannot rule over as of old : despite of all their efforts , including ( and mainly ) their attempts to conceal information , converters produced by independent developers prevail by users number and sometimes even deliver higher quality results compared to native converters .
It is known that development of a revolution situation into a revolution depends on the existence of party , which is ready and capable of taking a lead of a struggle .
And here the reasonable question emerges : how is anything at all works in such a chaos ?
Developers mainly use 2 approaches , decreasing the level of entropy a little :
Some programs support only a very limited number of data formats , therefore dramatically simplifying the problem .
If the author of a program declares that his program provides support for the majority of data formats , it means that most probably he is using dcraw source texts either as the ready solution or as a documentation .
Among others who uses this approach is such a major player as Adobe .
It is nothing less but amazing that such a huge industry largely depends on just one person and 8 thousand lines of code written by him .
It is easy to see that the both methods are having no prospects , especially from strategic point of view .
Adobe DNG
The DNG format was presented by Adobe in September 2004 as a universal format of a digital negative , intended for the eternal archive data storage .
The specification DNG 1.0 was poorly thought - out , and in a half a year Adobe presented the specification DNG 1.1 .
Together with the description of its format DNG SDK was released .
Unfortunately this DNG SDK cannot be considered as anything but a run-around : easy - to - read documentation , useful examples as well as program templates are virtually ascent .
Before we move on , let 's check on Adobe s statements : the archive properties and the universality .
Is it really archival ?
Let s make a very simple experiment : we will try to imitate the situation which could take place 3 years ago .
To make this experiment we will take a source RAW - file from the old enough camera ( Canon Powershot G6 ) and convert it into DNG with an old version of the Adobe converter .
To check archival properties we ll convert both files source RAW and its derivative DNG with the same presets into bitmapped RGB - format using current version of Adobe Camera Raw v.5 .
Let s have a look at the difference between the results ( photo 1 ) .
Visual difference between conversions of both files is small and it is highly possible that it won t be noticeable when printed in a magazine .
But straightforward subtraction shows that the difference exists .
It is rather difficult to consider a format to be an archival while it does not provide the identity with the source given that the archival file and the source have been processed equally .
Is it universal ?
To check universality let s perform the inverse operation : we ll take a shot with a current camera ( Canon 1D Mark III ) , convert it into DNG using the modern version of a DNG - converter , and try to feed it to an old version of Adobe RAW converter ( ACR ) , which does not know this camera .
This experiment is quite topical , and here is why : the support of new cameras in Adobe Photoshop CS2 has been discontinued , but not everybody is ready to pay for upgrade to Adobe Photoshop CS3 or CS4 given that these versions do not provide any distinct advantages to a particular user .
It has been found that the version 2.4 of Camera Raw does not open the file at all , while versions 3.x open it but results of conversions of RAW and derived DNG into RGB ( photo 2 ) differ even more than it was in the previous experiment .
Shortcomings and evolution of DNG
The reason for the both above - mentioned reciprocity failure is that not enough metadata is specified in DNG format specifications .
At every stage of the DNG progress Adobe unpack and standardize only the metadata which is necessary to support their current conversion methods .
All other metadata even if stored is still present in the initial ( non-documented ) form .
The level of metadata standardization in DNG is not enough for the goal ( universal archival format ) .
Gradually Adobe are modifying DNG , discovering information content of metadata and accordingly adding to the specifications , but that metadata have been ignored in previous versions of converters .
If the file had been converted by one of these previous versions , some data might have been lost forever ( as it was shown above ) .
The specification DNG 1.2 , which was released several months ago , contains some additional fields of metadata colour data , but since they are intended mainly to support Adobe products , they have been added in a form as they are used by Camera Raw and Lightroom .
This data has no relation to source RAW formats and hence it is artificial .
Thus , DNG more and more becomes the internal format of the company which have developed it .
The DNG format does not help developers to support non-standard sensors ( such as Foveon , Fuji Super CCD SR having 2 different images in one shot etc. ) .
Of course , it is not difficult to invent the way to store non-standard data , but consequently such data requires non-standard algorithms .
Unfortunately , those are not accounted for by DNG .
At the same time some manufacturers ( Panasonic , Leica , Samsung ) have started to use the DNG format as the output format of their cameras , though it does not prevent them from recording non-documented metadata , since there is a special place assigned for such undocumented tags in DNG specifications .
One can easily see DNG as one more RAW format .
In this sense DNG is a little bit better than all others since some fields are somehow documented .
But it is absolutely impossible to use DNG as the universal archival format , and one can see it from the simple experiments we offered here .
Moreover , the acceptance of DNG in its current state as the standard leads to the situation when the method of conversion used by Adobe is also imposed , though implicitly .
OpenRaw
In year 2005 the OpenRaw initiative emerged .
In fact it boiled down to the call to cameras manufacturers to publish specifications of their respective RAW formats .
This call was ignored altogether , despite the fact that well - respected people were holding polite and slow negotiations in accordance with all the rules of the Japanese etiquette with very influential managers of the leading manufacturers of digital photo equipment .
However , suppose that these manufacturers turned to be kind enough to publish all their internal raw cuisine , even if in the scope that was already known .
Would it be of any help for raw converters developers ?
Our opinion is not too much ; due to ( traditionally ) a couple of reasons :
To program the processing of all data formats is a lot of work .
Dave Coffin has been involved in it for more than 10 years , Phil Harvey about 5 years .
Of course , given you have the descriptions it is no need to hack any more , which would have reduced the amount of work , but even reduced volume is still exorbitant high .
In fact one needs not a description of all and every bit of a format but only descriptions of fields plus instructions of what to do with all that jazz .
Unfortunately the founders of OpenRaw did not even think about asking for such instructions .
There would be no reason to mention OpenRaw initiative if not for the intense PR campaign held 3 years ago .
The campaign was successful and now many think ( unfortunately , mistakenly ) that there is such a format as OpenRaw .
Who is to be blamed for and what is to be done ?
All the problems of the photo industry mentioned can be attributed , among other reasons , to the fact that the list of requirements for RAW data has never been seriously and openly discussed .
As a result in every particular case a subset of metadata interpreted by a converter reflects an opinion of developers on what is the correct way to process the data .
There is no need to go far away to catch an example of how it happens one of the authors of this article is guilty of the fact that even knowing how to decipher and handle Nikon s camera tone curve recorded in the metadata , he still thinks that those curves are not very useful and consequently ignores them in the converter .
The DNG format also lines up with the same tendency : the data tags added in the version 1.2 are intended to be used by Adobe programs in the first place .
The information industry have faced these problems many times already and have solved them by adopting the standards on data formats .
Before adoption those standards were widely discussed by all parties , and in case of necessity they are revised ; but again in accordance with a standard procedure .
With RAW - formats adoption of the standard on metadata is a reasonable solution for the present situation .
The standard should describe required and recommended metadata .
Moreover , the encryption of required fields , that is those fields that are critical for baseline raw conversion ought to be explicitly prohibited .
Yes , we need to agree upon what is that baseline , too .
We can discuss what tags should be included into metadata , as well as the structure of the fields ( that is where the standardizing committee comes useful ) , though some of them are pretty obvious .
One of these obvious fields , absence of which considerably slows down the work and leads to significant waste of time and resources , is the description of spectral characteristics of camera sensor .
These characteristics are well - known to manufacturers and sometimes even have been published in the sensor spec sheets , - unfortunately in the form of curves of a rather general type instead of tables with exact values .
The absence of open information on colour characteristics of a camera results in the situation when to implement camera support one needs either to perform a number of tiresome , expensive and sometimes very approximate tests , or to choose the color visually , or to resort to data extracted from DNG .
It takes time because with new cameras released initially the only converter available is the one offered by camera s manufacturer ( sometime as a separate purchase ) .
This converter not always ( to put it mildly ) suits users , sometimes because it does not provide the necessary quality and sometimes because it does not fit into the workflow adopted by a user or a big corporation .
For example , many design bureaus , photographic studios and pre-press bureaus use only Adobe suits .
The support of new cameras with Adobe software might be delayed for months .
As it was mentioned above , the push to DNG to a considerable extent is an attempt to impose the industry with Adobe s standard as the only one and thus to remove the problem of delayed support of new cameras , the problem which extremely irritates Adobe users .
Meanwhile DNG is not hopeless and is quite capable to become the basis for the standard .
To achieve this it is quite sufficient to expand the list of metadata fields , to make non-prerequisite some of the fields required for Adobe conversion software to work , and to prohibit data encryption .
The problem is that camera and software developers are extremely well - aware of the history of TIFF format and consequently are very cautious about Adobe initiatives .
But it is still possible that authorizing some committee on standards to bring DNG to agreeable status might solve this problem .
As for the both approaches existing today insisting on opening of all the tags of tens ( or even hundreds ) of data formats without the description of the meaning of tags ( like it is suggested by OpenRaw ) ; or imposing the scanty single format ( DNG ) they are not serving the purpose of resolving industry problems .
Both ways are in fact the paths to nowhere .
[ Aki ] had a broken TAC - 2 joystick that was just begging for some new and improved use .
Since it was the cable that was broken , [ Aki ] had the idea to make it wireless .
He designed custom boards for the transmitter and receiver .
Each is controlled by an ATTiny2313 .
He fitted it with the stock connector so it could possibly even still work on a commodore 64 .
He has n’t tested that yet though .

Worse is worse
by Jim Waldo
December 9 , 2003
Summary
The classic essay on " worse is better " is either misunderstood or wrong .
And in citing it in our design arguments , we short change both our customers and our craft .
I revisit this essay , and reflect ...
Advertisement
Recently , I was interviewed by a reporter who was doing a story on the difference between east coast engineers and west coast engineers ( yes , that old chestnut is again being revisited ) .
This in turn got me thinking about Dick Gabriel 's classic note " Worse is Better " , which is often credited with first articulating the distinction between the MIT ( or east coast ; after all , what else is there on the east coast ) approach to engineering ( do the right thing , no matter how complex it makes the code ) and the Berkeley ( or west coast ) approach to engineering ( make the code simple , even if it makes the user do more work ) .
The notion that worse is better has become something of a truism in the programming industry .
The usual examples are the C language ( worse than lisp , but it dominated anyway ) , Unix ( or more recently , Windows ) as opposed to Multics or VMS , and ( in a completely different arena ) VHS tape over Beta .
Each of the dominant technologies , it is pointed out , was worse than the alternative , but the worse technology became the standard anyway .
The moral to the story , or the reason that people bring the principle up in argument , is to convince whoever is on the other side of the argument that we should set our sights on the quick and dirty , less elegant solution to a problem , because " worse is better . "
Of course , this received wisdom is just so much crap .
The arguments simply do n't hold up .
But the damage that this principle has done to the technology industry is real , and we should start pushing back before we do any more harm than we already have done .
First , the arguments .
Gabriel 's original writing ( which can still be found , like everything else , either through Google or by going here ) makes an interesting read , and a number of good points .
Reading it again not only reminds one of how well it is written , but debunks a lot of the usual common knowledge about the article .
For example , the piece never contrasts the east coast and west coast engineering styles ; the two groups it talks about are the MIT / Stanford style ( one group ) and the New Jersey style of design .
Not nearly so interesting in these days as the notion that the contrast in styles is between west coast and east coast .
The rest of the paper is an excellent analysis for why Lisp lost out to C as a programming language , even though Lisp was a superior language .
Or at least superior on the grounds that Dick found most important .
But this does n't necessarily show that Lisp was in fact superior to C ; it can just as easily be taken to show that the metrics that were cited in the article were not the ones that were taken to be most important by those choosing a programming language .
The fact that C produced faster code , was easier to master , was easier to use in groups , and ran well on less expensive hardware were not considerations that Gabriel found important .
But others did .
On those metrics , the dominance of C as a programming language was an example of better is better , not worse is better .
The old chestnut of beta and vhs is open to the same sort of alternate interpretation .
On the " worse is better " interpretation , the superior quality beta was beaten out by the clearly inferior vhs tape format because of some inexplicable perversity of human nature ( or the machinations of clever marketing people , or the hubris of Sony , who owned the Beta brand ) .
But the vhs tapes were capable of recording longer programs on a single cassette , and could be played on cheaper recorders , and had a number of different suppliers .
Thus there were a set of metrics on which vhs was the superior technology , and these metrics seemed to be the ones that most in the market found to be important .
Vhs beat out beta not because worse is better , but better in some dimensions ( cost , time to record ) beat out better in other dimensions ( picture quality ) .
Even the case of Unix vs. Multics misses an important point .
While Multics may have been a better operating system , Unix had the twin advantages of actually existing , and running on a wide variety of fairly cheap hardware .
Windows ( and DOS ) ran on even cheaper hardware , and though it was easy to argue on any technical grounds that you wanted that Unix was a better OS than DOS , the property of existence on really cheap hardware turned out to the the metric of goodness that appealed to the customer .
The emergence of Linux as a real choice is beginning to give us more evidence in this particular choice ; perhaps a better OS is something that people will choose when other things are equal .
But when they chose DOS over Unix , things were n't equal .
In all of these cases , there is an alternate interpretation of the choices that were made that lead us to the conclusion that worse is not better .
Instead , what we see is that better is a complicated notion , and can depend on a variety of different metrics .
It may be disappointing to find out that what we geeks think of as better may not be what our customers think is better .
But finding this out should n't surprise us too much .
Of course , worse is better is a much catchier slogan than better depends on your goodness metric or some other , equivalent phrase that would actually reflect what was going on .
And there is wisdom and insight in the original article that can be used by designers , even under the catchier ( but less historically accurate ) slogan .
My problem with the slogan is that it has become a catch phrase for those who either have n't read the original article , or have read it and either have forgotten what it really talked about or never understood it in the first place .
As a catch phrase , it is often used to justify shoddy design , or following the crowd rather than doing what is right , or as short - hand for the real claim that our customers are too stupid to either appreciate or deserve high quality products .
Why spend the time doing things right , this line of reasoning goes , when we all know that worse is better .
You are far better off giving the customer something that you know is less than what you could produce , because they ( those simple customers ) will think that it is better .
The end result of this thinking is sloppy products that do n't work , are hard to use , or are unreliable ( or all of the above ) .
We try to convince our customers that this is the way software has to be , and then turn around and convince ourselves that they wo n't pay for anything better .
But we short - change our customers , and we cheapen our craft , when we put up with this sort of thinking .
When the original article was produced , I do n't think that this is what the author had in mind ; even if it was , it is time for us to reject the simple - minded interpretation of the slogan , and start putting out software that really is better ( on the dimension of goodness that our customers have , not necessarily our own ) .

Unlike President Bush , Barack Obama is going to enter office with a clear appreciation of the urgent problems of climate change and America ’s growing dependency on foreign oil  and a strong commitment to address both .
One way he can do this is to give mass transit  trains , buses , commuter rails  the priority it deserves and the full financial and technological help it needs and has long been denied .
Mass transit has always played second fiddle to the automobile , so Mr. Obama will need strong allies .
Ray LaHood , Mr. Obama ’s choice for transportation secretary , must be not only an ally but a champion for mass transit .
Mr. LaHood is a Republican and former member of Congress from rural Illinois , where farmers produce a lot of ethanol and where people mostly drive .
His résumé on transportation issues is thin , and we fear he may need some coaxing in this new direction .
Another important ally should be  and almost certainly will be  James Oberstar , a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
They nicknamed themselves the Lethal Warriors , and during two tours in Iraq , the soldiers of the Army ’s 2nd Battalion , 12th Infantry regiment confronted some of the war ’s cruelest fighting , hunting insurgents through the warrens of Baghdad and Tikrit amid roadside bombs , mortar fire and close - quarters firefights .
By June 2007 , in what one field commander called the “ heart of darkness , ” the unit was losing a soldier a day in a body bag or on a stretcher .
Over two tours , 33 of them had died .
On Nov. 30 , 2007 , Kenneth Eastridge , a wiry , heavily tattooed survivor of the fighting , found himself at a rough Colorado Springs bar called the Rum Bay , not far from the unit ’s Ft. Carson base .
Eastridge , a high school dropout from the projects of Louisville , Ky. , had joined the Army to escape what seemed the dead - end prospects of civilian life , only to run repeatedly afoul of Army rules and face a court - martial .
So on that cold night just two days after his discharge , Eastridge was at loose ends again , in the company of two other war - coarsened vets from his unit , Louis Bressler and Bruce Bastien .
Police say the trio plotted a robbery in the company of an Army private , leaving Bressler worried that the private would divulge their plot .
Later that night , police say , Bressler shot the soldier to death with a .38 - caliber revolver .

Now Eastridge , 25 , sits behind bars in a Colorado prison , having agreed to a 10 - year sentence in exchange for his testimony .
The Army was quick to downplay any link between what he and the other soldiers saw in Iraq and the allegations against them .
“ Anybody that does crimes of that nature , it goes deeper and farther back than anything in the U.S. Army , ” said Lt. Col.
Brian Pearl , the 2 - 12 ’s commanding officer .
“ Nothing here has trained them to do what they are charged with . ”
Yet there is a larger story of those who fought with the 700 - soldier unit : a string of alleged robberies , domestic violence and senseless murder .

Six of the veterans are behind bars , implicated in four separate shooting incidents and five slayings since August 2007 .
The killings stretch from Colorado to an Orange County beach town , where a veteran of the company is accused of beating his girlfriend to death .
In October , a soldier who served in Iraq with another Ft. Carson unit was charged with slitting a woman ’s throat and leaving her to die in the foothills near Colorado Springs , prompting U.S. Sen.
Ken Salazar ( D - Colo. ) to urge a “ swift and thorough review ” of the accused soldiers ’ records .
He asked whether the Army , in its zeal to meet recruiting numbers , had issued the soldiers waivers for felonies , serious misdemeanors or mental health issues .
The Army has launched a task force to examine the question .
“ This is an Army - wide issue and something that has to be paid attention to at the highest levels of government , ” Salazar said in an interview .

What connects these killings , if anything , remains unclear .
But some associated with the cases find it impossible to dismiss the common backdrop of Iraq as coincidence .
“ Think about Vietnam , ” said Amanda Philipps , one of Eastridge ’s public defenders .
“ This is just the tip of the iceberg . ”
Sheilagh McAteer , one of Eastridge ’s lawyers , who serves on a task force examining crime by Iraq veterans , said she has seen a spike in drug abuse and domestic violence cases .
“ It ’s all anecdotal , but it appears there ’s some kind of connection , ” she said .
“ It ’s going to get worse before it gets better .
There are now guys who are coming back from their third tour . ”

Although some of the accused were diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder , the significance remains murky .
Bressler was convicted Nov. 19 of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of the Army private , Kevin Shields .
Ed Farry , Bressler ’s attorney , said his client ’s diagnosis played no role in the case .
“ These people are n’t monsters and they are n’t killers simply because they have PTSD , ” Farry said .
What went wrong with the soldiers ?
Did Iraq blow open preexisting psychological fissures or create them ?
Was war just a detour in a life headed for trouble anyway ?

A troubled life

In September , as he awaited his sentencing and his time on the witness stand , Eastridge , whose arm bears a tattoo resembling a Nazi SS badge , recalled in a jailhouse interview that trouble found him early .
Eastridge said his mother was a drug addict who left the family when he was 10 .
Two years later , he was playing with his father ’s shotgun when it went off and killed his best friend .
He was convicted of reckless homicide and given probation .
He quit high school and decided to enlist .
“ I did n’t have nothing else , ” Eastridge said .
Faced with his juvenile record , the Army gave him a waiver .
During his first tour in Iraq , from August 2004 to July 2005 , he suffered a head wound when his Humvee ran over a bomb but was never treated by a neurosurgeon , his lawyer says .
Advertisement
After Eastridge ’s first tour , he was accused in Colorado Springs of pointing a gun at a girlfriend ’s temple and charged with felony menacing , but the Army returned him to Iraq in October 2006 before the case could be resolved .
The fighting was fierce .
The mission was to calm a sectarian struggle escalating in Doura , a district in south Baghdad where Sunnis , Shiites and Christians once mixed .
“ They were killing us every day , ” Eastridge said .
“ Everybody was just breaking down . ”
Soldiers faced roadside bombs , mortar attacks and small - arms firefights as they hunted insurgents door to door through the streets and alleys .
Advertisement
“ I was the guy in my platoon who was always up front .
They would volunteer me .
I guess they thought I was crazy , ” Eastridge said .
“ I wanted to kill all the bad guys . ”
The anxiety became so erosive , Eastridge said , that he and a fellow soldier decided to escape the battlefield by shooting each other with a stolen .32 - caliber pistol .
He would shoot his friend in the arm , and his friend would shoot him in the leg .
But the gun jammed , he said .
During his second tour , medical records show , Eastridge was treated for chronic stress , insomnia , depression and anxiety .
He said he would take three to five Valium pills before heading out on missions .
He said the Army found him passed out on Valium after he had sex with his girlfriend , an Army truck driver .
The incident landed him in an Army camp in Kuwait for a month , where he filled sandbags 14 hours a day , he said .

Army evaluators diagnosed him with post - traumatic stress and anti-social personality disorders and noted that he had “ homicidal ideations . ”
The Army court - martialed him and discharged him in November on what his lawyer calls less than honorable terms .
Even before the Army cut him loose , he said , he had started committing robberies with his buddies from the 2 - 12 , Bastien and Bressler , who had both recently returned from Iraq .
“ I was trying to get enough money to get an apartment , ” Eastridge said .
“ I was n’t trying to be all violent .
I was just trying to get on my feet . ”
On the night of Nov. 30 there was a party at Rum Bay , a club with a reputation for late - night fights .
Eastridge , out of work and still facing the unresolved menacing charge , was there with Bressler , Bastien and Shields , who was in the same platoon and was celebrating his 24th birthday .
Police say that ’s when Shields learned of their plans to commit another robbery .
Advertisement
By Eastridge ’s account , they all left the bar drunk .
Then , according to police , they stopped at a park , where Shields argued and traded punches with Bressler before Bressler gunned him down , worried that he knew too much and would talk .
Shields ’ body was found the next day .
Police say Bressler and Bastien were also involved in the robbery and murder , three months earlier , of a 23 - year - old soldier named Robert James .
Bastien pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in that case and to accessory to murder in the Shields case .
He has been sentenced to 60 years in prison .
Eastridge pleaded guilty to accessory to murder in Shields ’ death and agreed to testify at Bressler ’s trial .
Bressler was acquitted of first - degree murder but convicted of a lesser charge of conspiracy to commit murder , which could bring him 24 years in prison .
He still faces a charge of first - degree murder in the James case .
Eastridge was sentenced in November to the 10 years in exchange for his testimony .

Behind bars , Eastridge contemplated what life will be like when he hits the streets again , possibly in his early 30s .
He will have to find a trade .
“ Firefighting maybe , ” he said .
But he was not sure .
“ The only thing I know how to do is shoot . ”

Deadly shootings
Six months after the Shields killing , two other soldiers from the 2 - 12 -- with no apparent connection to the Colorado Springs robbery crew -- were roaming the city ’s streets with an AK - 47 , according to police .

On May 26 , police say , Jomar Falu - Vives and Rodolfo Torres - Gandarilla were traveling in a Chevy Tahoe when Falu - Vives shot an Army captain who was standing at an intersection .
Both are charged with attempted murder .
Police say that 11 days later , the pair were on the road again when Falu - Vives gunned down a couple posting garage - sale signs .
Falu - Vives faces murder charges .
Torres - Gandarilla is charged as an accessory .
Three months after those slayings , in still another unrelated case , sheriff ’s deputies in Orange County say they knocked on the door of a San Clemente condo to find a blond , blue - eyed surfer named John Needham , 25 , near his mortally beaten girlfriend , Jacque Villagomez .
After fighting with the 2 - 12 in Iraq , family and friends say , Needham was discharged last year suffering from shrapnel wounds to his legs and back , beset by nightmares and so jittery he jumped at the sound of dropped silverware .
As his brother put it , “ He ’s been no good since he got back . ”
Needham was charged with murder and is awaiting trial .

In Wonderland
Outside the gates of Ft. Carson , the leafy neighborhoods of Colorado Springs run to the Rocky Mountains , where gold is still mined and the staggering view from Pikes Peak inspired “ America the Beautiful . ”
This is a military town , home to the U.S. Air Force Academy , two Air Force bases and the nearly 18,000 - strong Army facility .
Local officials are familiar with the challenges confronting soldiers who are “ coming back to Wonderland , ” a term used to explain the transition from war to civilian life .

“ We ’ve heard of soldiers at the mall just hitting the floor when it thunders , ” said Davida Hoffman , a social worker who runs a local program for returning veterans .
At Ft. Carson , the 2 - 12 is busy training .
On a sunny morning this fall , Command Sgt. Maj .
Charles Sasser and Lt. Col. Brian Pearl , the officer in charge of the battalion , led the soldiers through training exercises at Camp Red Devil , a training camp deep in the hilly terrain of the expansive base .
Pearl believes the slayings linked to the unit are not connected to combat experiences , but rooted in personal events outside Army life .
“ If those guys were not in 2 - 12 infantry , they would have done the same thing , ” Pearl said .
“ People will say , ‘ In the U.S. Army , they ’re trained to kill people . ’
But we ’re trained to make ethical decisions . ”

He said that the battalion led the Army in reenlistment and that hundreds of soldiers returning from combat do not come home to kill anyone .
Early next year , the unit will be fighting again .
“ They bled , sweat and cried during 15 months in Iraq , ” he said .
“ Now they ’re preparing to go to Afghanistan .
They do everything we ask . ”

LONDON , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) - A new book on Charles Darwin says a passionate hatred of slavery was fundamental to his theory of evolution , which challenged the assumption held by many at the time that blacks and whites were separate species .
“ Darwin ’s Sacred Cause ” is among the first of dozens of works about the 19th century scientist to appear in 2009 , the bicentenary of his birth and 150th anniversary of the publication of his groundbreaking “ On the Origin of Species ” .
Its authors , Adrian Desmond and James Moore , also expect it to be one of the most controversial , because it explores what they call Darwin ’s humanitarianism and challenges the notion that his conclusions were the result of pure scientific pursuit .
“ There ’s got to be reasons why he came to common descent images of evolution when there was no precedent for that in the zoological science of his day , ” Desmond told Reuters .
“ It comes out of anti-slavery .
“ No one doubts that the Galapagos Islands , mockingbirds , the giant ground sloths and the giant tortoises were absolutely fundamental to his views and what he was interested in .
“ But you have to look at some sort of marshalling principle .
Every ship carried more than one naturalist generally in those days -- why did none of them come to this kind of common descent view and yet most of them had seen exactly the same evidence ? ”
Moore said the book did not seek to reduce the argument to “ I ’m against slavery therefore I ’m an evolutionist ” , adding :
“ This is not a reductionist argument .
We are making the case that it was necessary for Darwin to believe in ‘ brotherhood science ’ in order to see common descent .
We ca n’t figure out where else he got it from . ”
Desmond and Moore return to the naturalist 18 years after “ Darwin ” , their acclaimed biography of the man who concluded all species evolved from common ancestors .
As he himself was aware , his theories were revolutionary .
They knocked humans from their perch by suggesting they shared ancestors with monkeys and slugs , undermined the latest scientific research claiming whites were a superior species to blacks and challenged creationist assumptions .
FOREFATHERS , FIRST - HAND EXPERIENCE
Desmond and Moore argue that their view is important , because it shows Darwin was driven by human desires and needs , and throws new light on works that are still attacked today for being morally subversive .
The authors sifted through thousands of letters and other archive material from the Darwin family correspondence and Cambridge University Library and related Darwin to the key racial literature of his day .
The National Archives also contained the logbooks of HMS Beagle , the ship aboard which Darwin travelled the world and gathered evidence that provided the basis of his theories .
Darwin ’s Sacred Cause traces the naturalist ’s abolitionism to his grandfathers ’ opposition to slavery and to his friends and upbringing in Edinburgh and Cambridge at the height of the anti-slavery movement .
Crucially , he also had first - hand experience of slavery on the Beagle .
During his five - year voyage Darwin saw evidence of thumbscrews , beatings , the result of armed clashes with white “ masters ” and heard of slavemasters threatening to sell the children of their slaves .
“ Darwin came home from the Beagle voyage and in months he plumped for the common descent view of evolution , ” said Desmond .
Moore said that while many scientists see politics and morals as “ polluting ” factors in research , Darwin is an example of someone who successfully combined the two .
“ We know Darwin ‘ got it right ’ .
At one and the same time , Darwin could see something as a moral position and as scientifically relevant . ”
Darwin ’s Sacred Cause is published by Penguin imprint Allen Lane and hits the shelves in Britain on Jan. 29 .

If you are troubled by the loss in value in your 401 ( k ) or other retirement account , you have plenty of company .
Even professionally managed pensions suffered an average 26 percent loss in 2008 , marking the worst recorded year for defined benefit funds , according to Northern Trust Investment Risk and Analytical Services .
Despite the grim results , two radically different retirement profiles have emerged .
One is workers with defined benefit plans .
These employees are guaranteed monthly payments at retirement based on a set percentage of their last paycheck .
Some 80 percent of public - sector employees and 20 percent of private - ­sector employers participate in defined benefit programs .
The Center for Retirement Research ( CRR ) at Boston College estimates that 20 million active participants and millions of retirees are enrolled in these retirement programs .
The other group includes workers with 401( k ) and other defined contribution accounts .
These employees are exposed to market downturns with no set retirement benefits .
Last year , many of them were too heavily committed to the stock market , suffering losses between 30 and 40 percent .
" While a bad year for every investor , 2008 was particularly bruising for 401 ( k ) members forced to navigate sophisticated , complex market environments largely on their own , exposed to individual portfolio risks far greater than the pooled risk of professionally managed benefit programs , " says Keith Brainard , research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators , whose members oversee pension benefits of most state and local government employees .
Employees with 401 ( k ) plans who are five to 10 years from retirement are now faced with the possibility of delaying retirement or drastically reducing their lifestyle when they do .
For younger workers with 10 or more years of potential employment , the hope is that investment markets will rebound in 2009 and that 8 to 10 percent returns will once again prevail .
For employees with defined benefit plans , however , personal retirement plans remain largely on course .
But there are problems here , too .
Corporate pension plans are underfunded by $ 409 billion , according to consulting firm Mercer .
The CRR estimates that private firms need to increase contributions by about $ 90 billion this year , as required by the 2006 Pension Protection Act .
The law stipulates that firms must eliminate unfunded pension obligations within a seven - year period .
But those restrictions were relaxed in December due to the current economic slump .
In an effort to meet funding requirements , some private companies have already announced layoffs or pension freezes .
Others have gone bankrupt .
As a result , the CRR estimates employees over 50 years of age who work for companies that have taken these actions will face severely reduced benefits at retirement as they are unlikely to have saved independently of their pension plan .
Public - sector entities are not under the same requirements to supplement their unfunded obligations , and no reliable estimate exists of what additional contributions are required .
" It will take longer than expected for the total cost effect to become clear in public funds , " Mr. Brainard says , " as actuarial updates lag market realities and public funds utilize smoothing formulas that extend market losses over extended numbers of years . "
Unless the markets suddenly recover and reverse lost profits , defined benefit plans will require dramatic increases in funding by their sponsors .
Taxpayers will face footing the bill to finance public - sector retirement programs and shareholders of companies will need to allocate limited dollars from the balance sheets to fund corporate plans .
Neither group is likely to be generous when their own retirement funding is not secure .
Redefining a retirement system for all Americans that achieves retirement security may become the next politically explosive issue .
Alicia Munnell , director at CRR , has proposed a third tier of mandated retirement savings to augment 401 ( k ) savings and Social Security benefits .
To better understand defined benefit plans , consider these actions :
• Those fortunate to have this type of pension can check its funded status by requesting Form 5500 from your plan administrator or by visiting FreeERISA.com .
If there is a shortfall , discuss with your employer what actions it will take to remedy the situation .
• Understand the effect of unfunded pension liabilities on taxpayers .
To identify your state 's exposure , visit publicfundsurvey.org and review the 2007 Public Fund Survey .
• To see if your plan is covered by government - funded Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in the event your employer goes bankrupt , visit pbgc.gov .

Scientists Use Laser Imaging
Karl Bates and his colleagues in the palaeontology and biomechanics research group have reconstructed the bodies of five dinosaurs , two T. rex ( Stan at the Manchester Museum and the Museum of the Rockies cast MOR555 ) , an Acrocanthosaurus atokensis , a Strutiomimum sedens and an Edmontosaurus annectens .
The team found that the smaller Museum of the Rockies T. rex could have weighed anywhere between 5.5 and 7 tonnes , while the larger specimen ( Stan ) might have weighed as much as 8 tonnes .
Acrocanthosaurus atokensis was a large predatory dinosaur that looked like T. rex but with large spines on its back and roamed the earth much earlier in the mid Cretaceous period , around 110 M years ago .
The team suggest Acrocanthosaurus probably weighed in at a similar mass to MOR555 and other medium sized adult T. rex at about 6 tonnes .
The Strutiomimum sedens , whose name means “ ostrich mimic ” , lived alongside T. rex in the late Cretaceous period and probably weighed somewhere between 0.4 – 0.6 tonnes
The reconstruction of Edmontosaurus annectens , a plant - eating hadrosaur was based on a juvenile specimen , but still weighed in at between 0.8 – 0.95 tonnes .
As adults , some hadrosaurs grew as big as T. Rex , again living in the late Cretaceous period .
The team used laser scanning ( LiDAR ) and computer modelling methods to create a range of 3D models of the specimens , attempting to reconstruct their body sizes and shape as in life .
The laser scanner images the full mounted skeleton , resulting in a detailed 3D model in which each bone retains its spatial position and articulation .
This provides a high resolution skeletal framework around which the body cavity and internal organs such as stomach , lungs and air sacs can be reconstructed .
This has allowed calculation of body segment masses , centres of mass and moments of inertia for each animal – all the information that is needed to analyse body movements .
Having created their ‘ best - guess ’ reconstruction of each animal , they then varied the volumes of body segments and respiratory organs to find the maximum plausible range of mass for the animals .
Even scientists cannot be sure exactly how fat or thin animals like T. rex were in life , and the team were interested in exactly how broad the range of possible values were for body mass .
They believe that the lower weight estimates are most likely to be correct as there is no good reason for the dinosaurs to weigh more than they need to as this would affect their speed , energy use and demands on the respiratory system .
The team also measured the body mass of an ostrich , as an existing subject that would show how accurate their technique was , and found the results to be correct .
They will now use the results to further investigate the locomotion of dinosaurs , specifically how they ran .
Karl said : “ Our technique allows people to see and decide for themselves how fat or thin the dinosaurs might have been in life .
You can see the skeleton with a belly .
Anyone from a five - year - old to a Professor can see it and say , ‘ I think this reconstruction is too fat or too thin ’ .

BitTorrent is often praised as an indestructible force moving petabytes of data around every day .
It does have an Achilles ' heel though , and prominent p2p researchers warn that millions of downloads will come to a halt if eight servers hosted in Sweden happen to go offline .
Research by Raynor Vliegendhart of the Tribler P2P team at Delft University of Technology has shown that BitTorrent is more vulnerable to a global collapse than anyone has ever predicted .
By collecting statistics of a sample of 283,032 torrents with 52,634,797 connected peers , he found that over 50 % of all torrents were tracked by The Pirate Bay .
In order to get an accurate estimate of the tracker load a single person connected to three torrents is counted as three peers .
In the picture below , we see that roughly 5 million peers are connected to a torrent that uses only The Pirate Bay ( single ) .
Another 5 million have more trackers in the announce list , but use The Pirate Bay as the primary tracker .
For the remaining torrents
The Pirate Bay was added as an additional ( foreign ) tracker .
Top 20 BitTorrent Trackers
The Pirate Bay is by far the largest BitTorrent tracker , followed at a distance by Sumotracker , Torrent .to and Torrentbox respectively .
Unfortunately , this dominant position can result in a horror scenario if the Pirate Bay tracker fails .
Raynor told TorrentFreak that if The Pirate Bay goes down , many of the other trackers might collapse as well .
“ If The Pirate Bay goes down the load will automatically shift to others .
This is because most of the Pirate Bay swarms also include other trackers .
When Pirate Bay goes down it would overload others until they fall also .
Meaning even more stress and further casualties .
This is likely to end in a BitTorrent meltdown . ”
So what ’s the alternative ?
How can we fix this vulnerability ?
The obvious option is to rely less on the Pirate Bay ’s trackers , but this is easier said than done .
Although there are thousands of smaller trackers on the Internet , it has proven to be hard to convince people to actually use these .
Perhaps we should find an alternative for the traditional BitTorrent tracker then ?
A truly decentralized form of filesharing , that does n’t rely on the philanthropy of three Swedish guys ?
Attempts have been made to decentralize trackers , and most of the major BitTorrent clients support “ trackerless ” torrents through DHT .
DHT is not the silver bullet though , as it is lacking in speed and efficiency according to Tribler founder Johan Pouwelse , and the mainline Bittorrent client “ has a faulty DHT implementation and many people will be left in the cold ” .
Researchers of Tribler found several DHT flaws .
One bug in a DHT sorting routine ensures that it can only “ stumble upon success ” , meaning torrent downloads will not start in seconds or minutes if Pirate Bay goes down in flames .
“ The DHT concept is proven to be broken and just invites DDoS attacks , ” Pouwelse added .
“ People have proposed repairs to the DHT , but only at the cost of too much performance or global trusted servers . ”
Dr. Pouwelse says that there have been ideas to deal with BitTorrent ’s Achilles ’ heel , but none of these have materialized .
This summer Raynor hopes to have an operational solution in their Tribler BitTorrent client .
They think the trick is to include the SQLite database engine in every Tribler client .
This enables abuse prevention and fast starts , however this complex task could be delayed until Christmas ( of some year to come ) .
So is BitTorrent going to die ?
No , not by a long shot .
However , this research does point out that the ecosystem depends on The Pirate Bay .
If their trackers go down for whatever reason , others are likely to collapse because of the increasing load and many torrent download will slow down significantly or stop entirely .
So please direct your prayers to trackers around the world .
May they function in peace and prosperity .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama wants to slash the ballooning deficit in half by 2013 , U.S. officials said on Saturday , after massively increasing public spending to stem the worst economic crisis in decades .

Obama will outline his ambitious goal when he hosts a summit at the White House on Monday on fiscal responsibility and later in the week when his administration presents a summary of its first budget , for the 2010 fiscal year .
With tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs in the midst of a global economic meltdown , Obama has said fixing the U.S. economy is his top priority .
He has acknowledged that his success or failure in that will define his presidency .
“ We ca n’t generate sustained growth without getting our deficits under control , ” Obama said in his weekly radio address in which he also announced immediate implementation of tax cuts for 95 percent of Americans as part of the effort to stimulate the economy .
An administration official said Obama was proposing to cut the deficit , which private economists project will rise to $ 1.5 trillion this year , through a mixture of tax increases on wealthier Americans and spending cuts .
“ The deficit this administration inherited was $ 1.3 trillion or 9.2 percent of GDP .
By 2013 , the end of the president ’s first term , the budget cuts the deficit to $ 533 billion or 3.0 percent of GDP , ” the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity .
“ Most of the savings will come from winding down the war in Iraq , increased ( tax ) revenue from those making more than $ 250,000 a year , and savings from making government work more efficiently and eliminating programs that do not work , ” the official said .
The United States spent about $ 190 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2008 .
Obama has pledged to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months while ramping up the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan .
Since being sworn into office on January 20 , Obama has sought to reassure Americans that his government is tackling the economic crisis boldly and swiftly -- holding near - daily events to announce measures to stem mortgage foreclosures , prop up failing banks , rescue the ailing auto industry and drive his stimulus package through Democratic - led Congress .
The measures have received a mixed early reaction from gloomy financial markets uncertain whether they will succeed in arresting the downward economic spiral .
BUSH TAX CUTS
A second administration official confirmed a Washington Post story that said Obama would propose boosting tax collection from about 16 percent of the economy this year to 19 percent in 2013 , while federal spending would drop from about 26 percent of the economy to 22 percent in the same period .
He said Obama would let tax cuts implemented by his predecessor George W. Bush for Americans earning more than $ 250,000 expire on schedule at the end of 2010 , when the tax rate would rise from 35 percent to more than 39 percent .
Obama told Americans in his radio address it was vital to get “ exploding deficits under control as our country begins to recover . ”
“ On Thursday I ’ll release a budget that ’s sober in its assessments , honest in its accounting , and lays out in detail my strategy for investing in what we need , cutting what we do n’t and restoring fiscal discipline , ” he said .
Obama has invited business and union leaders , academics and lawmakers to a summit on Monday to discuss ways of cutting the deficit .
That will be followed by an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday in which he said he would outline “ our urgent national priorities . ”
In early January , just a few weeks before Obama took office , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit would soar to $ 1.2 trillion for the current 2009 fiscal year that ends September 30 .
But that figure excluded the recently passed $ 787 billion stimulus package , a combination of tax cuts and spending on infrastructure projects over more than two years .
Private analysts expect the impact of the stimulus package and other spending to counter the economic downturn will push the deficit to $ 1.5 trillion or more this year .
That would be more than triple the $ 455 billion deficit recorded in 2008 .
“ Over time , the budget deficit will make it harder for our economy to grow and create jobs .
That ’s why the president ’s budget for FY ( fiscal year ) 2010 puts us on the path to cut the deficit he inherited on January 20 , 2009 , in half by the end of his first term , ” an administration official told Reuters .
Earlier on Saturday , Obama said the U.S. Treasury will implement tax cuts for 95 percent of Americans enacted as part of the $ 897 billion stimulus package , fulfilling a campaign pledge he hopes will help jolt the economy out of recession .
“ I ’m pleased to announce that this morning the Treasury Department began directing employers to reduce the amount of taxes withheld from paychecks , meaning that by April 1st , a typical family will begin taking home at least $ 65 more every month , ” Obama said .

A simple , chemical materials model may lead to a better understanding of the structure and organization of the cell according to a Penn State researcher .
“ Cells are interesting because they show organization even at the level of the cytoplasm , and while it is thought to be important for cell functions , it is not always clear how this organization is achieved , ” said Christine Keating , associate professor of chemistry .
“ We are taking a materials chemistry approach in developing simple experimental models for cytoplasm organization , ” she told attendees at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Cytoplasm is the material that fills the cell and is crowded with very large molecules .
It surrounds the organelles — tiny organs like mitochondria and the nucleus .
Unlike organelles , the cytoplasm is a fundamental feature of all cells .
Many important biochemical processes take place here , and so cytoplasm is interesting as a major player in cell function .
Creating a cell with organelles would be a monumental task , but creating one that exhibits molecular crowding and heterogeneity — unevenness of composition — is possible using large polymeric molecules and a lipid membrane .
Keating uses lipids to create vesicles , tiny cell - sized bubbles of lipid membrane in an aqueous solution of two large polymers .
In one case she used poly ( ethyleneglycol ) ( PEG ) — a common polymer — and dextran — a polymerized sugar to create the cell .
“ Neither of these compounds is important in a cell , but they illustrate the possibility of partitioning large molecules within a cell without internal membranes , ” said Keating .
Cytoplasm is usually filled with macromolecules of proteins , nucleic acids and carbohydrates .
A mixture of a small amount of PEG , a small amount of dextran , water and dried lipid allowed the lipid to rehydrate and form the vesicles .
The PEG and dextran filled the vesicles to the same concentration as the surrounding liquid .
The lipid membrane encapsulated a mixture of PEG and dextran in water , but , the material separated to form two visibly distinct areas , one with a higher percentage of PEG and one with a higher percentage of dextran .
“ The materials do not separate completely with one type of macromolecule in one section and the other completely apart , ” says Keating .
“ But the two aqueous phases are different enough that additional molecules , such as proteins or nucleic acids , prefer one over the other and will become concentrated there . ”
In bulk materials , researchers have been able to cause aqueous phase separation of up to 15 different compounds .
Similar , multiple separations might even take place in a cell ’s cytoplasm .
Biologists know that enzymes and other proteins tend to clump together or collocate in certain parts of the cell at certain times .
This collocalization would make the chemical reactions in metabolic pathways occur more rapidly because the chemicals necessary for the next step would be located nearby .
The application of heat , or a change in osmotic pressure can cause the separated materials to mix .
However , upon cooling or reversion to the initial pressure , the materials again separate .
“ It should be possible to collocalize materials in an artificial cell and then have the process be reversible , ” said Keating .
“ We could then bring together molecules we want at a certain time and separate them to control their activity . ”
Keating believes that some of the chemical reactions in cells may be controlled by collocation .
If she can reproduce this type of collocation in her artificial cells , the systems can be more easily studied .
“ The answer to whether or not collocalization can play this role is probably yes , ” said Keating .
“ However , proving it is not easy .
With a simple reversible model system , we could test this idea and learn how large an effect is possible . ”
These primitive cells also model macromolecular crowding of cytoplasm , which happens because very large molecules , like proteins , are all competing for the same space .
Macromolecules have long chains of atoms , sometimes branching and within their structures remains a lot of empty space .
When faced with another large molecule , these macromolecules cannot occupy the same area and so they draw inward , filling some of the empty space and making themselves smaller .
Compacted macromolecules act differently than uncompacted molecules .
The rates of reaction of crowded macromolecules can differ dramatically from those of the same molecules in unlimited space .
These artificial cells with artificial cytoplasm may allow researchers to study the effects of macromolecular crowding in a controlled way .
The researchers are also looking at the effects of polarization and other types of compounds on these heterogeneous cells .
“ One of the things we are looking into is how ions behave in the model cells , ” said Keating .
“ We want to take advantage of the effect common ions like potassium and magnesium can have on protein and nucleic acid structures and function . ”
These polymer containing primitive artificial cells may offer a very simple experimental system for investigating what goes on in the much more complex environment of biological cells .
Achieving a feat that seemed impossible not so long ago , a team of scientists working with the Hubble Space Telescope captured the first visible - light image of a planet orbiting another star ( above and inset ) .
On the same day as this announcement , last November 14 , came the report of a related breakthrough using the ground - based Gemini and Keck observatories in Hawaii , with which astronomers captured the first infrared image of three planets orbiting a star .
A week later , another exoplanet candidate was spotted in infrared — this time by the European Southern Observatory ’s Very Large Telescope — orbiting the hot , bright star Beta Pictoris .
Astronomers ’ newfound success at imaging planets trillions of miles away comes with the use of more powerful telescopes , improved optics techniques , and software that compares images to minimize background starlight .
Bruce Macintosh , an astronomer with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , says that changes in the kinds of stars astronomers are seeking out — stars 50 to 100 percent more massive than our sun —may also factor into the number of exoplanet sightings .
Spotting an Earth - like planet around a sunlike star remains beyond current technology , but it suddenly seems much closer .
Israel 's prime minister claimed yesterday that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was embarrassed by orders to abstain from voting last week on a UN truce resolution for Gaza that she helped arrange .
Israel had argued that the Security Council measure calling for a halt to the Gaza fighting - which passed Thursday in a 14 - 0 vote with the US abstaining - was unworkable because it did not guarantee Israel 's security .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said he called President George W. Bush to seek an abstention from the US , a key Israeli ally at the United Nations .
" I said : ' Get me President Bush on the phone , ' " Olmert said in a speech in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon .
" They said he was in the middle of giving a speech in Philadelphia .
I said I did n't care : ' I need to talk to him now . '
He got off the podium and spoke to me . "
Olmert said he argued that the United States should not vote in favor , and the president then called Rice and told her not to do so .
" She was left pretty embarrassed , " Olmert said .
A senior US official in Washington disputed the account .
" The plan had been all along , as agreed by the secretary and the president , that if all of the pieces fell into place , we would abstain , " the official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue .
" The government of Israel does not make policy for the United States , " the official added .
The approved resolution called for " an immediate , durable and fully respected cease - fire , leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza . "
Ms Rice said later that the United States " fully supports " the resolution but abstained because it " thought it important to see the outcomes of the Egyptian mediation , " referring to an Egyptian - French initiative aimed at achieving a cease - fire .
Still , Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said he was surprised by the US abstention .
" We were told that the Americans were going to vote in favour , " he said on Friday , a day after the vote .
But when Ms Rice came in to the Security Council chamber , she informed the Saudi foreign minister with an apology that she would abstain and would clarify later that the US supported the resolution nonetheless , according to Malki .
" What happened in the last 10 or 15 minutes , what kind of pressure she received , from whom , this is really something that maybe we will know about later , " he said .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
There are rock stars , and then there are Rock Stars .
Eddie Van Halen is a Rock Star .
Eddie Van Halen wanted to create a guitar that was practically indestructible -- at least by him .
Take an incident in the summer of 2007 .
A security guard stopped me as I attempted to drive through the gates of Center Staging , a rehearsal studio across the street from Burbank Airport .
" That 's odd , " I thought .
" They 've never had security before .
I wonder what 's going on ? "
Pretty soon , I discovered the reason for the limited access .
A black BMW convertible drove up , and a baby - faced teenager jumped out of the driver 's seat .
The passenger door opened , and out walked Eddie Van Halen .
Everyone stopped talking and stared , including Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals , who were outside taking a break from their own rehearsal .
Van Halen and the other members of the band had just announced a big reunion tour with original singer David Lee Roth at a splashy news conference in Beverly Hills , and I had inadvertently discovered where they were prepping for their journey .
Eddie and his son Wolfgang -- named for Mozart -- greeted a couple of people in the parking lot and quickly disappeared inside the soundstage .
Moments later , the earth trembled as the loudest guitar I 've ever heard in my life was fired up .
It was like a sonic boom -- only the sound was n't coming from the airport .
It was coming from inside the soundstage .
The legendary guitarist launched into the familiar intro to Van Halen 's 1978 hit , " Ain't Talkin ' ' Bout Love . "
That was followed by " Runnin ' With the Devil . "
Joss Stone ran out of her own rehearsal studio -- barefoot -- and begged a security guard for entry .
She was turned away .
Do n't Miss The EVH Wolfgang
Months later , I would catch Van Halen , the band , during their triumphant hometown concert in Los Angeles .
Little did I know that during that tour , Eddie had been road - testing a series of prototype guitars he was designing with Fender .
The instrument was called " the Wolfgang , " after his son , who 's Van Halen 's current bass player .
Watch Van Halen show off his new axe »
After years of wearing down metal frets and having pieces of his guitar rip off or malfunction during shows , Van Halen says he 's built a guitar that even he can't destroy .
On the Wolfgang , frets are fashioned of stainless steel , and metal gadgets are custom - made by a company that specializes in medical tools .
Sections of wood are left unpainted so the instrument can breathe and age -- " like a Stradivarius , " the 54 - year - old musician explains with a degree of pride .
We recently caught up with Eddie at his 5150 Studio , high in the hills above Los Angeles .
It 's where the album " 1984 " was recorded , along with every subsequent Van Halen record .
The studio sits on seven acres , just a stone 's throw from the Tudor mansion he bought in 1980 .
He and his fiancee / publicist , Janie Liszewski , scoot around the property in golf carts .
The red , white and black - striped motif of his signature Van Halen guitar is painted on the walkway .
The following is an edited version of the interview .
CNN : You 've been tearing guitars apart and redesigning them all your life , have n't you ?
Eddie Van Halen :
It kind of started when I went to a Radio Shack - type of store in Pasadena .
They had a 12 - string guitar hanging there , and I did n't want 12 -- I wanted six .
And so I asked the guy , " Could I take six strings off and try it ? "
And the guy said , " No , not unless you buy it . "
So I borrowed the money from my parents , bought it , took six strings off and voila -- did what I wanted .
The guitar -- it's on the first album cover .
It 's called Frankenstein .
I 'm always tinkering with stuff .
And basically , the new Wolfgang is a combination of all the years of tearing things apart , ruining things , creating things and coming up with things that I later found out I could patent .
CNN : How many guitars have you accidentally broken on stage ?
Van Halen :
On stage ?
( He shrugs . )
During the last show , I actually tried to break a Wolfgang , and it would n't break .
I picked it up and I could n't break the damn thing .
I threw it up in the air , and later put it out in the rain .
I picked it up half an hour later , and it was still in tune .
It pissed me off .
CNN : The Wolfgang sells for about $ 3,000 .
Are you worried about introducing a high - end guitar when the economy is taking such a hit ?
Van Halen : I just do n't think that way .
I 'm really not a businessman , so to speak .
The only reason I do it is because people are always asking me where they can get what I use .
CNN : Who are some of the musicians who have asked ?
Van Halen : Everybody uses my stuff .
They just do n't like talking about it .
CNN : I 'm told you can hear things that most people can't with the naked ear .
Van Halen : I have selective hearing .
( Laughs )
CNN : I think a lot of men do !
Van Halen : Obviously , I 've lost a little bit , at very high frequencies -- which is kind of like a woman screaming at ya .
CNN : " Ed , did you take the trash out ? "
" Can you wipe the dishes ? "
Are you hearing anything ?
Van Halen :
What was that ?
( Laughs ) I do n't know .
I 'm blessed with a good pair of ears .
That 's how I fooled my piano teacher .
I 'd watch his fingers and I 'd listen to it , and I just kind of basically learned it by myself .
I can't read music .
Instead , I 'd do stuff inside the piano , do harmonics and all kinds of crazy things .
They used to put me in these annual piano contests down at Long Beach City College , and two years in a row , I won first prize -- out of like 5,000 kids !
The judges were like , " Very interesting interpretation ! " I thought I was playing it right .
But everything is open to interpretation .
Imagine if Beethoven had a tape recorder .
Then you 'd know exactly what he meant .
Maybe he meant ( singing the opening notes to the Fifth Symphony ) , " Da da da da " instead of " Boom boom boom boom ! "
Who knows .
CNN : Did you ever take formal guitar lessons ?
Van Halen : No .
That 's why I do all this crazy stuff .
It 's not taught .
CNN : Do you think you 'd approach music differently if you had taken guitar lessons ?
Van Halen : Probably .
But you only have 12 notes .
Do what you want with them .
CNN : What kind of music do you listen to when you 're at home ?
Van Halen : I do n't listen to anything , really .
Believe it or not , I 'm so slammed with ideas , and the man upstairs overloads me with stuff , so I 'm always doing my own thing .
CNN : How was it having Wolfie on the road with you on the last tour ?
He was 16 when he took over as Van Halen 's bass player in 2007 .
Van Halen :
It was a dream !
That kid is truly amazing .
I did name him after the right guy .
( Laughs )
CNN : He 's still in high school .
Did he have a tutor on the road ?
Van Halen : Yeah , he had four hours of school and then a gig at night .
He worked three times harder than any of us .
CNN : How was it touring with David Lee Roth after all these years ?
Van Halen :
It was great .
CNN : No smackdowns ?
Van Halen : No , no .
Everything went great .
It went smooth .
CNN : Is there going to be another Van Halen tour ?
Van Halen :
Oh , I know so .
I mean , we 're a band !
That was n't just a one - off thing .
It 's officially a band .
And Wolfgang Van Halen is the bass player .
Janie and I are getting married in June , and my son's going to graduate , and we 'll pick it up after that .
Obviously , I hope we record some new stuff .
I 'm writing , and just doing the same thing I always do .
CNN : Is Wolfie going to be in the wedding ?
Van Halen :
He 's going to be my best man .
My brother 's marrying us .
CNN : Oh , that 's right !
Alex ( the drummer in Van Halen ) is an ordained minister .
Van Halen : Yeah .
Reverend Al! ( Laughs )
We 're going to do it right here in the backyard .
Small , intimate wedding .
...
We 'll get a string quartet for part of it and a DJ for afterwards , although I 'm not much of a dancer .
CNN : Sounds like a very traditional , non -rock star - type of wedding .
So many people can pick out an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo , but not a lot of people know who you are as a human being .
Van Halen : I just consider myself slightly left - of - center .
I 'm not your average bear .
I -- what 's the word ?
I 'm not -- normal .
( Laughs ) I sound like Michael Jackson .
I 'm not like other guys .
CNN : You hate interviews , do n't you ?
Van Halen :
Well , believe it or not , I really do n't have much to say -- ' cause the equipment speaks for itself .
And so does the music .
CNN : If I play your new Wolfgang guitar , will I sound like you ?
Van Halen :
Why would you want to sound like anyone else ?
Get your own guitar .
They 're available !
All About Eddie Van Halen • Van Halen • David Lee Roth
Violence , bullying and tears :
How on earth could ' respectable ' parents let their children enter Channel 4's ' cruel ' experiment ?
Try to imagine ten boys and ten girls from differing backgrounds let loose to live in separate ' villages ' and told they can live without rules for two weeks .
A plot for a controversial new film , perhaps ?
Or a new play ?
No .
These are real children , from real families , allowed by their largely middle - class parents to take part in what has been described as a televised Lord Of The Flies for 2009 .
The youngsters - aged between eight and 11 - were left to decide everything and do everything for themselves .
And , surprise , surprise , the results of the Big Brother - style show for children were nothing short of terrifying .
Predictably , the producers of Boys And Girls Alone , which began on Channel 4 last night , are billing the four - part series as a fascinating TV experiment , which shows the differences between girls and boys when left to their own devices .
Violence :
In the boys ' camp , it was not long before blows were being exchanged
But children 's campaigners have accused programme makers of acting irresponsibly and exploiting children in their ever - growing quest for high ratings .
And it has to be said the show makes for uncomfortable viewing .
Within two days , some of the children were sobbing inconsolably .
Meanwhile , their parents watched on CCTV as their children exercised their newfound freedom , intervening only when events spiralled out of control .
In the boys ' house , it was not long before innocent horseplay turned to violence , with blows being exchanged .
In one scene , not to be aired , one boy even points a dinner knife at the other .
The girls , meanwhile , fared little better .
They split off into factions , with some of the older girls bullying the younger ones .
One girl is filmed sobbing : ' We got away from our parents to have fun , but it 's not fun .
It 's a nightmare . '
The series proved both agonising and revelatory for the parents who , having allowed their children to be placed in such a febrile atmosphere in the name of entertainment , watched from a distance as their children struggled with domestic tasks and dealt with the emotional fallout from relationships .
The producers say they were seeking to find out whether modern parents are producing a generation of mollycoddled ' cotton wool ' children .
But , while the format did indeed reveal intriguing differences between the sexes , questions remain about the long - term effects on the children involved .
The scene in the boys ' village was part Just William , part Lord Of The Flies
As Camila Batmanghelidjh , of the charity Kids Company , says : ' Any situation that leaves a group of young people without the mediating presence of a responsible adult is cruel and abusive . '
Liz Carnell , of the charity Bullying UK , adds : ' This just sounds like Big Brother Junior .
And considering the amount of bullying - related complaints we get about that show , it is certainly not an environment young people should be placed in . '
Liz Lammin , a 39 - year - old housewife from Redruth in Cornwall , has some regrets about allowing her son Matthew , nine , to take part in the show .
She thought he would be the target of bullies because of his red hair and excess weight .
Instead , her normally well - behaved little boy turned into a fractious , violent rebel , once allowed to live without rules .
She says : ' We went in on the third day and Matthew ran up to my husband , Neil , and hit him .
Then he turned and twice hit me , which he 's never done before .
I could n't believe how much he was swearing .
' When the girls moved into the boys ' village near the end of the two weeks , emotions were at such fever pitch that he shouted at one of them : " If you do n't f** * ing leave me alone , you f*** ing bitch , I 'll beat the c**p out of you . "
' This is the boy I was worried would be perceived as a country bumpkin .
I 've had to warn his grandparents ahead of the transmission because they will be shocked by his language .
Good intentions ?
Channel 4's commissioning editor said they wanted to create a village without adults where children could roam safely
' When Matthew came home to us he was a rude , arrogant monster .
It took us a long time to get back the little boy we put in there .
On the first night home , when we said it was bedtime , he said : " No .
There are no rules here . "
' He was frustrated and homesick .
More than half the boys wanted to leave ; one actually did .
As I followed Matthew round , trying to console him , I had a cameraman in my face .
' I was faced with a dilemma .
I knew if I pulled Matthew out early , he would be portrayed as a snivelling mummy 's boy , so I let him stay in .
But it turned him into a boy I hardly recognised . '
During filming , the children were placed in two enclosed ' villages ' in Cornwall , one for boys and one for girls , with three houses each .
The experiment ended with a ' prom ' in which they all dressed up .
One of the boys sobs as he pleads to be taken home
The programme was devised by Dominique Walker , Channel 4's commissioning editor for factual entertainment .
' We wanted to create a village without adults where children could roam free in safety , ' she says .
' The boys were more mollycoddled domestically , but although they fought more than the girls , they had more fun .
The girls were more bitchy and their arguments lasted a lot longer .
The girls did n't cry as much as the boys . '
After entering their village , the girls went to their store room , which contained a selection of food , picked out the ingredients for cakes and canapes and set to work baking .
Later that evening , they served up a wholesome dinner .
Over in the boys ' village , the scene was very different - part Just William , part Lord Of The Flies .
Experiment gone wrong :
Many of the children struggled with basic domestic tasks and ended up eating sweets and fizzy drinks
Grabbing toys from the store cupboard , they chased each other with water guns .
One boy fell in a duck pond and had to be fished out by another .
Soon , they were all drenched and had to change their clothes , dumping the sodden ones on the floor .
Nine - year - old Sid , the son of a boxing champion from Essex , was hungry but could n't work out how to plug the kettle in , so made a Pot Noodle using cold tap water .
The few boys who could cook heated up pizzas for themselves , but the rest turned to whatever needed the least preparation .
Mostly , they ate sweets and swigged fizzy drinks .
High on sugar and E - numbers , they became fractious and rows and scuffles broke out .
Trained chaperones were forced to intervene to break up fights .
The girls go on a shopping spree during their two weeks of freedom
So what of the parents who allowed their children to take part in such an ' experiment ? '
Far from being vulnerable or irresponsible , most were middle - class professionals , like Alison Wardropper , a consultant in genitourinary medicine at the University Hospital of North Durham , and her GP husband Fraser , who allowed their son William to take part .
It was William who first heard about the film .
' We were anxious about the whole thing , as we 've never been involved in television , ' says Alison .
' He wanted to do it as it was a once - in - a - lifetime experiment , but it was the after - effects that concerned us most . '
The parents sat in a building nearby the villages to watch events unfold .
Each had headphones linked to a microphone worn by their child .
There were also mikes in the rooms .
Cameras filmed the children and captured the boys ' swift descent into violence
Alison says : ' The most difficult thing for me to watch was when William was wandering around on his own .
I could see that he was playing Dr Who in his own mind .
I felt uncomfortable listening to everything he said .
I felt I was invading his privacy .
It was also hard being powerless to do anything . '
By day three , the children were finding that living without rules was n't such fun and many of the boys were crying and missing their parents .
To avert an emotional meltdown , the parents were encouraged to go in .
The mothers cleared up the mess in the boys ' village while the fathers played with the children .
At that point , Sid 's parents gave in to his demands to leave .
Alison , who has a daughter , Grace , 12 , was surprised to see how much William struggled with simple chores .
' The girls who took part were a lot more domesticated and orderly .
The boys were like ten separate people living together , but if they had a fight they 'd get over it quickly .
The girls gathered into groups and were unpleasant in a more targeted way .
' At home , William could make toast and tea and heat up soup , but in the house he struggled to open a tin of beans .
Another time , he grated cheese over still - frozen chips .
What it taught me is that we do too much for our children domestically . '
Meanwhile , there was tension between the girls ' mothers .
Debbie Beaumont , a 42 - year - old sales co-ordinator for an insurance broker , refuses to have a word said against her daughter Charley , 12 .
' She 's a leader , but that can come across as bullying .
At home , I 've often found her defiant .
She and another girl were the ringleaders in ostracising the youngest girl , Maddie , who had just turned eight .
' Maddie had daubed pink hearts on the walls , and Charley thought it was babyish .
There was a slight altercation between me and Maddie 's mum .
I told her that I have two older children , and once her daughter is a bit older she will see that this is nothing to worry about .
Soon , even the girl 's are abusing their newfound freedom
' I did n't think Charley was doing anything malicious .
Some of the girls , including Charley , trampled over the other girls ' beds , but they did n't destroy their property .
' It was n't nice to watch , but what do you expect when they 've been given no structure and are n't even eating the right food ?
The girls spent a lot of time bitching .
I do n't act like that - I work in an office and I never talk about other women in a negative way .
' My daughters come home from their all - girls ' secondary school with hair - raising tales .
It upsets me .
I think it 's partly TV shows they watch like Hollyoaks , where there 's constant rowing , and partly the speed of modern communications .
They 're always chatting to friends on MSN Messenger on the internet , or texting their friends . '
Maddie 's mum Simone MacLaine - Freeman , a 35 - year - old arts development officer from Sileby , near Loughborough , Leicestershire , admits to having qualms about allowing her daughter to participate .
' My fear was that it was going to be like Big Brother and was going to be invasive .
Although I did n't feel they were setting the children up for a nasty fall , there was one incident with Charley which was horrific .
I felt she was passively bullying Maddie , asking the other children if they liked Maddie or not .
She was trying to sow the seeds of doubt about my daughter .
12 - year - old Charley has been accused of bullying during the show
' It was hard to watch , but I let it go for a day or two .
Then I told one of the crew members that something must be done .
They suggested that I get together with Charley 's mother .
It was difficult as Charley 's mother implied that I was being over - protective .
' The producer finally stepped in and asked a chaperone to speak to Charley , so it finally came to an end . '
Adrian Pusey , a 47 - year - old sales rep from Mountsorrel , Leicestershire , also admits to some regrets about allowing his son , Jason , ten , to take part .
' Perhaps I 'm being naive , but I would expect any reputable programme maker to have the children 's welfare at heart .
I thought there would be defined limits beyond which they would not be able to go .
' But some of the things which went on were horrendous .
It was deeply upsetting to see Jason in tears because other children had run riot .
They kept spraying him with water and he got very upset .
Jason actually showed great maturity and not all children would have dealt with the complete chaos so well . '
Adrian 's wife Andrea , a complementary therapist , adds : ' When the girls and boys joined up together towards the end of the fortnight , I got to see them for the first time .
One of the girls threw a pizza at my son Jason .
And at the disco , one of the girls was doing a pole dance .
I thought : " You know what you 're doing " .
It was a shock .
I was amazed at how bitchy they were .'
Consent : Most of the parents were far from vulnerable or irresponsible .
Most were middle class professionals
Despite the relative sophistication of the girls , it was also clear that , emotionally , they were very much still children - which again challenges the wisdom of exposing them to a level of scrutiny which most adults would find hard to bear .
In one scene , Charley broke down and confessed a secret about her parents , who separated three years ago .
She revealed that she had known her mother had had an affair and had felt guilty that her father , then still living with the family , did n't know .
At that point , Debbie went in to the village to comfort Charley and explained that her father had , in fact , known about the situation .
' It was difficult watching her get so upset over the split , ' says Debbie with some understatement .
So what did the behaviour of the children reveal to trained eyes ?
The most startling finding was how much more aggressive the girls were than the boys , says clinical psychologist Dr David Schaich , who monitored the children 's welfare throughout filming .
' Recent research has indicated that girls follow rules and maintain standards .
That did n't materialise here .
The boys got into rough and tumble fights , then they 'd cry for their mums .
' The girls hardly cried at all and were extremely verbally aggressive and clique - ish in how they treated each other .
I was sad to see how concerned girls of this age were about their looks and body image .
You could see the beginnings of possible eating disorders . '
For 12 - year - old Charley , the thrill of ' being on TV ' was replaced by a heady dose of reality .
' I thought I 'd like it without adults , but I was surprised to find it was really hard , ' she says .
' My mum and I have grown closer now , and I help her at home when she asks me .
I really appreciate my mum and dad now .
I did n't realise how much you need your parents . '
Last night , a Channel 4 spokesman defended the show , saying : ' The children were monitored at all times and were never in any danger .
It has a number of uplifting moments .
It aims to show whether we are bringing up a generation of cotton - wool kids .
' It is a bit Lord Of The Flies , but there is no murdering . '
Just flying fists , tears and lashings of cruelty .
WASHINGTON , Jan. 26 ( UPI ) --
An independent body set up to monitor if U.S. federal agencies are protecting Americans ' civil liberties has been dormant since 2007 , USA Today reported Monday .
The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board , meant to be a watchdog on the civil liberties compliance of the U.S. departments of Defense , State , and Health and Human Services , has n't met publicly since 2006 and it no longer has members , the newspaper 's investigation revealed Monday .

In the meantime , the three departments have failed to comply with a 2007 law directing them to appoint civil liberties protection officers and report regularly to Congress on what they 're doing to make sure their programs do n't undermine the public 's rights and privacy , USA Today found .
James Dempsey , vice president of the Center for Democracy and Technology , said the lack of civil liberties and privacy compliance officers at the State and Health and Human Services departments is disturbing because the agencies handle passport and medical records .
U.S. President Barack Obama indicated after his election he wanted to give the oversight board subpoena power and to ensure sure agencies meet civil liberties rules , USA Today said .
I wish someone who has a good memory of these things and was there , would document that the key game design features of a DIKU are , if everyone is going to refer to MMOs as DIKU derivatives .
— a comment from Daniel Speed on Broken Toys » Wikicrap .
Glossing much here …
Edit : this article is getting updated on the fly as people add comments and reminiscences .
DikuMUD was derived from AberMUD , which was similar mechanics , but had more of a scavenger hunt mentality in some ways .
At its core , it is a class - based RPG with the principal classes being fighter , healer , wizard , thief .
( Later codebases added more ) .
It was heavily based on the combat portion of Dungeons and Dragons .
Advancement handled by earning experience points through combat , reaching a set amount of points , returning to town and “ levelling up , ” which unlocked new abilities .
Classes were immutable ( though eventually systems such as remorting , etc were added ) .
Rewards for killing things also included equipment , which affected your stats and damage capability .
If you reached the maximum level , common cultural practice was that you were invited to become a game admin ( this practice dates back to much earlier , and existed in some form in MUD1 ) .
Combat was generally on a fixed rate , with “ faster attacks ” in cruder systems consisting of actually running the same attack multiple times in a row ( so you could only do damage on multiples : 1x , 2x , 3x , 4x , 5x , 6x , 7x , 8x , 9x ) .
More advanced systems added true variable interval attacks .
Tactics were centered around controlling which target the mob was attacking , and using special state - affecting attacks that did things like trigger periods of indefensibility ( stun ) , periods of damage multipliers , etc , using stances .
Much of the gameplay consisted of moving about solo or in groups attacking monsters for XP and loot .
Grouping was a typical strategy because it was a large force multiplier , permitting players to kill targets much more powerful than they were alone .
Because of this , an array of systems including level limits on equipment , on grouping , and even on monster attacking were in place .
A command called “ consider ” told you whether the monster was too easy or too hard .
Monsters spawned originally on time intervals called resets .
At first , the whole zone reset at once , then resets evolved in Diku - derived codebases into per-monster timers .
( A zone was a collection of world data , including rooms , monsters , and items — each zone could at first have 100 of each . ) .
There evolved the practice of “ rare spawns ” and eventually “ rare drops ” as well .
Weapons , potions , and the like were all based on simply on performing spell effects , in the fashion today referred to as a “ proc . ”
They were hardcoded back then , however .
Players had the typical array of D&D stats , with the addition of “ move points , ” which were literally spent by moving from room to room and based on the weight of stuff you were carrying and your strength .
You had to rest to recover these .
Death in Dikus involved losing all your gear , because everything stayed in the corpse .
It also could set you back levels , as it cost you a fraction of your experience points .
You respawned back in town at the central spawn point , and in later codebases at your “ guildhall ” ( a class - specific spawn point and levelling trainer ) .
You then had to do a “ corpse run ” to get back to your body naked and reequip your gear .
In an inheritance from aspects of AberMuds , you could scavenge gear from the “ donation room ” which was a place where excess gear nobody wanted ( usually from outlevelling or from trash drops ) went when it was donated or “ sacrificed ” by other players .
This was not the only means of trying to keep the economy balanced .
Every item had a cash value ( the value for which it was sold in NPC shops ) .
In some Dikus , you got a fixed limit on what you could save with your character , said limit based on a maximum cash value .
If you saved your character at a point where you were in excess of this limit , you were saved with nothing .
In others , you simply could not save your character state .
( State saving was manual , and you had to go to an inn to do it ) .
There were also systems whereby your save time was limited , because you had to pay “ rent ” at the inn where you logged out .
The rent was proportional to the stuff you had , which drove people back to the game to keep earning gold .
Despite this huge sink , it was common for the economy to spiral out of control ( termed “ mudflation ” ) and for the admins to wipe all items or even all characters .
It was also common for the mud to crash , and corpses and stuff on the ground did not persist , since Dikus were a character state system .
DikuMuds came with stock areas , the best known of which is Midgaard , the main city .
Many mudders from the time period would judge a DikuMUD based on whether Midgaard was the first thing they saw .
Midgaard came to also feature stock tutorials called “ mud school ” which saw you through the first fight .
Zones were built by editing text files , though eventually forms of online editing tools ( “ OLC , ” for “ online creation ” ) were added .
Because map building was relatively asy , many Dikus were based on popular hack n slash fantasy fiction such as Forgotten Realms , Fred Saberhagen , Wheel of Time , etc .
DikuMUDs did not come out of the box with any quests , because they were not a programmable game engine .
They were about combat and levelling up .
There was no crafting either .
They did come with good chat features , grouping , etc. “ Clans ” were a common addition — you would call them guilds today , except that they were formed by admin command , not formed freely by players .
( Honestly , I am not sure where free - form clan formation came from .
I know we did it on LegendMUD , and we did it in UO , but I do n’t even remember which came first ! )
Believe it or not , Dikus DID have simple pets out of the box ( usually summoned and non-persistent ) .
They also had hunger and thirst ( with a requirement to eat and drink regularly for good health ) , containers , inventory , in - game messaging and bulletin boards , chat channels ( at first just via “ shout ” ) and so on .
They were quite sociable , because of the grouping requirements , the corpse mechanics , and the move rate factor .
Towns tended to have fountains in them so you could drink and rest , for example , and people would gather there .
Eventually Diku games added questing engines , then scripting languages ( see Worlds of Carnage ) , etc , and diversity developed .
Because they were functional games with content out of the box , many “ stock muds ” were created , which had little differentiation from one another .
If you knew some C you could customize the game some , and the single commonest means of doing so was to add more classes , more levels , and more player races .
It got to be a common sight to see games advertising “ 20 classes , 30 races , and 500 levels !!!!! ” without actually offering different gameplay .
It is important to realize that Dikus were the least flexible codebase at the time .
The other dominant codebases were built to be programmable platforms out of the box : MUSH , MOO , and LPMuds all had significantly greater capabilities and flexibility .
They were “ scriptable ” out of the box , had online creation support rather than requiring you to create content in flat text files , and most importantly , the core rulesets for a game were written “ in the platform , ” using the softcode tools that were available .
Because of this , tracing the history of a given mud feature backwards will usually find that it did n’t originate on Dikus .
That said , Diku codebases did eventually popularize many of the major developments in muds .
Procedural zones had been done before ; in Dikus , you saw 1,000 room procedural dungeons .
Instancing , public quests , player housing ( in the style we know today , as opposed to UGC systems ) , the modern scripting system model , the modern persistence system , and aspects of zone - based PvP all were developed or hugely elaborated on DikuMUDs .
In addition , once scripting hit , DikuMUDs arguably saw the flowering of quests to a level unseen in other codebases ( this is of course , a matter of opinion ! ) .
Diku derivatives gained things that got going first on other codebases , like banks , auction houses , PvP systems , player - formed clans , moods systems , player government systems , overhead ASCII maps , and even tags for sound effects .
Many Dikus had strict enforcement of rules regarding roleplaying , and even required players to stay in character at all times , or submit essays as applications to play .
Despite this , the core remained hack n slash , with many terming Diku gameplay “ roll - playing . ”
If Abers set the template , Diku was the root from which a huge portion of muds sprang , because they were so easy to get running ( though hard to customize ) .
As the initial code was release as open source ( though not under what we would today call an open license ) , many variants were made and also released , and many of these then also resulted in derivatives , etc .
When I did the tally in the late 90s , Diku - derived muds accounted for around 60 % of all muds running .
Considering there were at least three other major codebases and traditions with radically different architectures and significantly more power and flexibility , this was quite an achievement .
By the end of their dominance , the Dikus were beginning to rival other codebases such as MOOs and LPMuds in flexibility , whilst still retaining a simpler core architecture than either .
Because they were template fill - in - the - blank muds , most of them were very similar , and had to differentiate solely on their worldbuilding and fiction .
However , few altered the basic combat equation .
Among other terms “ tanking ” “ nuking ” and the like were common .
( Thieves were sort of a nuker , in some ways — they were used to initiate combat with a “ backstab ” attack that did up to quadruple damage — they then they had to get out of the way !
They were also used as scouts because they could move without triggering aggro ) .
In fact , “ kiting ” also took place quite a lot , by leading high level aggressive mobs into low level areas .
Everquest was created by players of DikuMUDs ( specifically Forgotten Realms ones — Sojourn , Toril , Duris ) , and even had the same wording for many server - generated messages ( “ it begins to rain , ” which was completely superfluous for a 3d game ! ) .
It played so similarly to its inspirations that some wondered if it actually was a DikuMUD , with graphics added on .
See here for the resolution of that ( false ) rumor .
Meridian 59 had DikuMUD players on its team .
UO had three Diku players on the original core team ( and a couple folks from other codebases ) .
Of the early MMORPGs , UO played the least like a Diku , whereas the line of inheritance from Diku to EQ and thence to WoW is completely undeniable .
In the end , the central elements of phase - based combat , combat states , cool - down based special attacks , tank - healer - nuker triad , and basic aggro management are what you play today in WoW .
A Diku player from the late mudding period would feel completely at home if you just gave them slash commands and a text box .
They ’d be astonished by the number of quests , would think the crafting system was insane , and would think that the entire PvP system was either a rip from an EmlenMUD or was teleporting you to HoloMUD , in the case of the battlefields .
Even raids would feel a lot like a “ group of groups ” tackling a level 50 , albeit at a scale smaller ; I recall participating in a “ raidish ” encounter on Worlds of Carnage against a dragon in a tower which nearly “ wiped , ” consisting of a half dozen maxed out characters and an assortment of lower ones .
My character , who was the lowest there by far , happened to get in the final blow and was the sole survivor , and gained five levels in one fell swoop .
While it is true that many of these core elements stretch back to AD&D , the fact is that as a pen and paper game , AD&D played quite differently when in the hands of an expert group .
Similarly , even though there were plenty of of hack n slash tropes in place in AberMuds and various LPMud mudlibs ( a mudlib is more or less a ruleset … that ’s a whole other article ! ) , or in standalone games such as the Wizardry and Might & Magic series , there was a very specific “ feel ” to how Dikus played , and this remained even across all the many children codebases ( the DikuMUD home page has a family tree of these ) .
In the end , if you play modern MMORPGs , you are playing what to a veteran feels strongly reminiscent of what they saw when they headed out of Midgaard and towards Haon Dor to go kill giant spiders , in 1991 .
Hope that answers your question !
Everything above is from memory , so dinos , feel free to jump in and correct me .

Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 128 -- America 's Ridiculously Big Economy .
The World 's Greatest Economic Engine -
The United States economy ( using 2004 World Bank numbers ) is larger than the second ( Japan ) , third ( Germany ) , fourth ( United Kingdom ) , and fifth ( France ) largest economies , combined .
If you add the sixth ( Italy ) , seventh ( China ) , eighth ( Spain ) , ninth ( Canada ) , tenth ( India ) , eleventh ( South Korea ) , twelfth ( Mexico ) , thirteenth ( Australia ) , fourteenth ( Brazil ) , fifteenth ( Russia ) , sixteenth ( Netherlands ) , seventeenth ( Switzerland ) , eighteenth ( Belgium ) , nineteenth ( Sweden ) , and twentieth ( Turkey ) largest economies together , the sum is still smaller than the United States economy .
The disparity becomes even more stark when you compare the relative population sizes .
This explains how the United States can spend such a relatively small amount of our GDP on our military and still have , far and away , the largest military force in the world .
It also explains how the U.S. can offer , far and away , more than any other country , in economic aid to poorer countries , yet still get criticized for not doing enough .
It is also worth noting that the American economy has now experienced 9 straight quarters of GDP growth over 3 % ( with some quarters much higher ) .
At consistent 3 % growth , with an economy so gargantuan , the U.S. will grow by roughly 350 billion dollars in a single year .
That 's like adding an entire Croatia ( a great country to visit , incidentally ) in a single year .
Compound that 3 % growth rate for a few years , and it's like adding a Canada , a Turkey , and an Ireland , combined .
Of course , those economies are also typically growing over that time , but you get the idea .

This category of graph is also important for another reason .
Liberals , greens , one - worlders , etc. , love to lament how the U.S. has x % of the population but generates >x % of pollution , greenhouse gases , nuclear waste , etc .
Or that we have >x % of the world 's wealth .
But they conveniently omit that we also generate >x % of the world 's output , so of course we will generate >x % of the world 's waste .
And when you net out the math , we are actually very efficient producers generating relatively less waste for our output .
To love the planet requires a love of capitalism .

Greedy gringos .
Shame on you for not sharing your wealth with other pure ... oops .. poor nations .
Now why do all these people want to move to America - the land of evil , destruction , greed , and other vices ?

No matter how accurate this chart is , it still displays what happened economically in the last 100 years .
The future may hold completely different story .

You forgot Taiwan 's $ 576 Billion economy .
Posted by : Me at August 11 , 2005 10:48 AM
Using the World Bank data , they did n't include Taiwan .
In the CIA data , they did .
A few discrepancies here and there , actually , between the data sets .

Is n't 3 % growth more like adding a Sweden every year ?
Croatia is more like every month .
