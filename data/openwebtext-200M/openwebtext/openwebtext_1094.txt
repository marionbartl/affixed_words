Traditionally , storage devices have managed the blocks of data given to them without being concerned about how the system used those blocks .
Increasingly , though , there is value in making more information available to storage devices ; in particular , there can be advantages to telling the device when specific blocks no longer contain data of interest to the host system .
The " discard " concept was added to the kernel one year ago to communicate this information to storage devices .
One year later , it seems that the original discard idea will not survive contact with real hardware - especially solid - state storage devices .
There are a number of use cases for the discard functionality .
Large , " enterprise - class " storage arrays can implement virtual devices with a much larger storage capacity than is actually installed in the cabinet ; these arrays can use information about unneeded blocks to reuse the physical storage for other data .
The compcache compressed in - memory swapping mechanism needs to know when specific swap slots are no longer needed to be able to free the memory used for those slots .
Arguably , the strongest pressure driving the discard concept comes from solid - state storage devices ( SSDs ) .
These devices must move data around on the underlying flash storage to implement their wear - leveling algorithms .
In the absence of discard - like functionality , an SSD will end up shuffling around data that the host system has long since stopped caring about ; telling the device about unneeded blocks should result in better performance .
The sad truth of the matter , though , is that this improved performance does not actually happen on SSDs .
There are two reasons for this :
At the ATA protocol level , a discard request is implemented by a " TRIM " command sent to the device .
For reasons unknown to your editor , the protocol committee designed TRIM as a non-queued command .
That means that , before sending a TRIM command to the device , the block layer must first wait for all outstanding I/O operations on that device to complete ; no further operations can be started until the TRIM command completes .
So every TRIM operation stalls the request queue .
Even if TRIM were completely free , its non-queued nature would impose a significant I /O performance cost .
( It 's worth noting that the SCSI equivalent to TRIM is a tagged command which does n't suffer from this problem ) .
With current SSDs , TRIM appears to be anything but free .
Mark Lord has measured regular delays of hundreds of milliseconds .
Delays on that scale would be most unwelcome on a rotating storage device .
On an SSD , hundred - millisecond latencies are simply intolerable .
One would assume that the second problem will eventually go away as the firmware running in SSDs gets smarter .
But the first problem can only be fixed by changing the protocol specification , so any possible fix would be years in the future .
It 's a fact of life that we will simply have to live with .
There are a few proposals out there for how we might live with the performance problems associated with discard operations .
Matthew Wilcox has a plan to reimplement the whole discard concept using a cache in the block layer .
Rather than sending discard operations directly to the device , the block layer will remember them in its own cache .
Any new write operations will then be compared against the discard cache ; whenever an operation overwrites a sector marked for discard , the block layer will know that the discard operation is no longer necessary and can , itself , be discarded .
That , by itself , would reduce the number of TRIM operations which must be sent to the device .
But if the kernel can work to increase locality on block devices , performance should improve even more .
One relatively easy - to - implement example would be actively reusing recently - emptied swap slots instead of scattering swapped pages across the swap device .
As Matthew puts it : " there 's a better way for the drive to find out that the contents of a block no longer matter -- write some new data to it . "
In Matthew 's scheme , the block layer would occasionally flush the discard cache , sending the actual operations to the device .
The caching should allow the coalescing of many operations , further improving performance .
Greg Freemyer , instead , suggests that flushing the discard cache could be done by a user - space process .
Greg says :
Assuming we have a persistent bitmap in place , have a background scanner that kicks in when the cpu / disk is idle .
It just continuously scans the bitmap looking for contiguous blocks of unused sectors .
Each time it finds one , it sends the largest possible unmap down the block stack and eventually to the device .
When normal cpu / disk activity kicks in , this process goes to sleep .
A variant of this approach was posted by Christoph Hellwig , who has implemented batched discard support in XFS .
Christoph's patch adds a new ioctl( ) which wanders through the filesystem 's free - space map and issues large discard operations on each of the free extents .
The advantage of doing things at the filesystem level is that the filesystem already knows which blocks are uninteresting ; there is no additional accounting required to obtain that information .
This approach will also naturally generate large operations ; larger discards tend to suit the needs of the hardware better .
On the other hand , regularly discarding all of the free space in a filesystem makes it likely that some time will be spent telling the device to discard sectors which it already knows to be free .
It is far too soon to hazard a guess as to which of these approaches - if any - will be merged into the mainline .
There is a fair amount of coding and benchmarking work to be done still .
But it is clear that the code which is in current mainline kernels is not up to the task of getting the best performance out of near - future hardware .
Your editor feels the need to point out one possibly - overlooked aspect of this problem .
An SSD is not just a dumb storage device ; it is , instead , a reasonably powerful computer in its own right , running complex software , and connected via what is , essentially , a high - speed , point - to - point network .
Some of the more enterprise - oriented devices are more explicitly organized this way ; they are separate boxes which hook into an IP - based local net .
Increasingly , the value in these devices is not in the relatively mundane pile of flash storage found inside ; it's in the clever firmware which causes the device to look like a traditional disk and , one hopes , causes it to perform well .
Competition in this area has brought about some improvements in this firmware , but we should see a modern SSD for what it is : a computer running proprietary software that we put at the core of our systems .
It does not have to be that way ; Linux does not need to talk to flash storage through a fancy translation layer .
We have our own translation layer code ( UBI ) , and a few filesystems which can work with bare flash .
It would be most interesting to see what would happen if some manufacturer were to make competitive , bare - flash devices available as separate components .
The kernel could then take over the flash management task , and our developers could turn their attention toward solving the problem correctly instead of working around problems in vendor solutions .
Kernel developers made an explicit choice to avoid offloading much of the network stack onto interface hardware ; it would be nice to have a similar choice regarding the offloading of low - level storage management .
In the absence of that choice , we 'll have no option but to deal with the translation layers offered by hardware vendors .
The results look unlikely to be optimal in the near future , but they should still end up being better than what we have today .
Adam - a new film that portrays autism
By Laura Schocker
BBC News Magazine
Hollywood movies rarely deal with disability - except for autism , when characters are typically shown as having special intelligence .
Why do we like to think everyone with autism is especially gifted ?
In one evening , he memorised every name and number from A to G in the phone book .
While waiting for a meal in a restaurant , he committed the entire tableside jukebox to memory .
A dropped box of toothpicks ?
One glance and he is certain that 246 have spilt on the floor .
His mind was like a computer and , for years , Dustin Hoffman 's Rain Man character has often been the first reference point for autism .
Dustin Hoffman 's Raymond Babbitt - setting the mould for autistic savant characters
Other films since this 1988 release have depicted similar areas of brilliance that are sometimes associated with autism , known as savant qualities .
In 1998 , for instance , Mercury Rising told the story of a nine - year - old autistic boy who used his savant abilities to crack a $ 2bn encryption code .
And in Mozart and the Whale , a 2006 film about two savants with Asperger 's syndrome , a high - functioning type of autism , Josh Hartnett 's character could glance at his watch and then calculate exactly how long he has had his job as a taxi driver .
The link between autism and savant skills in cinemas is clear , but does art really imitate life ?
Do people with autism always have an amazing intellectual skill ?
" The simple answer is no , " says Dr Stuart Murray professor of contemporary literature and film at the University of Leeds and author of the book Representing Autism .
" By far , the majority of people with autism do not have any kind of savant ability . "
' Autism celebrities '
In fact , the current estimate is that one or two in 200 people with an autism spectrum disorder have a savant talent , according to the National Autistic Society , although the exact numbers are still unknown in the UK .
WHAT IS AUTISM ?
A developmental disability that influences how a person communicates and relates to others
Often referred to as a spectrum disorder - because it affects people differently Asperger syndrome is a type of autism at the less severe end of that spectrum
More than half a million people in the UK have an autism spectrum disorder Source : National Autistic Society
Well known savants - including Kim Peek , who partially inspired Rain Man , Steven Wiltshire , a London artist who can recall entire cityscapes after brief observation , and Daniel Tammet , author of Born on a Blue Day , about living as an autistic savant - are the exception to the autism rule , Dr Murray says .
" These people are almost like autism celebrities , " he says .
" It 's not something that crops up very much in the day to day life of living with autism . "
So if autistic savants are the exception and not the norm , why are they are they so over - represented in films ?
" It 's a very sexy way of looking at autism , " says Jonathan Kaufman , president of Disability Works in the US and technical consultant for Adam , a new Hollywood film featuring a leading character with autism .
While his work with Adam , which went on general release in the UK at the weekend , was about capturing the day - to - day nuances of a person with Asperger 's - something he wishes would happen more often - he understands why many films have seized on savants .
" It focuses on the almost superhuman nature of the disability itself , " he says .
" Somebody who is gifted has always had a place in society . "
They tend to be the stories audiences want , says Dr Murray .
Films about disabilities typically focus on two types of story lines , he says .
Either : the disability provides some kind of incredible skill or quality that " makes up " for the negative , or
the person finds a way to " rise above " adversity " It does n't seem to be as bad to be severely autistic if you 're also skilled at maths or music , " he says .
" If it seems to be that with your disability comes an extraordinary ability , it takes away the worst aspects of being disabled . "
Artistic licence
This can be a comfort to audiences .
Stephen Wiltshire in a BBC documentary called Fragments of Genius " Everybody who is not disabled is fundamentally very scared by the possibility of becoming disabled , " says Dr Murray .
But what about people who do have autism ?
While mainstream movies with autistic characters may increase awareness about the disability , how does it affect what the public expect of the condition ?
" I have spoken to many families who say that they feel really depressed and devastated when they get this portrayal , " says Uta Frith , emeritus professor of cognitive development at the University College London .
While she understands films have artistic license to create compelling stories , the aftermath can be difficult for parents of children with autism .
" It seems almost like their fault that their child is n't like that . "
And it can go beyond childhood .
Robyn Steward , a 22 - year - old in London with Asperger 's syndrome says some people still think she 's the Rain Man .
" People expect you , as an autistic person , to be really good at maths , or a walking calculator , " she says .
In reality , she does n't care much for numbers .
" Everyone is an individual and has their own interests and not everybody is a savant .
So maybe people see it in Rain Man .
But that 's not the full story . "
ASPERGER'S AND AUTISM
Many of recent films about autism have focused on characters with Asperger syndrome , says Dr Murray People with Aspergers tend to have average or above average intelligence , but struggle to read social signals or understand jokes , metaphor or sarcasm In Adam , for instance , Rose Byrne , who plays Adam 's love interest , asks him , " Could you give me a hug ? "
He says yes and stands there until she makes things a bit clearer - " Adam , I 'd like you to give me a hug . "
Asperger 's syndrome
What type of story would Steward like to see on the big screen ?
Something a bit closer to her own experience , maybe with a character diagnosed later in life , she says .
Dr Murray agrees .
As a father of two children on the autistic spectrum , he says he relates more to something like The Black Balloon , an Australian film released last year .
The story focuses on a family living with an autistic son and depicts scenes with the boy running down the street naked or throwing himself down on the supermarket floor .
It may not be as romantic as the story of a maths genius , but it 's the reality , says Dr Murray .
" We 've all had the supermarket thing happen .
This rings true to us in a way that somebody doing the square root of a million and nine does n't , " he says .
The film was not a box office hit in the UK .
It went straight to DVD .
Here is a selection of your comments .
My brother is severely autistic but we have recently found he does have a special ability - he can tell you what day of the week any day in history was .
Ok , it 'll never make a Hollywood blockbuster , but hopefully we can entertain some people in the queue at Sainsbury 's rather than lying on the floor like he has done for the past 16 years !
Dave Howarth , Leatherhead , Surrey
My cousin is autistic and has an amazing ability to do jigsaws ; she might start in the top left corner and completes the jigsaw row by row until she reaches the bottom right corner .
She just seems to instinctively know exactly where each piece fits in the overall , 1000 piece plus , picture .
So , it appears she has outstanding visual and spatial abilities but we cannot fully understand them , or her , as she can not speak to us .
I think this lack of verbal communication makes it difficult for people to identify with her , perhaps not making her , or other children with severe autism , ideal heroes for films .
Josie , Bristol I do n't think there is anything wrong with portraying autistic people as being gifted .
It may not be factually correct but offsets a lot of the otherwise negative information around about autism .
It is possible for people with autism to live full and happy ( if different ) lives .
When parents of children with autism find out that their child is autistic they are bombarded with scare stories about how difficult the rest of their lives are going to be .
It is good to have messages of hope out there and important to always keep a positive perspective when dealing with autism .
Charlie Browne , Ireland
My son , aged six has Asperger 's Syndrome .
He is of above average intelligence and does not have super human powers !
However , like many on the autistic spectrum he has a " special " interest , in my son 's case in cars .
From a young age he could identify most makes and models of vehicle , and I am channelling that interest to help him with areas of academic life that he struggles with , such as maths .
People do n't see him as " autistic " they see this obsession as part of his personality .
His school report described him as having a " charming personality " and " popular " .
All I want is for my son to have a happy , fulfilling life , and romanticising conditions such as Asperger 's and autistic spectrum disorders does nothing to help this !
Rachel , Bristol , England I am the father of a mildly autistic son who is now six years old , not Asperger 's but Classic Kanners .
I am always searching for something that reflects the type of autism my boy has .
The Black Balloon was a great film but shows severe autism .
I would like to heartily recommend the Dutch film " Ben X " ( with English subtitles ) which portrays a socially functioning but autistic teenager .
Please can we have more like films like this one with it 's realistic portrayal rather than Hollywood Glamour stories .
Paul Bruff , London I have taught children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder for four years and while it 's true that some are quite intelligent ( though hard to measure ) very , very few possess amazing super - skills .
It is an unfair expectation and one that actually hinders society 's willingness to grapple with the issue .
The truly gifted have a chance of obtaining public support ; the average get lost in the morass of official apathy and ignorance .
Keith Giunta , Camden , USA
Your article asks ' if autistic savants are the exception and not the norm , why are they are they so over - represented in films ? ' - that would be because if films represented real life then most of us would n't bother to watch .
You do n't walk down the street and see car chases , serial killers , and spies on every corner , but the day to day reality most of us live is simply not movie material .
I suspect that the day to day reality of autism would be much the same .
Shiz , Cheshire , UK Hollywood tends to avoid stories about physical disability too - except blindness .
In " Scent of a Woman " Al Pacino plays a blind veteran whose sense of smell is greatly enhanced so that he can tell what perfume any woman is wearing .
" Daredevil " has Ben Affleck 's blind superhero able to use his advanced sense of hearing almost as sonar that gives him the ability to " see " his surroundings .
There are exceptions of course , but with blindness too cinema tries to give people pleasing stories : " do n't worry , they may be blind , but by extension they get superpowers ! "
Shane , Mayo , Ireland I wish I had amazing skills with my autistic spectrum disorders !
Sadly I just get problems with communicating , confusion with numbers and the added bonus of having walking outside be akin to an extreme sport .
Still , I 've got lots of supportive friends and family , and a great job , so what more do I need .
Sharon , London , UK
My son who suffers from the autistic condition Asperger 's Syndrome does not have super human powers .
He struggled at school and at 29 still cannot add up or tell the time .
Yet he can tell you everything you need to know ( director / producer / date / music score etc ) about a film he is interested in , and there are many .
Sue Birch , Mont de Marsan France I have Asperger 's and went to a special needs school for it .
Most of the other people there had at least one thing that they were brilliant at , not at savant levels but certainly well above average .
In addition to maths , science there was also experts in music , art , computing and stereo equipment to name but a few .
By the way , I 'm 25 with a full time job ( as an engineer ) and a reasonably successful social life .
Nowadays I just look upon my Asperger 's as just another part of my personality .
Alan Munro , Inverness
There is another film that gives a more accurate portrayal of autism in adults and is also a fantastic film - Snow Cake starring Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver , which again never made it to cinemas in this country but is available on DVD .

Collecting nearly $ 318,000 a year , the former head of Los Angeles ’ Department of Water and Power tops a list of 841 city pension recipients paid six - figure benefits , according to newly obtained records .
And , like many of the retirees , former DWP General Manager Ronald Deaton will be paid more beginning this summer -- boosting his annual retirement pay to more than $ 327,000 -- because of annual cost - of - living increases , records and interviews show .
New DWP pension data provide a fuller picture of the city ’s largest retirement packages at a time when City Hall is cutting services , the public is being hit with recession - driven tax increases to cover government budget shortfalls and rising public pension costs are under close scrutiny .
The Times previously reported that nearly 600 pensioners received $ 100,000 a year from the city ’s police , fire and general government retirement plans .
The new data from the city ’s utility adds close to 250 names to the list , which includes retirees or , in some cases , beneficiaries .

Former DWP Assistant General Manager Frank Salas ranks second on the list , receiving about $ 290,000 a year .
Councilman Bernard C. Parks , a former Los Angeles police chief and head of the city ’s budget committee , is third .
The Times reported in May that Parks , 65 , who has publicly warned about soaring payroll and pension costs , received $ 265,000 a year in retirement payments on top of his $ 178,789 council salary .
With a cost - of - living adjustment that took effect this month , Parks ’ pension has grown to $ 273,000 annually , roughly 10 % more than his final pay as police chief , records show .

In addition , Parks , who is serving a second four - year council term , is participating in a civilian pension plan as a councilman , officials confirmed .
That could add tens of thousands of dollars per year to his total city retirement income .
Parks ’ eligibility for a second pension -- and the amount -- would depend on how long he serves , his final salary and his age when he collects it , officials said .
Parks did not respond to an interview request .
City employee groups stress that six - figure retirees like Parks and Deaton are a small fraction of pensioners .
Most collect far less , typically about $ 40,000 for civilian retirees and close to $ 50,000 for former police officers , firefighters and DWP workers .
Also , officials note that career city employees do n’t normally receive Social Security payments , which also are adjusted yearly to offset increases in the cost of living .

“ For the most part , the high pensions go to people who are not in the unions .
They are basically senior management folks , ” said Barbara Maynard , spokeswoman for a coalition of city unions .
“ The vast majority of those we represent are frankly rank - and - file , hardworking people with modest pensions . ”
Still , the recession , the erosion of private - sector retirement benefits , and state and local budget cuts have given critics fresh ammunition to attack what they contend are overly generous government pensions .
“ We should never , ever design a pension formula that provides more for a person when they retire than when they are working .
It defies any common sense , ” said Marcia Fritz , vice president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility , a nonprofit pension reform group headed by former GOP Assemblyman Keith Richman .
“ But that ’s what we ’re finding ” in some school systems and public safety agencies , Fritz said .

The group has publicized more than 5,000 names of state and local government pension recipients across the state collecting more than $ 100,000 .
Fritz said high - end public pensioners are worthy of attention .
They include “ people who were advising , in closed - door labor negotiations . . . negotiating benefits , ” she said .
“ These are the ones that made this whole thing happen . ”
Deaton was a well - regarded executive who served in key city positions , including chief legislative analyst , over more than 40 years .
He said his benefits flow from a bargain he struck in the 1960s , when he walked into the DWP as a young junior administrative assistant .
His pension takes into account his long service , career advancement and final salary ( about $ 345,000 ) , he noted .
“ It was a deal made at the beginning of my career , not the end of my career , ” he said .
“ Because you happen to get up to the top , I do n’t think you should be paid any differently . ”

A looming jump in city pension costs , attributed largely to sharp declines in pension investment values , has prompted a major review of retirement plans at City Hall .
One recent projection warned that the share of the city general fund receipts required by two large pension funds would jump from 15 % this year to 33 % in 2013 - 14 .
That would amount to an increase of nearly $ 1 billion , making pension contributions the fastest - growing area of city spending , said Asst.
City Administrative Officer Tom A. Coultas , an employee relations specialist .
“ It ’s perfectly clear from our standpoint , design changes need to be made , ” he said .
“ The question is how much of a correction is necessary ” to ensure that pension programs can be sustained .
Recent market gains and accounting changes have eased the financial blow somewhat .
And a plan to cut 2,400 city jobs also could help control costs .
Still , recommendations for pension changes , expected to be sent to the mayor and City Council in September , will probably include some combination of reduced benefits and adjusted contribution rates for many new city employees , Coultas said .

There are legal and practical limitations to the changes that could be made .
Court rulings generally protect benefits provided to retirees and promised to current employees , officials say .
Altering pension plans involves negotiations with unions and , in some cases , voter approval .
Ironically , Parks , one of City Hall ’s more fiscally conservative voices , has been among those warning about rising pensions .
During the recent budget battle , Parks said that soaring payroll and pension costs have brought the city to a “ breaking point . ”
Without swift and significant structural changes to city finances , he wrote on his website , the city could risk insolvency .
Maynard , the union spokeswoman , said labor groups would work with city leaders to craft a solution .
“ Clearly , there is a problem . ”

The larger issue , she argued , is how vulnerable retirement accounts have become for many Americans , particularly in the private sector .
“ We need to lift all workers up to make sure they have a modest , secure pension .
Not take away from those who do . ”

Details about a U.S. Secret Service safe house for the First Family -- to be used in a national emergency -- were found to have leaked out on a LimeWire file - sharing network recently , members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee were told this morning .
Also unearthed on LimeWire networks in recent days were presidential motorcade routes and a sensitive but unclassified document listing details on every nuclear facility in the country , Robert Boback , CEO of Tiversa Inc. told committee members .
The disclosures prompted the chairman of the committee , Rep. Edolphus Towns , ( D - N.Y. ) , to call for a ban on the use of peer - to - peer ( P2P ) software on all government and contractor computers and networks .
" For our sensitive government information , the risk is simply too great to ignore , " said Towns who plans to introduce a bill to enforce just such a P2P ban .
Tiversa is a Cranberry Township , Pa. - based provider of P2P monitoring services .
In the past , it has served up dramatic examples of highly sensitive information found on file - sharing networks .
In January for instance , the company disclosed how it had discovered sensitive details about the President 's helicopter , Marine One , on an Iranian computer after a document leaked out over a P2P network .
Today 's hearing continued in that vein , with Tiversa providing new sensational examples of leaked information .
Boback showed off a document , apparently from a senior executive of a Fortune 500 company , listing every acquisition the company planned to make -- along with how much it was willing to pay .
Also included in the document were still - private details about the company 's financial performance .
Boback also showed numerous documents listing Social Security numbers and other personal details on 24,000 patients at a health care system , as well as FBI files , including surveillance photos of an alleged Mafia hit man that were leaked while he was on trial .
He demonstrated to members of the committee how pedophile predators troll file - sharing networks looking for images and data .
Speaking with Computerworld before the hearing , Boback said that all of the information was readily available on LimeWire 's file - sharing network after apparently being leaked .
The data on the nuclear sites was found on computers associated with four IP addresses in France , though it is not immediately clear where the data came from .
The files containing information about the president and his family had Barack Obama 's seal on it and a July date .
Though the information was not classified , it was sensitive enough that under normal circumstances it would not have been available even via a Freedom of Information Act request , he said .
This is the third time that the House Oversight committee has held a hearing on the topic of data leaks on P2P networks .
The last hearing was two years ago and featured similar revelations from Tiversa and others .
The problem is well understood , but it remains difficult to stop .
The leaks typically occur when a user installs a P2P client such as Kazaa , LimeWire , BearShare , Morpheus or FastTrack on a computer for the purposes of sharing music and other files with others on the network .
In many cases , users inadvertently expose not just the files they want to share , but also every other file on their computers .
Boback and others have warned that leaks have resulted in file - sharing networks becoming vast treasure troves of information for identity thieves , corporate spies and even foreign intelligence agencies .
That has prompted calls for lawmakers to force software vendors to implement stricter security controls in their applications .
The only vendor at today 's hearing was Mark Gorton , chairman of Lime Group LLC , the umbrella organization that runs Lime Wire LLC , developer of LimeWire , which is the most - used P2P client available .
Gorton testified two years ago and promised at that time to implement changes in the company 's products to make it harder for users to inadvertently share files .
Today he insisted that the company had implemented many of those changes and that the latest version of LimeWire makes it much harder for data to be inadvertently leaked .
Those claims were largely rejected by members of the committee , who blasted Gorton for failing to live up to his promises .
Pointing to the examples offered by Boback , Towns said that the file - sharing industry 's promises to regulate itself had clearly failed .
" Specific examples of recent LimeWire leaks range from appalling to shocking , " Towns said .
" As far as I am concerned , the days of self - regulation should be over for the file - sharing industry . "
Other members want the issue investigated by the Federal Trade Commission , the Securities and Exchange Commission and law enforcement authorities .
They said that the continued failure by companies such as LimeWire to take more proactive steps to stop inadvertent file - sharing is tantamount to enabling illegal activity resulting from the data leaks .
Towns plans to meet with the chairman of the FTC to determine whether the failure to stop inadvertent file - sharing constitutes an unfair trade practice by P2P companies .
MY MAESTRO AS I SAW HIM
by Nikhil Banerjee
Gurukul ' method of training is perhaps the most unique feature of our music and its heritage .
It may appear rather old fashioned if not primitive to those students who sit around modern electronic wonder gadgets like tape or video recorders and pick up their lessons .
But truth is what it is .
Gurukul system presupposes that the students have to be in constant company and guidance of their master whom they serve in every way .
As in the case of religion , it is only when the master is satisfied with the earnestness and sincerity of the student , then he imparts his power and the wealth of all the feelings and realizations of his own Sadhana or practice .
Between the teacher and the taught the principle of give and take is only this .
The student can only offer his devotion and service , and the teacher can let him have knowledge and truth .
We can find easily how a system as such can effect the total development of a student both physical and mental under the strict vigilance of the teacher who knows how to let the flower blossom .
Sad to say , for many many years this principle used to operate in a limited sense and the great Ustads kept up a very secretive approach .
They would not let the student see the truth unless there was any blood relation between them .
Baba Allauddin Khan Sahib was great in going against this current , and courageously proving that our music is not a hidden magic but essentially a matter of practice aiming at self - realization .
He was not a musician by family tradition .
His life is quite a classic story of endless tests and trials through which he found his way towards knowledge and enlightenment .
It is probably this background which bred such a strong antipathy towards anything mean and narrow in the sphere of teaching .
He was a teacher incarnate with the purest vibration .
Any student , if really deserving , had from him the shower of his blessings and by the sheer touch of his genius felt quite transformed .
Our much respected Sri Timirbaran , Ustad Ali Akbar Khan , our most revered Annapurnadidi , Pandit Ravi Shankar , Sri Pannalal Ghosh are some of the brightest luminaries that Baba produced , and who else but he could do it .
Many people raised one common question that how we could learn sitar from an Ustad whose medium of expression was sarod .
His biography records many interesting accounts of his training in veena , sursringar , rabab , surbahar and several other instruments .
This opened up endless possibilities of those instruments and enabled him to assimilate and introduce a style of playing much bigger in scope and dimension compared to which the old recordings or other sitar playing sound limited .
In course of teaching he said to me one day , " I have decided to teach you sitar after the style of Nawab Kutubudaulla Bahadur of Lucknow . "
He had such an exhaustive idea about the ' baj ' or style of playing of every instrument that he could neatly distinguish between them and combine them as well for the best conceivable effect .
A man is , in point of fact , inseparable from his ideals .
To my mind Baba Allauddin Khan Sahib was more of an institution than only a musician .
While staying at Maihar Baba gave as a life - style very much like that of an Ashram or hermitage .
As a person he was simple , unassuming and completely devoid of egoism .
He lived a life with the minimum of necessities and always helped himself to the best of his physical abilities .
He washed his own clothes every day .
He had a strong aversion towards any kind of luxury which , he believed , could only make a man materialistic and pleasure - loving and not idealistic and sensitive .
Maihar , as we all know , is a place of extreme climate and it becomes unbearably hot during the summer because of the limestone factories that surround it .
Once , his son Ustad Ali Akbar Khan Sahib bought an air - cooler and took it to Maihar with the expectation that it might give him some relief .
But after a few days it was rejected with scorn .
Till the day he was unable to move , he would go to the market to buy daily necessities and not let the students go there and waste their valuable moments of practice .
He was great in practicing austerity in his own life and had therefore the right to impose it on us .
He was a disciplinarian and would never allow the slightest deviation from his ideals of simple living , strict observance of Bramhacharya during our stay at Maihar , a total withdrawal of the mind from all kinds of superficialities , directing all the energy to practice of music and concentration .
In going to enforce all this he had to keep up a certain hardness which was , in reality , a show .
Stories of Baba 's severe scoldings , beating with the bow of violin and throwing of tabla hammer are so common that people are sometimes terribly mistaken to assume that he was a kind of an old village schoolmaster lacking in any sophistication , with only the ability to be rather ridiculously stern .
But this image of himself he deliberately projected in order not to allow any liberty to the disciple .
He always had the tension that soft treatment on his part would only spoil them .
One day I heard him speaking out rather candidly , " Do n't you see that I am a grandsire ?
Do n't I feel like taking them ( meaning his grandsons ) in my arms - patting and loving them .
But I am afraid it may spoil them . "
Here was the inner voice which could be heard seldom or never .
Beneath the veil of toughness was the soft and tender soul bubbling with humanity .
We used to watch with wonder how in different corners of his premises he arranged to set up wooden pieces of shelter - racks to let the birds build up their nests .
At the time of his meals these birds would gather around him and he enjoyed their innocent company .
Whenever any Sadhu or saint was around , Baba would give him God - like treatment , offering food and clothing .
He used to clean with his own hand the left - overs of their food and never let us touch them .
I cannot resist the temptation to narrate a couple of episodes which reveal Baba 's humanity .
There was one woman who was mentally deranged and stayed near Baba 's house .
In the evening she would frequently visit Baba while he was engaged either in playing or teaching us .
We even noticed that various herbal medicines were externally applied on her head to cool down her nervous system .
This lady would keep her head on Baba 's lap and while listening to music fell asleep .
The stern teacher never felt disturbed but rather compassionately said " Ah , what a pity that she suffers so much !
Let her have some rest at least ! "
Other than those who witnessed this scene , how can anybody recognize what he actually was !
Once in the market at Maihar he watched a person sitting out rather dejected in a corner with a number of dholaks to sell but not heeded by anyone .
He was touched so much so that he took up one dholak and started playing .
The result was obviously a crowd around him .
Many of them were throwing coins and a few dholaks ( folk drums ) were sold out within a short time .
Baba saw that some money were collected .
He gave it all to the dholak - seller and went home happy .
About religion Baba was very broad - minded .
When he used to have his daily prayer or Namaz he would ask me to go into my room and have my ' Gayatri ' Yapa .
Some of the habits and practices he suggested got so firmly riveted into my mind as ' mantras ' or sermons .
He would say , " Whenever you are giving a performance , meditate on your Guru first and then you will see that he takes you over and carries you through .
Whenever you play a Raga , begin with worshipping and welcoming it .
Imagine it to be deity .
Bow down and pray that it should have mercy on you and it should become alive through your medium .
Never approach a raga with a feeling of pride or vanity in your heart .
Music grows out of the purest feelings of your soul and hence the mind of the musician , if only purified , can produce the vibration . "
Baba 's behavior on the stage sometimes became rather erratic .
But this was only the result of a certain tension and apprehension that he might fail to establish the raga .
I saw him many times uttering Namaz and even crying out " Ma , Ma " to Goddess Saraswati .
This appeared strange to people .
But I had the most glorious experience to hear the same person playing sursringar to himself in Maihar with all the serenity and calm of mind .
I still remember that after a couple of minutes it seemed too much for me .
The emotional appeal was so tremendous that my entire being was gone to pieces , senses suspended and it was a trance all over .
Anyone who heard him there could realize how great a Naad ( Sound ) Yogi he was .
There was a very old temple on top of a hill at Maihar known as the temple of Saradamai .
Pilgrims came there from far and near and surprisingly enough they would come to see Baba straight from the temple .
To the poor common people of Madhya Pradesh who knew nothing about music , Baba Allauddin Khan Sahib was sort of a Sadhu - a noble soul and they used to call him " Baba " in that sense .
People of Maihar loved and honored him like anything excepting the Muslim community , who did not quite approve of his liberal views on religion .
After his death they at first refused to carry him for burial .
There was a storm of controversy .
But at the end we saw that the burial procession was being attended by the Hindus and Muslims alike and even the chief priest of the temple of Saradamai joined .
It was a marvelous spectacle !
Baba can be compared to Sant Kabir whom both the Hindus and Muslims claimed to have belonged to their community .
I would rather say that like Sant Kabir he was far above these social distinctions .
He was a great Naad Yogi .

On October 22 , Microsoft will finally release a new version of Windows that will be as good as the deeply disappointing Windows Vista should have been when it came out in January 2007 .
The new edition , called Windows 7 , is a big improvement over both Vista and the sturdy , 2001 - vintage Windows XP still widely in use .
It will give Apple ’s long - superior Mac OS X operating system a run for its money ( though Apple might maintain its edge with a new version , called Snow Leopard , due in September ) .
But how will Windows users transition their current computers to the new Windows 7 ?
While this latest operating system stresses simplicity , the upgrade process will be anything but simple for the huge base of average consumers still using XP , who likely outnumber Vista users .
It will be frustrating , tedious and labor - intensive .
In fact , the process will be so painful that , for many XP users , the easiest solution may be to buy a new PC preloaded with Windows 7 , if they can afford such a purchase in these dire economic times .
In fact , that ’s the option Microsoft recommends for XP users .
( Conveniently , this option also helps Microsoft ’s partners that make PCs . )
By contrast , if you ’re using Vista , the upgrade to Windows 7 should be a fairly easy , straightforward process .
Because the new version shares most of the underlying guts of Vista , it installs itself on your current machine relatively quickly and smoothly , preserving all your files , folders , settings and programs .
In a test of this process earlier this year , using a pre-release version of Windows 7 , I upgraded a Vista laptop with no problems and little effort in about an hour .
But Windows XP users , including the millions who have recently snapped up cheap , XP - powered netbooks , will first have to wipe out everything on their hard disks in order to install Windows 7 . on their current machines .
In fact , Microsoft does n’t even call migrating to Windows 7 from XP an “ upgrade . ”
It refers to it as a “ clean install , ” or a “ custom installation . ”
This disk wipeout can be performed manually , or automatically during the Windows 7 installation process .
A Boston federal jury has ordered Joel Tenenbaum to pay a total of $ 675,000 — $ 22,500 per song — to the major record labels for willfully infringing 30 songs by downloading and distributing them over the KaZaA peer - to - peer network .
The figure is closer to the $ 222,000 award in the first Jammie Thomas - Rasset trial than the $ 1.92 million figure from the second trial .
The verdict came down at late Friday afternoon after a little more than three hours of deliberation .
When asked about the size verdict , Tenenbaum 's attorney and Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson told Ars that " it 's a bankrupting award . "
He also felt things might have been different had they been allowed to argue Fair Use .
" We were not allowed to speak to fairness , " he told Ars .
" I thought we had pretty damn good arguments on Fair Use . "
" I 'm disappointed , but not surprised , but I 'm thankful that it was n't much bigger , that it was n't millions , " Tenenbaum told Ars after the verdict was announced .
We asked him if he regrets not settling earlier on in the process .
" Ask me in a couple of months , " Tenenbaum replied .
He also told Ars that he does n't have the ability to pay the judgment and said that he'd be filing for bankruptcy if the award stands .
Although the jury found that he willfully infringed on the copyrights in question , Tenenbaum said he was " not displeased with the jury considering how the trial went . "
What about the fact that the damages could have been much worse , as high as $ 4.5 million ?
" That to me sends a message that [ the jury ] considered [ my ] side legitimately , " he replied .
He was also evasive when asked if he regrets downloading music for free .
" That 's really a loaded question , " he replied .
" There are so many things that could have been different . "
The RIAA was pleased with the verdict .
" We are grateful for the jury ’s service and their recognition of the impact of illegal downloading on the music community , " the RIAA said in a statement .
" We appreciate that Mr. Tenenbaum finally acknowledged that artists and music companies deserve to be paid for their work .
From the beginning that ’s what this case has been about .
We only wish he had done so sooner rather than lie about his illegal behavior . "
The trial was an almost entirely one - sided affair .
Plaintiffs built their case with forensic evidence collected by MediaSentry , which showed that he was sharing over 800 songs from his computer on August 10 , 2004 .
A subsequent examination of his computer showed that Tenenbaum had used a variety of different peer - to - peer programs , from Napster to KaZaA to AudioGalaxy to iMesh , to obtain music for free , starting in 1999 .
And he continued to infringe , even after his father warned him in 2002 that he would get sued , even after he received a harshly - worded letter from the plaintiffs ’ law firm in 2005 , even after he was sued in 2007 , and all the way through part of 2008 .
And when he took the stand on Thursday , Tenenbaum admitted it all , including the fact that he had “ lied ” in his written discovery responses and at his first deposition in September 2008 .
Tenenbaum ’s admissions were so clear - cut , and so damning , that Judge Gertner — who had recruited Nesson to represent the formerly lawyer - less 25 - year - old — took the basic issue of infringement away from the jury , determining that no reasonable jury could find for Tenenbaum on that issue .
The jury of five men and five women , all white and all from the Boston suburbs , were left only to determine the issue of willfulness and damages .
Tenenbaum is only the second of approximately 18,000 individuals targeted by the labels to have gone to trial , and the second to lose .
In June of this year , a Minnesota jury ordered Jammie Thomas - Rasset to pay $ 80,000 for infringing each of 24 songs , totaling $ 1.92 million .
Last December , the labels announced that they were no longer initiating new cases against individual peer - to - peer users .
However , they said they would see through to the end those cases already in the litigation pipeline .
According to the labels ’ attorneys , there remain about 100 cases pending where the defendant has filed an answer , about a dozen of which are being actively litigated in the discovery stage .
The Tenenbaum litigation was dominated by the larger - than - life personality of Tenenbaum ’s counsel , Harvard Law School professor , who infuriated the plaintiffs , and at times Judge Nancy Gertner , with his unusual litigation tactics .
These included making audio recordings of the attorneys and the court , and then posting the results to his blog , and publicizing internal discussions with potential expert witnesses about legal strategy .
A sanctions motion against Nesson for his recording practices remains pending .
Tenenbaum ’s case was dismantled piece - by - piece by a series of adverse rulings over the past several months .
Judge Gertner dismissed his abuse - of - process claims against the plaintiffs and the Recording Industry Association of America ; excluded four of his proposed expert witnesses and limited the scope of a fifth ; and , in a coup de grace delivered less than eight hours before the start of trial , barred him from arguing fair use to the jury .
Judge Gertner previously announced that she will hold a post - trial proceeding to determine whether the size of the award violates the US Constitution ’s guarantee of due process of the law .
While no federal court has ever invalidated an award of copyright statutory damages as constitutionally excessive , the record labels ’ litigation campaign has spurred arguments that the Supreme Court cases imposing limits on punitive damages should be extended to statutory damages , which may contain a punitive element .
Tenenbaum filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs ’ statutory damages claim on constitutional grounds , but Judge Gertner deferred ruling on the issue unless and until there was actually a damages award handed down by the jury .

So bad that if you decide to use an essay mill — or something like it — and you get caught , your academic career could be over .
What about degree mills ?
These organizations — sort of like sisters of essay mills — are more than happy to send you a “ diploma ” from a non-accredited “ school ” as long as you are willing to shell out the cash .
Do n’t even think about it .
You ’re in college for a reason and it has a lot to do with a process called learning .
So who are some high profile fibbers who were caught lying about their degrees — or lack thereof — and ended up in the shamelight ?
Celebrity chef dishes up embellishments .
How about being fired from your own Food Network show for lying about — you guessed it — a cake ?
Robert Irving , a British chef , said that he designed Diana ’s wedding cake and was buddy - buddy with Prince Charles , yet he later admitted to only picking fruit for the cake at the school where it was being made [ ii ] .
He also said he was a knight and owned a castle in Scotland , but it was just another one of his strange concoctions [ iii ] .
He was fired from Dinner : Impossible because of his fanciful transgressions , even though he later worked on Food Network ’s production , Restaurant : Impossible .
Add in a fake Bachelor ’s of Science in Food and Nutrition from Leeds University[iv ] and you have a winner in some type of B.S. department .
Three or four - year degree ?
Apparently , David Edmondson , Radio Shack ’s CEO , had difficulty recalling his educational attainments and how many years his college career spanned .
Although he said that he had psychology and theology degrees from Heartland Baptist Bible College , he did n’t .
He resigned after stating , “ I clearly misstated my academic record , and the responsibility for these misstatements is mine alone ” [ ii ] .
Bachelor ’s and Master ’s — not .
Marilee Jones , once an M.I.T. dean , had been at the school for 28 years and lied about earning , not one , but two degrees — a bachelor ’s and master ’s .
Reality ?
She had zero .
She admitted that she ‘ misrepresented her academic degrees to the institute , ’ and she did n’t ‘ have the courage to correct [ her ] resume ’ [ ii ] .
She resigned and has a consulting practice .
Maybe he just has something in his eye . . .
it could explain Bausch & Lomb ’s then CEO , Ronal Zarrella , and his shiftiness , but it probably has more to do with the fact that he never earned a Master of Business Administration from NYU like he said he did .
Bausch & Lomb thought Zarrella “ was too valuable to the company ” to let go at the time but Zarrella ended up leaving later on when ‘ extensive product recall and hundreds of product liability lawsuits ’ plagued the company [ ii ] .
Yahoo ’s CEO is n’t cheering anymore .
Scott Thompson [ viii ] resigned after only four months on the job because he fibbed about earning a computer science degree from Stonehill College .
Was n’t it enough , Scott , that you were president of PayPal and landed a pretty cush job running Yahoo ?
Were n’t you proud of your existing accounting degree that was legit ?
Yahoo did n’t really hire you because you had a computer science degree , did they ?
Anyway , Daniel Loeb , shareholder of Yahoo , said , ‘ Now more than ever Yahoo investors need a trustworthy C.E.O. ’[ ii ] .
Do n't Lie about your Degree ; Earn Your Degree Online !
Lying about any type of degree is more than just unbecoming .
It could cost you your career , as many of these fibbers revealed , and it can show the world that you are n’t ethical .
Having integrity is important – and you can demonstrate it in even the smallest acts , like earning an A on your psychology final because you studied hard or showing up to class and taking your own notes , instead of relying on your buddy ’s notebook because you hate waking up for 8 a.m. classes .
Do n’t let the easy way out win over hard work and dedication !
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki has ordered his government to take down concrete blast walls that line Baghdad 's streets and surround whole neighborhoods , the Iraqi military announced Thursday .
The walls split Baghdad along sectarian lines , shielding some from Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents .
" The concrete walls will be taken off from the main roads and side streets in all Baghdad areas , with no exceptions and within 40 days , " a statement from Iraqi military 's Baghdad Operations Command read .
The massive concrete barriers , typically 3 meters ( 10 feet ) tall , were quickly erected around many Baghdad buildings after the U.S. invasion in 2003 .
They mushroomed during the sectarian warfare that followed the 2006 bombing of a Shiite Muslim shrine in Samarra , when they were put up to separate Shiite and Sunni districts across Baghdad .
While they split the city along sectarian lines , they also managed to protect neighborhood residents from Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents and helped U.S. troops and Iraqi government forces manage security within them .
The order does not cover the Green Zone , which houses Iraqi government buildings and the U.S. Embassy , or military installations , government institutions , hotels or some private companies .
The order came after meeting Wednesday with high - ranking security officials , according to the command .
Iraqi forces are now calling the shots on issues related to security in their homeland since June 30 , the date U.S. combat troops were mandated to leave Iraqi cities and towns pursuant to a joint security agreement .

Catholic ban on adoption by same - sex couples is ruled illegal
Catholic adoption societies which refuse to offer children to gay couples face closure following a tribunal yesterday .
Judges ruled in a test case that the charities , which find homes for hundreds of children each year , will be breaking the law if they refuse to accept same - sex couples as adoptive parents .
The ruling means some Catholic agencies face a choice between abandoning their adoption services or their religious principles .
The ruling means some Catholic agencies face a choice between abandoning their adoption services or their religious principles ( picture posed by models )
One diocese has already said it is likely to close its adoption charities .
Some of the long - standing charities have not opposed adoption by same - sex couples since Labour 's 2007 Sexual Orientation Regulations stated that no organisation or company may discriminate against gays .
But yesterday 's appeal ruling by the Charity Tribunal confirmed that those which have stuck to Roman Catholic teaching must now do the same or give up trying to get children adopted .
In its appeal , the Catholic Care charity , run by the diocese of Leeds , said that the right to discriminate against homosexual couples was ' a principle of a Catholic organisation ' .
But following the ruling a spokesman for the diocese said : ' As the charities cannot provide unrestricted services without being in breach of their obligations to act in accordance with the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church , it seems likely that the charities will need to close their adoption services and a flagship service of the charities will be lost .
' We are concerned about the possible impact this will have on potential adoptive parents and children . '
Tribunal president Alison McKenna ruled that the Catholic Care charity was 'a well - respected voluntary adoption agency which has made a significant contribution to the provision of adoption services in this country and facilitated many successful adoption placements ' .
But she and two colleagues said the charity 's activities would be unlawful if it went on refusing to accept gay adoptive parents .
Other Catholic adoption agencies declined to comment .

From catcalls to lurid comments , should you shout back , or just ignore them ?
Any tips for those who will not give up their skirts ?
Forget modesty : it 's about catcalling .
Unlike Gwladys , I quickly gave up on the idea of biking with a skirt on .
A pity really , because the thought of commuting to work wearing light and fluttering fabrics is especially appealing during summer time .
But from now on , I 'm all about ugly lycra capri pants .
My admission of defeat is n't about wanting to keep my poise : looking silly is n't too much of a problem if I am in the midst of a strenuous physical exercise .
What made me give up dresses was the never - ending catcalls hurled my way day in , day out .
No matter that I was just commuting to work at 8.30 am looking dishevelled , or biking through the park on a Sunday afternoon looking nice : if biking on my own , unwelcome remarks were de circonstance .
I have heard it all : from builders demanding that I " flash my boobs , love " and older men asking if I had panties on , to teenagers making furtive kissing sounds supposed to suggest appreciation .
I even once encountered a pedestrian who , having spotted me cycling from afar in a deserted street , stopped in the middle of a crossroad only to bend down with a huge grin , trying to catch a glimpse of my knickers .
At first , politely ignoring lurid comments while avoiding eye contact with the offenders seemed like a good solution .
But such unwanted attention quickly became tiring , if not unsettling .
After a few months of weekly ( if not daily , during summer months ) street harassment , I decided to resort to a more aggressive tactic and ditched my much - loved dutch bike , bought myself a hybrid , and started dressing head - to - toe in black lycra .
And would n't you know ?
The catcalling ceased immediately , except for that recent time when I had the incredible audacity to go on a bike ride wearing shorts .
But really , does it really have to come to that ?
Should women have to police their own clothes , rather than men watch their behaviour ?
I would love to hear about how female cyclists deal with catcalling .
Do you say something back , or do you just shrug and keep on going ?
Any tips for those who will not bow down and give up their skirts ?

Most great scientists have prizes named after them .
Or university buildings .
Not Bob Drewes , a Palo Alto resident and one of the world ’s leading experts on African reptiles .
Drewes has been forever immortalized with something that may have other researchers glancing over with envy — or chuckles .
A mushroom named after a part of the male anatomy .
His anatomy .
In the scientific equivalent of the full monty , one of Drewes colleagues discovered a new species of mushroom in the tiny nation of São Tomé , a tropical island off West Africa .
He named it Phallus drewesii .
For those a little rusty on their high school Latin , it means “ Drewes ’ Penis . ”
The randy new species will be formally exposed to the world this month when a photo spread of the mushroom graces the cover of Mycologia , a leading scientific journal of fungi .
“ I am utterly delighted .
The funny thing is that it is the second smallest known mushroom in this genus and it grows sideways , almost limp , ” said Drewes , who is curator of herpetology at the California Academy of Sciences .
Drewes was leading an expedition up a mountain in the jungles of São Tomé in 2006 with a team of scientists when his longtime friend , Dennis Desjardin , found the two - inch species , which is technically a new type of stinkhorn mushroom that grows on wood , emits a foul odor and attracts flies .
Desjardin , a mushroom expert and biology professor at San Francisco State University , recognized it as a rare find , made a few jokes , and the name stuck .
Drewes considers the suggestive fungus an honor , though he ’s aware biology students will be snickering for generations to come .
“ I ’ve got four kids and a bunch of grandkids .
None of my colleagues or them will let me live it down , ” Drewes said .
“ But I love it .
It is a form of immortality . ”

Today we ’re going to learn how to install a bathtub and then tile the surrounding shower wall , okey - dokie ?
I ’ve got an awesome , professionally done
video here put together by The Home Depot , plus some extra tips and common mistakes .
Pipes that you will need will include the hot and cold supply lines , as well as a pipe that will lead to the shower head .
You will also need a mixing valve and shower head .
Also , this is n’t as hard as it might initially seem : you can have this done in a single morning , I swear .
Common Mistakes
Some of the most common mistakes including violating local code restrictions ( check these before you do or buy anything ) , attaching copper pipe to galvanized without utilizing a dielectric or brass fitting between the two ( copper and zinc will react and severely corrode each other very quickly ) , not leveling your fixtures as you ’re installing them , and forgetting to install air gaps where necessary ( pay attention to the video ! ) .
That ’s all I can think of off the top of my head that I ’ve seen people do before , if anyone has any extra tips they ’re welcome to leave them in the comments below .

Effects of overpopulation
Food Shortage
The more people there are , the greater amount of food is needed .
If there is not enough food to feed people in a specific place , then there is food shortage in that place .
When people do not get enough food , their health is affected .
People become undernourished when they do not have enough food to eat .
Undernourished children are more likely to get sick .
Water Shortage
When population increases , the demand for water also increases .
Farmers need more water to irrigate their fields so that they can produce more crops .
Factories need more water to use in manufacturing more goods .
More households need more water for drinking , cooking , washing clothes , personal hygiene and many other activities .
Water shortage is evident when people have to walk a long way to get water , or when they have to queue up to get it .
Many people do not have access to potable water .
They get their water from springs , rivers , wells and rain .
The quality of water that people get may be poor .
Water shortage in a community can bring about problems related to sanitation and health .
Limited Space
The population of a place increases in just a short time .
However , the space in a place remains the same .
When the houses in a neighborhood are overcrowded , it shows that the population in the area is too big .
This is a common sight in a city .
Many poor people build shanties along creeks , in dumpsites or along railroads .
More than one family may share a shanty .
Overpopulation in a community can limit space for housing .
Health Problems
Food shortage , overcrowding , poor water supply and environmental pollution affect the health of the people , particularly the children .
Poor environmental sanitation is a major cause of diseases such as diarrhea , typhoid and cholera .
Dirty insects such as flies and cockroaches contaminate food with disease - causing germs .
Many children who play barefoot in dirty areas and do not wash their hands before eating become infected with worms .
Some respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis , pneumonia and bronchitis are worsened by polluted air .
Communicable diseases can easily be transferred from one person to another in an overpopulated area .
Environmental Degradation
More people generate more waste .
Solid wastes such as plastics , tin cans and bottles , when not properly disposed of , become eyesores in a place .
Garbage and sewage , if left untreated , can pollute the water supply .
More people need more things to use so more factories are built , more transportation facilities are made and more products are manufactured .
This means more fuels are burned .
The more fuels are burned , the more polluted the air becomes .

Wayne Gretzky once said , when asked the secret of his success at ice hockey , “ I skate to where the puck will be . ”
It is for the same reason I keep bringing up the issue of money missing from the US federal government and the possibility that collateral fraud and counterfeiting of US government and agency securities were instrumental in facilitating the transfers .
If we simply accept as a given books and records that are not reliable when there is significant evidence that vast sums have been stolen or transferred illegally , we will find ourselves being controlled and bought with the very money stolen from us .
We will endure the ultimate leveraged buyout in the history of our civilization .
This one financial issue will be an important determining factor as to whether our children and grandchildren will live as free men and women or not .
But it is too late , say some , as the money is gone .
Actually , it is not too late to recapture funds .
If liabilities were illegally or fraudulently originated , we may not be liable for them .
In addition , if we are still interacting with liable parties with assets , we can create rights of set - aside for those responsible .
I am inspired by the story last week of the Italian seizure of billions in US bonds from two Japanese crossing the border into Switzerland .
Max Keiser Comments
Do you think it is impossible for billions , if not trillions , of counterfeit or unrecorded sovereign and agency bonds to be issued and floating around the world ?
Think again …

Herzl ’s diary demonstrates that indifference to an indigenous Asian minority is in the DNA of Zionism .
In 1896 , Herzl made a trip to Constantinople to try and meet Sultan Abdul Hamid so as to negotiate the purchase of Palestine , which was then part of the Ottoman Empire .
Herzl was prepared to offer millions of pounds to resolve the Turkish debt crisis , and get a Jewish state in exchange .
The Sultan declined to meet with him ( they met a couple years later ) but his aides gave Herzl some terms .
Could he work on the Armenian issue in the European press ?
Turkey was getting bashed for its treatment of the Armenians .
And Herzl , who always bragged that his pen was not for sale , agreed to do so .
I ’m not going to go through all Herzl ’s work on behalf of the Turks on the Armenian issue now .
This is a blogpost , not a scholarly article .
But in seeking to " pacify " the Armenians , Herzl visited an Armenian revolutionary in his London apartment , Nazarbek ( evidently the poet Avetis Nazarbekian ) .
Herzl :
The house is noisy , second - rate , middle - class elegance , and from time to time wild Armenian faces appear in the crack of the door .
They are refugees who find shelter here .
[ Herzl then meets Nazarbek ]
Black , tangled , serpentine locks , black beard , pale face .
He mistrusts the Sultan and would like to have guarantees before he submits .
His political ideas are confused , his acquaintance with the European situation downright childish … it seems , his word is obeyed by the poor people in Armenia who are being massacred .
He lives in London , not uncomfortably .
I asked whether he knew who was finally benefitting from all this unrest , Russia or England ?
He replied that he did not care ; he was revolting only againt the Turks .
The woman [ Nazarbek ’s wife ] kept interrupting us , speaking in Armenian and evidently against me .
She has a wicked look ; and who knows how much she is to blame for the bloodshed …
I promised I would try to get the Sultan to stop the massacres and new arrests , as a token of his good will …
I offer this not as the final word on the Jewish - Armenian relationship .
I do n’t know much about it .
Though right in line with Herzl , Abe Foxman took the Turks ’ side recently , during the flap over recognition of the Armenian genocide .
I offer it chiefly as light on the Israel lobby and its methods .
Herzl was playing the Great Game of world politics .
He was a genius at it .
Thus his concern with Russian and English interests .
He did n’t seek a mass movement at first ; he sought the help of Jewish bankers and editors in his effort to parley with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire for a colonial chunk of the empire .
Herzl did n’t want to be a court Jew– no , he wanted to be a statesman for the Jews , and god bless him– but he operated in the courts of Europe , not always successfully .
And as I have said before , I bet I would have been a Zionist back then .
Face to face with a man representing oppressed indigenous Asians who faced genocidal forces in their society , Herzl was contemptuous .
And that Jewish history is still with us .
Cultivating the powerful , using financial influence , expressing contempt for an indigenous Asian people –these traits have been hallmarks of the Israel lobby .
I say history because it ’s coming to an end .
There are other ways of being Jewish in modern society .

Federal agents arrested seven men in North Carolina on Monday and charged them with plotting to wage “ violent jihad ” outside the United States , according to an indictment unsealed in federal court in Raleigh , N.C .
The full text of the indictment is embedded below .
The government charged Daniel Boyd , a 39 - year - old American who traveled to Afghanistan two decades ago to fight the Soviet - backed government , with recruiting six young men , including two of his sons , to take part in a conspiracy “ to advance violent jihad , including supporting and participating in terrorist activities abroad and committing acts of murder , kidnapping or maiming persons abroad . ”
According to the indictment , members of the group practiced military tactics and the use of weapons in rural North Carolina , and traveled to Gaza , Israel , Jordan and Kosovo hoping “ to engage in violent jihad . ”
The indictment also claims that an eighth member of the group , who is still at large , traveled to Pakistan for the same purpose .
A North Carolina newspaper , The News & Observer , reported on Monday night : “ The charges are related to allegations that they helped raise money and provide training for terrorism operations in Tel Aviv , Israel . ”
The newspaper added “ Federal officials will not say where the men are being held . ”
The Justice Department identified two of the suspects as Mr. Boyd ’s sons Zakariya Boyd , 20 and Dylan Boyd , 22 .
The others are Anes Subasic , 33 ; Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan , 22 ; Ziyad Yaghi , 21 and Hysen Sherifi , 24 .
All are American citizens except Mr. Sherifi , who is a native of Kosovo but a permanent legal resident of the United States .
The Associated Press reports that “ no attorneys for the men were listed in court records . ”
Mr. Boyd ’s mother told The A.P. that she knew nothing about the case but that it “ certainly sounds weird . ”
The father of Mr. Hassan declined to comment and family members of the other me were unable to be reached on Tuesday .
The Justice Department ’s summary of the charges lays out several apparently unsuccessful efforts by members of the group to take part in attacks in other countries :
Among other acts , the indictment alleges that Daniel Boyd traveled to Gaza in March 2006 and attempted to enter Palestine in order to introduce his son to individuals who also believed that violent jihad was a personal religious obligation .
Later , in October 2006 , defendant Ziyad Yaghi allegedly departed the United States for Jordan to engage in violent jihad .
In June 2007 , Daniel Boyd and several other defendants departed the United States for Israel in an effort to engage in violent jihad , but ultimately returned to the United States after failing in their efforts .
According to the indictment , after his return to the United States , Daniel Boyd made false statements twice to federal officials about who he had planned to meet on his trip to Israel .
In February 2008 , Daniel Boyd allegedly solicited money to fund the travel of additional individuals overseas to engage in violent jihad and in March 2008 , discussed with Anes Subasic preparations to send two individuals abroad for this purpose .
He allegedly accepted $ 500 in cash from defendant Hysen Sherifi to be used to help fund jihad overseas and later showed Sherifi how to operate an AK - 47 assault weapon .
According to The News & Observer , one of Mr. Boyd ’s neighbors , Charles Casale , said he was shocked by the arrest : “ If he ’s a terrorist , he ’s the nicest terrorist I ’ve ever met in my life . ”
The newspaper also reported :
To neighbors and friends , Daniel Boyd was a father who stopped his work at noon each day for prayer .
Dylan Boyd , Daniel ’s son , was a college student at N.C. State University who until last year worked as a clinical services technician at WakeMed Raleigh Campus .
Mohammad Omar Aly Hassan was a newlywed ; his father owns a Raleigh car dealership . [… ]
A spokesman at the Islamic Center in Raleigh said he did not know the suspects ; an estimated 1,200 people attend Friday services at the center .
Hassan and Yaghi both attended Al - Iman School , which shares space with the Raleigh mosque , according to former teacher Samar Hindi .
Most recently , Daniel Boyd had been attending Jamaat Ibad Ar- Rahman , a mosque in Durham .
David Kris , an assistant Attorney General , described Daniel Boyd as “ a veteran of terrorist training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan who , over the past three years , has conspired with others in this country to recruit and help young men travel overseas in order to kill . ”
Mr. Boyd ’s history , as sketched out in the indictment , illustrates how complicated the American government ’s relationship has been with Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan over time .
Two decades ago , Mr. Boyd was reportedly a member of an Afghan - led faction that was then allied with the United States in the struggle against the Soviet - backed government .
According to The Associated Press :
In 1991 , Boyd and his brother were convicted of bank robbery in Pakistan — accused of carrying identification showing they belonged to the radical Afghan guerrilla group , Hezb - e - Islami , or Party of Islam .
They were each sentenced to have a foot and a hand cut off for the robbery , but the sentenced was later overturned .
The wives of the men told The Associated Press in an interview at the time they were glad the truth about their husbands had finally become known .
The wives said the couples had U.S. roots but the United States was a country of “ kafirs ” — Arabic for heathens .
Hezb - e - Islami , or the Islamic Party , led by the Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , was one of a number groups that the United States supplied with weapons during the time Mr. Boyd was in the region .
The group still exists and is still led by Mr. Hekmatyar , but it is now allied with the Taliban against American - led forces in Afghanistan .
Last month , my colleague Adam Ellick reported that Kunar Province in eastern Afghanistan “ is largely controlled by the Islamic Party . ”
In an interview with The New York Times in 1988 , Mr. Hekmatyar , described then as a “ major recipient of covert American military assistance , whose aim is a ‘ pure ’ Islamic state , ” complained , in English , that “ there are people in America who are against our jihad . ”
In what might now be seen as a sign that the American alliance with Afghan holy warriors was inherently problematic , Mr. Hekmatyar told The Times in 1988 that he knew there were “ people who support our struggle because they are against the Russians , not as an Islamic struggle . ”
He also explained that he had refused to accompany other leaders of the Islamic resistance who traveled to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan in 1986 , because “ I was afraid America would compromise with Gorbachev over Afghanistan . ”
While the shifting alliances in Afghanistan seem to have no relationship to the recent plots that Mr. Boyd was charged with facilitating , there was an interesting coincidence of timing .
On Monday , the same day he was charged , The Guardian reported that Mr. Hekmatyar “ has reportedly been approached with a deal by western intelligence agencies , ” hoping to draw the Islamic Party back into a de facto alliance with the United States .
The A.P. reports that during Mr. Boyd ’s trial in 1991 , he accused the court of being insufficiently Islamic :
In 1991 in Pakistan , Daniel Boyd and his older brother denied they were guilty of stealing $ 3,200 from the bank .
When the sentence was imposed , Boyd shouted : “ This is n’t an Islamic court .
It ’s a court of infidels ! ”
When the brothers were arrested , they were accused of carrying identification showing they belonged to the radical Afghan guerrilla group , Hezb - e - Islami , or Party of Islam .
They had become the first foreigners to be convicted and sentenced by special Islamic courts set up by the conservative federal government to impose speedy trials for so - called “ heinous ” crimes .
About a month later , when the brothers ’ convictions were overturned , Daniel Boyd said , “ The truth has finally come out . ”
During Mr. Boyd ’s trial in Pakistan , his wife , Sabrina , who is also American , was present , as were the two sons who were arrested with their father on Monday .
At the time Zakariya was three and his brother Dylan , also known as Mohammed , was five .
As a reader points out , a North Carolina news site , the Cary Citizen , has published more photographs of two of the men who were arrested on Monday , which seem to have been posted on one man ’s Facebook page .
Readers from or familiar with the Balkans , or really any region that has suffered through ethnic - nationalist conflict , will not be surprised to hear that news
Web sites concerned with the former Yugoslavia have focused on the fact that two of the arrested men reportedly have roots there .
The Sarajevo newspaper Oslobodjenje reports that Anes Subasic is from Bosnia and Herzegovina .
The fact that Hysen Sherifi is from Kosovo is given great prominence in the lead story on the Web site Serbianna , which is headlined : “ Kosovo Albanian Islamic Terrorist Charged . ”
A fellow news blogger , Catherine Pritchard of The Fayetteville Observer , writes to tell us that she has just written a blog post based on a Washington Post article from 1991 on Mr. Boyd and his trial in Pakistan .
You need to pay to read the full text of the Post article — which was written by Steve Coll , the author of “ Ghost Wars : The Secret History of the CIA , Afghanistan , and bin Laden , from the Soviet Invasion to September 10 , 2001 ″ — but this excerpt is available for free on Washingtonpost.com :
[ Daniel Boyd ] married his high school girlfriend , [ Sabrina Boyd ] , the daughter of a medical doctor who works for the U.S. government , at a mosque at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
She decided to convert to Islam just hours before the wedding and said she has never regretted it .
“ As much as I was raised as an American , I try to follow Islam strictly , ” she said .
Both Daniel and [ Charles Boyd ] worked in construction .
Just under two years ago , Daniel and Sabrina decided to move to Peshawar to work with a Muslim relief agency aiding some of the estimated 3 million Afghan refugees who have fled to Pakistan because of Afghanistan ’s 12 - year - old civil war .
In Pakistan the Boyds shifted from house to house in Hyatabad , a suburb in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains beneath the Khyber Pass , which leads to Afghanistan .
After a year , Charles Boyd and his second wife , [ Debra ] , joined them .
With two young sons initially and a third born in Pakistan , there were many adjustments .
Money was short , hospitals were inadequate , baby supplies were difficult to find , and all their drinking water had to be boiled .
Still , as they became increasingly involved in their new religion , said Sabrina Boyd , the hardships were more than worth it .
Through their lawyers , the Boyds maintain that they did not rob the bank .
Their lawyers also say they did not receive a fair trial in the special Islamic courts recently established by Pakistan ’s government to provide swift justice in cases of “ heinous crimes . ”
Among other things , the Boyds ’ lawyers have contended that police invented evidence against the brothers , obtained a confession from them at gunpoint and arranged witness identifications improperly .
Steve Coll , who wrote that article about Daniel Boyd ’s trial in Pakistan in 1991 for The Washington Post , now writes , and blogs , for The New Yorker .
He just published a new post on his blog , Think Tank , on The New Yorker ’s Web site , which includes another excerpt from the article :
[ T ] his morning Daniel Boyd and his wife , Sabrina , also known as Saifullah Abu Laith and Umm Mohammed , are a long way from football games and homecoming dances .
They are sitting in the dusty office of the superintendent of the Peshawar Central Jail in this swirling , violent city near the Afghan border .
Here Daniel and his brother Charles await the appeal of their conviction on bank robbery charges by a Pakistani Islamic court , which has handed down a stunning sentence — amputation of their right hands and left feet .
“ I guess we ’re just living in a nightmare come true , ” said Sabrina Boyd , who appears in public covered from head to toe in strict Islamic dress , her wide brown eyes peering through a slit in her veil .
“ It ’s just unfortunate because it ’s really breaking up my family .
I hope this thing is over with very soon , God willing .
We were very private people before all this . ”
I wo n’t spoil the surprise ( or Washingtonpost.com ’s business model ) if readers want to purchase and read the full text of that article , but I will mention that Mr. Boyd ’s story , of a young American convert to Islam heading for Afghanistan to engage in holy war , seems to have been similar to that of John Walker Lindh , the so - called “ American Taliban , ” who traveled the same route about a decade later .
In 2003 , Jane Mayer wrote this article for The New Yorker on Mr. Lindh ’s case .
The Washington Post ’s Web site has just made the full text of Mr. Coll ’s article on Daniel Boyd from 1991 available for free .
It makes interesting reading both in light of today ’s arrests , and in light of the current struggle inside Pakistan over the implementation of Shariah law .
In October 1991 , Mr. Coll wrote that the Islamic court that had ruled that Mr. Boyd and his brother should be punished with amputations had been set up by the government of then - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , who may return to power in Pakistan soon .
Mr. Coll reported :
The special courts in which the Boyd brothers were convicted were created earlier this year under a controversial constitutional amendment pushed through by Sharif ’s government .
The amendment was denounced by opposition leaders as a mechanism for political authoritarianism .
Other commentators saw it as partly an effort to appease Pakistan ’s small but vocal minority of radical Islamic religious leaders .
The News & Observer reports that “ An unnamed eighth member of a suspected North Carolina - based terrorism group is at large and wanted by federal authorities , U.S. Attorney George Holding said early this afternoon .
The individual , whose name was redacted from an indictment made public yesterday , does n’t appear to pose a danger to the larger public , said Holding , the head of the Raleigh - based federal prosecutor ’s office for the Eastern District of North Carolina . ”
According to the News & Observer :
FBI agents are actively looking to take the person into custody .
Holding would not name the person , nor describe his or her involvement beyond the indictment .
That individual is described as a U.S. citizen and North Carolina resident who traveled to Pakistan in October 2008 to participate in violent jihad .
The Associated Press reports : “ Authorities think the eighth suspect is in Pakistan , according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation . ”
According to the indictment , the suspect went to Pakistan in October to “ engage in violent jihad . ”
My colleague Liz Robbins reports :
On Tuesday in Raleigh , Khalilah Sabra of the Muslim American Society gave a news conference to urge due process for the arrested men , and she read a statement from Mr. Boyd ’s wife , Sabrina , with whom she is friendly .
“ The charges have not been substantiated , ” Ms. Boyd said in her statement .
“ We are an ordinary family and we have the right to justice and we believe justice will prevail .
We are decent people who care about other human beings . ”
The statement , which Ms. Sabra read to The New York Times in a telephone interview , continued : “ Indictments always seem factual , but a rush to judgment is not part of the process . ”
Ms. Sabra said that she first met the family in Afghanistan two decades ago , when she was working for the Red Crescent Society , a relief organization akin to the Red Cross .
She said Mr. Boyd was in the region to train with the mujahedeen , rebel groups who were then fighting the pro-Soviet government . [… ]
In her statement , Ms. Boyd acknowledged reports of her husband ’s activities in Afghanistan .
“ He was there fighting against the Soviets in a war that had the full backing of the U.S. government , ” she said .

Creative arts can be painful .
I remember my dad being beaten up numerous times by critics , only to have those same people come back 5/10 years later & say that in retrospect the work was ahead of its time .
Was even revolutionary !

Beck seems to be feeling sorry for himself for having brought down a brickload of opprobrium -- and fleeing advertisers -- for having called President Obama a " racist " with " a deep - seated hatred for white people " .
So he brought on the big guns to defend his teary - eyed self : Rush Limbaugh .
No black hole emerged from the critical mass of so much wingnuttery on one program , but it did produce a yawning maw of first - tier fearmongering , colored with a garish streak of self - pity .
Beck started off the festivities with a brief reference to his , ah , persecution at hands of liberal blue meanies :
Beck :
Oh sure , they 're tearing me apart -- but none of the facts !
Write what you learn on this show down .
Write these questions down and demand answers .
Because it 's not my America we 're talking about here .
It 's all of ours -- left , right , Democrat , Republican -- all of our freedom of speech is on the ropes .
And questioning your government is not only important , it is -- in a democratic republic , which I think we still have , it is required of you .
Freedom of speech is under attack .
Then came on the Big Man himself , who declared Beck heroic for bearing up under siege from those liberal meanies , who want to " silence " right - wing talkers like themselves :
Limbaugh :
This whole administration is as radical and far left as any that the country has ever had .
And what they 're trying to do here to communications is simply stifle dissenting voices .
They 're trying to wipe out any opposition .
If you look at Barack Obama and his track record as a politician , it is to clear the playing field .
He does n't even like debating his opponents .
He just wants to get rid of them .
Quoth the man whose frequently - expressed desire to " do away with all the liberals " inspired The Eliminationists .
But then , Limbaugh is nothing if not the Master of the Projection Strategy .
Thus inspired to new depths , Beck then unleashes one of his patented paranoid fantasies about how somebody from the right is going to do something ugly and give the Obamabots the excuse to " seize power overnight " :
Beck :
If you watch MSNBC , I contend that you will see the future .
Because they are laying the ground for a horrible event that will be -- eh , what they 're laying the ground for , anything from the right , they 're -- some awful event -- and I fear this government , this administration , has so much framework already prepared that they will seize power overnight before anybody even gives it a second thought !
Hmmmm .
Yeah , it 'll be the fault of those darn liberals at MSNBC -- and not right - wing fearmongers like Beck and Limbaugh who are constantly frothing up mindless hysteria about Obama and the Democrats -- who will be responsible when some right - wing extremist blows up another federal building .
Right .
Limbaugh , in response , saves the best for last :
Limbaugh : I 'm really -- you know , we may be looking at Barack Obama destroying the Democrat Party .
It 's too soon to say that now , but we may be looking at that happen .
There are reasons for optimism , but you are right , it is a dangerous time .
It 's the most dangerous time in my life for freedom and liberty in this country .
Beck : I will tell you , um , a lot of people would say , ' Well , that 's Rush Limbaugh , he's , you know , this is hyperbole , etc. etc . '
Would you agree with me , Rush , that this is not -- this is not conservatives or Republicans or independents talking about this , because they do n't like Rush -- uh , they do n't like , um , Barack Obama .
These are Americans -- I 'm an American , I 'm speaking to you as an American -- this is bad for anyone unless you 're in the power circle .
You do n't want to go down this road with what they 're proposing with the FCC .
Limbaugh : No -- well , I do n't want to go down the road with anything they 're proposing on anything , Glenn .
And it 's -- but you ask an interesting question .
You know , are people going to react to you or me , because , ' Well , that 's hyperbole , ' that 's what these guys do .
I , uh , my first hour yesterday was chronicling how this man is systematically dismantling our ability to gather intelligence to protect ourselves against an attack .
He is purposely using his Attorney General to make the United States the villain of the world .
And I 'm gonna tell you , folks .
From the bottom of my heart , I am uncomfortable thinking and saying these things about a man who 's been elected president of the United States .
It is terribly upsetting and disconcerting , and I wish I did n't think it , and I wish I did n't have to say it .
But , there 's no way to sugar - coat it :
This is not politics as usual .
This is not left vs. right .
This is not Republican vs. Democrat .
This is statism , totalitarianism , versus freedom .
And if these people are allowed to go where they want to go unchecked , then some people , a lot of people -- I do n't think half the country , but close -- will wake up one day and find , ' My God , what the hell happened ? '
Because this is not what they voted for , they had no intention of this .
They thought they were getting something entirely different .
And it is , uh , it 's a responsibility that we all have , being honest and earnest , to inform people of what these possibilities are , because they are very real .
Sigh .
Does n't anyone else find it kind of peculiar that right - wingers -- and these two in particular -- not only avidly don the garb of victimhood after making light of actual victims on a professional and regular basis , but also are unable to actually name any " freedoms " that Obama is actually taking away ?
In the two most common instances cited -- Beck 's old fave , guns , and his current fave , the FCC and the " Fairness Doctrine " -- there have been no actual policy changes even submitted or discussed so far .
In other words , they 're scaring up boogie men out of thin air .
This includes the wailing and teeth - gnashing over the ostensible efforts to " silence " them .
Just Lather .
Rinse .
Repeat :
Money , Jobs and Technology
Bizarre .
Annoying .
Frustrating .
All are words that can be used to describe the current moneda ( coin ) crisis that is ensnaring Buenos Aires .
Go to the corner kiosko and you ’re likely to see a small cardboard sign stating , “ no hay monedas . ”
Attempting to buy a $ 3.50 Coca - Cola with a 5 pesos bill ?
Suerte !
The kioskero will roll his eyes , sigh and grimace .
If he has the monedas , this cashier will begrudgingly give up the $ 1.50 in coins .
But if he is short , he will either offer candy in place of the coins , round the price of the sale down to the nearest peso , or could even refuse the sale .
The stresses of this coin shortage are not limited to businesses running the risk of not having enough change , however .
Since most colectivos ( buses ) in Buenos Aires accept coins for payment , nearly everyone living in this city has been affected .
For example , just last weekend I needed to visit the province of Buenos Aires via colectivo , a voyage that was going to cost me approximately 6 pesos in coins round - trip .
As expected , I was short on change .
So I dipped into a couple different subway stations and bought several one - way subway tickets at $ 1.10 with $ 2.00 notes , just to get the $ 0.90 in change .
All this hassle , just for a few coins to take the bus !
Those who do no currently live in Buenos Aires probably think that I ’m speaking in hyperboles .
No sir !
The coin shortage has caused real complications for daily bus commuters , supermarkets , and kioskos alike .
Because of an Argentine law that favors customers in such moneda - less transactions , local businesses frequently lose small portions of the revenue as they are required to round prices down .
Occasionally , even the subway system is forced to give passengers free fares because they lack sufficient coinage .
But why is Argentina experiencing this shortage ?
And who ’s trying to make it better ?
Who ’s to blame ?
Ask a dozen Porteños why they think there is a shortage of coins , and you ’ll get several different explanations .
Each resembling some sort of conspiracy theory , these conjectures place blame on at least one of the following suspects : the Argentine Central Bank , bus companies , cash transport companies , toll road companies , the Federal Government , and private citizens .
But why would these groups want to generate an artificial coin shortage ?
Generally , when there is a shortage of any item in the formal market , a scurrilous black market emerges where that item can be sold at a generous profit .
Coins on the black market are known to be sold at an 8 to 15 % markup .
A full probing discussion of each theory is beyond the scope of this article .
So we ’ll quickly touch on just a few of the explanations .
Let ’s begin with the Argentine Central Bank , the sole supplier of currency to the market .
Critics suspect that the Central Bank has been negligent in its production of new coins .
They argue that if the government simply printed more coins , then the market would be flooded with monedas , thus ending the shortage .
But the Central Bank printed 524 million coins in 2008 , a notable increase from 2006 when the bank minted only 160 million new coins in a time without crisis .
Therefore , the blame placed on the Central Bank seems unfounded , as this institution is at least trying to alleviate the current situation at hand .
Perhaps the more likely culprits are the companies that collect large amounts of coins .
For instance , the bus companies collect millions of coins everyday , but do n’t return an equal amount of coins in change .
Likewise , the companies that transport large amounts of cash have the opportunity to hoard coins .
In October 2008 , a private cash transport company that was connected to two bus companies was found hoarding 13 million coins .
Herein lies the rub , the colectivos have been coin operated for years and there has not been a shortage in the past .
This would seem to suggest that either the bus companies have recently conceived of this lucrative side business , or that there are additional factors at play .
Conversely , while private citizens may not have been the initial cause of the shortage , they could very well be exasperating the problem .
If you are like me , you keep a stash of coins in your apartment because of the shortage .
Just the perception of coin scarcity will lead to hoarding which , in turn , leads to more scarcity .
What ’s the solution ?
Do n’t despair .
There are a few solutions to the shortage , but their level of success has yet to be measured .
The most effective remedy may be to make it possible for all colectivos to accept electronic cards for fare payment , similar to the subway system ’s Monedero card .
The government has implemented the use of electronic cards on a many bus lines and has plans to further expand it .
Another remedy proposed by the Wall Street Journal calls for the subways and buses to print their own tokens , which can be purchased with cash at designated locations .
The association of Argentine Chinese Supermarkets ( Casrech ) has decided to issue tickets in place of coins when they do n’t have adequate change .
The tickets can later be redeemed for 110 % of face value .
But this ticket system may simply be an indication of the greater problem at hand , as this may be a strategy to avoid having to buy coins on the black market at a rate greater than that 110 % .
Additionally , the government has further tried to alleviate the situation by enacting a law that obligates banks to change up to 20 pesos for coins per day for those holding an Argentine bank account .
Unfortunately , most banks simply ignore the law , even though a few have been fined for it .
What can you do ?
The most common strategy for obtaining a healthy stash of monedas is by getting change for $ 1.10 subway tickets .
Regular subway riders will buy individual tickets each time they commute , and walk away with that healthy 90 cents in change .
If you need large amounts of change , and you do n’t consider time to be money , the most reliable place to obtain your stash is at either Retiro or Once train station .
Here you can exchange bills for coins , but ojo !
( watch out ! ) , you could wait in line for hours to do so .
Although the coin shortage may cause you the occasional inconvenience , be thankful for the fact that you do not own a kiosko , taxi , or supermarket .
This unfortunate group is seeing their actual income affected by the shortage .
Hopefully , we will soon see the day when coins are a simple annoyance , and not something that can elicit a death stare from a cashier .
Until then , I eagerly await the day when Bon Bons are no longer used as legal tender .

I missed this yesterday at Newsbusters but Treacher , rightly aghast , tipped me to it this afternoon .
Never will you see a starker example of MSNBC getting away with the sort of deception for which Fox News would be pilloried , especially in the context of race .
If you missed Monday ’s post about this , go watch the footage ( or look at this photo ) and see if you can deduce why they would n’t want to show the guy with the rifle from the neck up during this particular segment .
For all the well - deserved heat that MSNBC ’s primetime line - up has taken for its demagoguery —
Maddow has been notably egregious during the health - care blowup — this proves that they ’re not above pulling this crap during their daytime “ hard news ” segments either .
When you ’re done with the clip , scroll through the new photo gallery Zombie ’s put together of the many , many , many “ Kill Bush ” signs at leftist protests over the past eight years .
Thank goodness outlets like MSNBC and the Huffington Post took such “ blunt , no - argument stances ” against that sort of insanity at the time .
You know those people who go around saying " do n't film anything videoed at these Comic Con presentations or we will kick you out of Con ? "
Thankfully some people ignore them .
Then find a friend with a YouTube acount .
And the studio probably do n't really mind that much … it 's all in the game .
Kick - Ass !
New world 800 m champion Caster Semenya has been asked to take a gender test , according to athletics ' governing body .
The International Association of Athletics Federations says it demanded the test three weeks ago amid fears she should not be able to run as a woman .
IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said the " extremely complex , difficult " test results were not due for several weeks .
The South African athletics federation insists it is " completely sure " that Semenya , 18 , is a female .
" We would not have entered her in the female competition if we had any doubts , " said a statement .
Semenya won gold in impressive fashion on Wednesday , leaving her rivals trailing as she won in a time of one minute , 55.45 seconds .

Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei was second , a massive 2.45 seconds adrift , with Britain 's Jenny Meadows taking bronze .
Semenya did not attend a post - race news conference following her success , but IAAF secretary general Pierre Weiss did appear before the media .
" We know you want to talk to her , but she is young , she is inexperienced and she is not able to reply properly to all your questions , " he said .
" I will answer for her .
The decision not to put her up was taken by the IAAF and the South African federation .
" I repeat , she was not prepared for a situation like this . "
Weiss insisted the IAAF had handled the situation as best as it could and defended the timing of the announcement to test Semenya .

" She was unknown three weeks ago , " he said .
" No one could have anticipated this .
We are fast but we are not a lion . "
He added : " If it is proved that she is not a female , she will be withdrawn and the medals revised .
At the moment , the athlete must be given the benefit of the doubt . "
Semenya burst on to the world stage when she ran 1.56.72 in Bambous last month , smashing her previous personal best by more than seven seconds .
She also broke Zola Budd 's long - standing South African record and arrived here as the newly - crowned African junior champion .
" In the case of this athlete , following her breakthrough in the African junior championships , the rumours , the gossip was starting to build up , " said Davies .
" The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure .
The situation today is that we do not have any conclusive evidence that she should not be allowed to run . "

For once , the tittle - tattle was not the usual sort about performance - enhancing substances .
This was more basic and a whole lot nastier : was the ' she ' actually a ' he ' ?
A group of doctors , including an endocrinologist , a gynaecologist , an internal medicine expert , an expert on gender and a psychologist , have started the testing procedure but it is uncertain when the results will be known .
Weiss said testing was being done in Berlin and South Africa but admitted it was a complex issue .
" At this stage , it 's confusing , " he said .
" Personally I have no clue what 's going on .
I rely on and trust our doctors .
We would have preferred not to have had a controversy . "
After the race , Meadows said : " It 's up to the IAAF to sort it out .
You can't do anything about who is out there .
" There 's just eight people on the track and you just have to make sure you 're in the first three to get a medal . "

Last updated 8 March 2019 .
Les Paul 's guitars were played by stars like Sir Paul McCartney Les Paul , whose pioneering electric guitars were used by a legion of rock stars , has died at the age of 94 .
Mr Paul died from complications of pneumonia in New York , according to Gibson , the firm that sold his guitars .
He is credited with developing one of the first solid - body electric guitars , which went on sale in 1952 and contributed to the birth of rock .
He also developed other influential recording innovations such as multi-track recording and overdubbing .
And he was credited with inventing the eight - track tape recorder .
U2 guitarist The Edge , Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page , Guns N' Roses star Slash and The Who's Pete Townshend are among those closely associated with the Les Paul sound .
Slash described him as " an exceptionally brilliant man " .
Les Paul began as a country and jazz musician .

He said : " Les Paul was a shining example of how full one 's life can be .
He was so vibrant and full of positive energy .
I 'm honoured and humbled to have known and played with him over the years . "
Fellow guitarist Joe Satriani called Paul " the original guitar hero , " saying : " Les Paul set a standard for musicianship and innovation that remains unsurpassed . "
Henry Juszkiewicz , chairman of Gibson Guitar , said : " His influence extends around the globe and across every boundary . "
Gibson president Dave Berryman said : " As the ' father of the electric guitar ' , he was not only one of the world 's greatest innovators but a legend who created , inspired and contributed to the success of musicians around the world . "

Mr Paul was also a successful performer in his own right , notching up 11 number one singles and 36 gold discs with his wife Mary Ford .
He was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978 and the Rock ' n ' Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 .
Les Paul began as a country and jazz musician , playing with such acts as Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole .
Unhappy with acoustic guitars , he had begun experimenting with guitar amplification at the age of 13 by placing a telephone receiver under the strings .
Les Paul performed with his wife Mary Ford
He created his first solid - body electric guitar , dubbed " the log " , in 1941 .
" I went into a nightclub and played it .
Of course , everybody had me labelled as a nut , " he later said .
It did not go on sale for another 11 years , by which time Leo Fender 's rival Telecaster model was already on the market .
In 1948 , Mr Paul almost died in a car crash that shattered his right arm and elbow .
Afterwards , he convinced doctors to set his broken arm at a right angle in the guitar - picking and cradling position .
' Beautiful guitar '
He continued to refine his guitar design throughout the 1950s .
Its basic structure has barely changed over the decades and continues to be popular among stars and amateurs alike .
Gibson released a line of Les Paul guitars designed by Slash Stephen Lawson , editor of Total Guitar magazine , said : " It was a beautiful guitar it was hand crafted , it was carved , it was a really beautiful looking instrument .
His work on taping techniques began after World War II , when Bing Crosby gave him a tape recorder .
After building a primitive home studio , he started to experiment with multi-tracking - a technique where separate recordings are combined .
Recordings such as Lover , Nola , Brazil and Whispering featured the musician layering guitar parts on top of one another , often varying tape speeds to produce unusual tones and pitches .
The technique became more widely appreciated on his 1950s recordings with Ford , particularly the US number one hit How High the Moon .
" I 've been trying to imagine a world without Les Paul - it would be so different .
Until he invented multi- track recording , you had to make a record gathered round a microphone in the middle of room , " said Stephen Lawson .
" One of the most obvious classic Les Paul Guitar solos is Sweet Child of Mine by Guns N' Roses - that intro has such a distinctive Les Paul sound to it .
" It can go from a mellow beautiful sound that really hits you in your soul , all the way to a shredding searing lead guitar tone . "

I can’t help myself .
I still think it ’s worth bringing up , even for the 64th time .
I ’m talking , of course , about the atomic obliteration , at the end of a terrible , world - rending war , of two Japanese cities , Hiroshima and Nagasaki , on August 6 and 9 , 1945 , whose anniversaries  if that ’s even the appropriate word for it  are once again upon us .
In this , at least , I know I ’m not a typical American : Hiroshima and Nagasaki still seem all too real to me .
As the child of anti-nuclear activists , I was raised to pay attention to two significant dates in American history  the day when the Enola Gay , a B - 29 Superfortress bomber named after the pilot ’s mother , dropped Little Boy , a five - ton uranium explosion bomb , on Hiroshima ; and the moment , three days later , when another plane , jokingly named Bock ’s Car ( after the plane ’s original pilot ) , dropped Fat Man ( a moniker supposedly given it in honor of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ) , a more complex plutonium implosion bomb , on Nagasaki .
When I was little , in preparation for those dates  and in this we were truly a minority of a minority in this country  we showed films documenting the aftermath of the atomic bombings .
To this day , I can remember threading our old 16 mm projector and then watching the shocking , shaky , grainy , black - and - white footage of ruined cities and ruined bodies filling the living room wall as one of those somber male over - voices narrated the facts .
So now , as the 64th anniversary of so many deaths approaches and thinking the unthinkable remains incomprehensibly in vogue , it seems worth the bother to recall one more time just what it means for the unthinkable to become reality .
The Death Count
In Hiroshima , Little Boy ’s huge fireball and explosion killed 70,000 to 80,000 people instantly .
Another 70,000 were seriously injured .
As Joseph Siracusa , author of Nuclear Weapons : A Very Short Introduction , writes : “ In one terrible moment , 60 % of Hiroshima … was destroyed .
The blast temperature was estimated to reach over a million degrees Celsius , which ignited the surrounding air , forming a fireball some 840 feet in diameter . ”
Three days later , Fat Man exploded 1,840 feet above Nagasaki , with the force of 22,000 tons of TNT .
According to “ Hiroshima and Nagasaki Remembered , ” a web resource on the bombings developed for young people and educators , 286,000 people lived in Nagasaki before the bomb was dropped ; 74,000 of them were killed instantly and another 75,000 were seriously injured .

In addition to those who died immediately , or soon after the bombings , tens of thousands more would succumb to radiation sickness and other radiation - induced maladies in the months , and then years , that followed .
In an article written while he was teaching math at Tufts University in 1983 , Tadatoshi Akiba calculated that , by 1950 , another 200,000 people had died as a result of the Hiroshima bomb , and 140,000 more were dead in Nagasaki .
Dr. Akiba was later elected mayor of Hiroshima and became an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament .
Surviving Hiroshima
Those who somehow managed to survive call themselves Hibakusha , which literally means “ those who were bombed . ”
Most of the inhabitants of those two cities who miraculously made it through those hot and terrible August days are , if alive , now in their seventies or eighties , and they continue to tell their unique stories of horror , destruction , and survival .
Their urgent pleas for peace , disarmament , and atonement often go unheard by a twenty - first century American culture that often seems to barely recall what happened last week , much less 64 years ago .
Many of them have , over the years , traveled to the United States to tell their stories and show their scars , demanding that we never forget and that the world work towards nuclear disarmament .
Akihiro Takahashi is 77 years old now , but part of him will always be the 14 - year - old boy standing in line with his classmates on August 6 , 1945 , less than a mile from where Little Boy detonated .
He still recalls how he and his classmates were knocked off their feet by the blast .
When he stood up again , he “ felt the city of Hiroshima had disappeared all of a sudden .
Then I looked at myself and found my clothes had turned into rags due to the heat .
I was probably burned at the back of the head , on my back , on both arms and both legs .
My skin was peeling and hanging . ”
Since that time , Takahashi has endured many operations and spent countless hours in the hospital to repair the damage wrought in that single instant .
On that August morning , he began to walk home  though there were few homes left in the leveled city  stopping to relieve the terrible heat and pain of his burns in the Ota River that flows through Hiroshima .
Along the way , he encountered injured friends , including a boy with terrible burns on the bottoms of his feet whom he half carried along with him .
“ When we were resting because we were so exhausted , ” he related in an oral history , “ I found my grandfather ’s brother and his wife , in other words , great uncle and great aunt , coming toward us .
That was quite [ a ] coincidence …
[ W ]e have a proverb about meeting Buddha in Hell .
My encounter with my relatives at that time was just like that .
They seem[ed ] to be the Buddha to me wandering in the living hell . ”
Jigoku de hotoke ni au you is the phrase .
In English , the equivalent would be “ an oasis in the desert , ” something rare that provides great relief .
There were not many such oases in Hiroshima that day .

Imagining Nagasaki
Akihiro Takahashi’s story ( of which the above was but a small part ) is just one of so many thousands  and hardly one of the grimmest .
Of course , 80,000 to 140,000 stories went with their potential tellers to their graves that day .
Along with the stories that could be told , there were also the photographs to help us imagine the unimaginable .
Yosuke Yamahata was 28 years old and working for the Japanese News Information Bureau in August 1945 .
Along with Eiji Yamada , a painter , and Jun Higashi , a writer , he was dispatched to devastated Nagasaki by the Japanese military just hours after Fat Man exploded and instructed to “ photograph the situation so as to be as useful as possible for military propaganda . ”
Their train arrived at the outskirts of the ruined city in the middle of the night .
Here ’s how Yamahata describes the scene : “ I remember vividly the cold night air and the beautiful starry sky …
A warm wind began to blow .
Here and there in the distance I saw many small fires , like elf fires , smoldering .
Nagasaki had been completely destroyed . ”
By the time the sun rose , Yamahata had made his way to the center of what was no longer a city .
As the day went on , he retraced his steps , along the way taking photographs of the carnage and destruction until he was back at the train station .
All in all , he took 119 photographs that day , capturing some of the most haunting and enduring images of the atomic age .
In one , a bloodied boy holding a rice ball stares , his head covered with an air raid hood ( a dark cloth that the Japanese military handed out to civilians telling them it would protect them from American bombs ) ; in another , an exhausted - looking woman nurses a badly burnt baby .
In almost every image , the ground is littered with burnt bodies and unattached limbs , household items , rubble , and timbers .
As he walked through the missing city , people cried out for water or for help uncovering bodies buried in the rubble .
“ It is perhaps unforgiveable , ” reflected Yamahata , “ but in fact at the time I was completely calm and composed .
In other words , perhaps it was just too much , too enormous to absorb . ”
Returning to Tokyo , Yamahata took advantage of the general confusion that surrounded the Japanese surrender to the Americans and managed to hold on to his negatives , rather than turning them over to his superiors .
A handful of his images were published in Japanese newspapers at the end of August 1945 , before the American army arrived and the U.S. occupation began .
In October 1945 , occupation authorities imposed a ban on photographing the atomic sites and on the publication of all atomic - related stories ( and the images that went with them ) .
Most of Yamahata ’s photographs from Nagasaki were not seen until 1952 , after Japan was once again an independent nation and Life Magazine published a few of his Nagasaki photos .
That same year almost all the Nagasaki photographs were published in Japan under the title : Atomized Nagasaki : The Bombing of Nagasaki , A Photographic Record .
The book includes sketches by Eiji Yamada and an essay by Jun Higashi , his two companions in Nagasaki that day .
In the introduction , Yamahata wrote : “ Human memory has a tendency to slip and critical judgment to fade with the years and with changes in life style and circumstance …
These photographs will continue to provide us with an unwavering testimony to the realities of that time . ”
Remembering
When I was young , to keep memory from “ slipping , ” our family and friends marked the anniversary of those terrible days in a distant land with a demonstration or vigil .
Often , we ended with a ceremony of remembrance , setting paper lanterns afloat on water in honor of those who died .
Admittedly , this would not pass for a carefree American summer evening , but even as a little girl I came to feel as if I knew some of the A - bomb survivors personally  the experience of Akihiro Takahashi , the photographs of Yosuke Yamahata , and perhaps closest to my heart , the story of Sadako Sasaki .
Sadako and the Thousan ... Eleanor Coerr Best Price : $ 1.11 Buy New $ 3.75 ( as of 09:25 EST - Details )
The children ’s book , Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes , written by Eleanor Coerr , brought me close to one girl whose life was cut short by my government ’s A - bomb long before I was born .
I was then a chubby , sedentary kid , and so found myself strangely intrigued and confused by Sadako ’s deep love of running .
She was just two years old when Little Boy exploded above her city , but eight or nine as the book begins , impatient and uncomfortable with all the obligatory ceremonies surrounding the anniversary of the bomb in Hiroshima .
She did not like to look at the survivors or care to hear the terrible stories .
All she wanted to do was run .
Lithe , athletic , and popular , Sadako joined a footrace on the very anniversary of the destruction of her city and , when she found herself unable to finish , was taken to the doctor only to discover that she had “ atom bomb sickness ”  in her case , leukemia .
In the hospital , a friend reminded her of an ancient Japanese belief : if you fold 1,000 paper cranes , the Gods will grant you a wish .
So with the help of her classmates , she began to do just that .
Scrap paper , candy wrappers , fancy printed paper : all become tiny origami birds of hope .
With her as an inspiration , I learned to fold paper cranes , practicing until I could do so with my eyes closed and fold them as small as a pea .
Childhood being childhood , what may have impressed me most was a friend of mine who could fold those origami birds with her toes .
On October 25 , 1955 , with 356 birds left to go ( as Coerr tells it ) , Sadako died .
Since 1958 , a statue of Sadako holding a golden folded crane has stood in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial , draped with small paper birds sent from children all over the world , a symbol of peace .
Hiroshima and Nagasaki Today
Sixty - four years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki , we need more than symbols of peace .
Folding paper cranes alone cannot , unfortunately , end the threat of nuclear war .
Memories of the destruction fade , the hibakusha grow even older and die , the haunting pictures end up in books stored spine out on bookshelves .
Meanwhile , the terror of nuclear annihilation  so keen at certain moments during the long superpower Cold War stand - off  seems to have worn off almost completely .
That ’s too bad , since the actual threat of nuclear war remains hidden but potent .
The nine nuclear powers  the United States , Russia , France , England , China , Israel , Pakistan , India , and North Korea  have more than 27,000 operational nuclear weapons among them , enough to destroy several Earth - sized planets .
And in May , Mohamed ElBaradei , the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency , warned that the number of nuclear powers could double in a few years unless new disarmament is a priority .
Is it any wonder then that , according to a recent Rasmussen opinion poll , one in five Americans believe nuclear war “ very likely ” in this century , and more than half , “ likely ” ?
The unthinkable is still under consideration  even as the Obama administration takes its first steps in the right direction .
In an April speech in Prague , President Obama publicly embraced the goal of seeking “ the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons . ”
In its wake , his administration has begun taking still quite modest but potentially important steps towards that goal , including : renewed talks with Russia over mutual nuclear reductions , conversations initiated in the Senate about jump - starting the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban , stalled these last 10 years , and of negotiations for the also stalled Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty , imagined as an internationally verified ban on the production of nuclear materials for weapons .

Right now , however , the American nuclear landscape  little acknowledged or discussed  remains grimly potent .
According to the authoritative Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , the United States still maintains a nuclear stockpile estimated at 5,200 warheads  of which approximately 2,700 are operational ( with the rest in reserve ) , while the Obama administration will spend more than $ 6 billion on the research and development of nuclear weapons this year alone .
At some point early next year , the administration will complete a Nuclear Posture Review outlining the role it believes nuclear weapons should play in the American pantheon of power , and , if the president follows through on his anti-nuclear statements , perhaps that document will at least begin to limit the scenarios in which such weapons could be used .
In the meantime , the policy of the United States remains no different than it was in 2004 , when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signed the Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy .
It said , in part , that the United States possesses nuclear weapons for the purposes of “ destroying those critical war - making and war - supporting assets and capabilities that a potential enemy leadership values most and that it would rely on to achieve its own objectives in a post - war world . ”
Read that sentence again , and think , under such a doctrine , what might the United States not bomb ?
Keep in mind as well that the bombs which annihilated two Japanese cities and ended so many lives 64 years ago this week were puny when compared to today ’s typical nuclear weapon .
Little Boy was a 15 - kiloton warhead .
Most of the warheads in the U.S. arsenal today are 100 or 300 kilotons  capable of taking out not a Japanese city of 1945 but a modern megalopolis .
Bruce Blair , president of the World Security Institute and a former launch - control officer in charge of Minutemen Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles armed with 170 , 300 , and 335 - kiloton warheads , pointed out a few years ago that , within 12 minutes , the United States and Russia could launch the equivalent of 100,000 Hiroshimas .
It is unthinkable .
It seems unimaginable .
It sounds like hyperbole , but consider it an uncomfortable and necessary truth .
The people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the children of our future need us to understand this and act upon it  64 years too late … and not a minute too soon .

Frida Berrigan , a Senior Program Associate at the New America Foundation ’s Arms and Security Initiative , is the eldest daughter of peace activists Liz McAlister and Philip Berrigan .
The two met during the Vietnam War , founded the Jonah House community in the early 1970s and spent eleven years of their marriage separated by prison sentences stemming from their anti-nuclear and peace activities .
Phil Berrigan died in 2002 at the age of 79 .
Recently by Gary North : What I Should Have Said to Meryl Streep
Bill Marina ( 1937 — 2009 ) died of a heart attack on the morning of July 7 .
The libertarian movement has lost one of its most gifted historians .
He was retired from teaching , but he was the least retired retired professor I have ever known .
He was working on half a dozen major projects when he died .
My main regret is that he did not write more books .
But he wrote essays and short items constantly , including one posted a couple of hours before he died : an essay on Israeli “ sovereignty ” ( his quotation marks ) and American power .
He was the author of the standard college - level textbook on the history of Florida .
That was his only book that ever sold well .
He was a non-interventionist in his view of American foreign policy .
He began his academic career with a 1968 Ph.D. dissertation : Opponents of Empire : An Interpretation of American Anti-Imperialism , 1898 — 1921 .
Sadly , it was never published .
With the Web , I hope the actual dissertation will be .
He had recently bought a book - scanning machine that will create PDFs .
He wanted to re-publish classic books and post them on the Web .
He never deviated from his opposition to empire .
He took shots at it whenever he could find an outlet .
He is the only person I ever knew who thought George Washington was a closet imperialist .
He wrote this in a LRC article in 2007 .
Much has been made by some opponents of Interventionism , in suggesting that we go back to Washington ’s Farewell Address , of “ no entangling alliances , ” as a model for the country today .
I believe this a misreading of the Washington - Alexander Hamilton view , that this really meant an open door to unilateral intervention .
As exhibit one , I would offer Washington ’s aid to the French Creoles in Haiti in 1792 , in an effort to thwart the Blacks revolting there .
Here was America ’s first effort at “ foreign aid , ” some $ 726,000 at a time when that was real money !
As a southerner and slaveholder , Washington was concerned that Black revolt would carry over into the United States .
Bill Marina was hard - core .
He wrote a series of articles three decades ago on the militia in the American Revolution .
The local militias , not Washington ’s centralized conventional army , held the British in check inside coastal cities .
He wrote this in 1975 :
The regular American army , as well as segments of a rag - tag militia , accepted the surrender at Yorktown .
The existence of that army should never be allowed to obscure the large reason for the British defeat which was that they could never control , let alone win over , a population of armed militia that was the foundation of support for the American government .
The British military historian Eric Robson acknowledged : “ Restricted to little more than the ground they stood on , the British increasingly found subsistence a matter of considerable difficulty . ”
That was not the result of Washington ’s valiant little army camped at Valley Forge or for so many years across the Hudson from the British in New York City , but rather the American guerrilla militia that from local homes and farms made life in the British Army a living hell .
Every small detachment was legitimate prey for the Americans .
Historians will never know how many of these small skirmishes there were , but only glimpse them all over the landscape , realizing that they form the real reason for the low British morale and eventual defeat .
I earned a Ph.D. in American history , with a concentration in colonial America .
Before I read Marina , I had never heard this story .
It is still ignored in the textbooks .
This was the origin of the Second Amendment .
I knew nothing of his heart condition , but I was concerned that he would not finish his great book , a detailed analysis of the Kennedy assassination .
He was the only history professor who was in Dealey Plaza at the moment it happened .
He was on the faculty of the University of Texas , Arlington , at the time .
He spent over 40 years studying the event , and having his students study it .
He was convinced that Oswald acted alone .
His death is unnerving for me , because a week ago , I wrote an article about a letter I sent to him on how to market his book , when he finished it .
In late April , I wrote an article just for him , to encourage him to finish .
I wrote this :
It is steady as you go .
It is line upon line .
It is cumulative .
If you are working on several projects , be sure that you have a schedule to complete each one in sequence .
Stick to your schedule .
If you do n’t , you will probably die with all of them incomplete and fragmentary .
So , you must prioritize .
Be in a position to reschedule your time , so that if you ever find out you are terminal , you can complete the main one .
This means that you must steadily complete sections of the main one .
Get them finished .
Do n’t assume that you have 20 years .
My worst fear has been realized .
I will miss him personally .
I will miss his intellect .
I am happy that just a few days ago , I asked him for recommendations of books on Confucius .
He was also an expert in Chinese history .
He sent me three suggestions .
I should have asked for a lot more suggestions over the years .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- China is on an oil buying binge .
Over the past few months , the Chinese government -- or its big government - controlled oil firms -- have closed or floated a slew of deals in countries all over the world .
These deals have expanded the nation 's oil reach and may one day position the nation to match the skills of western oil firms .
The deals include a $ 10 billion loan the Chinese government extended to Russia 's Rosneft in exchange for a guaranteed cut of that company 's production .
The Chinese have also gotten in tight with Brazil 's Petrobras , arranging a similar deal with the firm that is developing a huge new offshore field - one of the biggest new discoveries in decades .
But it does n't end with loans .
Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that China National Petroleum Corporation is interested in buying all or a part of Argentina 's YPF for $ 14.5 billion , although a deal is far from certain .
In Africa , CNOOC and Sinopec are buying a $ 1.3 billion stake in offshore Angolan development rights from American oil firm Marathon .
Angola has recently overtaken Nigeria as Africa 's biggest oil producer , and is one of Exxon Mobil 's ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) favorite countries to invest in .
And rumors are swirling that the China National Petroleum Corporation will take the majority stake in Iraq 's Rumaila oilfield from BP ( BP ) .
Rumaila produces over 1 million barrels a day , and is Iraq 's biggest oil field .
It 's clear what the Chinese are doing .
" They are stilting on a huge pile of cash and they 're using this as a buying opportunity , " said Greg Priddy , a global energy analyst at the Eurasia group , a political risk consultancy .
China wants to buy oil for several reasons .
First , they can .
Their huge trade surplus means the Chinese have racked up a giant stash of dollars .
But this pile of dollars can be dangerous .
Many worry the dollar is set to fall due to rampant American spending .
But China is stuck .
It ca n't sell them too fast for fear of accelerating the dollar 's weakness .
So buying hard assets like oil is a great way for China to diversify its holdings , without destabilizing the greenback .
Second , they do n't really trust the market .
The Chinese , along with many Asian countries , have less faith in the free market .
This distrust was , in Chinese eyes , probably justified a few years back , after they tried to buy U.S. oil company Unocal in an open market deal that collapsed after a public outcry in the United States .
" The Chinese definitely want their own stuff that they can control and send anywhere in the world , " said Priddy .
Finally , they see the big picture .
Chinese oil demand is expected to grow nearly 20 % in the next six years , and the country already imports over half of the 8 million barrels a day it uses .
" They are doing what you 'd expect any country to do :
They are procuring resources for the best interest of the people , " said Ruchir Kadakia , a global oil analyst with the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
" I think they watched the developed world dig itself into a deep enough hole to learn a few lessons . "
All this buying raises the question : Will the Chinese firms soon be able to rival the Western oil companies ?
In many ways they already do .
China National Petroleum Corporation 's daily oil production is already roughly equivalent to Exxon's .
And PetroChina at one point had a market capitalization twice Exxon's , although the vast majority of shares are owned by the government - run China National Petroleum Corporation so it 's hard to arrive at a true market value .
Where the Chinese firms lag is in expertise .
Complex operations - like deep water drilling or liquefying natural gas , are still the domain of the Western oil firms .
But given time , and given their need to develop those deep - water leases off Angola , the Chinese are bound to gain the technical know - how that will put them on - par with the best western firms .
New simulations reveal that turbulence created by jets of material ejected from the Universe 's largest black holes can stop stars from forming .
Evan Scannapieco , of Arizona State University ( ASU ) and Marcus Brüggen of Jacobs University in Bremen , Germany , present a new model in a paper to be published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .

We live in a hierarchical Universe : the Earth is a planet in our solar system , the solar system resides in the Milky Way Galaxy , and galaxies combine into groups and clusters .
Clusters are the largest structures in the Universe , but sadly we know little about them .
While researchers have long known that the gas in the centres of some galaxy clusters is rapidly cooling and condensing , they were puzzled why this condensed gas did not form into stars .
Until recently , no model existed that successfully explained how this was possible .
" There are two types of clusters , " says Scannapieco , " cool - core clusters and non-cool core clusters .
Non-cool core clusters have n't been around long enough to cool , whereas cool - core clusters are rapidly cooling , although by our standards they are still very hot . "
Our understanding of the activity occurring within cool - core clusters has been revolutionised by X - ray telescopes .
Although these clusters can contain hundreds or even thousands of galaxies , they are mostly made up of a diffuse , but very hot gas known as the intracluster medium .
This intergalactic gas is only visible to X - ray telescopes , which map out its temperature and structure .
The observations show that the diffuse gas is rapidly cooling in the centres of cool - core clusters .
At the core of each of these clusters is a black hole , billions of times more massive than the Sun .
Some of the cooling medium makes its way down to a dense disc surrounding this black hole , some of it goes into the black hole itself , and some of it is shot outward .
X - ray images clearly show jet - like bursts of ejected material , which occur in regular cycles .
But why are these outbursts so regular ?
And why does the cooling gas never drop to colder temperatures that lead to the formation of stars ?
Some unknown mechanism is creating an impressive balancing act .
" It looked like the jets coming from black holes were somehow responsible for stopping the cooling , " says Scannapieco , " but until now no one was able to determine how exactly . "
Scannapieco and Brüggen used the enormous supercomputers at ASU to develop their own three - dimensional simulation of the galaxy cluster surrounding one of the Universe 's biggest black holes .
Their simulation included a component modelling the effects of turbulence , which had never been accounted for in the past .
Turbulence , by its very nature , is extremely complex , and so simulating it directly is no easy task .
But Scannapieco and Brüggen adapted an approach developed by Guy Dimonte at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Robert Tipton at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which uses a set of differential equations .
They work showed that turbulence is a key ingredient in the galactic processes .
" When you have turbulent flow , you have random motions on all scales , " explains Scannapieco .
" Each jet of material ejected from the disc creates turbulence that mixes everything together . "
Every time some cool gas ( shown in blue in the simulation on the right ) reaches the black hole , it is shot out in a jet ( shown in red and yellow ) .
This generates turbulence that mixes the hot gas with the cold gas .
The mixture becomes so hot that it does n't accrete onto the black hole .
The jet stops and there is nothing to drive the turbulence , so it fades away .
At that point , the hot gas no longer mixes with the cold gas , so the centre of the cluster cools , and more gas makes its way down to the black hole .
Before long , another jet forms and the gas is once again mixed together .
Thus , turbulence works in partnership with the black hole to maintain the balance .
Without the turbulence , the jets coming from around the black hole would grow stronger and stronger , and the gas would cool catastrophically into a swarm of new stars .
When turbulence is accounted for , the black hole not only balances the cooling , but goes through regular cycles of activity .
" We improved our simulations so that they could capture those tiny turbulent motions , " says Scannapieco .
" Even though we can't see them , we can estimate what they would do .
The time it takes for the turbulence to decay away is exactly the same amount of time observed between the outbursts . "

( CNN ) --
An international search is under way for a 29 - year - old Auburn University veterinary student who vanished under what appears to be unusual circumstances in Thailand .
Michael Griffin Harrie , 29 , disappeared earlier this month during a vacation in Thailand , Auburn University says .
The family of Michael Griffin Harrie is pleading for help in locating him .
" We just do n't know what happened to him , " Paul Harrie told CNN about his missing son .
" I now know the meaning of living a nightmare . "
In a media release , Alabama 's Auburn University said Harrie , a second - year student at the veterinary school , was attending a summer study abroad program in Morioka , Japan .
He informed a professor he was going to take a one - week vacation with friends to Bangkok , Thailand , that would begin on July 7 .
" He said he would be back on the 14th , " his father explained .
But Harrie never returned to his studies .
And when he failed to meet up with his parents in Tokyo on July 16 , they reported him missing .
The investigation into Harrie 's disappearance is being led by Bangkok police .
The American Embassy in Thailand has also been notified , and Auburn University has dispatched two representatives to Japan .
" The role there is to provide assistance to the family , " Auburn University communication director Michael Clardy told CNN .
The best clues to finding Harrie appear on video .
Harrie 's father , who hired a private detective agency to assist in the search , said surveillance tape from Bangkok 's Suvarnabhumi airport on July 14 shows his son entering the airport but then exiting the terminal before checking in for his flight .
Why would he suddenly turn around and leave remains a mystery .
Efforts to track him through automated bank transactions also add to the complexity .
His father said his son stopped withdrawing money out of ATM machines a day earlier , on July 13 .
While his family calls Harrie an avid traveler , Paul Harrie said his son's behavior is out of character .
" The idea of picking up and not telling anyone is very unlike him .
He likes to explore areas but always under some sort of controlled circumstances so we know where he is going .
The concern is he did n't tell anybody where he was going , " he said .
The worry was heightened on Tuesday because Harrie was not on his scheduled flight home to the United States where his veterinary school training was to resume in the fall .
His family , desperate for answers , has a message they hope will reach their missing loved one .
" If anybody sees him , please ask him to contact us , " Paul Harrie said .
" We love him , and we are worried sick about him . "
Michael Harrie is from the San Francisco , California , area .
He has blue eyes and brown hair , wears eye - glasses and is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds .
The Auburn University Department of Public Safety and Security is asking for anyone with any information on his whereabouts to call at 334-844-8888 .
Former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , who has a new book out this week , warned in an interview that national security will suffer if counter - terrorism warriors fear that bosses will second - guess their front - line actions after the fact .
Chertoff said his book , “ Homeland Security : Assessing the First Five Years , ” lays out an architecture for defending the nation against the threats of the 21st century .
As Homeland Security chief from 2005 through the end of the Bush administration , Chertoff oversaw 218,000 employees and a $ 50 - billion budget .
He was head of the Justice Department ’s criminal division from 2001 to 2003 , during which time he led the investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks and prosecutions of cases including the Enron scandal .
Dressed casually and speaking in rapid - fire sentences , he spoke with a reporter in the offices of his security consulting company , the Chertoff Group .
The following is an edited account of the interview .

Making the headlines these days are such issues as shutting down the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and possible prosecutions of CIA interrogators .
Some critics , including former Vice President Dick Cheney , say such moves make America less safe .
Where do you stand ?
What we owe the people who are at the point of the spear is certainty .
Right after 9/11 . . . there was a lot of criticism about prior timidity in being too lawyered up and too cautious about killing [ Osama ] bin Laden .
. . .
Now , I think you ’d be fair to say as an agent : I should be as nonaggressive as possible .
. . .
Unfortunately that ’s the message coming out .
. . .
People will take the most risk - averse option .
And of course the country wo n’t be safe .
Advertisement
And if you think the country should tolerate that , that ’s a fair argument .
But you ’ve got to be clear about it and . . . if it turns out that something happens as a result and Americans get killed , then you have to take responsibility .
--
You do n’t talk much in the book about detention or interrogation issues .
There ’s a lot of criticism that there was excess and abuse during the George W. Bush administration .
How do you feel about that looking back ?
I think it ’s a reasonable criticism to say that we in the last administration took too long to get these military commissions and processes up and running .
By waiting a long time to get that done , it kind of soured the process .
Advertisement
On the other hand , I have to say , Congress has shown no interest in actually writing a set of rules and laws that would govern the problem of people who ca n’t be prosecuted in a criminal court , maybe ca n’t be prosecuted in a military commission , but are clearly too dangerous to release .
I spent four years working real hard to keep people who were trained in Al Qaeda camps from coming into the country .
The idea that we [ might ] bring them in and let them go is not a happy prospect .
--
In addition to terrorism , you write about this idea of groups like the Mexican cartels or the Central American Mara Salvatrucha , or MS - 13 , gang that have a destabilizing capacity .
Advertisement
When you deal with groups like the FARC [ Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ] or MS - 13 or some of the cartels along the northern part of Mexico , they are almost at the level of acting in a political way .
They use violence for political purposes ; they do threaten the stability of at least the local authorities .
If you look at Venezuela , that ’s a great example of the confluence of Hezbollah , Iran , Venezuela , the FARC -- all these actors have found each other , and the traditional line between what ’s criminal and what ’s war and the national defense has really eroded .
. . . [ Venezuelan President Hugo ]
Chavez has made a deliberate decision to set himself up against the United States .
. . .
He has aligned himself with non-state actors . . . and so there we see the entire spectrum of basically a unity of effort on the part of both a state actor that ’s hostile to the U.S. and non-state actors who are hostile to the U.S. and / or interested in criminal activity .
That to me is unfortunately the wave of the future .

The problems of social mobility highlighted in the all - party report chaired by Alan Milburn last week were genuinely shocking .
After 12 years of Labour government , the fact that , for instance , 75 per cent of judges are privately educated , as well as more than 50 per cent of top journalists , when only 7 per cent of the population goes to private schools is a damning picture of inequality in Britain .
The litany of injustice is depressing .
The Russell Group of elite universities has only 16 per cent of undergraduates from the poorest economic backgrounds .
In contrast , 68 per cent of top barristers went to private schools .
Britain is one of the least socially mobile countries in Europe .
Shocking , but no surprise .
For a long time , class has been pushed to one side in political debate .
Money has been put into improving failing schools – but the idea of excellence , high aspiration and achievement that characterises the best private schools is rarer in the state sector .
In short , it is obvious that , on the whole , most kids that go to most private schools get a better education .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Education is n't the only inequality .
Any child from a middle - class family will enjoy a huge amount of social capital .
Their family will be likely to value education highly .
( One of the deep - rooted problems with the working class is that many of them are suspicious of education as simply trying to be " posh " . )
Crucially , they will be personally connected to other professionals , and will be able to arrange , say , work placements for friends .
Furthermore , wealthy families can afford to work for nothing at voluntary internships .
Part of the reason for this continuing underachievement by the Government is that New Labour has had a very particular definition of equality – and one that continues to favours the middle class by default .
In September last year , Harriet Harman announced that she was going to press for greater representation of women , ethnic minorities and disabled people at Westminster – a typical box - ticking attitude to " representation " .
However , she did n't make much of a fuss about the fact that there are only 38 MPs from manual occupations in the Commons – a third of the working population represented by only 6 per cent of MPs .
Political correctness as a substitute for political action is not the only difficulty .
There have certainly been improvements over the last generation in state schooling , but they have all too often been about making sure that the most disadvantaged , and possibly thick , kids ( yes some kids are thick , in all social classes ) are not left behind rather than pushing gifted children to their limit in the way they do in good private schools .
Also , deprived children in sink schools can be disruptive and mess up things for kids who want to work hard .
Thus there are a lot of very clever kids from poor backgrounds that slip through the net and end up in McJobs .
Realistically , the playing field will never be entirely flat .
For a start , there is only a limited number of clever children .
And all the gerrymandered university entrances and puffed - up exam results wo n't change that .
Not everyone is , can be , or even wants to be , smart .
However , there is an answer to this problem of continuing inequality .
It is simple , and highly effective .
It would transform almost overnight a weak public education system into one that would probably be the best in the world .
It would save the middle classes a great deal of money , and still retain for them a considerable advantage in the world of work , while enabling the most underprivileged working - class children to succeed .
It is a win -win situation .
The trouble is , it 's taboo .
I 'm talking about the abolition of private schools .
Such a suggestion is always met with cries of " Jacobin " or " Stalinist " .
But if we could just put aside our emotional reactions for a moment , the positive consequences would be massive .
First , state schools would improve immeasurably – because the middle classes would have to send their children to them ( although a small number might be educated abroad ) .
The schools would be top notch because the middle classes would n't be campaigning for better education out of idealism but straightforward self - interest .
Also the deadening strictures of the national curriculum could be got rid of – fine for the plebs , but the middle classes would n't want to see their children so narrowly and mechanically educated .
Second , the middle classes would save themselves tens of thousands of pounds in school fees .
Third , middle - class and working - class children would mix , which would erode prejudice on both sides .
For those in the middle classes who would fear losing their privileges under such a system – and that means all of them – plenty of privileges would remain .
Connections , wealth and an educated background all represent a major advantage over clever " ordinary " kids and would still do so .
Furthermore , the working class would doubtless remain prejudiced against being posh , so the field would still be skewed .
The professions would still be packed with the privileged .
Just less so .
It would , if you like , reduce privilege to a minimum without abolishing it entirely ( an impossibility ) .
Of course this wo n't happen , because we are not rational in our choices – or about the idea of choice .
So the next best thing – in the realms of reality – is remove the absurd charity status from private schools and continue to press them to open up their facilities to state - educated pupils .
And above all , push the idea of excellence in state schools rather than just flattening everyone out ( an idea that is gaining favour through streaming and gifted - child programmes ) .
The problem that the Labour Party has is not recognising that intellectual elites really do exist .
There is a small number of clever people .
But they are not concentrated among the middle classes .
They are everywhere , randomly distributed .
Thus this is not just a matter of fairness – society will operate far better if all the most able get a chance .
And the middle classes will still be on easy street .
I 'm not sure who came up with the phrase " elitism for everyone " .
But it 's a great political principle , and Labour should waste no time putting it into practice .
BEIJING 
The toll from the already deadly Typhoon Morakot in the Pacific threatened to soar on Tuesday , as huge mudslides buried a rural village in south - central Taiwan and at least six apartment buildings in coastal China , leaving hundreds of people missing .
The Taiwan mudslide , triggered early Sunday by as much as eight feet of typhoon - spawned rain , was said by local residents to have buried as many as 600 people in the village of Hsiao - lin , but the figure could not be quickly verified .
Image Unverified reports by residents suggested Monday that Hsiao - lin , a village in southern Taiwan , was buried in a mudslide , leaving as many as 600 people missing .

In Pengxi , a mountain - ringed town in coastal China about 270 miles southwest of Shanghai , a landslide buried six four - story apartment buildings as residents slept at 10:30 p.m. Monday , local time .
Rescuers pulled four survivors and two bodies from the debris , but were unable to say how many others were missing .
To the list of industries undermined by the Internet , from music to the Yellow Pages , we can add another : diplomacy .
By all appearances , the early release of the Libyan convicted of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland was part of a program of quiet diplomacy by the British government to appeal to Moammar Gadhafi .
This favor turned out to be anything but quiet .
The freeing of the Libyan intelligence officer convicted of the 1988 bombing , Abdel Basset al - Megrahi , is a case study in how people now expect a free and instant flow of information about what their politicians have done and how hard it has become to keep secret deals secret .
The release of the bomber was announced by the Scottish minister of justice as an act of compassion , citing Megrahi 's prostate cancer .
But other murderers have been ill and died in Scottish prisons .
Suspicions grew with the leak of a letter from the Foreign Office in London that had assured the justice minister there was no legal barrier to Megrahi 's early release .
The letter expressed the " hope on this basis you will now feel able to consider the Libyan application . "
The " judicial " decision was exposed as political .
Under further pressure , Downing Street released a letter Prime Minister Brown had sent Gadhafi urging a low - key welcome for the state intelligence officer who killed 270 people , mostly Americans .
A " high - profile return would cause further unnecessary pain for the families of the Lockerbie victims , " the letter said .
It also said , " You will be aware that the Scottish executive 's public announcement on Megrahi 's future is expected very shortly .
I understand that their decision is to transfer Megrahi back to Libya on compassionate grounds , " contradicting earlier claims that the decision was known only when the Scottish minister announced it .

A Sri Lankan journalist says she was kidnapped from outside her home in the capital Colombo and held for a day by people claiming to be the police .
Krishni Ifam , a Tamil reporter who works for media development NGO Internews , said the men had warned her to give up journalism altogether .
She said she was then released in the central city of Kandy late on Wednesday with a tiny amount of cash .
Police in Sri Lanka could not be reached for comment .
Unmarked vans
Ms Ifam has been speaking about her ordeal on a private television station and , separately , to the BBC .
She said men who said they were policemen forced her to get into their vehicle outside her Colombo home early on Wednesday and drove for several hours while keeping her blindfolded .
She said they had taken her belongings , asked if she was writing articles for foreign media outlets and warned her to give up journalism altogether before releasing her .
Ms Ifam used to write for a prominent Tamil - language newspaper .
Separately , a columnist who usually covers astrology was picked up late on Wednesday by men with identity cards from the Criminal Investigation Department .
His wife said he was still being held 24 hours later .
In both these cases the vehicles used were said to be unmarked white vans , which have become notorious in Sri Lanka as a means of abduction and sometimes disappearance .
The Sri Lankan government insists that the media here are free .
But many journalists say they do not feel free to write or broadcast what they want - many have been physically attacked and others have fled into exile .
Radiohead fans certainly have active imaginations .
The rumored Wall of Ice EP , which many believed was set to surface today ( August 17 ) , has proved to be nothing more than a case of mistaken identity .
Guitarist Jonny Greenwood has posted on the official Radiohead website in an attempt to clear up the mess .
“ So here ’s a new song , called ‘ These Are My Twisted Words ’ , ” he says , confirming that the track that leaked last week is their work .
“ We ’ve been recording for a while , and this was one of the first we finished .
We ’re pretty proud of it .
There ’s other stuff in various states of completion , but this is one we ’ve been practicing , and which we ’ll probably play at this summer ’s concerts .
Hope you like it . ”
The Wall of Ice website , which appears to have been set up by either a prankster or an over - eager fan , currently bears the following message :
“ Do n’t just publish bullshit only to get hits on your webpage .
Do n’t just create your own stories after reading one post on a message board .
Get your facts straight . ”
Yikes .
Radiohead is set to headline the Reading and Leeds festivals in the U.K. at the end of this month , which will be the first chance to hear some of this new material .
In my romantic travel daydreams , I imagine myself marching off into the hills of Patagonia with nothing in my backpack but a change of underwear and a piece of flint .
In reality , however , I — and most travelers today — bring gadgets .
Lots of gadgets .
From iPods to noise - canceling headphones , from digital cameras to GPS trackers , they take up space , can consume electricity and distract us from actually enjoying the trip .
Gadgets also tend to be expensive , small and easy - to - lose .
But gadgets can be both useful and cheap — they can help even budget travelers make the most of their adventures .
Here is a list of the 10 gadgets , all under $ 50 , that I either own or have been lusting after .
1. Last summer , when I was hitchhiking across northern Cyprus , a British couple wanted to give me a ride from our hotel .
The problem :
Their car would n’t start .
Luckily , I was carrying a Leatherman Skeletool CX , which has pliers , which I used to tighten the battery leads and get the car going .
Now I do n’t go anywhere without a multitool .
I ’ve used it to slice goat cheese in Monaco and reattach a suitcase wheel in Vilnius .
This week , however , I ’m planning to lay aside my Skeletool for the Leatherman Juice C2 , which not only costs less ( $ 31.99 at Amazon ) but has more tools , including a corkscrew .
2. Caving in the Black Hills of South Dakota .
Camping in Oregon .
Reading a book on an overnight train from Istanbul to Bucharest .
Could n’t have done any of that without a flashlight .
Now , forget about old - school incandescent bulbs — LEDs are the way to go , and from the reviews I ’ve read , Cree brand LEDs are both more powerful and less expensive than other brands .
The Fenix LD01 ( $ 42 from Amazon ) is ridiculously tiny but throws off 80 lumens from a single AAA - powered Cree bulb .
3 . Pickpocketing is a major concern of travelers , whether they ’re carrying loads of cash or 50 euros that need to last the next two weeks .
My solution is to put aside the wallet , often bulky and usually carried in the back pocket , and switch to a money clip , which is slimmer and fits in the harder - for - thieves - to - reach front pocket .
It ’s not 100 percent foolproof , but I have n’t been robbed in the decade I ’ve been using one .
I got mine for $ 10 at a Miami flea market , but if I were getting a new one — and did n’t care about its hideous “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” styling — I ’d try the Memorex Money Clip Flash Drive ( $ 17.99 at Target stores ) , which builds in a one - gigabyte USB drive .
4 . Whether you ’re securing your belongings at a hostel or lashing up your snowboard , a retractable cable lock is a lightweight essential for travel .
Make sure to get one with at least a three - foot cable .
The Master Lock 4605D costs about $ 10 at Amazon , but the $ 18 Kryptonite R4 has a detachable LED flashlight ( no word on whether it ’s a Cree ) .
5 . How do you fit a month ’s worth of clothes into a 22 - inch carry - on ?
By sucking the air out with vacuum packing bags .
Travel Space Bags look like a good value — $ 7 for two medium bags , $ 8 for two large at the Container Store — and my fellow travel writer John Rambow tells me he likes them .
( I ’ll be testing them out on my next trip . )
While you ’re at it , it never hurts to bring along a half - dozen Ziploc - style bags , too .
6 . It used to be that whenever I went abroad , I never had enough adapter plugs for all my devices : laptop , camera charger , cellphone charger and so on .
Then , last summer , one of my readers suggested what I should ’ve realized all along :
If you bring a power strip , you only need one adapter .
Since then , I ’ve used the Belkin Mini Surge Protector , which has three outlets and two USB jacks ( great for MP3 players and cellphones ) and costs $ 25 .
( Full disclosure : My wife ’s cousin works for Belkin . )
7 . Whether you ’re a snap - happy amateur or a DSLR - toting pro , stabilizing your camera will make for better pictures .
Most mini-tripods , however , need a flat surface to rest upon .
Not so the Gorillapod , which has flexible , multijointed legs that let it balance just about anywhere , even around vertical poles , tree branches or wherever you want to prop the camera .
The original , good for compact cameras , costs $ 21.95 from its manufacturer , Joby , while a larger version , which can handle the weight of an S.L.R. , is $ 39.95 .
8 . I do n’t even remember where I got my travel first - aid kit , but over the years it ’s provided me with bandages , painkillers and other essential tools for dealing with the bumps , scrapes and hangovers associated with long - term budget travel .
It ’s almost depleted now , so I ’m getting REI ’s seven - ounce Adventurer Medical kit ( $ 24.95 ) , which has all the usual bandages and tablets , plus safety pins , duct tape , sting - relief wipes and protective nitrile gloves .
I almost ca n’t wait to get hurt !
9 . The most important gadgets , in my opinion , are not those that let us travel more easily but those that let us connect with other people .
A deck of cards is always in my bag , and I have friends who wo n’t leave home without a Frisbee .
Those are n’t exactly gadgets , though .
Speakers for an iPod are nice to have along — the lightweight , $ 29.99 iSymphony is what I own — but I sometimes feel like iPods promote egotism : Everyone wants to be the D.J. Instead , I love my $ 30 , 4.7 - ounce Grundig Mini 300 shortwave radio .
It may not have the greatest receiver or speaker , but I remember one night , sitting in the foothills of the Himalayas with a new friend , tuning in to music and news broadcast from India , England , China , Russia , Vietnam and beyond , marveling at how isolated and yet how connected we felt .
Nice .
10 .
Some gadgets are newfangled and exciting , others time - tested and true — which is why , wherever I go , I carry a notepad and a pen .
Moleskine is the ultra - popular choice , but I prefer Ecojot ’s 3 - by - 4 - inch recycled - paper notepads ( about $ 5 ) , which are smaller and more flexible , but with enough backing to provide a stable writing surface .
As for a pen , I buy Muji ’s 0.38 - millimeter gel - ink ballpoints , $ 1.25 apiece .
So there you have it , the gadgets no frugal traveler should be without .
( And , no , I ’m not getting paid to promote any of this stuff . )
Of course , your ideal gadget list will also depend on what kind of frugal traveler you are .
Hikers and campers may want headlamps instead of flashlights , or hand - crank radios instead of battery - powered , while urbanites might see little use for a first - aid kit .
On top of that , the particular brands and models matter less than what the devices actually do — you may prefer Kryptonite locks over Master , and you know what ?
That ’s O.K .
Just bring a retractable cable lock .
I ’d hate for someone to run off with your tripod , shortwave radio and first - aid kit .
Correction :
An earlier version of this post misstated that the Leatherman Juice C2 included scissors .
It does not .
Politicians were deemed less trustworthy than prostitutes
China 's prostitutes are better - trusted than its politicians and scientists , according to an online survey published by Insight China magazine .
The survey found that 7.9 % of respondents considered sex workers to be trustworthy , placing them third behind farmers and religious workers .
" A list like this is at the same time surprising and embarrassing , " said an editorial in the state - run China Daily .
Politicians were far down the list , closer to scientists and teachers .
Insight China polled 3,376 Chinese citizens in June and July this year .
" The sex workers ' unexpected prominence on this list of honour ... is indeed unusual , " said the China Daily editorial .
" At least [ the scientists and officials ] have not slid into the least credible category which consists of real estate developers , secretaries , agents , entertainers and directors , " the editorial said .
Soldiers came in fourth place .
The Taliban have a new target : beer and bratwurst .
In perhaps their most bizarre threat to date , Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan have threatened to bomb the Oktoberfest festival in Munich , Germany , which attracts millions of visitors ever year , along with several landmark buildings and government officials .
The threats , while perhaps farfetched , follow a series of warnings from the Taliban and Al Qaeda and underscores a concerted effort by the insurgents to weaken Germany ’s resolve for the fight in Afghanistan .
Germany has responded by banning all air flights over Munich for the rest of the 16 - day festival , which ends Oct.
4 .
The threats were delivered in a series of videotapes issued by the Taliban on Friday , the Guardian reported .
One features a German - speaking militant named Ajjub .
The videos coincide with a recent warning to Germany issued by Osama Bin Laden , delivered in Arabic with German subtitles , as The Christian Science Monitor reported .
In fact , for the past two weeks , in the runup to Germany ’s elections on Sunday , the Taliban and Al Qaeda have issued several messages , as Germany ’s Deutsche Welle news service reports .
Whether the Taliban have the capacity to carry out an international terrorist attack remains to be seen .
To date , their attacks have all taken place in Afghanistan , or in Pakistan by related militant groups .
The messages are meant to play upon deep divisions in Germany between the government and the public over the war in Afghanistan .
Germany has 4,200 troops in Afghanistan , and 35 have been killed since 2002 .
Most political parties are committed to continuing the mission .
But public support for the war effort has flagged , and took a particular dive after a September airstrike in Afghanistan – called in by German troops and executed by American planes – left dozens of civilians dead .
Polls suggest that the German public wants to reduce or pull out altogether its troops on the ground .
Noting that dismay , German political parties tried to keep the Afghan mission out of political debates , reports Radio Free Europe .
But now that the elections are over , the debate is likely to return to the fore .
In an editorial last week , the Christian Science Monitor advised :
Small Business Identity Theft and Fraud
The sorts of crimes we ’ve been seeing perpetrated against individuals are starting to be perpetrated against small businesses :
In July , a school district near Pittsburgh sued to recover $ 700,000 taken from it .
In May , a Texas company was robbed of $ 1.2 million .
An electronics testing firm in Baton Rouge , La. , said it was bilked of nearly $ 100,000 .
In many cases , the advisory warned , the scammers infiltrate companies in a similar fashion :
They send a targeted e-mail to the company ’s controller or treasurer , a message that contains either a virus - laden attachment or a link that — when opened — surreptitiously installs malicious software designed to steal passwords .
Armed with those credentials , the crooks then initiate a series of wire transfers , usually in increments of less than $ 10,000 to avoid banks ’ anti-money - laundering reporting requirements .
The alert states that these scams typically rely on help from “ money mules ” — willing or unwitting individuals in the United States — often hired by the criminals via popular Internet job boards .
Once enlisted , the mules are instructed to set up bank accounts , withdraw the fraudulent deposits and then wire the money to fraudsters , the majority of which are in Eastern Europe , according to the advisory .
This has the potential to grow into a very big problem .
Even worse :
Businesses do not enjoy the same legal protections as consumers when banking online .
Consumers typically have up to 60 days from the receipt of a monthly statement to dispute any unauthorized charges .
In contrast , companies that bank online are regulated under the Uniform Commercial Code , which holds that commercial banking customers have roughly two business days to spot and dispute unauthorized activity if they want to hold out any hope of recovering unauthorized transfers from their accounts .
And , of course , the security externality means that the banks care much less :
“ The banks spend a lot of money on protecting consumer customers because they owe money if the consumer loses money , ” Litan said .
“ But the banks do n’t spend the same resources on the corporate accounts because they do n’t have to refund the corporate losses . ”

A former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association , Charles Kuck , who represents some of Mr. Alcala ’s old clients , says shadowy lawyers emerge any time Congress considers taking up an overhaul of immigration laws .
“ Every state has a James Alcala  a man or a woman who has been arrested or indicted , or should be arrested or indicted , for engaging in fraudulent activity , ” Mr. Kuck said .
Mr. Alcala ’s lawyer , Susanne Gustin , would not comment .
Mr. Alcala , who has been released from custody pending trial , which has not been scheduled , did not return phone calls to his law firm .
If convicted , he faces up to 10 years in prison .
Court papers in the Alcala case say that the smooth - talking lawyer assured client companies that he could secure the prized H - 2B visas for their workers , whom he then instructed to return to Mexico and lie to United States consul officials .
In an effort to falsely convince those officials that one illegal immigrant had never been to the United States , Mr. Alcala told the man to “ show up wearing huaraches [ Mexican sandals ] and a sombrero , ” according to the indictment .
It charges the lawyer and seven other defendants , including a former Border Patrol agent and a former consul worker , with 17 counts of visa fraud and conspiracy to smuggle aliens into the United States .
The authorities say Mr. Alcala obtained at least 5,000 H - 2B visas for American companies , most through fraud and forgery .
Some companies that hired him  including landscaping and construction  did not know the documents they paid for were gotten illegally , said a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Utah , Brett L. Tolman .
“ There were a lot of people who were getting hurt , who were trying to do things legitimately , but Alcala never explained what would happen to them , ” said Lance Starr , an immigration lawyer who once worked for Mr. Alcala , but grew suspicious that the firm was breaking the law .
“ He was telling people , ‘ I can make you legal quickly and easily , ’ and for them , it was their only hope . ”
Reddit and I go way , way back .
I was there when Alexis and Steve presented the early idea ( and a working application ) at one of the early Web Innovator 's meetups in a small , cramped bar in Kendall Square , Cambridge .
Several months later , there was a startup meetup at MIT .
I was one of three groups presenting at a startup gathering at MIT .
The guys from Reddit spoke right after me .
When I kicked off OnStartups.com , reddit readers were an early source of traffic and helped build the readership of the site to what it is today .
Back in the early days , the content was great and I found myself going to reddit several times a day to find useful and interesting content .
( It did n't hurt that my own articles were making it to the front page of reddit on a pretty regular basis ) .
Now , I 'm saddened when I look at the front page of reddit and what is popular there .
It seems that the system has been overtaken by articles on the political , the weird and the arcane ( and sometimes all three ) .
I could post some of the links on the front page here to make my point , but it 's subjective .
Go see for yourself .
As a result of this deterioration of quality , I find myself going to reddit much less often than I used to .
I 'm not sure what caused the downward trend .
In fact , it may not even be a downward trend ( that 's subjective ) .
Perhaps what 's popular on reddit now simply reflects what 's going on within the user base .
It 's just not for me .
Perhaps it was when Conde Nast bought reddit that the decline began .
Perhaps Alexis and Steve just lost interest .
Perhaps the trend was inevitable as more and more people joined reddit and became a diffuse audience instead of a clustered community of like - minded people .
I do n't know .
Of course , losing me as a frequent user has almost zero impact on reddit .
The site seems like it 's continuing to do well ( in terms of traffic and popularity ) .
But , I still feel a sense of loss .
I ’ve just discovered that probably one of the best series ever produced on philosophy is available on Google Video .
The BBC series Human All Too Human includes three fantastic programmes on Friedrich Nietzsche , Jean Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger – a trio of controversial thinkers who massively influenced 20th century philosophy .
It ’s an interesting choice as all had fascinating and turbulent lives – Nietzsche ending his life in insanity , Heidegger a unrepentant Nazi defended by a Jewish ex-lover , and Sartre who walked the line between free love and womanising .
All had a huge influence on psychology at various stages , and you can clearly see how many struggled with concepts of mind and society .
The programmes tackle both the characters and their theories and are some of the most engaging and gripping programmes I ’ve ever seen on philosophy , an essential subject that usually gets little more than satire or lip service from mainstream media .
They ’re an hour each and worth every minute .
Put some time aside , find a comfy chair and enjoy .

The Internet might be the best thing that ’s happened to stay - at - home dads since Michael Keaton ’s “ Mr. Mom , ” said Sarah Boesveld in Canada ’s Globe and Mail .
Men are getting laid off faster than women , and many “ unemployed fathers have been hitting up daddy blogs ” — or better yet , writing them — to help them transition into a sphere “ dominated by moms . ”
Daddy - bloggers are great at giving stay - at - home dads advice and support , said Steven Hodson in The Inquisitr , but they ’re no match for the raw , market - moving power of the mommy - bloggers , whose “ ire ” has burned more than one company .
And that ’s alright .
Mommy blogs gave voice to a group of “ under appreciated or just ignored ” women , while many daddy - bloggers see their blogs as a “ temporary way station ” to being breadwinners again .
Poor dads will never be “ drunk on power ” like I am , as a soon - to - be mommy - blogger , said Toni Fitzgerald in the Cumberland , Pa. , Sentinel .
As any marketer will tell you , mommy bloggers are “ the new hot group to be in , ” since moms trust fellow moms ’ advice on what to buy .
But all parent bloggers face the same “ irony ” : making time to be a mommy or daddy blogger takes you away from the “ thing that qualifies you to be one , parenting . ”
We work as technology partners with a number of designers .
They 'll design a site and we 'll make it work as a website .
These partnerships have been rewarding as we 've worked on a diverse range of sites and have been able to meet a number of great designers .
This diversity of work is a product of many of our design partners having a print background .
In web design circles we 've seen this looked down upon , but frankly our experience with print designers has been incredibly positive .
Generally , print designers have a very strong and disciplined design background so once they learn the basic principles of the web as a medium they are able to translate their ability well .
The purpose of this post is to cover the basics of the web for designers who have a strong print background .
It does n't cover core design principals , those translate to the web just fine .
The five main areas that will be coverd are :
Successful Web Layouts
Compared to print pieces , most websites share very common layouts .
To some extent , this is because designers tend to copy each other .
Other than a lack of creativity however , there are a number of good reasons for this .
Websites that behave in expected ways are much easier to use .
To get an understanding of how web layouts evolved .
It is worth reading this piece by Jakob Nielsen about how user 's eyes move on a webpage :
F - Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content
General Website Elements
This eye pattern makes plenty of sense when considering how the elements of site are traditionally placed .
Below are some accepted rules - of - thumb to consider when placing website elements :
Logo
A site logo should go in the top left with few exceptions .
This is where a visitor 's eye goes first so the site will be associated with your brand if the logo is there and ready .
Additionally , this is where a visitor will check if they stumble onto the site from elsewhere and they wonder where they are .
Navigation
A site 's primary navigation should either be listed vertically along the left side of the page or horizontally along the top of the page .
More and more major sites are moving to a horizontal naviation scheme .
We believe this trend will continue now that nearly every site designs for a minimum screen width of 1024 px .
This increased width allows for larger navigational structures to fit horizontally and it also encourages more multi-column content layouts .
( See a nytimes.com sectional page . )
Content
The primary content of a page should be towards the left or center and be reasonably narrow .
In fact , the same alphabet - and - a - half line length rule applies from print -- for a fixed - width site this means roughly 500 pixels .
The primary difference between print is that on the web , text can't easily wrap from one column to the next .
Visitors are willing and accustomed to scrolling while reading .
Login , Logout , and Search
These go in the top right of a page by convention .
Nearly every bank , ecommerce site , search engine or really every site puts these in the top right so visitors will be looking there .
Banner and Call to Action
As described in the eye tracking article above , the first pass a visitors eye makes , is in a horizontal stripe across the top of the page .
Many sites will put a banner in this area along with a call to action .
This has become nearly universal among political websites that must quickly interact with new visitors since the site may be only be up during the campaign .
Contact Forms / Buttons and Signup Forms / Buttons
These are often found in the sidebar of pages towards the top .
They can also be placed in the header of a site near the top , but the explosion of blogs has made it more common to see them in sidebars .
The important thing to remember is that the farther down the page they are , the number of views they will get will decrease .
Footer
Obviously the footer of a site should be at the bottom .
Some of the elements that are often contained within the footer include a repeat of the logo , primary site navigation and copyright line .
If the site has a privacy policy or terms of service , this should go in the bottom right .
Well - Understood Layout Elements
" Featured " Box
It has become common to use a box in the highlighted banner of a site that features latest stories along with an image .
Usually just one will be featured at a time , but it is possible to switch between three or four using tabs , links or buttons .
This can be done simply , with a switcher , or other fun effects can be used like sliding or fading .
We use this technique on our homepage to highlight our different services and we use a slide transition .
Drop Down Menus
Early - on , drop down 's were considered bad practice .
This was because they depended on javascript during a time when bandwidth was scarce and javascript was much more unreliable across browsers .
Today they are common and quite useful .
One form of the dropdown , the mega - dropdown shows a large amount of information at once .
These can make deep sites much easier to navigate .
Jacob Nielson has a great writeup on these .
The Dimensions and Color of the Website Medium
Compared to print , websites are very small .
Websites are shown on low - resolution screens that are poor at reproducing color .
This causes a number of issues that a print - to - web designer needs to be aware of .
Pixels vs. Inches vs. DPI
When dealing in print the unit of measure is the inch , or point , or cm or something else that bears a connection to real - life physical dimensions .
This is why DPI is used .
A designer can create something of a certain size , regardless of the resolution it will be printed at .
This is not possible on the web since the unit of measure is the pixel and pixel density varies dramatically .
For example , it is possible for the common resolution of 1024x768 to be used on a 12 " laptop and a 19 " flat panel .
This is why setting your working resolution to 72dpi is not enough !
Instead it is important to understand the dimensions of the media in terms of pixels .
Monitors may have varied resolutions , but in 2009 it is safe to design for a minimum resolution of 1024x768 .
This does not mean that you can use all of those pixels as you can see below :
Safe Dimensions
Some of the width and the height will be consumed by the browser , scroll bar , toolbars and even the windows task bar .
We consider a safe maximum width to be 960 px .
It may be worth going more narrow if the background image or color are important to the tone of the site .
For elements that must be " above - the - fold " use 500 px as a safe number .
Also remember that visitors are more and more willing to scroll .
For content columns aim for 450 - 650 px wide .
This gives visitors a chance to change their font size without losing a good reading width .
Working in Photoshop
When in Photoshop , be sure to set your unit of measure to the pixel so that it is easy to work out the dimensions of the site .
Additionally be sure to use the sRGB colorspace .
CMYK does not work on the web .
If the site ends up needing translated from CMYK some colors may be slightly different than you originally intended .
Additionally , if you are ever saving an image for the web , a CMYK image will not display properly on most visitors machines .
Typography for the Web
Web Safe Fonts
Typography on the web is depressing .
There is really no way around it .
There are some emerging technologies that could make the situation better , but these are the only safe fonts for copy :
Times / Times New Roman
Georgia
Palatino Linotype
Andale Mono
Arial
Arial Black
Impact
Trebuchet MS
Verdana
Comic Sans MS
Courier New
So what does " web- safe " mean ?
It means you can expect them to be installed on a visitor 's computer and that it will render as you expect .
If you use a font that a visitor does n't have , the results cannot necessarily be anticipated and a replacement font will be selected .
To try out some of these fonts on the fly , the following tool is great :
Using Non-Web - Safe Fonts
Other fonts can also be used sparingly by using a number of techniques .
The thing to remember , however , is that any of these techniques have downsides .
They either cause the page to render more slowly , increase the file - size of the site , or make text impossible to copy and paste .
Many of the best " web- medium " designs stick to web - safe fonts as much as possible
Replacement Techniques :
Basic Image Replacement -
This is just a rasterizaton of the text to a static jpg , gif or png .
This makes it impossible to update the text with a CMS and also can have some SEO downsides .
This is the best technique for logos or other major design elements .

Cufon -
This uses javascript to draw the text in a font as vector shapes .
It is reasonably lightweight and it is easy to change text since it is done dynamically .
As a downside , the text cannot be selected and it can have a delay prior to rendering .

sIFR -
This method is like cufon except it uses flash to render the text .
This makes it a little more heavy - weight , but its text can be selected .
Designing for more than Lorem Ipsum
If you are designing a site with client or user generated text , you 'll need to consider more than just paragraph text .
A good web - style guide will be ready for :
Headings 1 - 6
Paragraph Text
Ordered Lists
Unordered Lists
Blockquotes
Building this out will ensure that the site design will continue to look good even as content is added .
Backgrounds
Since visitors have different monitor sizes , they will see a different amount of the site background .
This should be considered when designing the background .
In most cases , a repeating background will be used , so it wo n't matter how large a monitor is .
That is how this site works :
A background image must also account for the fact that each page will be a different height .
In the case of our site , we repeat the background image horizontally over a white background .
The same can be done with a vertical gradient , but it will need to ultimately fade to a static color , so that a webpage can extend down indefinately .
If an image is used as the background , it will need to consider extra wide monitors .
It should either fade out to a static color , or the image should be 1920 px wide to accomodate 24 " monitors .
It will also have the issue of vertical expansion to consider .
Organization
As mentioned early on in this guide , it is important to set up Photoshop to be ready to work with web colors and pixel based dimensions .
To do this , set your color profile to sRGB and your units to pixels .
This will get you off to a great start .
From there , it is important to keep your photoshop file well organized as it will serve as a reference for the website design for the life of the site .
There is a great guide on Web Design Depot on how to do this .
The key points are :
Make sure every layer is labeled and organized in a folder .
Nest Folders into a logical design heirarchy .
Make sure to include hover and click states
This concludes the guide .

Although administration officials are eager to deny it , rationing health care is central to President Barack Obama 's health plan .
The Obama strategy is to reduce health costs by rationing the services that we and future generations of patients will receive .
The White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report in June explaining the Obama administration 's goal of reducing projected health spending by 30 % over the next two decades .
That reduction would be achieved by eliminating " high cost , low - value treatments , " by ...
MenuetOS is an operating system that is super - fast and can fit on a single floppy disk ( remember them ? )
The average PC user expects that their computer 's operating system will consume a fair chunk of hard drive space .
Windows Vista Premium can take 15 GB of hard drive space to install and tax even modern desktop PCs and notebooks .
Indeed , thanks in part to Microsoft , people are used to the endless cycle of hardware upgrades to get the most out of their operating system — or even just make it usable .
The developers behind MenuetOS have taken a different tack , however : their operating system is lightweight and incredibly speedy , despite having many of the trimmings you would expect from a modern OS .
MenuetOS offers pre-emptive multitasking , an attractive and modern - looking GUI , a TCP / IP stack for Internet access and more .
Most importantly , you can run Quake on it .
What 's even more astounding is that the entire operating system can fit on a single floppy disk .
The secret behind Menuet 's diminutive size and astonishing responsiveness lies , unsurprisingly , in the development process .
Modern operating systems are written predominately in high - level languages like C and C++.
Menuet , however , is written entirely in assembly language : a symbolic representation of machine language .
These days many programmers have minimal if any contact with assembly language , but that has n't deterred the Menuet development team and the result is a slick , compact and super - quick operating system .
Two of the Menuet developers , Ville Turjanmaa and Madis Kalme , took time out to talk to PC World Australia about what inspired them to undertake the daunting task of writing the operating system , the current state of the OS and future plans for it .
Firstly , what inspired the creation of MenuetOS ?
Most people would consider writing an entire operating system in assembly language to be a pretty audacious project .
Ville :
The original idea for assembly OS came a few years ago when I was browsing the Internet and came across to a page which used a scripting language .
And even with my relatively new computer , the short script executed quite slowly .
So it seemed like there will always be the need to create a language which uses the last cycles from a new CPU .
So I decided to go to the other extreme end and just use assembly as much as possible .
Can you give me some idea of the backgrounds of the core developers ?
Do you have people contributing from outside the core team ?
Madis :
My passion has always been assembly language .
As a teenager I started with some programmable calculators where ML [ machine language ] was the only way to go .
Compared to that , assembly is really a breeze and such an elegant way to program .
Ville :
We come from different countries and with different backgrounds , but most of us core developers have a university background .
I 've used different programming languages during the last 30 years .
From BASIC and Pascal , to C and assembly .
And yes , there are people contributing from outside the core team ; the MP3 player is one such contribution .
What aspect of Menuet are you most proud of ?
Are there any parts of the OS that were particularly challenging to code ?
Madis :
I am very excited about the GUI part because most hobby operating systems go as far as implementing only a command - line type of OS , but with a true - colour , VESA - supported GUI , it differs from all of these and therefore its ideal for games and small graphical demos .
The 64 - bit register extensions helped me to make a register - only line and circle routines and these I consider my " µ- achievements " that I can be proud of .
" Challenging to code ? " —
I will let Ville answer that
Ville :
As for the actual coding , I 'm most pleased with pre-emptive scheduling and USB support .
Maybe we have also made a small difference to mindsets about what can be done with assembly language .
What next for Menuet ?
Do you have a timeline for getting to version 1.0 ?
Are there any features coming up that you 're especially proud of ?
Ville :
We need to add new drivers and improve existing applications .
Other than that , there are one or two completely new features I 'd like to add before hitting the 1.0 mark .
The 32 - bit version of Menuet was released under the GPL , but the 64 - bit version uses a non - open - source licence that is free for " personal and educational use " .
Why did you decide to licence the 64 - bit version differently ?
Has this had any impact on encouraging people to join the effort ?
Ville :
With a completely new type of open source project , people seem to have strong opinions about what direction to take .
Even up to a point when time is actually spent more with disputes than doing the actual coding .
And when that happened , I decided to concentrate more on the original path of Menuet with the 64 - bit version and with a new type of license .
However , I do n't have anything against open source or possibly opening up the Menuet64 source later .
But with the current licence , I 'd say the people are a bit more committed and willing to put more effort in to a new feature .
Well , I guess we could start with the obvious :
1 . It is commonly known as a fluid , and it is found in all three states of matter ( solid , gas and fluid ) all over planet earth .
Funny that , because water is in fact the only molecule that naturally occurs in all three states of matter .
2 . Water is formed by a chemical bond between the two elements , oxygen and hydrogen .
Two elements of oxygen combine with one element of hydrogen to form one molecule of water .
3 . It is found in everything around us , yes even the iron shovel you hold in your hand or the crystal you use for channeling your healing energy .
In fact , it is the third most common molecule in the universe , besides hydrogen and carbon .
4 . It is found within our bodies , and in very high percentages I hasten to ad !
Especially if we look at some organs like the brain .
5 . Thanks to the discovery of the microscope , we also know that when water turns into a solid it forms a tightly packed lattice of tetrahedral crystals .
6 . A few years ago we found out that the pattern of tetrahedral clumping as water turn in to a solid could be influenced by intention and music .
This mystical ability was discovered thanks to a very observant and very lucky scientist called Dr Emoto , who observed the phenomenon and intuited it ’s causality .
7 . We recently discovered that this tetrahedral quality persists when water turns into a fluid , and water seem to have a natural ability to combine together in tetrahedral clumps of up to a 100 molecules each .
The rest of the molecules floats around freely and disorganized , sometimes in more and sometimes in less quantities .
8 . We also found that the amount of free and disorganized water molecules depend on factors such as the temperature and pressure of the fluid , and the presence of other molecules that may be dissolved within it .
Before we discovered the tetrahedral clumping , water was considered to be the odd one out amongst molecules , with some 66 qualities that distinguished it from other forms of matter .
With the theory of clumping we can now start to explain some of these differences in the behavior of water .
Things like why water can absorb so much heat before it starts to boil , and why the crystalline structure of frozen water is influenced by thought .
This in turn explain how crystals work , and why they have their power .
It starts to explain such mysteries as the recent finding that happiness is contagious , that music can trigger an automatic emotional response , and it provides new theories to explain the hitherto mysterious way our brain seem to work .
By discovering the tetrahedral clumping nature of water we may just have hit upon the holy grail , and suddenly a whole world of knowledge start to make sense !
What ’s up with water you ask ?
Apparently quite a lot .
It begs me to tip my hat and wink a smile at glimpsing some understanding about mystery of life , the universe and just about everything …
Baby steps I know , but giant leaps for mankind .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
There may be reasons to tax the rich more , as a lot of people in Washington are talking about doing .
But to raise taxes on them , and only them , to pay for the country 's most ambitious proposals like health care reform , is a problem , experts say .
If nothing else , it makes for some bad math .
" We do n't have enough rich people .
We could tax the wealthy to extraordinary levels .
But we cannot afford everything we want , " said Ken Kies , a former director of the Joint Committee on Taxation and currently a tax lobbyist for businesses including insurers .
Yet , rich households are the focus of several revenue generating proposals to help pay for health care reform and other endeavors .
Income surtax : Key committees in the House on Tuesday released a proposal that would impose an income surtax on high - income families -- an additional tax on income over a certain threshold .
The surtax applied in full would range from 1 % to 2 % for couples making between $ 350,000 and $ 500,000 .
It would range from 1.5 % to 3 % for couples making between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million .
And it would be 5.4 % for families making more than $ 1 million .
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the provision could raise $ 544 billion over 10 years .
Millionaire 's tax :
The Senate is said to be considering a " millionaire 's tax " of 5 % levied on single filers making more than $ 500,000 and joint filers making more than $ 1 million .
Deduction limit : President Obama has proposed limiting the value of itemized deductions for high - income taxpayers .
One idea under consideration in the Senate is to limit the mortgage interest deduction for the wealthy , although that idea is almost certain to face strong pushback from those with ties to the real estate industry , said Jaret Seiberg , the financial services policy analyst of the Washington Research Group , a unit of Concept Capital .
Expanded Medicare tax : Senate leaders are also considering applying the 1.45 % Medicare tax paid by individuals to capital gains and dividends , and possibly also on income from properties and partnerships .
Currently , the Medicare tax is only levied on earned income , such as wages .
Health care is n't the only big - ticket item driving the push to raise rates on the rich .
Obama has said he wants to make the tax system fairer and raise revenue by letting many of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts expire for high - income taxpayers .
He also wants to help pay for Social Security reform by subjecting more income to the Social Security tax .
Currently , individuals ' half of the payroll tax is 6.2 % on the first $ 106,800 of wages .
Under a proposal from Obama , people would also then pay between 1 % to 2 % on income over $ 250,000 .
Finally , Obama has directed his tax reform panel to recommend ways to raise revenue but not increase taxes for families making less than $ 250,000 .
That suggests those at higher levels are fair game .
The problem with taxing only the rich
Some of the big ideas kicking around Washington these days may have merit and may be worth pursuing .
But they 're not going to be enough if the goals are to enact new initiatives like health reform without adding to the deficit , and without taxing any family making less than $ 250,000 , experts say .
" There 's an argument for making the tax system more progressive , " said Len Burman , director of the Tax Policy Center .
" [ But ] people are going to have to pay tax or come to terms with smaller government .
Right now there 's enormous pressure for the government to do more and more . "
And by not letting the Bush tax cuts expire for families making less than $ 250,000 , the administration is forfeiting an estimated $ 2.1 trillion in revenue over 10 years .
Meanwhile , the federal debt held by the public is scheduled to rise from 41 % of gross domestic product to 82 % by 2019 under the president 's proposed budget , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
That already assumes the majority of Bush tax cuts expire for upper - income taxpayers .
At the same time , tax burdens across all income groups have been fairly low historically speaking .
Although they pay the lion 's share of income tax dollars collected , high - income taxpayers benefited disproportionately from the Bush tax cuts .
But those same tax cuts also increased the ranks of those who end up owing no income tax - the majority of whom are not high income .
The Tax Policy Center now estimates that after taking the tax breaks for which they 're eligible , 47 % of tax - filing households will have no federal income tax liability this year .
Many tax policy experts believe fundamental reform of the tax code -- a reform that simplifies the code and broadens the base of payers -- could be one step toward resolving long - term shortfalls .
Evasion is another concern experts raise when rates are hiked too high or too frequently .
If high income taxpayers feel their tax burden too burdensome , they are more likely to seek out legitimate tax shelters .
But also the higher rates go , Kies said , " the more it creates an atmosphere for cheating . "

Third Circle Of Hell To Be Full Of Poo Jokes
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 12th of August 2009 - 05:09 PM ]
Continuing down the path of Hell from Lust , Visceral Games keeps with their fun and dark developer 's diaries .
This time they cover the third level , Gluttony .
A level that should be as gruesome as the scene from Se7en and starts to look that way with some of the concepts they show in the video .
One thing that kind of bothers me though is the fact that they talk a lot about defecation , feces , and poop in the video .
A lot .
In fact they even point out that one of the previously revealed creatures now has a poo attack to go along with the projectile vomit and devouring of Dante .
All of this should n't be too big of a surprise given the sin and concept of the level from the original story .
Well except that they made the point to try to not do something similar in Lust as well as mentioned cutting something from the level in the Comic Con panel .
If you did n't see or read this before , let me sum up .
They said they did n't want to go the simple route of slapping peni and boobs everywhere mixed in with porn .
They wanted to go the creepier way of things .
They even mentioned cutting a scene where Cerberus , guardian of Gluttony in this mythology , shoves Dante up his ass .
They said it was to vulgar and did n't set the right tone they wanted .
I just hope the tone they wanted was n't comic relief after a creepy sex based level .
You be the judge .
Maybe I 've skewed things in my own twisted head .

Home Fully - parameterized , first - class modules with hygienic macros Fully - parameterized , first - class modules with hygienic macros , dissertation by Martin Gasbichler , 2006 .
It is possible to define a formal semantics for configuration , elaboration , linking , and evaluation of fully - parameterized first - class modules with hygienic macros , independent compilation , and code sharing .
This dissertation defines such a semantics making use of explicit substitution to formalize hygienic expansion and linking .
In the module system , interfaces define the static semantics of modules and include the definitions of exported macros .
This enables full parameterization and independent compilation of modules even in the presence of macros .
Thus modules are truly exchangeable components of the program .
The basis for the module system is an operational semantics for hygienic macro expansion - computational macros as well as rewriting - based macros .
The macro semantics provides deep insight into the nature of hygienic macro expansion through the use of explicit substitutions instead of conventional renaming techniques .
The semantics also includes the formal description of Macro Scheme , the meta - language used for evaluating computational macros .
A very readable , interesting , and useful work .

CHICAGO ( AP ) —
As a political uproar rages over end - of - life counseling , a new study finds offering such care to dying cancer patients improves their mood and quality of life .
The study of 322 patients in New Hampshire and Vermont suggests the counseling did n’t discourage people from going to the hospital .
The study ’s publication in today ’s Journal of the American Medical Association coincides with the fight over health care overhaul proposals in Congress .
Some conservatives have called end - of - life counseling included in one version of the bill “ death panels ” and a step toward euthanasia .
A House proposal allows Medicare to pay doctors to chat with patients about living wills , hospice and appointing a person to make decisions when the patient is incapacitated .
In the new study , trained nurses did the end - of - life counseling , mostly by phone , with patients and family caregivers using a model based on national guidelines .
All the patients in the study had been diagnosed with terminal cancer .
Half were assigned to receive usual care .
The other half received usual care plus counseling about managing symptoms , communicating with health care providers and finding hospice care .
Patients who got the counseling scored higher on quality of life and mood measures than patients who did not .
Patients getting counseling often thank the nurses helping them , said author Marie Bakitas , a researcher and nurse practitioner at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon , N.H .
“ They seem to feel a whole lot better knowing there ’s someone who ’s looking at the rest of them and not just the tumor , ” Bakitas said .
The Bushie Obama Can’t Fire
Obama vowed to reverse Bush ’s hard - line drug policies , but Dubya still has a man raising havoc in the White House drug office .
Problem is , Obama ca n’t fire him .
The Bush years were not the finest hour for the White House ’s Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Drug czar John Walters , who ran the place beginning in late 2001 , waged a militaristic drug war , pouring money into dubiously effective efforts to fight trafficking abroad while letting treatment programs stagnate at home , and obsessing over marijuana at the expense of more dangerous drugs .
It ’s an approach that Barack Obama ’s drug czar , Gil Kerlikowske , is now trying to steer away from .
He has vowed to end the use of the phrase “ war on drugs , ” and the hard - liners who filled out Walters ’ office are now gone .
All of them , that is , except one guy : David Murray , the drug czar ’s chief scientist , and Walters ’ most enthusiastic disciple .
David Murray is a lone human memento of the Bush administration ’s drug war , surrounded bypeople who are trying to undo the work on which he has spent the past eight years .
“ He was brought in as a political hatchet man , ” says Ross Deck , a former ONDCP analyst and a 16 - year - veteran of the office who quit during the Walters years .
Before joining in the ONDCP , Murray had no prior experience in addiction science , or law enforcement , or anything else particularly related to drug policy .
He is on the record questioning many of the drug policies espoused by Kerlikowske .
Congress has spent three years trying to get him fired .
Why , then , does Murray somehow still have a job in the Obama administration ?
The reason can be found in the fine print of the federal bureaucracy .
Midway through his tenure , Walters moved Murray — at the time his special assistant — from a politically appointed job to the chief scientist ’s post , a theoretically apolitical position that makes him much harder to fire .
By law , Kerlikowske can’t touch a hair on his head for the first 120 days of his own stint as drug czar .
Which means that until the middle of September , Murray is living in a peculiar limbo : a lone human memento of the Bush administration ’s botched prosecution of the drug war , surrounded by people who are trying to undo the work on which he has spent the past eight years .
ONDCP veterans speak fondly of Murray ’s predecessor , a defense research veteran named Al Brandenstein , who was the drug czar office ’s only previous chief scientist from 1991 until Walters removed him in 2004 .
Brandenstein worked to put advanced drug- detection technologies in the hands of law - enforcement agencies , but he was also interested in advancing the understanding of the demand side of the drug-use equation .
In the 1990s , he got government funding for brain - scanning equipment that medical researchers would use to better understand the biochemistry of addiction .
Critics in the drug - policy community argue that Brandenstein ’s work produced little of value , and that his post existed mostly to provide a pretext for government spending on gadgetry — but for better or worse , that was what Congress had asked for when it created the chief scientist job .
Murray , on the other hand , was not .
A former cultural anthropologist who had left academia for the conservative think - tank circuit , he had made a name for himself in Washington a decade earlier with an article in Policy Review about the danger out - of - wedlock births posed to the fabric of American society .
( It began , memorably , “ America is becoming a nation of bastards . ” )
As Walters ’ special assistant , he had made headlines in Canada in 2003 by suggesting that the U.S. ’s northern neighbor ’s experiments with marijuana decriminalization could cause diplomatic problems along the border .
Shelving most of Brandenstein ’s work , Murray pursued the occasional science project — he was enthusiastic about testing the Beltway ’s sewage for traces of cocaine — but mostly used his office as a political soapbox , lambasting opponents and burying unflattering data that suggested his boss was n’t exactly winning the drug war .
( The Statistical Assessment Service , a research organization that Murray himself launched in 1994 , has in recent years devoted much ink to debunking its own founder ’s claims on drug - policy issues like needle exchange . )
In congressional testimony , Murray branded medical - marijuana advocates “ modern - day snake - oil proponents ” ; in a 2007 appearance on a panel at the libertarian Cato Institute , he derided the think tank ’s pro-legalization stance to be “ an illusion ” that “ grows out of late - night dormitory engagements in college that one hopes one outgrows . ”
He also alienated more middle - of - the - road drug - policy experts both inside and outside the bureaucracy ; one outside expert recalls attending a drug - research group meeting with Murray and hearing him offhandedly refer to the pot-friendly Netherlands as a “ narco- state . ”
“ David acted as though he had said nothing the least bit unusual in saying that , ” the expert says .
“ It ’s indicative of how off the map he is — he simply does n’t understand how strange his own views are about these things . ”
Congress felt similarly .
In the fall of 2005 , as the panic over methamphetamine use in rural America was reaching its apex , Walters sent Murray to brief the members the House of Representatives ’ Meth Caucus — a group formed by mostly rural and Western congressmen in 2001 — on what the administration planned to do about the burgeoning problem .
The assembled lawmakers were so spectacularly unimpressed that one of them , Indiana Republican Mark Souder , marched out of the meeting and promptly demanded that Murray step down from his post , calling his briefing “ pathetic ” and an “ embarrassment . ”
Murray ’s performance was so bad , Souder declared , that “ if Director Walters and anyone else in that office agrees with what was said today , they should resign . ”
This was grandstanding , of course .
But Congress made more substantial efforts to oust Murray after the Democrats came to power in 2006 .
Over the next three years , the Senate Appropriations Committee — which controls the federal government ’s purse strings — used its annual report to criticize the chief scientist directly , a highly unusual gesture .
“ The Committee , ” one of the reports reads , “ is highly disappointed in the director of this program ” — Murray — “ and is troubled by his ideas for research and development that appear to have little or no value . ”
When Walters insisted on keeping him in the post in the face of such criticism , the Appropriations Committee responded by slashing funding for it .
Murray ’s office , which received nearly $ 47 million in 2003 , got just $ 1 million this year .
The committee has made it clear that ONDCP ’s science shop wo n’t see another dime until Murray is gone , at least from his current job .
What happens after that is an open question .
( Repeated calls to the ONDCP ’s press office for an interview with Murray or a comment on his future prospects went unreturned . )
While most drug - policy watchers assume Kerlikowske will kick him out of the chief scientist post as soon as he can , actually firing him is trickier .
There are ways to encourage burrowed - in ideologues to quit , however — ONDCP veterans recall that George Bush Sr. ’s drug czar , Bob Martinez , used to do it by assigning them to an office with no windows , phones , or computers .
“ He ’ll be there until somebody runs him off , ” Ross Deck , the former ONDCP analyst , says of Murray .
“ What can they do with him ?
They can give him a job counting paperclips . ”

The latest in mini dog breeding is without a doubt the Dorkie , and with a name like that how could you not want one ?
The breed is of course not a purebred , but a mix between Dachshund 's and Yorkshire Terriers .
On the western parts of North American the Dorkie has been gaining in popularity and breeders are jumping on the money making opportunity .
These designer dogs have got the cute going on and owners love the easy going nature of the Dorkie .
The Dachshund and the Yorkshire Terrier are similar dogs in regards to size and how their personalities are .
An adult Dachshund weighs anywhere between 15 - 28 pounds while a Yorkshire Terrier will be , on average , about 7 pounds as an adult .
Dorkies find their weight range to be between 5 and 15 pounds .
Despite their small sizes , the Dachshund and the Yorkshire Terrier were originally bred to be hunters .
So you can imagine that they still have some of their hunting instincts in tact even though most Dorkie 's would barely hurt the wings on a fly .
There has been a large number of breeders popping up lately so you should n't have to look far to nab one of these adorable dogs .
They make for a great dog for kids because they have about the same energy supply , are very easy going and love to play with kids .
Knowing that the Dachshund is a loyal companion , and the Yorkshire Terrier is an energetic and often noisy creature .
The temperament of a Dorkie leans more towards the Dachshunds submissive attitude .
Although , a Dorkie will bark incessantly at any foreign organism in their perceived territory .
Despite their outward aggression , they are not known to attack humans or other dogs .
There are not too many health problems known yet with the breed , but so far my girlfriend 's Dorkie has shown no signs of major problems .
It will be interesting to see over the next few years if anything major comes up , so make sure to keep up on the infortmation for your dog 's sake .
Since the Dorkie is small you only have to worry about it escaping through small holes in your yard fence , or getting ahold of small objects it can choke on .
Remember to stay away from mall pet stores and stick with caring local breeders who do not farm their dogs .
Your best bet is looking on Craigslist in your local area , or using Google to find a Dorkie breeder near you .
I also recommend checking out this link to find a long list of legit and reputable Dorkie breeders .
In what may just be a perfect storm of technology geek gadget lust , an auction house in Southern California is preparing to auction off the first Apple Macintosh Plus ever made–a computer that was owned by “ Star Trek ” creator Gene Roddenberry .
The event promises to bring together two of the most famously devoted fan bases – Apple buyers and Trekkies .
Profiles in History , an auctioneer of Hollywood memorabilia , will offer the aging Mac at an auction scheduled for Oct. 8 - 9 .
( For those keeping score at home , the device bears the serial number F4200NUM0001 . )
The Macintosh Plus was launched in 1986 and featured a whopping 1 megabyte of RAM ( today ’s comparable desktop computers come loaded with a base 1 gigabyte of RAM — a 1,000 times more ) .
It was the third model in the Mac line and cost $ 2,600 , according to Wikipedia .
The very first Mac Plus to roll off an Apple assembly line was presented to Roddenberry as a gift .
He died in 1991 .
The auction house said
It has an estimated sale price of $ 800 - $ 1200 .
Also on the auction list is Michael Jackson ’s white glove that he wore on the Victory Tour .
One would expect a somewhat higher price for that cultural artifact .

One of the highly entertaining aspects of Sonia Sotomayor nomination and confirmation process has been the constant refrain of “ Affirmative Action ” pushed by conservatives as they seek to undermine Sotomayors reputation .
You see , in conservative circles , affirmative action is synonymous with a person of color getting a job that they did n’t deserve ( when there is probably a much more qualified White Male available ! ) .
Apart from being laughable given Sotomayors extensive judicial experience and readily apparent intellectual discipline , conservatives seem to have a comically short - term memory in relation to their own less - than - qualified picks for the Supreme Court .
Or , in short , Clarence Thomas .
I ’m not necessarily saying Clarence Thomas was selected by George H.W. Bush for the Supreme Court because he was black .
But I am saying Clarence Thomas has been an embarrassment to the Supreme Court for his 18 years on the Supreme Court , displaying a complete lack of even basic understanding of Constitutional Law and repeatedly falling asleep during oral arguments on some of the most important constitutional and civil right cases of the past 2 decades .
Incidentally , Sotomayor was appointed by H.W. Bush to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York around the same time Thomas was appointed to the Supreme Court .
The simple question is Independent of personal background , is Sotomayor qualified for the Supreme Court ? , and the answer to that question is a resounding yes .
Pose the same question about Clarence Thomas , and the answer is a resounding no .

“ We ’ve never fretted over budget deficits , ” said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial , at least not if they finance tax cuts or “ spending to win a war , ” but the $ 9 trillion , 10 - year federal deficit forecast by the White House budget office is different .
Not only is it driven by domestic spending , it ’s also based on “ laughably implausible ” assumptions , like that Congress will hold spending to the rate of inflation .
As things are going now , $ 9 trillion “ may be optimistic . ”
“ Can we please relax ? ” said Robert Reich in Salon .
Ten - year budget projections are “ notoriously irrelevant ” and wildly inaccurate .
Besides , out of context , “ deficits and debts mean just about nothing . ”
In 1945 , federal debt was 120 percent of GDP , but economic growth “ tamed ” that ratio in a few short years .
The only number “ worth looking at ” is the deficit projection for next year — $ 1.6 trillion — which , given our bad jobless numbers , seems “ alarmingly small . ”
Small ?
America ’s fiscal situation is an unsustainable , “ dreadful mess , ” said James Pethokoukis in Reuters .
Not that Americans are much help — we need to choose between higher taxes or smaller government , but “ a fair reading of the polls ” shows we “ sort of want both ” lower taxes and more government services .
And our “ politicians are certainly no better . ”
Well , they need to step up , said The Washington Post in an editorial .
The Obama White House “ has a point ” that more than half of the $ 9 trillion deficit stems from Bush - era tax cuts , wars , and other policies , but it ’s “ time to stop crying ‘ we inherited it . ’ ”
Obama needs his own “ clear , credible plan ” to restore fiscal sustainability .
See this guy above ?
No , that ’s not Frank Caliendo .
That ’s John Madden , and his franchise might have cheated gamers out of up to $ 925 million !
Let me back up a bit .
You might remember in 2004 that EA and NFL signed an agreement that allowed EA exclusive rights to use the NFL ’s teams , stadiums , and players for 5 years .
There ’s a lot more drama where that came from , but to make a long story short , they screwed their competitors ( particularly Take Two ) out of 5 years of NFL titles .
If you want more information , look it up .
However , a Michigan economics professor by the name of Jeffrey MacKie - Mason declared in a class - action lawsuit that by monopolizing the NFL franchise , EA was able to unfairly hike up the price of Madden titles to $ 60 .
This actually violates Californian anti-trust laws .
So …what ’s this mean for you ?
If you bought a Madden game , you ’re probably not going to get any restitution or anything even if EA loses the lawsuit , which is unlikely .
But you ’ve probably been screwed out of some money , and the jilted companies who would have preferred your gaming dollars are n’t going to walk away quietly .
On a personal note , there are very few sports games that I ’ve liked , and I could never get into Madden .
Also , I ca n’t justify buying a new game every year just because some stats were updated and a feature or one - and - a - half was added .
Hell , I only buy every other Dynasty Warrior title .
Anyway , let ’s see what comes of this .
Like I said , it ’s unlikely that gamers ’ll get anything back , but maybe a precedent will be set here .
Hopefully , it wo n’t be in the wrong direction .

The Obama administration has been keenly aware of discontent among many in its liberal base with regard to its Afghanistan policy and an expected request for additional troops following General McChrystal 's upcoming assessment of the situation there .
That liberal base just got a high - profile voice to lead its charge .
Sen . Russ Feingold , D - WI , called on President Obama to announce a timetable for withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan .
" This is a strategy that is not likely to succeed , " Sen .
Feingold said about the troop buildup in Afghanistan .
" After eight years , I am not convinced that pouring more and more troops into Afghanistan is a well thought out policy , " said Feingold .
The liberal Democrat said he has expressed his reservations with President Obama , Admiral Mullen , and others inside the administration and he says he has " never been convinced they have a good answer . "
" I think it is time we start discussing a flexible timetable so that people around the world can see when we are going to bring our troops out , " said Feingold .
" Showing the people there and here that we have a sense about when it is time to leave is one of the best things we can do , " he added .
Sen .
Feingold did n't offer up a specific timetable for when he would like to see American troops out of Afghanistan .
The senator opposed the war in Iraq and eventually became a leading voice among Democrats in pushing the Bush administration to adopt a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
In an interview with the editorial board of The Post - Crescent in Appleton , WI this afternoon , Sen .
Feingold highlighted that the three top terrorist targets originally in Afghanistan - Osama bin Laden , al - Zawahiri , and Mullah Omar - are now in Pakistan .

" Are n't we helping to drive more extremists into Pakistan ? , " Feingold asked .
He went on to call Pakistan the home of the " witch 's brew of every kind of nightmare . "
Sen .
Feingold pointed to Af - Pak Ambassador Richard Holbrooke 's recent comments when asked about what success will look like in Afghanistan .
" We 'll know it when we see it , " said Holbrooke .
" That 's not good enough for me , " Feingold responded .
Mr. Feingold said that he believes the United States needs to maintain its ability to go after Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and continue operations there to " make sure we can do the most we can in the remaining time . "
The Wisconsin Democrat is starting to be a bit of a liberal thorn in the President 's ( left ) side and has some Democrats wondering if he may be plotting a 2012 primary challenge to Mr. Obama .
His call for an Afghanistan timetable withdrawal today comes on the heels of his pressuring the president to include a public option in whatever health care reform bill he signs into law .
" I am not interested in passing health care reform in name only .
Without a public option , I do n't see how we will bring real change to a system that has made good health care a privilege for those who can afford it , " Feingold said last week in response to some perceived wavering on the public option from Obama administration officials .
Last April , Sen .
Feingold issued a report card on President Obama 's handling of " rule of law " issues and gave him a " D " on his administration 's posture on " state secrets . "
You remember Betsy McCaughey , do n't you ?
She 's the right wing hack who propagated a purposely misleading article in The New Republic that was used to torpedo the Clinton health plan , and more recently the author of the " death panels " lie .
Well , Rolling Stone 's Tim Dickinson has a hell of a scoop in their Oct. 1 issue in an article called " The Lie Machine : The Plot to Kill Health Care Reform " :
McCaughey 's lies were later debunked in a 1995 post - mortem in The Atlantic , and The New Republic recanted the piece in 2006 .
But what has not been reported until now is that McCaughey 's writing was influenced by Phillip Morris , the world 's largest tobacco company , as part of a secret campaign to scuttle Clinton 's health care reform .
( The measure would have been funded by a huge increase in tobacco taxes . )
In an internal company memo from March 1994 , the tobacco giant detailed its strategy to derail Hillarycare through an alliance with conservative think tanks , front groups and media outlets .
Integral to the company 's strategy , the memo observed , was an effort to " work on the development of favorable pieces " with " friendly contacts in the media . "
The memo , prepared by a Phillip Morris executive , mentions only one author by name :
" Worked off - the - record with Manhattan [ Editor 's note :
At the time , McCaughey was a fellow at the Manhattan Institute ] and writer Betsy McCaughey as part of the input to the three - part expose in The New Republic on what the Clinton plan means to you .
The first part detailed specifics of the plan . "
McCaughey did not respond to Rolling Stone 's request for an interview .
Rotobrush is a company that really cares about the quality of their equipment .

A lot of machines star off great but quickly loose there power , not the BrushBeast .
With its new stronger more breathable bag and filter system and 4 motors this machine will handle the worst of the worst .
I do n’t think I know how great it was until I had to send it back .
Rotobrush machines are easy to use , easy to set up , durable , and now preform even better than before .
I ca n’t wait to get a few of my own .

Whether it 's highlighted in major news headlines about Argentinean affairs and Ponzi schemes , or in personal battles with obesity and drug addiction , individuals regularly succumb to greed , lust and self - destructive behaviors .
New research from the Kellogg School of Management examines why this is the case , and demonstrates that individuals believe they have more restraint than they actually possess -- ultimately leading to poor decision - making .
The study , led by Loran Nordgren , senior lecturer of management and organizations at the Kellogg School , examined how an individual 's belief in his / her ability to control impulses such as greed , drug craving and sexual arousal influenced responses to temptation .
The research found the sample , on average , displayed a " restraint bias , " causing individuals to miscalculate the amount of temptation they could truly handle , in turn leading to a greater likelihood of indulging impulsive or addictive behavior .
" People are not good at anticipating the power of their urges , and those who are the most confident about their self - control are the most likely to give into temptation , " said Nordgren .
" The key is simply to avoid any situations where vices and other weaknesses thrive and , most importantly , for individuals to keep a humble view of their willpower . "
In developing their case , the study 's authors cited previous research demonstrating that people often have difficulty appreciating the power of impulsive states .
People in a " cold state " ( not experiencing hunger , anger , sexual arousal , etc. ) tend to underestimate how a " hot , " impulsive state will influence their behavior .
To expand upon these findings , the study authors set out to test whether :
People in a cold , non-impulsive state will overestimate their ability to control impulses
People in a hot , impulsive state will have a more realistic view of their capacity for impulse control
People who perceive they have a high capacity for impulse control will expose themselves to more temptation and will ultimately exhibit more impulsive behavior
To test their hypotheses , the researchers conducted four experiments focusing on hunger , addiction and mental fatigue .
Each experiment resulted in significant " restraint bias . "
For example , one experiment focused on cigarette addiction found those who overestimated their capacity for self - control were much more likely to smoke a cigarette after simply watching a movie about smoking .
Another experiment centered on hunger .
Results found a satiated group was significantly less likely to return snacks than a hungry group who limited their temptation by choosing less appealing snacks .
" A system which assumes people will control themselves is going to fall prey to this restraint bias ; we expose ourselves to more temptation than is wise , and subsequently we have millions of people suffering with obesity , addictions and other unhealthy lifestyles , " said Nordgren .
" And , while our study focused on personal behaviors like smoking and eating , it is easy to apply our findings to a broader context .
Understanding the power of temptation , you might also ask about the extent to which we need oversight or regulatory guidelines for business and political leaders . "
Furthermore , this research suggests observers should think twice before judging those who fall prey to temptation because most people overestimate their capacity to control their own impulses , Nordgren concluded .

Ok , well it is n't really for sale .

SHAOGUAN , China —
Three weeks after simmering racial tension escalated to mayhem and a double murder at a toy factory here , about 750 Uighur workers remain largely out of sight , behind locked gates and guarded doors — perhaps because they are at the center of a storm that has brought international attention to a remote Chinese province .
Most of the Xinjiang migrants who arrived at the massive factory in northern Guangdong province in May are apparently being held in a branch workshop 15 miles up the road , after the fight here led to mass protests and killings 2,000 miles away in their home province .
Their tightly guarded new home and workshop is sealed off , and requests to visit inside and interview the Uighur men playing pool behind the gates after dark were refused by guards without explanation .
When asked if those inside were allowed to leave , a guard replied sternly , “ No , they ca n’t go out . ”
About 10 locals said they have n’t seen the Uighurs outside the gates since they were moved here following the Shaoguan factory murders on June 26 , but government officials say they can come and go .
Onlookers are quickly shuffled away from the gates and police closely monitor every move .
On July 10 , officials from Shaoguan and Xinjiang local governments held a press conference to reveal new details of their investigation into the deadly factory fight , and to discuss the overall situation .
They produced two Uighur workers from the toy factory to answer a few questions about their current situation , but many details remain unclear .
The young Uighur man and woman said their new living quarters are safe , but they did not discuss how tightly their movement is controlled .
The press conference was time - limited , and the workers , identified only by their Chinese names , were quickly shuffled away when it ended .
“ I did feel scared right after the incident happened , but now we feel so confident and full of hope for our life and work , ” said the woman , Xiare Kezhi .
“ Now we have already gone back to work and we all live with peace of mind . ”
They do , however , know about the violence that occurred in Urumqi on July 5 , when a reported 156 people were killed after locals took to the streets to protest the Shaoguan murders and lack of arrests .
The two workers are from Kashgar , where foreign journalists were ordered to leave on Friday .
“ We have heard about what ’s happening in Urumqi ; we watch TV news and people are talking about it , ” said the Uighur woman .
“ We wonder why people connected the two things .
We think that what happened here has nothing to do with the Urumqi incident . ”
What precisely happened at the massive Shaoguan toy factory on June 26 remains clouded by rampant rumors and anxiety .
City officials at the press conference said the fight broke out after a Han woman was harassed and groped by a group of Uighur men when she returned to her dorm from work late on June 25 .
She reported the incident and the men refused to cooperate with an investigation , said city government spokesman Wang Qingxi , so the fight escalated into a deadly brawl that killed two Uighur men and left 100 people injured .
News of the incident , some of which was apparently exaggerated , quickly spread across the internet .
Uighur rights groups globally condemned what happened and a lack of police action .
Earlier this week , officials announced they had arrested 15 people in Shaoguan , including three Uighurs , in connection with the factory brawl .
Other reports said several people were detained for spreading rumors .
As Xinjiang braces for a crackdown , locals in Shaoguan are full of opinions about Uighurs , race and what really happened here .
“ Things are back to normal in the factory because there are no people from Xinjiang there anymore , ” said Yang Lin , a 40 - year - old factory worker from central China .
“ We were very surprised by everything that happened , but these were people who wanted to steal things . ”
“ These people from Xinjiang are just wild , ” said another worker who refused to give his name , but who said he believed the rumors that the men raped Han women shortly after arriving at the factory in May .
Those initial rumors , skewering six Uighurs for raping two Han women ( a charge later denounced by police ) , started circulating online in early June .
But workers said tension arose shortly after the Uighurs arrived .
Hubei native Li Wenlin said there was constant arguing between the Han and Uighur men for weeks , but he stayed out of it .
“ I ’m an easy person to get along with and I thought the Uighurs were fine , ” said Li , who said police in the factory warned against talking about the incident .
Despite the tension and violence , officials said plans to bring several hundred more Uighur workers to the area will proceed .
The future for those holed up in the gated toy factory appears unknown .

A few months ago in Osaka , a Japanese friend I had n’t seen for a while asked if I had put on weight .
After considering a variety of responses , I did what any 40 - year - old narcissist would do — I denied it .
“ Are you sure ? ” she said in Japanese , with a smile .
“ You look fatter . ”
“ What do you mean , ‘ fatter ’ ?
I ’m the same . ”
“ But your face , it looks fatter .
I ’m sure .
Your arms , too . ”
Honestly , I could n’t say if this was true because I always put monitoring my weight on a bathroom scale in the same category as getting a perm and plucking my eyebrows .
I noticed that some of my pants were getting a bit snug , but that can happen after many washings .
If my belly protruded a tad more than usual , that could easily be attributed to water retention caused by the high - sodium Japanese diet .
But two weeks later , another acquaintance , also Japanese and female , said almost exactly the same thing : “ Chotto futtota ? ” ( Have you become a little fatter ? )
This was getting tiresome .
Since coming to Japan earlier this year to teach English , I found that certain features of my appearance attracted more attention than they did back home .
In a land of ( what some Japanese disparagingly call ) big faces , small noses , boring black hair , little eyes and short legs , my “ small face , ” “ tall nose , ” wavy brown hair , round blue eyes and long legs made me quite the exotic specimen .
I was single and an active participant in the dating market , but this obsession with my gut was throwing me off my game .
The European Union ( EU ) has published a new Digital Competitiveness Report ( Adobe Reader . PDF ) , which finds that the EU is home to 114 million fixed broadband subscribers and that half of EU households and more than 80 % of EU businesses have a fixed broadband connection .
Some three quarters of those also have average download speeds of over 2 M bps ( Megabits per second ) .
Still , despite broadband being available to 93 % of the EU25 population ( 87 % in 2005 ) , some 50 % of households are still without a connection , with many of those residing in remote and rural areas .
Adults over the age of 65 and the unemployed are also the least active online .
Never the less , in 2008 some 56 % of EU citizens were using the Internet on a regular basis , up from 43 % in 2005 .
So where does the UK come ?
We still have one of the most active online economies in Europe , not to mention 99.8 % coverage of broadband services ( includes slower ' up to ' 512 Kbps [ 0.5 Mbps ] services ) and a 62 % take - up .
We rank 6th in EU Broadband Penetration and when all factors are included our overall showing is strong in 4th place .
However UK broadband performance ( speed ) remains somewhat poor , placing us a lowly 15th overall , mostly because of a poor average broadband speed ( reported as 4.1 Mbps by Ofcom in April 2009 ) .
Statistics buffs can find a veritable treat of hundreds more charts and lots of loopy numbers in the full report ( download linked at the top of this news item ) .
Sadly full details on broadband pricing were not available for the UK .
My internet service is being shut off Monday .
I do n’t know if I ’ll be able to post again before then or when I ’ll be able to post again after .
Hopefully soon .
I do n’t have a new place yet .
Crazy , I know .
We ’ll see how it goes .

The whopping claws on its feet may look terrifying , but it looks like they were used for climbing rather than disembowelling ( Image : Solent News / Rex )
ACCORDING to Jurassic
Park , everyone ’s favourite fleet - footed predators dispatched their prey by disembowelling them with deadly “ killing claws ” .
Not so , say palaeontologists who have studied the biomechanics of Velociraptor claws .
Instead , the notorious dinosaurs used their claws to cling to prey and to climb trees .
Phil Manning of the University of Manchester , UK , and colleagues previously showed that Velociraptor ‘s sharp - tipped foot claw could puncture skin and help the dinosaur cling to wounded prey …
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s largest state employees ’ union voted on Saturday to approve a strike authorization measure to protest furloughs of state workers and pressure state officials to ratify its labor contract .
A spokesman for Service Employees International Union Local 1000 said a strike was not imminent but that the vote authorized union officers to initiate certain job actions , including a strike if necessary .
The SEIU represents about 95,000 state employees , including clerical workers and teachers .
The group ’s labor contract with the state expired last year , SEIU spokesman Jim Zamora said .
The union negotiated a new deal with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s administration in February , but the contract has not been ratified by the state Legislature .
Earlier this week , the Republican governor signed a bill that closed a more than $ 24 billion budget gap .
Under the legislation , furloughs will continue for state workers for three days a month , cutting their pay by 15 percent .
“ We feel that he ( Schwarzenegger ) really undermined any kind of a contract deal by pushing these furloughs on folks , ” Zamora said .
The SEIU said the strike authorization was approved by 74 percent of its membership .
Ned Stafford / Hamburg , Germany
A criminal investigation into approximately 100 professors in Germany suspected of taking cash bribes for illegally helping unworthy students obtain doctoral degrees has rattled the foundations of German science and higher education .
News of the investigation broke in Germany over the weekend , causing Federal education and research minister Annette Schavan to fret publicly that Germany ’s strong international science reputation would suffer if the allegations turn out to be true .
G?nther Feld , senior prosecutor in Cologne , told Chemistry World that the professors under investigation come from several disciplines , including the natural sciences .
Most work on a contract basis , with only a few full professors with tenured positions .
He declined to name affected universities , but German press reports have listed universities in Frankfurt , Leipzig , Rostock , Hamburg , Hannover , Cologne and Berlin among others .
The academics came under suspicion following an investigation into the Institute for Academic Consultancy in Cologne last year .
During that investigation Feld and his team collected evidence on around 100 professors now facing possible indictment for bribery .
The firm allegedly charged up to € 20,000 ( ? 17,465 ) to help doctoral candidates find a dissertation topic and supervisor , with participating professors reportedly receiving between € 2,000 and € 5,000 per doctoral candidate .
Under German law , supervision of a PhD dissertation is a public service and professors are not allowed to accept money beyond their normal salary for the service .
It is not clear how many doctoral candidates were involved , but Feld does not foresee criminal charges being filed against them as most were unaware of the situation .
Universities affected by the scandal will all eventually be contacted by prosecutors .
Some have already publicly announced that they have been in contact , such as the University of Hamburg , which confirmed involvement to the local daily paper Hamburger Abendblatt .
Divided
Matthias Jaroch , spokesman for the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers , says the association condemns any professor taking bribes in return for easing the path for a PhD and believes those caught should be criminally prosecuted .
While he says the high number of professors being investigated ’a shock , ’ he notes that 25,000 PhDs are awarded each year in Germany and most of those are legitimate .
Germany has 38,000 professors , he says , 24,000 of who can supervise doctoral candidates .
Manuel Ren ?
Theisen , professor of business management at Munich ’s Ludwig Maximilian University , has a very different view , however .
He told Chemistry World that he was not surprised by news of the investigation , saying that he had been warning for 20 years of possible crimes by academic consulting services .
He says that the scandal has potential to go beyond the 100 professors now being investigated .
’ It might be the tip of an iceberg .
The company was working for more than 25 years with hundreds of PhDs . ’
He believes universities have been aware of the potential problems of such consulting services , but have chosen to look the other way .
’ They ignore it because they are colleagues , ’ he says .
Eva-Maria Streier of the German Research Foundation ( DFG ) , Germany ’s main funding body for university research , concedes that the high number of professors being investigated is ’ striking , ’ but says : ’ We assume that scientists promoted by the [ DFG ] will not be affected by this , since all DFG scientists have to sign [ a contract ] for good scientific practice .
If they do n’t follow this they can be pursued - and they do know that . ’
Kurt Begitt , deputy executive director of German Chemical Society , knows the founder of the Institute for Academic Consultancy and says he had thought it was a legitimate operation giving legal assistance to doctoral candidates .
’ I never thought it was criminal or scandalous , ’ he says .
Begitt disagrees with those who feel the scandal will harm Germany ’s scientific reputation .
Although prosecutors have not revealed details of professors being investigated , Begitt says he is confident that few , if any , chemistry faculties are involved .
Chemistry is a highly specialised field , usually requiring a minimum of two doctoral supervisors , he says .
Burma 's detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi plans to renovate her crumbling lakeside home to keep out trespassers , her lawyer says .
The Nobel peace laureate had her house arrest extended by 18 months earlier this month for violating her detention rules after a bizarre incident in which an American man swam uninvited to her Yangon residence in May .
Nyan Win , one of her lawyers and the spokesman for her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party , said Ms Suu Kyi had been in contact with an architect about making renovations .
" She worries for the security of her house and that 's why she wants to repair it , " he said .
" It is to prevent another trespassing . "
Nyan
Win said the democracy icon would pay for the renovations herself .
He said she was concerned about security despite the house being more heavily guarded by authorities now than it was before John Yettaw made the trip across Inya Lake using a pair of homemade flippers .
Yettaw was sentenced to seven years hard labour for the stunt but was freed after a visit by US senator Jim Webb earlier this month .
Ms Suu Kyi's own conviction over the incident , which sparked international outrage , means she will not be free for elections promised by Burma 's junta in 2010 .
She has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest at the family mansion since the junta refused to recognise the NLD 's landslide victory in 1990 .
After a stint in the notorious Insein prison for her trial , she returned to the house with her two aides , where they live an isolated existence with no Internet or telephone access and almost no visitors except doctors and lawyers .
Her lawyers are expected to file an appeal against her conviction early next week .

Back in 2007 , id Software came up with the idea of Quake Live , a browser - based first - person shooter that preserved the spirit of the popular Quake III Arena video game .
In 2008 the project entered an invitation - based closed beta stage , and an open beta was available starting with February 2009 .
The only problem was that the browser plugin allowing the game to be played only supported Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox , running under either Windows XP or Vista .
Things are about to change , as id Software President Todd Hollenshead announced during the QuakeCon 2009 press conference that Quake Live would soon be adding support for Linux and Macintosh systems .
Users who want to catch an early glimpse of the enhancements can do that at QuakeCon , since both versions of the plugin are available for testing on the show floor .
Non-attendees will have to wait for the update that is scheduled to come on August the 18th , this Tuesday .
About Quake Live :
Quake Live is a browser plugin - based first person shooter video game developed by id Software , which first appeared in 2007 .
It is a variant of its predecessor , Quake III Arena , running a slightly updated version of this game 's engine .
The focus is on usability enhancements rather than graphical upgrades , including the plugin that runs compile code on the user 's processor and a more streamlined heads - up display .
Notably , this game does n't make use of Adobe 's Flash technology to run .
Quake Live is free to play , as financial backing for this project comes from in - game advertising .
Do n't expect any graphical wonders from this game ; based on a title released in 1999 , it 's meant to have a quick and simple installation procedure for casual gaming or maybe aid team - bonding through lunch break tournaments .

A young Russian woman , a devoted collector of horror films and spiders , is on trial for sedating and raping ten men .
The police were shocked that 32 - year - old Valeria K. , a quiet good - looking woman from the city of Tambov , was the mysterious rapist who abused ten local men after poisoning them with clonidine , Life .ru reports .
Valeria , who has already been nicknamed the Black Widow for her love of spiders , would get acquainted with men and invite them to her place .
She gave them drinks with clonidine , which almost immediately sent them to sleep for almost 24 hours .
After that , she undressed her victims and raped them , tightening a rope on their male organs to kep them erect .
Waking up in hospital with clonidine poisoning and penis trauma , all the victims could remember was a friendly brunette who gave them drinks .
Finally , local police identified the offender and arrested her .
At present , the police know about ten of Valeria ’s victims , although one of them refused to file a complaint against her .
“ It was great , ” the unnamed man said .
“ I like hot women .
I only wish she had n't use the clonidine on me . ”
Update :
We 're adding more footage as it becomes available .

As it seems to lose control over its country , Iran 's government just tightened its grip yet more on the media .
But it 's hard to believe the move will stop the flow of information of the country .
Not while people keep uploading videos like these to the Internet .
Whether your interest is the business of media , online , or oil – or whether you are simply human – these clips are a must - watch .
It 's not often you can see the way the world works change in 10 clicks .
A warning :
There are graphic depictions of violence in these clips .
I still remember where I was when news of the Clipper Maid of the Seas went missing .
I was heading home from work to wrap some Christmas presents and trim the tree as the holiday approached .
By the time I got home , scenes of an entire town engulfed in flames with shattered homes and rubble strewn throughout .
On its way to New York ’s JFK , shortly after leaving London ’s Heathrow Airport , Pan Am Flight 103 was blown apart as it flew over Lockerbie Scotland .
The falling , flame engulfed wreckage of the Boeing 747 fell down on and crashed into the tiny Hamlet killing 11 of its residents .
All 243 passengers that were on the plane and its 16 crew members were killed immediately .
With 270 people dead , investigators began to piece the plane together as well as the puzzle of how this happened .
Years of discovery disclosed that what brought the plane down was a wireless transmissions that triggered explosive plastics packed in luggage within a cargo hold of the plane .
In time the makers of the bomb and conspirators behind the plot were discovered but in In 2001 , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi , a Libyan , was the only person actually captured and convicted for his involvement in the bombing .
He received a life imprisonment sentenced for his actions and a certain degree of closure was achieved .
But yesterday , 8 years later , Al Megrahi was diagnosed with terminal prostrate cancer .
For most such a diagnosis means death .
But thanks to the Scottish judiciary and its representative in this case , Secretary Kenny MacAskill , for this terrorist , terminal prostrate cancer meant freedom .
In a powerful statement MacAskill stated that while the courts must dole out justice they must also demonstrate compassion and they believe that the fatal cancer that Al Megrahi has warrants their compassion .
I suggest that the families of those 270 who were killed by Al Megrahi ’s actions deserved some compassion .
I believe that the 270 who were killed could have used a little compassion .
I also believe that justice has a role in securing the safety of all those who were fortunate to be spared an untimely death at the hands of terrorists .
Call me heartless if you wish but I am glad that fate dealt Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi prostate cancer .
He deserves it .
In this case , fate provided a deserving man with a debilitating disease that could provide him with the pain and suffering that a civil society has no right to apply themselves .
Furthermore , I believe the legal authorities had no proper justification for altering the sentence that this terrorist deserved simply because he has become ill .
Prostrate cancer does not exonerate one of murder and it should not be a get out of jail free card .
Having been freed , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi received a heroes welcome upon his return to his Libyan homeland .
Many fellow countrymen cheered his triumphant return home .
Freeing Megrahi was not compassionate .
It was stupid .
What is to prevent this man from repeating his dastardly deeds before his well deserved cancer renders him to weak ?
Yesterday , by freeing Megrahi , justice was denied and society as whole was victimized .
We have the Scottish judicial system to thank for it because while they sought to be compassionate to one murderous terrorist they allowed themselves to be callous to the safety and security of everyone else .
Call me heartless if you want but I can only hope that , now free , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi ’s cancer progresses so fast that he dies quickly because now that he is free , his death is the only way to keep us safe from him .
Supporters of the Pirate Bay website , one of the world 's top illegal file sharing websites , demonstrating in Stockholm in April .
Swedish internet users have slowed down illegal downloads after the adoption on April 1 of a stricter law , which has been hailed by the music , film and video industry .
Sweden 's tough new anti-piracy law has led to a sharp drop in illegal downloading but critics say the effects will be short - lived and argue it is an excessive breach of personal privacy .
Sweden 's legislation , based on the European Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive , is credited with a 30 percent fall in the country 's total web traffic the day after it came into effect .
Experts say that the drop in Swedish web usage is explained by the fact that illegal downloading represents between 50 and 75 percent of Internet traffic worldwide .
The new law , effective as of April 1 , gives copyright holders the right to force Internet service providers to reveal details of users sharing files , opening the way for legal action that could see downloaders pay damages and fines .
Data from Internet service provider Netnod show usage is still free - falling , four months after the law was passed .
In France , lawmakers have kept a close eye on Sweden 's approach to illegal downloads as they look set to pass their own anti-piracy bill later this year .
" It 's obvious that those who are using file - sharing have been scared and moved somewhere else , like streaming music sites , " said Daniel Johansson , a researcher at KTH Institute of Technology in Stockholm .
" Some popular Swedish artists have seen their downloading on websites like The Pirate Bay go down by up to 80 percent , " he added .
The Pirate Bay claims to have some 22 million users worldwide .
While unauthorised downloads are on the slide at a time when global record sales are booming , the amount of music bought from legal download sites have shot up by 57 percent compared to last year .
Music retailers say their overall sales have risen by 14 percent , according to data from IFPI , an association that represents the recording industry worldwide .
But it is not just music that is downloaded illegally -- films and video games are also popular with Internet pirates .
Per Stroemback , a spokesman for the Swedish Games Industry association , describes Sweden 's tough stance on piracy as " a historic example of effective legislation " .
" No one could predict such a dramatic decrease in illegal traffic and not only that there 's also been a huge increase in the legal services , " he told AFP .
As yet , no one person has been charged under the new law but Lisa Cronstedt , a Sweden - based spokeswoman for IFPI , told AFP that the group plans to sue individual illegal file - sharers within the next month .
Five audio book publishers have already secured a landmark victory against Swedish Internet service provider Ephone when it refused to release data of customers believed to have downloaded copyrighted material illegally .
Ephone 's chief executive has said he plans to appeal the judgement , which said the company could be fined if it does not hand over the information .
Companies like Ephone fear they will lose customers if forced to release data such as Internet protocol ( IP ) addresses , which identifies which computers are used to surf the web .
Christian Engstroem , a member of the European Parliament and the deputy leader of Sweden 's Pirate Party , argues Internet users will be unfairly punished under the new legislation .
" This is a completely unequal law , where ordinary people will become scapegoats and will be asked for hundreds of thousands or millions of ( Swedish ) crowns by the industry , " Engstroem told AFP .
" I do n't think it will be efficient in the long run .
I believe the traffic is going to climb up again after some months , " he said , adding that eventually people will find new ways to avoid being traced .
Engstroem 's party , which calls for greater web privacy and legalised file - sharing , soared in opinion polls shortly after a Stockholm court in April found the four Swedish men behind popular download site The Pirate Bay guilty of promoting copyright infringement .
In June 's European elections , the Pirate Party won just over seven percent of the popular vote .

The recession might be global , but Skype — the world 's largest international phone company — wants more pennies from the pockets of its customers who place overseas calls to landlines and mobile phones .
Starting on September 6 , Skype is doubling its connection fee for calls to most countries from 3.9 cents to 7.9 cents .
The connection fee remains 3.9 cents for calls to so - called Global Rate Countries , a selection of countries that includes Germany , the U.K. and the United States .
Calls to those countries cost 2.1 cents per minute after the first minute , which will cost 6 cents in total .
Skype is doubling the rates as part of a normal process of looking at prices and making any necessary adjustments , according to a Skype spokesman , who points out that Skype subscribers wo n't see a price increase , and Skype - to - Skype calls remain free .
The rate change was quietly announced on a hard - to - find page on Skype 's site .
It 's a surprising change for Skype given that it is already facing a number of competitors who beat Skype on price — including companies such as Rebtel and Gizmo Project .
Wholesale data connectivity prices also continue to fall worldwide .
" It 's not just about price , it 's about value , " a Skype spokesman told Wired.com , citing Skype 's free audio and video calls and its new " ultra - wideband " audio codec – which delivers high - quality sound using less bandwidth .
While the change is just pennies per call , it could add up to a big change in Skype 's bottom line .
The company , which eBay bought in 2006 for $ 2.6 billion , has never brought in much revenue , as its core product is free computer - to - computer calling .
In 2008 , Skype contributed $ 550 million to eBay 's revenues — not much given Skype handles more international calls than any other telephone company .
Ebay announced in April that it would spin
Skype off into its own company via an IPO in early 2010 , but Skype could not comment on whether the price change is meant to increase the value of the company since it is in a SEC - mandated quiet period .

How many present - day members of Congress are Freemasons ?
| REUTERS
In search of the Hill 's Freemasons
The reporter walked into his office expecting a normal day at work : cup of coffee , call some sources , the usual routine .
But this was n’t going to be an ordinary day at all .
Advertisement
His editor had other ideas .
Darker ideas .
The editor wanted an article on the new Dan Brown novel called “ The Lost Symbol ” , about a conspiracy by Freemasons in Washington .
The long - awaited book features Robert Langdon , the hero of Brown ’s previous smash hits “ The Da Vinci Code ” and “ Angels and Demons , ” on a dramatic quest in and around Washington ’s most famous landmarks to find a secret hidden long ago by the Masons .
But the editor was intrigued by a real - world question :
How many present - day members of Congress are Freemasons ?
And is any member of Congress also a Knight Templar — a famous subgroup of Masons that traces its lineage to the medieval crusaders ?
In a flash , the reporter realized he had spent years acquiring the skills needed to complete the quest to find the Freemasons on Capitol Hill — and finish it before the looming deadline .
I am the only man in this cubicle who can write this story .
My God !
CHAPTER 2
The reporter turns to the same exotic and arcane research tool Langdon uses in the book : Google .
There , he finds a clue .
A YouTube video shows a member of Congress accepting an award from his fellow Masons in 2008 .
It ’s Joe Wilson — the South Carolina Republican who shouted “ You lie ! ” at President Barack Obama this month .
He says he is a member of the Sinclair Lodge of West Columbia , S.C .
“ For over 250 years , Masons have been a part of the fabric and leadership of the United States , ” Wilson says on the video .
“ The grand tradition of brotherhood is a reflection of the very framework this nation was founded upon . ”
No answers there , and Wilson ’s office declined to elaborate .
Next , the reporter dialed the number of Dick Fletcher , executive secretary of the Masonic Service Association , a sort of national clearinghouse for Masonic information .
But Fletcher said Masons do n’t keep records of government officials who are members — and would n’t release them if they did , for privacy reasons .
Deadline approaches .
There were forces at work that no one could comprehend .
The reporter turned to an even more eminent figure , Senate Historian Don Ritchie .
But Ritchie said there ’s no list of Masons in Congress .
Politicians have long been drawn to the group , he says , because of its grass - roots political organizing power .
The reporter heard a chime and looked up at his computer screen in astonishment .
An electronic message has appeared there , as if by magic .
These are words .
And they ’re written in English , an ancient language I happen to speak .
It was an e-mail , from a hidden and well - placed source .
And it contained a list of names of members of Congress .
Hidden among them was the Knight Templar .
But which one was it ?
CHAPTER 3
The reporter raced to the one place he knew he could find answers : the U.S. Capitol .
Dashing into the building , he found the first of the names on his list — House Minority Whip Eric Cantor .
The Virginia Republican offered a few cryptic words as he ascended the grand House stairway just beneath an enormous painting of George Washington .
Cantor ’s fellow Virginian was perhaps the most famous American Mason , but nine signers of the Declaration of Independence , including Ben Franklin , and 13 signers of the Constitution were Masons .
As many as 14 presidents have been Masons .
Legend has it that the fraternal organization descended from medieval stone masonry guilds .
Its membership is open to men of any religion , so long as they profess faith in a supreme being .
It has long attracted conspiracy theories that Masons seek to control the world .
Its members , though , say it is simply a social and charitable organization , albeit one with secret handshakes and codes .
“ I joined the Masons about 20 years ago , because my dad and uncle were members of a lodge down in Richmond , ” Cantor said as he climbed the stairs .
“ But I have n’t participated in a long time .
I ’m just too busy . ”
He says he does n’t know anything about the new Dan Brown book and continues down a hallway .
The reporter quickly moved to a subterranean portal : the Senate subway .
Soon enough , a figure emerges from the long tunnel .
It ’s Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester .
He , too , is a Mason .
“ I really like the ceremony , ” he says .
“ That ’s what drew me to it . ”
He says his father - in - law invited him to join the Masons in the mid-1980s .
“ A lot of our Founding Fathers were Masons .
Maybe because they liked to be so rebellious and nonconformist . ”
But Tester has n’t read the Dan Brown book , either .
And when the reporter prods him about the conspiracy theories , he says simply : “ I do n’t put a lot of stock in all that . ”
Tester disappears onto the Senate floor .
Maybe Tester ’s fellow Mason , Sen. Chuck Grassley , can offer enlightenment .
The Iowa Republican says part of the appeal is the fraternity ’s egalitarian worldview .
“ There are Masons in every country and in countries like Iran , where they are probably underground .
Hitler did n’t like Masons , ” Grassley said .
And although the elaborate rituals may seem silly to outsiders — including the red fez worn by Shriner Masons — he said , “ Do n’t judge us by the funny hats we wear . ”
The reporter was beginning to panic .
He still had n’t found the Knight Templar .
He vowed to press on .
CHAPTER 4
It was going to take an even more exalted personage to solve the mystery .
The reporter dialed the phone number of Rep. Howard Coble ( R - N.C. ) , a 33rd Degree Mason .
“ It ’s a real first - class organization , ” Coble says of Masonry .
“ If people conducted their lives along the way the Mason code is spelled out , there would be far fewer problems , far more solutions and far less chaos , ” Coble says .
Ordo Ab Chao : Order out of chaos .
He ’s alluding to the Masonic credo .
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
The reporter presses for explanation .
Coble demurs .
“ I ca n’t speak more openly than that , ” he said .
“ I do n’t want to get drummed out of the lodge . ”
He explains that his Masonic brothers have already been lenient with him — since he ’s too busy to get to meetings very often , he forgot the password to the lodge in North Carolina recently .
A fellow Mason had to vouch for him .
" I ’m proud to be a Mason , ” Coble said .
“ But I ’m not proud of my attendance record . ”
CHAPTER 5
The reporter raced through the other congressional Masons on his list .
Rep. Denny Rehberg ( R - Mont . ) : Recently injured in a boating accident , he does n’t respond to the reporter ’s summons .
Rep. Jeff Miller ( R - Fla . ) : unavailable .
Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) : recently hospitalized .
The reporter stood in the opulently carpeted speaker ’s lobby just off the House floor , peering through the glass doors into the chamber .
There , he spotted the object of his pursuit .
It was so obvious .
How could he not have known ?
The Knight Templar was standing in the back of the House chamber , chatting amiably with his fellow Democrats .
This was it .
The moment the reporter had been working for .
Rep. Nick Rahall ( D - W.Va . ) emerged , briefly , from the chamber .
A genial 60 - year - old with bushy eyebrows , the diminutive Rahall did n’t look anything like a medieval crusader .
In fact , his family roots are in Lebanon , not Europe .
But Rahall is also a 33rd Degree Mason , who joined the secretive society about five years before he ran for Congress in 1976 .
“ When I joined , there were a great deal of older individuals who helped me along the way and to whom I am deeply indebted to this day , ” he said .
“ We call each other ‘ travelers , ’ ” Rahall explained .
“ To become a 32nd or 33rd Degree Mason , there are a whole slew of degrees before that , and it ’s a long road we ’ve taken together . ”
Rahall said he achieved his 33rd Degree status by two routes : through the Scottish Rite and through the York Rite , where he participated in the Commandery .
That ’s the portion of the Freemason tradition that makes Rahall a Knight Templar .
And although he had n’t read the Dan Brown book , Rahall says he understands why the Masons attract so many conspiracy theories .
“ It ’s because , particularly in the early days , there were code words to get into the lodge , and everything is done by rituals , ” Rahall said .
“ The Masons themselves helped perpetuate the myth , knowing it was just that — a myth . ”
The reporter screwed up his courage to ask one final question .
So is there a global conspiracy ?
“ No . ”
But you would n’t tell me if there was , would you ?
“ That ’s right , ” Rahall said with a smile .
Chuckling , the Knight Templar traveled back though the portal to the ancient floor of the House of Representatives .
In cereta ’s words , “ Oh yes , I ’m going there . ”
Trigger warning .
After George Sodini went on a misogynist shooting spree , killing three women , a lot of people were making comparisons to the Virginia Tech or Columbine shootings .
But among women in the tech world , the comparison I most often heard was the Montreal Massacre .
Most people outside of Canada ( and / or geek feminism ) have never heard of it .
Here ’s what happened : in 1989 at Ã‰cole Polytechnique , an engineering school in Montreal , Quebec .
Marc LÃ©pine walked into an engineering classroom with an automatic rifle , separated the men from the women , proclaimed that he was “ fighting feminism ” , and shot all nine women , killing six .
Moving on , he started shooting people in the hallways and cafeteria .
In all , he killed 14 women and then himself .
In Canada , the anniversary of this event is a National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women .
This year is the 20th anniversary .
LÃ©pine , like Sodini , hated women and blamed them for his problems , so he killed them .
And they are n’t alone .
In fact , they sound a lot like that guy who used to post to the Debian mailing lists ( source ) :
Yea you ’ve become a developer … and have done nearly nothing except shill your feminist shit and try to turn debian into a woman ’s project ( you are succeeding , men are leaving debian because of you and your ilk , worthless bitch ) .
I pray that God takes you and all your supporters from this earth soon .
You are a developer because so many vocal men support feminism ( no matter how many divorces they suffer through ) .
You are not a developer on your own merit .
Those who are against you do not dare speak up because they know that anti-feminist men are thrown out of debian .
I am praying for your death and the death of your supporters .
What you have done to debian should not go unpunished , your dislike of men ( that chip can be seen from space ) and wish to raise women up to be “ strong and powerful ” and take men ’s work ( debian and other free software projects ) away from them should earn you a death sentance .
Debian cannot survive when men leave it .
I pray you find your way into a feminist unfriendly country one day .
God willing , you will die .
Happily the feminist - unfriendly countries are immigrating to you .
Remeber the netherlands ?
Feminists die there .
Since I gave my keynote at OSCON ( which mentioned the above in passing ) I ’ve had people say , “ Death threats ?
Really ?
Well , you ca n’t take trolls too seriously , ” and “ I ’m sure it ’s just an isolated incident . ”
I ’ve also had people ask me why we still need feminism — do n’t we have equality now ?
I ’ve had people say that attempts at making the open source community safe and welcome will “ ruin open source ” and that we ’re trying to impose a thought police on a culture that wants to be free — free to make death threats , I guess .
And at CLS , in a roundtable discussion on griefers and trolls , I asked whether anyone had ideas for how to deal with death threats online , and people just shrugged ; law enforcement does n’t take them seriously , and the only recommendation anyone could give was to put the mailing list or blog comments on moderation .
But what if you do n’t control the forum where the threats occur ?
George Sodini had his own blog .
Kathy Sierra ‘s attackers were posting on other blogs .
And why should it be our responsibility anyway ?
“ Just moderate your mailing list / blog comments ” sounds to me like “ if you walk home alone you ’re asking for it . ”
How did vile , murderous , misogyny come to be the responsibility of anyone except the perpetrator ?
I heard a great quote , which Google tells me comes from Gavin DeBecker ’s book , “ The Gift of Fear ” :
At core , men are afraid women will laugh at them , while at core , women are afraid men will kill them .
I know some people will roll their eyes at that and think it ’s overblown .
Others will probably say that living in a state of fear is counter - productive , and we should just tough up and ignore it if we want to eg.
take engineering classes , participate in free and open source software projects , or just go about our daily lives .
No .
The correct reaction to a death threat — whether specific or general — is fear .
The correct action for resolving that fear is to remove the death threats .
We need to come down like a ton of bricks on anyone making those threats , online or off .
And we need to stop pretending that people who say those kinds of scary - ass things are all “ harmless trolls ” .
If George Sodini ’s taught us nothing else , he ’s taught us that .
BEIRUT , Lebanon  A Russian - built Iranian passenger plane bound for Armenia from Tehran crashed and exploded in a fuel - laden fireball minutes after takeoff early Wednesday .
All 168 people aboard were killed , Iran ’s state news media said .
The airline crash is Iran ’s worst in six years , and it underscored the country ’s vulnerability to aviation disasters .
Iran has been unable to adequately maintain its aging fleet of American - built aircraft for 30 years because of an embargo after the Islamic Revolution , and has increasingly relied on aircraft from Russian manufacturers , which have their own troubled safety history .
The plane that crashed Wednesday , a Tupolev 154 leased by Caspian Airlines , based in Tehran , was bound for Yerevan , the Armenian capital , with 153 passengers and 15 crew members , and was loaded with fuel , Iranian news services said .
It went down in a farm field near Qazvin , a city about 75 miles from Tehran , said the Qazvin police chief , Hussein Behzadpour , in comments to Iran ’s English - language Press TV .
Witnesses quoted by Press TV and other Iranian news agencies said that the tail and at least one of the tail engines were on fire as the plane plummeted , and that it exploded in flames on impact , creating a crater 30 feet deep and scattering body parts and wreckage .

Television images from the scene showed smoking ruins and emergency workers rummaging through the wreckage , presumably looking for the “ black box ” flight recorders that would reveal the crew ’s conversations and the plane ’s speed , altitude and heading .
The spokesman for the Aviation Organization in Iran , Reza Jafarzadeh , said the plane , Flight 7908 , crashed 16 minutes after departing from Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran , according to Press TV .
Sirous Saberi , deputy governor of Qazvin Province , said the plane had a technical problem shortly after takeoff and was trying to return to the airport in Tehran , according to the Mehr News Agency in Iran .
Six Armenian citizens and two Georgian citizens were on the flight , and the rest were probably Iranians , The Associated Press reported , citing the deputy chairman of Armenia ’s civil aviation authority in Yerevan .
The passengers included eight members of Iran ’s national youth judo team , two coaches and a delegation chief , en route to train with the Armenian judo team and attend a competition in Hungary in August , the semiofficial Iranian Labor News Agency said .
The leader of the disaster management center in Iran ’s Health Ministry said that all aboard had been confirmed dead , state news agencies said .
It was the first fatal accident for Caspian Airlines , which was founded in 1992 .
The airline operates a fleet of six TU - 154 airliners , all dating from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s .

The aircraft that crashed Wednesday was built in 1986 and was leased to Caspian in 1998 .
It is believed to be owned by VARZ - 400 , a Russian aircraft maintenance and overhauling company , according to Ascend , an aviation industry consulting company based in London .
The crash was Iran ’s deadliest since February 2003 , when a Russian - built Ilyushin plane carrying 289 Iranian soldiers slammed into a mountain in southeast Iran moments before it was to land .
Many of Iran ’s deadliest air disasters have involved its fleet of Russian planes designed and built during Soviet times .
In 2006 , a TU - 154 operated by Iran Airtour burst into flames upon landing in Tehran , killing 29 of the 148 people aboard .
Airtour , affiliated with Iran ’s national carrier , also suffered a fatal accident in 2002 , when a Tupolev jet plowed into a mountainside , killing all 119 aboard .
Since entering service in 1971 , the TU - 154 has been in 54 crashes , resulting in the deaths of 2,602 passengers and 258 crew members , according to Ascend .
In 2005 , a Lockheed C- 130 operated by the Iranian military rammed into a housing complex shortly after takeoff from Mehrabad Airport in Tehran , killing 115 people , including 21 on the ground .
Caspian Airlines passed an operational safety audit in 2007 by the International Air Transport Association .
The airline is scheduled to seek renewal of its safety certification by the end of November .

Moonbow and Rainbows Over Patagonia
Credit & Copyright : Stéphane Guisard ( Los Cielos de Chile )
Explanation :
Have you ever seen a moonbow ?
Just as rainbows are lit by the Sun , moonbows are lit by the Moon .
Since the Sun is so much brighter than the Moon , sunlit rainbows are much brighter and more commonly seen than moonbows .
The above movie captures not only a moonbow , but several rainbows , moving clouds , and the starry sky visible in 2009 February over Patagonia in Chile .
The slight movement of the rainbows is due to the changing sky position of the Sun .
Since moonlight is itself reflected sunlight , the colors are nearly the same .
Both rainbows and moonbows are created by light being scattered inside small water droplets , typically from a nearby rainfall .
The raindrops each act as miniature prisms , together creating the picturesque spectrum of colors seen .
Surprisingly , Microsoft , which has never been known for running cool ads , has landed some punches .
Shortly after the Microsoft campaign started , Apple unleashed commercials that mocked its competitor as spending money on advertising when it should have been fixing Vista , its much - maligned operating system .
“ It got Apple ’s attention , did n’t it ? ” says Robert X. Cringely , host of PBS ’s NerdTV .
FOR years , Microsoft was the stodgy market leader .
It sold 90 percent of the world ’s operating system software , and generally left the advertising to Dell , H.P. and other hardware makers who licensed Windows .
The only time Microsoft hawked its most recognizable brand on television was when the latest version of the software hit the shelves .
Then the company flooded the airwaves with commercials full of loud music and swirling imagery saying that the new version of Windows is out  and that it ’s awesome !
Apple is the classic smaller insurgent .
Its share for desktops and laptops in the United States is just over 8 percent .
Every time Apple grabs another point of market share from Microsoft ’s partners , its stock price climbs .
And one way that Apple has tried to gain share is by running clever ads that ridicule everything Microsoft stands for .

There ’s no better example than “ Get a Mac , ” unveiled three years ago by Apple ’s longtime ad agency , TBWA / Chiat / Day .
No technology company would choose Mr. Hodgman ’s character , PC , to personify its brand .
He reeks of the past .
He boasts of using his desktop to make spreadsheets and ridicules his more youthful friend , Mac , played by the actor Justin Long , for using his desktop for “ juvenile ” pursuits like blogging and movie making  even through it ’s clear that PC would like to be in on the fun .
He just ca n’t get his Windows computer to do his bidding .
Like a classic sitcom character  think Ralph Kramden of “ The Honeymooners ”  PC is always dreaming up ill - advised schemes intended to show his superiority .
He ’s thwarted by viruses , system crashes and other problems more associated with Windows - based computers than Apple ’s products  and , recently , he has become a hapless apologist for Vista .
Mr. Long ’s character smugly watches his friend ’s pratfalls , glancing at the audience with raised eyebrows as if to say , “ If only this poor guy would buy a Mac. . . . ”
PC will never learn .
Not as long as he keeps driving sales for Apple .
Since 2006 , the year that he first appeared in all his pasty - faced glory , Apple ’s share of the computer desktop market in the United States has more than doubled , according to IDC , the technology industry research firm .
Its stock price , meanwhile , has risen 142 percent since May 2006 , while Microsoft ’s has barely budged .
Yes , the astonishing success of newer Apple products like the iPod and the iPhone has helped .
But the PC character should also take a bow .
( Representatives of Apple and TBWA / Chiat / Day declined to be interviewed for this article . )
... is deepening .
Things in California are getting worse .
The time has come for all of us to take a stand – to make an all - out effort to reclaim the California we love .
Since February , I ’ve been going non -stop listening to people , sharing ideas , thinking hard about the problems Californians face .
I ’ve visited dozens of towns in every corner of our state and participated in more than 100 events .
I ’ve also spent a lot of time assembling a first - rate campaign team … a team committed not just to my victory , but also to seeing Republicans win across the state .
In the months ahead , I will be reaching out to many more voters , visiting more towns , and working with Republican candidates to organize and energize our party .
Republicans have a lot of work to do .
We need to organize like never before .
Last week I committed $ 250,000 to fund our Party ’s voter registration efforts .
We need to do all we can to attract more people to our party , and we want them to stay .
I believe in my heart that we can win next November … and with all that ’s riding on next year ’s elections , Republicans must win .
Now , during the past 8 months , as I ’ve traveled the state , I ’ve consistently heard one thing …
Californians in every walk of life have told me again and again that they desperately want California to be great again .
There ’s a profound hunger for change , for leadership , and for authenticity .
Californians want to trust their leaders again .
They want to be told the truth .
And most of all , they want to live in a place of opportunity and optimism , not a place of small dreams and scaled - down ambitions .
Californians love their state , but they understand that their home is in deep trouble .
They know because they confront the problems every day .
More than 2.2 million Californians are out of work .
Our unemployment rate is at a record - shattering 12.2 percent .
And in some parts of the state , things are much worse .
In parts of Riverside County , unemployment hovers around 30 percent .
Think about what that means …
Think about the heartbreaking conversations that have taken place : Employers telling long - time employees they must go …
Husbands telling wives that they ca n’t afford their homes …
Parents telling children their college dreams are over .
For Californians who still have jobs , taxes and fees are eating into their lives .
Every year we pay more to sustain an out - of - control state bureaucracy …
A wasteful and arrogant bureaucracy , out of touch with the needs of Californians and unwilling to give an inch even in the toughest of economic times .
When I was with you in February , I shared a statistic that made you gasp .
It bears repeating .
During the past decade , California ’s government spending has grown by 80 percent .
Do you feel like our state is 80 percent better ? …
Of course it is n’t … And here ’s another startling fact : Since 2004 , state government has added more than 40,000 employees .
This year , at a time of deep recession , when local governments , families and businesses across our state are cutting back , the government of California has actually hired 10,000 more bureaucrats !
Is it any wonder that Californians are fed up ?
And if unemployment , taxes , fees , and out - of - control spending do n’t ruin your day , there ’s a good chance you ’re very worried about your children ’s education .
Too many Californians send their children to broken public schools .
Schools where our best teachers lose faith and where union rules give our worst teachers a free pass .
Schools where our children fail to learn and where the state ’s future diminishes a little more each day .
Is it any wonder that Californians are fed up ? …
Of course not …Californians have every right to be in a foul mood .
Cynicism towards everything Sacramento – towards the politics and the politicians – runs deep .
People are tired of the lies .
They ’re angry at the lack of values and commitment .
And they ’re worried that if we do n’t do something soon , it may just be too late .
I understand those feelings .
I ’ve lived in California for nearly 28 years .
My sons were born here .
I built a business here .
My husband became a doctor here .
I care deeply about this state .
And I refuse to accept that California cannot be better than it is today .
I refuse to let California fail .
But let ’s be honest with one another , you ’ve all heard this before …
So today more than ever , you want to elect a governor who lives up to your ideals .
Who shares your core values .
Who may not agree with you on every issue , but is consistent and principled in his or her goals and beliefs .
You want to know with certainty what you ’re getting in a candidate .
And you ’re right to want to know that .
Well , all I can say is this : you will always know where I stand …
I will not repackage myself just to win this election or stay in office …
I happen to think that if I tell you who I am , what I ’ve accomplished , what I believe , and what I plan to do , you will decide for yourselves whether I should have your vote .
So let me briefly take you down that path .
For those of you who know me , you know that first I ’m a mom .
I have two older boys , one ’s in college and one just graduated .
And I ’m happy to report that the college graduate has actually found a job and is paying his own rent !
My husband , , is a neurosurgeon at Stanford .
We ’ve been married 29 years .
And after all those years , Griff ’s still the love of my life , my inspiration … without him I would n’t be standing here today .
I ’ve spent the past 30 years in business .
I ’ve worked for such great companies as Procter & Gamble , Disney , Hasbro , Stride Rite , and FTD .
I ’ve had to be confident , efficient , focused , and most importantly , accountable .
During the past 10 years , I was the President and CEO of eBay .
I built eBay from a 30 - person , $ 4 million dollar company , to a company of 15,000 employees and nearly $ 8 billion in revenues .
eBay was the culmination of my business career .
It ’s the place where I tested my years of experience and honed my leadership skills .
But it was also much more .
At eBay , I helped millions of people create small businesses on the marketplace .
I became intimately familiar with the challenges small businesses face in this country .
I came to understand that job creation is dependent on a fragile mix of circumstances – circumstances all too often disrupted by the intrusive hand of government .
And I came to love the inspired individual – a person set free to pursue his or her dreams by an open marketplace and a free society .
Government does not create wealth in this country – inspired individuals create wealth .
Helping those people succeed on eBay was the privilege of a lifetime .
My interest in public service blossomed during my years at eBay .
It ’s an interest that was fueled by my parents , both of whom served their country in the Pacific during World War II .
And it ’s an interest that was inspired by my long friendships withandI am running for governor because California simply cannot continue on the path it ’s on .
And I want your support because I believe I ’m uniquely qualified to help turn our state around .
California is the world ’s 8th largest economy .
It contributes 13 percent of our nation ’s gross domestic product .
America ’s future is deeply woven into the fabric of California .
And I believe that the outcome of our struggles to govern our state and fix our problems will define America ’s destiny in the 21st century .
Now , we can continue down the path we ’re on :
We can bury our heads and just accept the inevitability of reckless government spending …
We can keep sucking up tax increase after tax increase …
We can pretend that it ’s not a big deal when a neighbor we know or a business we depend on moves to another state …
We can ignore the schools , especially if our kids are not in them …
And we can blame the whole mess on the politicians and move on .
But if we do that – if we continue down the ugly path we ’re on – our children and grandchildren will inherit a terribly diminished state …
California will become a symbol not for what ’s possible , but for the missed potential of a great people .
I want to take a different approach .
I ’m a big believer in focus .
And I believe the next governor has to focus on three things to save our state .
She must create jobs , cut spending and fix our broken education system .
We could spend hours talking about each of these areas .
Instead , what I ’ll do now is share the main parts of what I propose to do .
I invite you to visit my website at MegWhitman.com for more details .
Since earlier this year , I ’ve been crystal clear that if I ’m elected I ’ll look at everything through the lens of job creation .
California simply cannot begin to solve its problems until our people are working again .
We must put jobs first .
My number one goal as governor will be to help the private sector create at least 2 million jobs for Californians by 2015 .
This is the amount we need if we ’re going to replace the jobs our economy has stopped producing or is losing to neighboring states .
It ’s the target we need to hit if we ’re going to restore prosperity .
The way you create jobs is by lowering taxes and eliminating redundant and poorly conceived regulations that stifle job growth .
You have to create an environment where businesses can afford to stay in California and create more jobs .
As governor , I ’ll cut taxes to create jobs .
…
Specifically , I ’ll cut taxes for job - creating businesses of every size .
I ’ll implement targeted tax relief , such as a sales tax exemption for manufacturing and R&D equipment , to help rebuild manufacturing in California .
I ’ll expand research and development tax credits .
And I ’ll establish tax incentives and credits for companies that train and hire displaced workers .
I ’ll also establish a cabinet - level position in my administration dedicated to private sector job growth .
Times have changed and California has to compete for jobs .
When I was CEO of eBay , I frequently got calls from governors around the country trying to get me to move business to their states .
If I ’m elected , you can bet I ’ll be burning up the phone lines to businesses in Nevada , Utah , Colorado , Texas , and beyond .
If the burden of taxes and fees in California do n’t kill off your business , do n’t worry , regulations will .
When I began to tour the state , I expected to get an earful about taxes , and I have .
But the passion I ’ve seen around government regulation , especially from small business owners , has been just as strong , and with good reason .
For the sake of one cause or another , California has piled mountains of bad regulations on business .
We do a lousy job of anticipating the unintended consequences of all those rules .
Half the time , we do n’t even bother to check whether existing laws address a particular problem .
You see , bureaucrats rarely have the desire to think things through , and politicians rarely have the courage .
A study released this past Monday found that the total cost of regulation to the state is $ 493 billion .
And that cost results in an employment loss of 3.8 million jobs , which is about a tenth of the state ’s population .
California ’s regulatory environment is a proven job killer .
So on my first day in office , I ’ll issue a moratorium on all new regulations until our economy has begun to recover .
I ’ll initiate a complete review of the state ’s existing regulations to root out and eliminate the rules that do n’t make sense or are outdated .
And I ’ll appoint people who share my view on regulations and work to make sure there ’s a balance between the right rules and a healthy economy .
And if I ’m elected , I ’ll take a careful , thoughtful approach to environmental regulation .
The environment of California is important to all of us .
California ’s natural beauty is one of the reasons I love this state so much .
And I worry that man has not always been a careful steward of our state ’s natural resources .
As governor , I will work hard to protect the environment of our state .
But , the needs of our environment have to be balanced with the needs of our people and our economy .
We have unilaterally implemented too many over - reaching environmental regulations – laws that have left us at an economic disadvantage .
AB - 32 is a great example .
Governor Schwarzenegger signed this legislation into law in 2006 .
It ’s goal is admirable – to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions .
But the consequences to the economy have been ignored .
A recent study estimates that AB - 32 could cost the state more than a million jobs and implementation costs could exceed $ 100 billion .
That ’s devastating .
As governor , I will place a one - year moratorium on AB - 32 by executive order , until we fully understand the law ’s impact on our troubled economy .
To be clear , I ’m not talking about repealing AB - 32 .
Instead , I want to exercise the prudent option in the law that allows the governor to push back implementation when there is a threat of significant economic harm .
… My bottom line is simply this : I love California ’s environment .
But I reject environmental policies that do little for the environment and wreak havoc on California ’s economic future …
Liberal environmentalists may not like jobs or people , but California needs both .
Now , let ’s talk about spending .
And honestly , when I talk about spending , I just get mad …
It ’s really very simple .
California cannot spend more money than it takes in .
Why is it so hard for politicians to come to terms with this concept ?
Families get it .
Businesses get it .
We all get it .
Our problem is not revenue .
We collect enough taxes to run this state and then some .
Our problem – our addiction – is spending .
And it ’s an addiction that ’s killing us .
It ’s killing our state and it ’s killing our country .
Simply put , Californians can no longer afford the government they have .
The Democrats and special interests can try to convince us that our taxes are reasonable , and that we should all just be grateful to live here .
But people know better .
Californians are tapped out .
They have no more money to give to Sacramento or Washington for that matter .
And Californians are mad .
They do n’t have the luxury of getting a pay raise whenever they need one .
So why does California ’s government get to raise our taxes whenever they want more money ?
We need a governor with a spine of steel who will look at the books , decide on priorities , deal with the legislature , and take the heat for what we cut and what we fund .
If being popular and getting re-elected is your goal , then being governor is a really bad job - person fit .
As I committed to in February , if elected I will identify and implement at least $ 15 billion in permanent spending cuts from the state budget .
I ’ll eliminate redundant and underperforming government agencies and commissions .
And I will reduce the state workforce by at least 40,000 employees .
That reduction that will reset the workforce to 2004 - 2005 levels and save the state a projected $ 3.3 billion annually .
But cutting simply is n’t enough .
We have to get our heads around the concept that mismanagement and waste in government is sapping precious dollars away from the things we want to do .
Did you know that almost every state worker receives a merit pay increase every year until they reach the top of their pay scale ?
How can that be ?
Are your pay raises guaranteed ?
With automatic pay increases every year , there is no incentive for state workers to perform , and managing performance is nearly impossible .
As governor , I ’ll reform government management .
I ’ll crack down on the overly generous benefits of state employees .
I ’m deadly serious about rooting out the waste of tax dollars .
And I am serious about the need for California ’s government to finally enter the 21st century .
We need to systematically apply technology to our government agencies , so we can realize the same savings and efficiencies that have helped our economy .
And right now , government is not being held accountable for much of what it does .
I want to start measuring government performance .
I will create meaningful performance goals for departments and publish the results on line .
I want our government – and your governor – to be held responsible for delivering the services Californians are paying for .
Education must be the third priority for our next governor .
And again , the issue here is very simple .
If we do n’t rededicate ourselves to education with the same energy Americans have applied to going to the moon and fighting wars , the results will be profound .
We will lose our ability to innovate and create the next generation of companies and jobs in California – to create the next eBay , the next Google , the next Genentech .
We will permanently erode California ’s prosperity .
We must start producing more and better - qualified high school graduates – graduates ready for advanced studies or prepared for strong vocational careers .
More than fifty percent of our state budget , or about $ 50 billion , goes to education , and we are still failing our children .
We ’re ranked at the bottom in the quality of our K - 12 education .
In two of the most important skills for elementary school education – math and reading – our state ranks 47th and 48th .
In science , we rank 43rd .
The issue is not money .
There ’s plenty of money .
It ’s how the money is spent .
If you send me to Sacramento , I ’ll put more control in the hands of local educators and parents …
I ’ll grade our schools A through F and put the results on line so parents can easily determine how their schools are doing …
I ’ll give parents the ability to move their children out of failing schools …
And I ’ll remove the state cap on the number of charter schools so we can have more competition in our education system .
I will reform our spending programs so that the people closest to our children – teachers and principles – can make spending decisions that make sense .
Right now , too much is decided by bureaucrats in Sacramento .
Finally , I ’ll reward outstanding teachers and those in key areas such as math and science .
My goal is nothing short of bringing California ’s schools back to number one .
It ’s an audacious goal .
It wo n’t be easy and it wo n’t happen right away .
But it has to happen during the next decade .
The prosperity of California and the strength of our nation depend on our success at reclaiming educational excellence .
I hope you ’ve noticed that the theme of my campaign is A New California .
And I ’ve been pleasantly surprised by how well Californians seem like the phrase .
After campaign events , people will come up to me just to talk about what A New California means to them .
And this has been really interesting .
For most of the older Californians I meet , A New California means the California they grew up in … the idealized California of the past … where jobs were plentiful , schools were strong , the roads were new , taxes were under control , and California seemed to have its act together .
Our state was the envy of the world .
Our leaders seemed honest and bold .
Things were better , safer , less confused and more optimistic .
For younger people , the phrase speaks to the future .
They talk about how they want things to be .
And guess what ?
They talk about honest and bold leaders .
Plentiful jobs .
They want strong schools and better roads .
They want to be able to afford an education .
They love technology and its ability to change things .
They want things to be better and safer .
They want to be optimistic .
Californians young and old want the same thing – they want California to be great again .
They want their communities to be strong and safe .
They want jobs that pay well and give them a chance to enjoy the American dream .
They want government in its proper place .
Most of all , Californians want to know that if they work hard and play by the rules , really terrific things will happen .
That the future can always be better than today , and that California ’s best days are ahead , not behind .
I ’m asking for your help .
I need your support .
Creating A New California is a daunting challenge .
Too much has gone wrong for too long .
But there ’s so much than can go right .
For generations , Californians have shown that they ’re wired for innovation , courage , and compassion .
Our struggles have been the struggles of our nation , and California ’s success has defined the American experience .
If today ’s generation can come together to uproot old habits , old ways of thinking , and old ways of doing business , then we will change the world .
I look forward to building A New California with you .
Thank you so much for having me here today .

The Mad Hatter told Alice that " words mean what you want them to mean . "
He would have been at home in the European Union , where " no " means " yes " and political propaganda is passed off as information .
If Ireland votes No to the Lisbon Treaty , the EU will continue and Ireland will be part of it , but if they vote Yes the Irish will find they have even less leverage in Europe than today .
In the course of the second referendum campaign in Ireland some extraordinary claims have been made about the economic consequences of voting No : it would frighten investors , cost jobs and condemn Ireland to economic isolation ; while a Yes vote , to quote the Taoiseach , is the " critical first step on the path to recovery . "
“ Chocolate Experts Hate Mast Brothers . ”
That stark headline from a Slate article last spring drew attention to a fact not widely known outside the fine chocolate world .
Chocolate judges , authors , and specialty shop owners hold the Mast Brothers in low regard , Megan Giller reported , because the quality of their chocolate comes up short .
While that is true , so far as it goes , it does not explain the particular disdain Mast Brothers receives .
After all , some other bean - to - bar chocolate makers produce chocolate of equal or lower caliber .
Looking beyond the quality issue , the Masts are not the only chocolate makers to wear beards , cloak themselves in hipster affectation , fixate on packaging , or garner press that ’s out of proportion with their merit .
The real reason is something else entirely .
Let ’s turn the spotlight towards the elephant in the room .
The fine chocolate community scorns the Mast Brothers because they are thought to have launched their business with a fundamental fraud : that of pretending to be a bean - to - bar chocolate company .

Former CIA agent and known Pentagon propagandist told Fox ’s Brian Kilmeade that member of an ACLU initiative to defend Guantanamo Bay detainees that were torture should be jailed Thursday .
The John Adams Project is defense teams assembled by the ACLU to assist detainees .
Photos of CIA agents were shown to detainee to help determine which agents were complicit in illegal torture .

“ [ The DOJ ] should move on these people so fast .
Anyone who ’s part of this , the John Adams Project , those that came up with this idea , they should dismantle the program and put these people in jail , ” said Simmons .
Appearing on the Glenn Beck show , Fox News legal analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano speculated that the defense team had not broken any laws .
“ If , for example , they got the names of CIA agents by luck or gossip or from public sources and then went out and took photos of those people in public places like Walmart or a restaurant , as offensive as that may be , it is not illegal , ” he said .
Napolitano continued , “ If it was done not by an officer of the United States or done for some purpose other than harming the CIA agent , like , ‘ Did you ever see this man when you were in prison in egypt ? ’
That is not a crime . ”
Simmons falsely suggested that the Justice Department would “ stand idly by and allow this illegal outing of potentially covert CIA operatives . ”
The Justice Department has initiated an investigation of the John Adams Project , according the The New York Times .
The Justice Department is investigating whether three military defense lawyers for detainees at the Guantánamo prison illegally showed their clients photographs of C.I.A. interrogators , two leaders of civilian legal groups that are working with the defense lawyers said Thursday .
Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation approached the three lawyers with the Judge Advocate General ’s Corps nearly two weeks ago , said Anthony D. Romero , president of the American Civil Liberties Union , which is helping the military lawyers defend the detainees in military commissions .
The agents informed the uniformed lawyers of their right to remain silent , and then questioned them about whether they showed their clients pictures of Central Intelligence Agency officials — possibly including covert agents — that came from an “ independent investigation ” by the A.C.L.U. and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , Mr. Romero said .
“ This is a misguided effort , a diversion of investigative resources , and blatant effort to shut down the zealous defense of defendants at these sham proceedings at Guantánamo , ” he said .

A woman who claimed she was beaten and sexually assaulted by a diplomat and his royal wife , who brought her to London , has spoken of her fear of reprisals .
The 23 - year - old , who has been granted refugee status , is owed more than £ 20,000 following an employment tribunal order , but has been unable to get justice as the couple have returned home .
The woman said she had been treated as little more than a slave after having been promised paid work as a nanny , a room in the couple 's magnificent house and days off to enjoy London .
Instead , she alleged , they violently beat her , sexually assaulted her and locked her away to work 19 - hour days for no pay .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The couple , whose identity is known to the IoS , cannot be named as the victim fears reprisals .
She said that they had had her followed after she escaped from their home last year , and have subjected her and her family to death threats .
Her tale of modern slavery is one that is all too familiar in Britain .
There are more than 20,000 migrant domestic workers estimated to be in the UK .
Those working for diplomats are particularly vulnerable because visa restrictions prevent them changing employer .
Last year 189 visas were issued to domestic workers accompanying diplomats , and every year some of these will be subjected to abuse .
Now campaigners are demanding a change in the law .
Although the woman reported her allegations to police , they advised her that the couple could not be prosecuted because of their diplomatic status .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) contacted their embassy but were told that since they have returned to their home country they cannot be chased for the compensation payments ordered in January .
The domestic worker was 21 when she came to Britain .
" From the first night I knew something was wrong , " she said .
" I was made to share a room with the diplomat and he came into my bed and touched me all over .
" I was so scared but I spoke no English and had no money and no phone .
I was trapped .
I was paid nothing , never allowed to leave the house , and only given scraps to eat .
" They made me get up at six to cook , clean and care for them and their children ; I did n't get to bed until one in the morning .
They treated me like dirt , throwing things at me , shouting at me and hitting me ...
I hand - washed all their clothes until my hands were inflamed .
If I did n't do what they asked they would beat me and smash my head against the wall .
Every time I asked to go home they threatened me .
They said they would destroy my passport and harm my family .
I was terrified because I knew they could ; they have power in my country . "
Kalayaan , a charity dedicated to helping migrant domestic workers , says her case illustrates the terrible abuses that diplomats can get away with in this country .
Jenny Moss , a community advocate for the charity , said : " To protect diplomats ' domestic workers it is imperative that the UK Government give them the basic right to change employer , so they can flee abuse and access protection and justice without fear of deportation .
The power that employers can wield over vulnerable individuals is akin to bonded labour and leads to human trafficking . "
An FCO spokesman said : " We expect foreign missions and diplomats to meet their obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 , to respect the laws and regulations of the UK , including employment rules . "
For a few mad years , Irish consumers and their money were easily parted .
But now that the boom is over it is finally dawning on us that Rip - Off Ireland was a fact , not a slogan
EVERYONE HAS their favourite tale of Rip - off Ireland .
Mine dates back a few years , when I called in to a well - known shop that installs kitchens just as an expensively - dressed woman flounced out .
The owner was shaking his head : “ I tried to put her off , because I ’m run off my feet , but she insisted .
I quoted her € 37,000 to get rid of her .
The kitchen costs € 20,000 .
But she said : ‘ when can you start ? ’ ” .
But Rip - off came in all shapes and sizes in the bad old days , from sheds sold in Dublin 4 for six - figure sums to the 50 cent some shops charged for an extra slice of bread with your soup or a second biscuit with your coffee .
A supermarket owner recently complained to me how , to satisfy suppliers , he had to sell well - known brands in his stores at twice the price charged in the UK : “ You ’d have the same packaging and the same soup from the same factory in France .
The only difference was that the British pack was slightly bigger , and the Irish product was twice the price . ”
Back in the boom days , none of this mattered .
Fools and their money were easily parted , but there was always more credit on tap .
Property investment was a form of pyramid selling , and a new sucker was sure to turn up to take that dismal two - bed in Ballygoupwards or Bucharest off your hands at a hefty premium .
“ The credit card was king , ” says Niall McHenry of consumer website saveafewbob.ie .
“ The buy now , pay later mentality was rife .
There was a ‘ wealth effect ’ with people spending based on the perceived value of their assets . ”
But not any more .
Shoppers are shopping around – finally .
Cosy business relationships have splintered .
The banks have rolled down the shutters on feckless credit .
Thrift is the new paragon .
And all this happened before the recession turned money - saving into a necessity rather than a sport .
“ People are no longer blasé about accumulating debt .
What ’s more , their wealth has diminished .
The feeling now among consumers is that we are facing into a few years of pain .
Many will be waiting years to get back to breakeven , ” says McHenry .
Now we revel in our value - consciousness .
We outdo each other with stories of bargain deals .
We haggle as we never did – apart from in a Moroccan carpet factory .
We try out goods in shops , then purchase them on the internet .
As consumers , we do n’t get angry anymore – we get even .
McHenry talks of a new paradigm among consumers expecting to get value for money .
“ This mindset is not a fad .
It is here to stay .
For a whole generation of consumers mostly in their 20s , 30s and 40s , the repair job on their mortgage , investment portfolio or pension fund is going to take a number of years .
They will be on a constant look - out for good value or trying to secure a good deal . ”
That ’s why 4 per cent of the Irish grocery market moved North , until retailers in the Republic finally got the message earlier this year .
Or why more than 200,000 electricity customers have switched from the ESB to Bord Gáis or Airtricity in search of handsome savings .
THE JOURNEY FROMRip - off Ireland to Cheap Ireland is a long one and it ’s by no means finished .
In 2005 , the Consumer Strategy Report ( CSR ) commissioned by the government found that Ireland was the dearest country in the euro zone for food , soft drinks , tobacco and rent , and the second most expensive for alcohol , restaurants and pubs .
Only this week , a CSO report said Ireland had the second - highest prices in Europe , at over 25 per cent more than the EU average .
The CSO figures , however , dated from 2007 and 2008 , before the new economic realities asserted themselves and consumers took matters into their own hands .
High prices were only part of the story .
Massive consumer inertia presented retailers with huge captive audiences , regardless of the price or quality of their offerings .
The public wanted what the public got because they did n’t know any better .
The majority of consumers found the area of consumer rights both complex and confusing , according to the CSR report .
Consumers ’ refusal to vote with their feet was intimately tied in with weak regulation .
Consumer protection equated to a few prosecutions against retailers for overcharging , or for cheating on weights and measures , while the big picture was lost .
Consumer groups , run on a shoestring , were mere minnows against the power of giant corporations .
The other reasons for persistently high prices were well known ; they included a lack of competition in many sectors , overly cosy relations between supposed business rivals and between government and business , and the booming economy , which taught us all the price of everything and the value of nothing .
Yet in spite of the grumbling about the patent unfairness of it all , nothing changed .
Ireland regularly topped the charts internationally for cost of living .
Even our best - known exports , such as Guinness or Kerrygold , cost less abroad than in their country of manufacture .
But then , some years ago , things did start to change .
Slowly , at first .
The Ryanair generation started asking why it cost more to take a taxi to the airport than it did to fly to the Continent .
Eddie Hobbs stoked the latent ire of consumers on rabble - rousing television programmes .
Towns around the country started agitating for discount supermarkets .
The first of the foreign invaders arrived in banking ( Royal Bank of Scotland , Halifax ) and retailing ( Aldi , Lidl ) to shake up domestic markets .
Near - continuous sales became the norm as department stores and other retailers switched over to a more American style of business .
The internet opened up endless new possibilities and new choices for consumers .
Growing consumer power led the government to establish the National Consumer Agency ( NCA ) in 2007 , which was given a raft of new powers to investigate business malpractice .
The NCA has had a mixed time , but its shopping surveys undoubtedly concentrated the minds of consumers , retailers and Government on the Rip - off prices charged for groceries in the Republic .
The internet drove the new zeitgeist , by providing shoppers with alternatives to over - priced high street stores , a mine of comparative information and a growing number of consumer - oriented websites .
The excesses of Rip - off Ireland were documented in loving detail on forums such as askaboutmoney.com and boards.ie , and afficionados set up specialist sites devoted to “ cheap eats ” , “ Lidl treats ” and the like .
Diarmuid MacShane set up ValueIreland.com six years ago , at the height of the Rip - off Ireland phenomenon : “ At the time , there was only one other consumer focused website around – the boards .
ie Rip Off Ireland forum – still in place today .
“ In the past six years , many other websites with a consumer focus have come and gone but in the past two years particularly there has been a marked increase in the number of Irish consumer - focused websites – I count upwards of 78 different sites today .
This is brilliant for Irish consumers – the more information they have to hand , the better they can decide how , where and when to spend their money wisely . ”
Niall McHenry is a more recent entrant to the internet , and his venture is driven to some extent by necessity .
“ I lost my job 12 months ago , as did a number of my friends and colleagues .
Other family members and friends had their hours reduced and their salaries pared back .
Everyone was cutting back on their spending and becoming more conscious about obtaining value for money .
I felt there was no website offering ‘ value conscious ’ consumers the right mix of research , editorial and deals . ”
The traditional media has also responded to the new sentiment , with the appointment of consumer correspondents in many newspapers and the creation of specialist columns , such as the popular PriceWatch column in this newspaper .
It was n’t just that we changed our habits ; our mindsets changed too .
There were no red faces in the queue of shoppers driving into Sainsburys in Newry , in spite of suggestions in some quarters that cross-Border shopping was unpatriotic .
Even comfortable middle - class shoppers started boasting about the value they found in German discount stores .
( This week , I was invited to a dinner during which the host proudly announced that everything used in the meal had been bought in Lidl . )
What started as a trickle of change became a dam - burst in the past year .
Homeware and clothing prices tumbled as outlets discounted heavily ; mark - downs of up to 70 per cent were common during the January sales .
A price war broke out among the big supermarkets , which have cut food prices by about 20 per cent since the start of the year .
Increased competition in the electricity and phone markets encouraged consumers to switch in greater numbers than ever before .
Some parts of society have proved more resistant to change .
The cost of education and medical services is actually going up , this week ’s CSO figures show .
Insurance companies are pushing up premiums even though accident rates have fallen .
It now costs up to €60 for a 10 - minute appointment with a GP , even when the purpose of the consultation might only be to obtain a prescription or a referral .
Last month , a survey by the Consumers ’ Association of Ireland found that the cost of services such as dentistry and plumbing were on average 30 per cent higher in Dublin than in Belfast .
These figures appear to bear out the recent assertion by the Tánaiste , Mary Coughlan , that some sectors had yet to feel the “ chill winds of economic reality ” – she singled out “ engineers , architects , the legal profession , dentists and others ” – by showing how they intended to reduce fees and charges .
Not surprisingly , the professions took umbrage .
Architects pointed out that half of their number are currently unemployed , and engineers were similarly appalled .
“ The Tánaiste was mistaken ; we ’re facing an arctic gale , not a chill wind , ” says Ken Murphy , secretary general of the Law Society .
“ All the evidence is that there is significant downward pressure on solicitors ’ fees . ”
Even some food staples have resisted the downward trend in prices ; lamb , bread , milk and butter have all increased over the past two years , the CSO figures show .
“ The figures show that for people on the margins , the cost of some of these basic items has n’t changed a lot , ” says Lorraine Mulligan , a policy analyst with Siptu .
The bulk of recent deflation is accounted for by reductions in mortgage rate interest , which obviously benefits only homeowners .
NOW THAT WE’REall so value - conscious , are we better off ?
The astute shopper probably is ; these days , every time I pick up a tub of infant formula for € 8.50 or so , I marvel at the savings before asking how it was that I paid € 15 for the same product for years in the bad old days .
But as Mulligan points out , there can be a major downside to the hunt for ever lower prices .
“ It ’s all very well to get cheaper produce , but you also have to think about employment and local jobs . ”
In the retail sector alone , economist Jim Power has claimed 100,000 jobs could go if the main supermarkets switch to sourcing cheaper products from abroad rather than buying closer to home .
Food scientist Prof Pat Wall of UCD has warned of the dangers of a “ race to the bottom ” in terms of price on the quality of the food we eat .
The demand for ever - cheaper chicken , for example , may push producers to cut corners on food safety and animal welfare to meet the voracious demands of retailers .
And while consumers may welcome ever falling prices of clothes , concerns have been raised on many occasions about the conditions under which workers in developing countries operate to produce them .
“ Whether it ’s Irish farmers or garment workers in the developing world , you have to pay the people involved a fair price as well as taking a close look at the margins being charged at the retail end , ” Mulligan says .
Lower prices are also the result , in many cases , of lower wages .
Pay cuts of 5 - 10 per cent have been implemented in many private sector companies , and longer working weeks are the norm .
So while there may be bargains out there , we ’ll have less time and less money to avail of them .
However , thrift and the search for value is now a necessity , not an option .
As McHenry remarks , “ nobody is ashamed to look for a good deal because we are all in this together .
Not just those who have been unfortunate enough to have lost their jobs . ”
5 HAVE A PROUD AND HAPPY JUNETEENTH !

General Order Number 3
One of General Granger ’s first orders of business was to read to the people of Texas , General Order Number 3 which began most significantly with : " The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States , all slaves are free .
This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves , and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer . "
The celebrations that followed the reading of the proclamation by General Gordon Granger began a tradition that has lasted for one hundred and fifty five years , and today is hosted in cities across America and beyond .

As our funeral procession passed near Wichita State University in Wichita , KS , a parade was taking place .
The parade stopped to let us pass , and the men and women on horseback removed their cowboy hats and placed them over their hearts .
It was the first time that day we laughed - Grams would have loved that she stopped a parade .
What those men and women did not know is my Grams was a First Lieutenant in the Army - she served during WWII as a psychiatric nurse .
She lived an amazing life after that , with God at the helm .
I learned today that the parade that day by WSU was the Juneteenth Parade .
That the men and women so selflessly stopped to allow our funeral procession to move past has remained in our family 's hearts and minds all these years .
We can not thank you enough for your kindness .
You are forever a part of our family 's history .

There has been , it seems , something of a fuss over the announcement from Valve that they ’re releasing a sequel to Left 4 Dead this November .
The main point of contention has been that many were expecting more new content to be added to the original game , rather than appearing in the form of a full price sequel .
This was underlined when an article on VideoGamer was rediscovered in which Valve boss Gabe Newell stated , “ So we ’ll do the same thing with Left 4 Dead where we ’ll have the initial release and then we ’ll release more movies , more characters , more weapons , unlockables , achievements , because that ’s the way you continue to grow a community over time . ”
We spoke to Valve ’s VP of marketing , Doug Lombardi , to ask him about the player response .
He talks to us about the reasons why L4D2 is a full sequel , why gamers should wait to find out more about the game before making up their minds , and how there are definitely still plans for the original Left 4 Dead .
RPS : The main point of contention has been that a while back there was a statement from Gabe Newell given to VideoGamer in which he said there were plans to add more characters , unlockables , weapons and achievements to the original Left 4 Dead .
Doug Lombardi :
So , we ’ve made a number of releases on the PC , and we made a pretty big release on the 360 in terms of the DLC , and we were able to get out for free which I thought would pretty cool , and it was not an easy thing to pull off .
Beyond that , we plan to continue updating Left 4 Dead .
We ’re not done with that title , it ’s not over .
The SDK stuff just came out .
I think we mentioned to RPS that if you ’re using the SDK and making maps for it , those will work for L4D2 as well .
We are trying to keep the community together – we ’re going to be doing more stuff about keeping the community together as we get closer to launch .
I think the short answer is : trust us a little bit .
We ’ve been pretty good over the years , even with L4D going back just a few months , about supporting games post - launch .
Gabe ’s always talking about providing entertainment as a service – it ’s not about making a game any more .
That ’s one point of it .
The other point is , we did n’t sit down and say , “ We need to ship a sequel next for next Christmas , what features do we need ? ”
That was n’t the way it happened , that ’s not the way Valve works .
What did happen was , the team sat down and said , “ We ’ve got a bunch of ideas of stuff we want to do . ”
People were really fired up when the game was finished , and there was a lot of feedback and ideas that came from watching people play – on the scale of millions of people , as opposed to hundreds of people that we went through during the playtesting sessions .
So we put a lot of those things on the board and said , “ What can we do quickly ?
What ’s going to take more time ?
What ’s the best way to get stuff out to customers ? ”
And part of that plan ended up with L4D2 , with things like changing the way the finales worked , introducing some new Survivors , giving new dialogue , telling more about the story , introducing new Specials .
We said , “ Wow , that makes for a nice sequel . ”
And then there was the stuff in the Survival Pack which makes for a nice DLC .
And what we ’d like to do is release a great game , provide lots of entertainment - as - a - service type of features , whether they ’re technical updates or whether it ’s the Survival Pack , and then also deliver more .
RPS : So how did the sequel come about ?
DL : One of the biggest pieces of feedback we got after the game came out , and even after the Survival Pack , was : this is all really great , I loved it , but I want a bunch more campaigns , I want more content .
In a sense , L4D2 is a response to what players were asking for after the first one shipped .
That ’s really how it came about .
I think if folks spot us a bit more time , they may see where we ’re going with all this .
The more they learn about how much there is in L4D2 …
I mean , twenty new weapons is n’t DLC !
Three new Specials , and twenty weapons , and five new campaigns : that starts to feel like a sequel .
I think as more gets unveiled as we go from E3 to Comic Con and PAX , and show the game in places where the public can play , and then when the demo comes out a couple of weeks before launch , I think people will get where we ’re going , and hopefully do n’t think that we ’ve turned into some sort of opportunist cow milkers .
RPS : Do you wonder whether an aspect of it is that it ’s been so quick ?
Do you think if you ’d waited another six or eight months , people might have responded better ?
DL : Maybe , maybe .
But two years from now though , would you look back and say that was better ?
Like I say , give it some time : quick decisions are n’t usually the best ones .
I would say that may have been part of it , people may have felt differently about it had it taken longer to produce it .
The other thing is , it ’s something new for Valve .
Valve does n’t have a reputation for shipping quick sequels !
So it ’s something different .
We had similar reactions when we announced The Orange Box .
There were a lot of people who thought , “ It ’s not going to be worth fifty dollars , all these games are really tiny , ” and then by the time the game came out the review said , “ The best value in gaming . ”
Again , I would say , let us tell more of the story before people make their final judgement .
And then if they say we ’re f’d , then that ’s fair .
[ laughs ]
RPS : Do you think part of the problem might have been that the Survival Pack felt like it was finishing the first game .
When there were two versus campaigns that were n’t in there , it might have felt like the Survival Pack completed the game rather than added to it .
DL : Maybe .
It ’s hard to say , I have n’t sat down and had a calm , reasonable dialogue with a group of people that have had [ this week ’s ] reaction yet .
I ’ve been busy keeping it a secret , then we just announced it a couple of days ago .
I also want to get more informations , I want to hear more of what their story is and what they ’re reacting to , so I can understand it better , and I ’m sure Gabe feels the same way .
We ’ll see what is the genesis of why folks are having this reaction to it .
And that [ the Survival Pack ] might have been part of it as well , but it ’s definitely not the case that we ’re closing the book on L4D and saying , “ Next time you get anything it ’s when the sequel comes out . ”
RPS : So is there any chance of new content like new maps and new campaigns in the original L4D ?
DL : Yeah , there ’s certainly a chance of that , and we ’re not announcing any of the specifics of that today .
Like I say , stay tuned , there ’s more coming , there ’s more information we ’re going to talk about for the sequel , there ’s more content coming for Left 4 Dead in the fairly near term , that I think will sort of add to this picture and hopefully change some people ’s opinions of what ’s happening right now .
Thanks to Doug Lombardi for taking time out of a crazed E3 schedule to talk to us .
The RPS hivemind realises people are very passionate about this subject , but remains confident that the discussion below will not make us frown .

Today , one of the biggest problems we have , and one of the things that shocks so many Americans , is the rise of teen suicides and the rise of school shootings .
Yet all we hear from the corporate mass media on the shootings is “ Well , we need to take the guns away . ”
Let me tell you something , I went to school in Texas .
We took guns to school .
Nobody shot anybody .
So what ’s changed ?
Drugs .
Kids on psychiatric drugs .
Nearly every school shooter in this country can be shown to have been involved with psychotropic drugs — either taking them at the time of the shootings , or what can be even worse , coming off of them .
And teen suicides ?
Read the FDA black box warnings , these drugs can cause suicidal ideation .
So logically , if kids are being drugged up with antidepressants , and if in fact teen suicides are rising , then it does n’t take a rocket scientist to realize that we better stop drugging our kids to death .
Psychiatric drugs cause major changes in brain chemistry and in behavior .
International drug regulators warn that the drugs we are doling out to kids can cause mania , psychosis , depersonalization , suicidal and even homicidal ideation .
If we take a look at the school shooters that were under the influence of these drugs , you have to wonder why there has n’t been a federal investigation into the correlation between drugs documented to cause violence and suicide and kids taking them who then became violent and suicidal .
If even a handful of these school shooters were found to be taking PCP or smoking crack we would have headline news announcing a causal relationship between illicit drug use and acts of violence .
But because these kids are taking legal drugs , prescribed by a psychiatrist for an alleged mental disorder , something we use to refer to as “ childhood , ” the powers that be do n’t think it merits an investigation .
Well we are all aware of how much Pharma spends on lobbying efforts .
Regarding corporate media I would venture a guess that the reason they have n’t taken on the issue is simple : Big Pharma is now one of , if not the largest , advertisers in the United States , with $ 5 billion a year spent on direct to consumer advertising .
The rise of drug - induced acts of violence and suicide is n’t limited to our schools .
In January 2009 it was reported that more of our military died of suicide than of combat deaths .
Why is that ?
Could it be because our military are getting pumped full of psychiatric drugs ?
What Time Magazine referred to as “ America ’s Medicated Army ? ”
Well if we are “ medicating ” our troops with antidepressants and antipsychotics , drugs documented to cause suicidal reactions , let ’s put 2 and 2 together and state the obvious — these drugs are minimally a contributing factor .
Many people do n’t realize that psychiatry ’s love affair with the military dates back more than 90 years ; During World War I the biggest problem the German military had was desertions — people leaving the front lines of the War .
So the Germans turned to psychiatrists who came up with a solution : Electroshock .
Psychiatrists theorized that if the shock soldiers experienced due to the brutalities of war made them desert the front lines , then another kind of shock — electroshock — could get them to be good little soldiers and willingly return to combat .
Maybe because electroshock wiped out their memory , or maybe because soldiers chose to face the front lines rather than have another 450 volts of current tear through their brain , it worked .
Psychiatry had come up with a winning strategy for the military to deal with reluctant soldiers and since that time the love affair between the two entities has never waned .
Today there are mobile psychiatric units that travel with the troops to ensure they ’re drugged up as needed .
And though they are not yet employing electroshock , as more Americans are made aware that these psychotropic drugs are killing our troops , do n’t be surprised if sometime soon you pick up a newspaper and find psychiatrists promoting a new cure for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ; Electroshock .

Executive Summary
A recent directive by the Chinese government requires the installation of a specific filtering software product , Green Dam , with the publicly stated intent of protecting children from harmful Internet content .
The proposed implementation of software as reviewed in this report would in fact have an influence that extends beyond helping parents protect their children from age inappropriate material ; the filtering options include blocking of political and religious content normally associated with the Great Firewall of China , China ’s sophisticated national - level filtering system .
If implemented as proposed , the effect would be to increase the reach of Internet censorship to the edges of the network , adding a new and powerful control mechanism to the existing filtering system .
As a policy decision , mandating the installation of a specific software product is both unprecedented and poorly conceived .
In this specific instance , the mistake is compounded by requiring the use of a substandard software product that interferes with the performance of personal computers in an unpredictable way , killing browsers and applications without warning while opening up users to numerous serious security vulnerabilities .
The level of parental control over the software is poor such that this software does not well serve parents that wish to the limit exposure of their children to Internet content .
The mandate requiring the installation of a specific product serves no useful purpose apart from extending the reach of government authorities .
Given the resulting poor quality of the product , the large negative security and stability effects on the Chinese computing infrastructure and the intense backlash against the product mandate , the mandate may result in less government control .
Key Findings
Green Dam exerts unprecedented control over users ’ computing experience
The version of the Green Dam software that we tested , when operating under its default settings , is far more intrusive than any other content control software we have reviewed .
Not only does it block access to a wide range of web sites based on keywords and image processing , including porn , gaming , gay content , religious sites and political themes , it actively monitors individual computer behavior , such that a wide range of programs including word processing and email can be suddenly terminated if content algorithm detects inappropriate speech .
The program installs components deep into the kernel of the computer operating system in order to enable this application layer monitoring .
The operation of the software is highly unpredictable and disrupts computer activity far beyond the blocking of websites .
The functionality of Green Dam goes far beyond that which is needed to protect children online and subjects users to security risks
The deeply intrusive nature of the software opens up several possibilities for use other than filtering material harmful to minors .
With minor changes introduced through the auto - update feature , the architecture could be used for monitoring personal communications and Internet browsing behavior .
Log files are currently recorded locally on the machine , including events and keywords that trigger filtering .
The auto - update feature can used to change the scope and targeting of filtering without any notification to users .
The effective level of parental control over the software is poor
Technically , the software may be turned off or uninstalled and the filtering settings adjusted .
In practice , a large number of users accept pre-installed software and never change default settings .
Moreover , a combination of poor implementation and opaque design makes it very difficult for even expert users to understand what the system is doing by default , let alone understand the impact and scope of auto-updates and configuration changes .
These factors severely erode any arguments over parental choice .
Moreover , the bundling of filtering to cover many different targets through poorly designed and implemented interfaces leaves parents with inadequate choices in customizing filtering setting to match their personal family preferences .
Mandating the use of a specific software product is a questionable policy decision
Introducing a product standard by mandating the use of a particular software product made by a specific company for individual use at a national level is unprecedented .
We are not aware of any comparable requirement by any country in any context .
A product mandate provides a strong measure of central control at the cost of consumer choice , security , and product quality , with implications for personal computer performance .
This is a remarkably poor choice for computer users in any country .
The effects of this product mandate are magnified by the fact that the product and company in question are reported to have little or no experience in the development , testing , deployment , or support of a very widely used software product .
Background and Context
On May 19 , 2009 , the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ( MIIT ) in China sent a notification to computer manufacturers of its intention to require all new PCs sold in China after July 1 to have filtering software pre-installed .
The notice , jointly issued by the MIIT , the Civilization Office of the Central Communist Party Committee , and the Ministry of Finance , according to the PRC Government Procurement Law , mandates the procurement of all rights and services related to a designated software to be made available for free public use .
The software , called “ Green Dam Youth Escort , ” is a product of the Jinhui Computer System Engineering Co. , with input from Beijing Dazheng Human Language Technology Academy Co .
The purported intent of the Green Dam software is to filter harmful online text and image content in order to prevent the effects of this information on youth and promote a healthy and harmonious Internet environment .
The Wall Street Journal reported that , similar to anti-virus and operating system software , Green Dam would regularly update PCs with a database of banned sites and block access to those addresses .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the founder of Jinhui confirmed that the software can be turned off and uninstalled with a password ; blocked sites can be accessed either with a password set by the administrator or by adding addresses to a ‘ white list ’ of allowed sites ; and URLs can be added to the black list on the user ’s hard drive .
Jinhui compiles and updates the blacklist of websites , which it says is primarily focused on pornographic sites .
While users would have the option to add other content to the blacklist , Jinhui said it had no reason to do so and that its cooperation with a research institute of the Ministry of Public Security on image - recognition technology was limited to pornography .
The company also engaged in technical cooperation with the People ’s Liberation Army ’s Information Engineering University .
Even if the software were limited to only pornographic sites , it reaches a scope well beyond personal home use of new PCs .
According to a press release for the software , the MIIT is working with the Ministry of Education , Ministry of Finance , and the State Council Information Office to require primary and middle schools across the country to have Green Dam installed and functional by the end of May .
However , comments on the now - closed official Green Dam BBS translated by blogger Roland Soong revealed dissatisfaction and frustration among teachers and school administrators over the software ’s functionality .
Users complained about the nuisance of upgrading without network capabilities , the blocking of non-pornographic websites , and the recording of Internet usage data , as well as the inclusion of spyware with the ability to obtain periodic screen captures .
Self - reported usage statistics for Green Dam since end of March 2009 :
made available for download at 95 domestic websites
downloaded 3.27 million times
installed at 518,000 computers at approximately 2279 schools
in use by 6957 websites , at approximately 1.16 million computers
installed in more than 53 million PC units marketed for home use .
According to MIIT sources , computers being sold in rural China at an average 13 percent discount have already had the software pre-installed .
Although companies including Lenovo , Inspur and Hedy have agreed to include the software , Dell , China ’s third - largest vendor of PCs , was still determining whether it would install the software as of June 8 .
The Notice requires computer manufacturers to report the number of computers shipped with the software for each month in 2009 , and then annually for subsequent years .
No penalties for non-compliance were detailed in the Notice .
Green Dam filtering software : a rapid assessment
Researchers at the OpenNet Initiative and StopBadware project collaborated on a rapid , initial assessment of the behavior of the Green Dam software .
This initial testing focused on understanding the basic behavior of the system ( what does it block , when , and how ) rather than the underlying technical implementation , which we and others will explore in depth in future research .
A core finding of our initial assessment is that the behavior is in itself complex enough to require significant effort to understand .
Other researches have been working on assessing the functionality and weaknesses of Green Dam .
The most comprehensive open evaluation that we have seen was carried out a team of Chinese researchers .
This report posted on Wikileaks continues to be updated and covers many aspects of the software , from the core functionality to the image processing software and the programs that are monitored by Green Dam .
Another review of Green Dam , quoted in greater length below , carried out by researchers at the University of Michigan highlighted security threats for users of Green Dam such that " any web site the user visits can exploit these problems to take control of the computer . "
Green Dam Youth Escort is a Windows client application that blocks content primarily on Internet Explorer ( IE ) but also on other browsers and even in some cases in user applications like notepad .
To perform its blocking , Green Dam inserts hooks deeply into the operating system in both the networking and windowing system .
We tested the 3.17 version of the Green Dam software as downloaded from http://www.lssw365.net/ and installed on a clean version of Windows XP Pro running within VMWare .
The Windows XP installation was brought up to date with all Windows updates and configured for Chinese language support .
The Green Dam system is hard to understand ( and therefore for users to evaluate and control ) because it displays a variety of seemingly inconsistent behaviors depending on a combination of opaque design decisions , updates , and configuration settings .
Different versions of the software , updated automatically in the background without user knowledge , significantly change what sites are filtered and how they are filtered .
The categories presented in the configuration interface often do not correspond to actual sites blocked .
Pages are blocked in a variety of different ways , including blocking the pages from loading , displaying a warning window on top of the page , killing the web browser tabs , killing the whole browser , and even killing other user applications .
Sometimes the blocking happens while a page is loading , sometimes before a page loads while typing in a URL , sometimes after a page loads , and sometimes while typing content into another application .
Furthermore , how and when content is blocked changes over time , even without updating or configuring the Green Dam application .
And in general , simple parts of the application are poorly designed and implemented , increasing user confusion and leading to serious security vulnerabilities .
The following table explains the relationship between a ) Green Dam 's version and configuration and b ) Green Dam 's blocking behavior for sites representing various types of content :
The left hand axis of the above table represents the different configurations of the system , the top axis represents the sites loaded ( or blocked ) , and the fields indicate the result of attempting to load each site under each configuration .
The system generally exhibits one of five behaviors when loading a site : success ( S ) , network reset ( R ) , browser kill triggered by content ( KC ) , or browser kill triggered by location entry ( KL ) .
The configuration of the system depends on three variables : the version of software , the category filtering settings , and the language processing settings .
The latest download version of the system at the time we tested it was 3.17 , but an update to 3.173 was available by clicking on a manual update button in the configuration interface .
The configuration interface also has an update period setting that determines how often the application is automatically updated to the latest release ( 3.173 at the time of this report ) .
The configuration interface also has a screen that has a check box by each of the following filtering categories : pornography , pornography ( severe ) , violent games , illegal drugs , and gay sites .
For the purposes of the above table , we either checked all of these category settings or unchecked them all .
And the configuration interface also has a screen with a single checkbox labeled “ language processing . ”
In both the 3.17 and 3.173 versions , turning off category filtering and language processing disables all functionality of the system .
We found no evidence of any content blocking , in web browsers or other user applications , while these settings were turned off .
Both versions offer an uninstall option that has the same effect of disabling all blocking behavior by the system and also stopping any of the supporting processes from running .
By default , both versions of the software are configured with all category filtering and language processing turned on .
In the 3.17 version , category blocking turns on the filtering of pornography and gay sites through connection resets triggered by keywords .
We tested several popular English language shooter computer gaming sites and could find no filtered sites , even with those categories turned on .
We found several examples of illicit drug - related sites that are blocked with the associated category turned on .
We also found no examples of sites blocked by the pornography ( severe ) category , though it is possible that that category is used for blocking child pornography sites , which we did not test .
Turning on the pornography ( severe ) category and turning off the pornography category causes the application not to block any of the pornography sites we tested , including several popular hardcore pornography sites .
We know that the system uses keyword blocking for these sites because it does not use either IP blocking ( requests to the same IP with different content are not blocked ) or DNS blocking ( network traces show DNS requests are not blocked ) .
We know from monitoring network traffic using a packet sniffer that the system is using TCP resets to kill the connections .
In the 3.17 version , language processing turns on blocking for political and religious content by killing browser tabs and applications and even other user applications like notepad .
In some cases , including falundafa.org in our tests above , the kill action is triggered by entering a particular URL into the location bar or window of the browser .
When such a URL is entered into the location bar at the top of IE , Green Dam displays the following warning over the browser for less than a second before killing the whole browser application ( including not just the particular window but every window and every tab currently open in the browsing session ) :
When such a URL is a entered into the location window ( the window displayed when a user chooses File -> Open in IE ) , Green Dam sometimes kills just the active tab and sometimes kills every single tab open in every single IE window .
IE tries to reload all tabs killed this way with the previous content for each tab ( unlike with the browser kill action , which makes the browser go away altogether until restarted by the user ) .
The language processing also triggers application kills for a small range of user applications , including Notepad and Wordpad .
When language processing is on and a user enters one of the URLs that triggers location bar kill actions by default ( ' falundafa.org ' but not ' epochtimes.com ' ) , Green Dam will kill any of these applications either immediately or a few seconds after the user types in the offending keyword .
For other URLs , including epochtimes.com in our tests above , the language processing is triggered by the content on the page itself .
In these cases , the user can see some or all of the page load briefly before seeing the warning screen flash on the screen followed by the whole browser dying as described above .
In all of these cases , whether the URL or the content causes the language processing feature to kill the browser tab or window , the language processing feature will thereafter always kill the browser when the user enters that URL into the location bar or window .
So the first time the user loads epochtimes.com , Green Dam will kill the browser window after displaying the content briefly .
If the user tries to enter epochtimes.com into the location bar again , the system will kill the browser immediately without loading the page .
All URLs that are killed within the location bar are also killed whenever they appear in the auto - complete list of the location box .
This is an extremely buggy and intrusive method of killing sites because it extends the kill action to single letters that auto - complete to kill blocked sites .
For example , if a user enters epochtimes.com into the location , the user will see the page briefly , see the warning box briefly , and then have the whole browser killed .
But after the user restarts the browser , epochtimes.com will be in the browser history and therefore in the auto - complete list .
So depending on the other URLs in the auto - complete list , the user may only have to type 'e ' into the location box to trigger the appearance of epochtimes.com in the auto - complete list and therefore cause Green Dam to kill the whole browser .
The end effect of this is that Green Dam can effectively ban , through the extremely intrusive kill action , all URLs beginning with a given letter ( 'e ' for ' epochtimes .
com ' , 'f ' for ' falundafa.org ' , etc ) .
There are several other methods for causing kill - blocked sites to enter the browser history and therefore trigger these extremely intrusive auto - complete kills ; for instance , the user can enter www.falundafa.org instead of falundafa.org into the location bar to get the same behavior as with epochtimes.com .
This behavior can be reset by deleting the browser history , and therefore removing the offending sites from the auto - complete list .
But it is highly unlikely that most users will make the connection between entering a specific single letter into the location bar and a particular site visited , perhaps long ago and perhaps not even by the same user .
We updated the test system with the latest version of Green Dam by clicking on a manual update button on the update configuration screen .
That same screen also has a setting for how often the Green Day software will automatically update itself .
This auto - updating feature raises the possibility that the functionality of the software will change significantly in the future without user participation or even knowledge .
The biggest change in the 3.173 version of the software is that all filtering categories other than pornography ( severe ) have been removed from the configuration screen and , according to our testing , from the filtering altogether .
None of the first page Google results for ' sex ' or ' gay ' were blocked by the 3.173 version of the software , even with the single , pornography ( severe ) category turned on .
The language processing feature remains largely the same in the 3.173 , with the only detected change being that www.falundafa.org was added to the default list of location bar kill URLs ( though typing www.falundafa.org into the location window still brings the falundafa.org site up and then causes the auto - complete kill problem for ' f ' ) .
The result of these changes in the 3.173 version is that this version of the software is only useful as a tool for blocking political and religious content , not pornography .
This is likely a mistake .
In addition to these filtering features , Green Dam has a logging system that stores a record of every site visited , every site blocked , and why each blocked site was blocked .
We have seen no evidence that this file is being sent back to a central server or anywhere outside of the client computer .
Still , the log file does not obey the browser privacy controls , leaving a trail of a user 's browsing history even after the user has tried to delete the trail for the browser .
This is of course a desired feature for many parents who want to monitor their children ’s Internet usage , but the log is on by default for all users on the computer and can only be disabled by uninstalling the Green Dam software altogether .
In general , the software has a number of other problems that result from poor design and implementation .
The language , especially describing the language processing function , does not make at all clear the kinds of content the option blocks or the extremely intrusive kill methods used to block the content .
The update mechanism itself , leaving alone questions of centralized control of the software , is unreliable – it failed to update for about half of the three days in which we tested the software , under an order of magnitude less load than it would see were the software installed on every computer in China .
The system has whitelist and blacklist functionality in its configuration interface , but we were unable to get either to work ( whitelisted sites remained blocked , and blacklisted sites remained unblocked ) .
The system claims to do sophisticated image processing to detect pornography images , but after browsing many pornography sites , the only picture we saw blocked was a photograph of a face in a news article .
Interestingly , the Green Dam software is identified as malware by anti-virus software from the largest free anti-virus company in China ( www.360.cn).
The StopBadware Project at the Berkman Center confirmed that the application violates its Badware guidelines for software , as it does not disclose the filtering of political speech or the unexpected behavior of completely killing processes that contain such speech .
Most critically , researchers at the University of Michigan have already found serious security problems with the software :
We examined the Green Dam software and found that it contains serious security vulnerabilities due to programming errors .
Once Green Dam is installed , any web site the user visits can exploit these problems to take control of the computer .
This could allow malicious sites to steal private data , send spam , or enlist the computer in a botnet .
In addition , we found vulnerabilities in the way Green Dam processes blacklist updates that could allow the software makers or others to install malicious code during the update process .
We found these problems with less than 12 hours of testing , and we believe they may be only the tip of the iceberg .
Green Dam makes frequent use of unsafe and outdated programming practices that likely introduce numerous other vulnerabilities .
Correcting these problems will require extensive changes to the software and careful retesting .
In the meantime , we recommend that users protect themselves by uninstalling Green Dam immediately .
The ramifications of these vulnerabilities are difficult to overstate .
The mandate by the MIIT ensures an enormous pool of victims for any attacker smart enough to either lure Chinese web surfers to a web site or infiltrate the server storing the update files .
The prevalence of “ drive by downloads ” makes for an easy mechanism to populate thousands of websites with code that could turn every Chinese computer running Green Dam into a member of a botnet .
If an attacker were able to compromise the web server hosting the update code , then every computer that phoned home could also be infected .
Major software vendors like Apple or Microsoft use cryptographically signed code to ensure that only approved software is sent to clients requesting an update .
Green Dam does not use any visible safeguards to ensure the safety of their users during the critical update process .
Internet content regulation in China
China maintains one of the most extensive and technologically sophisticated filtering systems in the world .
The ‘ great firewall of China ’ uses a variety of overlapping techniques for blocking content containing a wide range of material considered politically or socially sensitive by the Chinese government .
While China employs filtering techniques used by many other countries , including DNS ( domain name system ) tampering and IP ( internet protocol ) blocking , it is unique in the world for its system of breaking Internet connections when triggered by a list of banned keywords .
Known as a TCP reset , this filtering strategy operates by forging legitimate reset signals in order to implement a keyword filtering scheme at a large scale .
TCP reset filtering is based on inspecting the content of IP packets for keywords that would trigger blocking , either in the header or the content of the message .
When a router in the Great Firewall identifies a bad keyword , it sends reset packets to both the source and destination IP addresses in the packet , breaking the connection .
Users anywhere in the globe can experience this by searching for ‘ falun ’ or other sensitive words at Baidu.com or other search engines hosted in China .
Technical filtering associated with the so - called Great Firewall of China is only one of several tools for controlling Internet content that are applied in China .
For example , to manage the explosion of the Chinese blogosphere , blog service providers must not only install filters that prevent the posting of potentially thousands of keyword combinations , but also flag certain posts for review .
Comment sections , forums , and other interactive features that pose a higher risk of containing sensitive content can be shut off , while posts can be deleted or concealed by the provider so that only the author can see them .
Bloggers who are considered to have written too many troublesome posts can have their accounts cancelled at will .
At the same time , because these compulsory control mechanisms are actually implemented through informal processes , provider - based content control is neither narrow nor entirely predictable .
A study of Chinese blog service providers demonstrated that there is substantial variation in censorship methods , the amount of content censored , and providers ’ transparency about deleting or de-publishing content .
Similar findings were reached in a Citizen Lab study of four popular search engines in China , which found significant variations in the level of transparency about filtering , actual content censored , and methods used , suggesting that there is not a comprehensive system for determining censored content .
While Google and Microsoft , which are hosted outside China , actually de-listed certain search results , the two search engines hosted inside China , Yahoo ! and Baidu , ran their Web crawlers behind the China ’s filtering system , and therefore did not index Web sites already blocked by the Chinese government .
Although Google censored considerably less that the other search engines , it also has a practice of prioritizing authorized local content , which researcher Nart Villeneuve found amplified the significance of the censored Web sites as they were the only ones to offer differing viewpoints .
Indeed , the complexity of these informal control mechanisms was further revealed in April 2009 , when an employee of China ’s leading search engine , Baidu.com , leaked a folder containing the substance and flow of internal censorship .
These included lists of topics , keywords , and URLs to be blocked , lists of banned forums , employee guidelines for monitoring work , censorship guidelines for the popular Baidu post bars , and guidelines of how to search for information that needed to be banned .
The Chinese government ’s legal control over Internet expression and content is also multilayered and achieved by distributing criminal and financial liability , licensing and registration requirements , and self - monitoring instructions to non-state actors at every stage of access , from the ISP to the content provider and the end user .
Some of these blunt and frequently applied methods include job dismissals ; the closure of Web sites , often by their Web hosting service , for a broad array of infractions ; and the detention of journalists , writers , and activists .
All Internet services that fail sufficiently to monitor their Web sites and report violations face fines and other serious consequences , including shutdown , criminal liability , and license revocation .
The government has used this approach to bring social media outlets such as video sharing sites in line with the larger governing framework for Internet content regulation .
Green Dam , designed for use at the household and institutional level , adds another layer of control and complexity to an elaborate and well - developed content regulatory system in China .
International points of comparison
China is not alone in seeking technological filtering solutions aimed at protecting its children from material on the Internet that is perceived to be harmful to minors and , in doing so , reaching down to the institutional and household level for the application of regulatory mechanisms .
The United States and Australia are two apt points of comparison .
Legislation in the United States links federal funding for schools and libraries to the installation of filtering software that blocks access to content harmful to minors .
Although controversial , this regulatory approach has survived legal challenges in the US courts .
This approach places considerable discretion in the hands of local librarians and school administrators , who can disable the filters for adults and may choose to alter the blocking configurations offered in the software .
Unlike the current Chinese model to promote the use of Green Dam , there are several competing filtering products that can be used to fulfill this mandate .
At the household level in the US , filtering is entirely voluntary , again with a number of software products vying for this household filtering market .
Filtering software at the household level has played an indirect role in national - level filtering policy .
The US courts , in rulings that broad - scale mandatory filtering in US is unconstitutional , have referenced the effectiveness of household - based filtering mechanisms as comparable to more centralized solutions in terms of level of protection for children but with a lower burden on constitutionally protected free speech .
Australia invested considerable resources in developing software that could be implemented by households across the nation to filter content harmful to minors .
The adoption rates for this software for its proponents have been woefully low ( only 137,000 copies of the filter were downloaded or requested on CD ; Australia has over 6 million Internet subscribers .
These figures do not indicate how many of the downloads have been installed and continue in use . ) .
Soon after its release , a teenager described online a way to disable the software .
The failure of this voluntary household - based filtering strategy undoubtedly informed the much debated plans in Australia for developing a mandatory filtering policy , which was intended to be implemented by ISPs .
The original plan was to introduce an opt - out system , whereby the default choice for users would be a filtered connection unless they explicitly requested an open unfiltered connection .
Although a trial is currently underway , recent signals suggest that the government will be backing away from the opt - out design , instead reverting to a less restrictive opt - in regime .
Technology companies also play an important role in controlling online content .
Internet applications also act to shield consumers from offensive or sensitive materials .
Search engines such as Google and Yahoo include safe search options .
Blogging hosts and social media , including YouTube among others , include terms of service restrictions that limit the type of content that users can post on these sites , relying heavily on user feedback reports to identify infringing content .
Many other countries around the world are adopting various strategies for addressing concerns over child safety online that combine to different degrees legal restrictions , voluntary programs in conjunction with technology companies and options for controls at the household level .
Green Dam : a shift in filtering strategy and capability for China ?
Compared to China ’s existing filtering apparatus , the addition of this system marks a substantially different approach to filtering , moving the implementation of filtering to institutions and end -users on the periphery .
One of the principle problems with large - scale filtering strategies that rely on intervention through a small number of points of control is the cost of implementation , both in technological infrastructure and a reduction in connectivity speeds .
Intensive monitoring of content can not take place through a centralized system without either tremendous investments in processing facilities or at the cost of dramatically reduced Internet speed .
Distributing the control mechanisms through client - side software offloads the burden of sorting through content to the individual machines on the network .
In essence , such a system amounts to a huge distributed super computer dedicated to controlling online content .
This allows a much more intrusive and comprehensive filtering system than the more centralized ISP - level filtering schemes , including dynamic content analysis and image processing .
However , leveraging the technological potential of client - side control requires either government control over personal computers or the voluntary participation of computer administrators and users .
Blurring the lines between parental and government controls
The Australian and US experiences with content control highlight the philosophical and architectural differences between filtering strategies that place control in the hands of government versus households .
Household control of filtering mechanisms implies that participation is entirely voluntary , that there is adequate control over the scope and targeting of filtering , that content control options are easily understandable and transparent , and that controls can be easily implemented with software that is configurable by users .
At the opposite end of the spectrum , government controls are mandatory and leave no discretionary control in the hands of users .
Online content control strategies may fall somewhere between these two extremes of pure household and government control .
In the case of Green Dam , the setting of defaults will have a substantial influence on user decisions .
If the software comes loaded on all new computers , that software will remain there for a large number of users .
Even though the software we reviewed allows users to uninstall it , many users will leave it there unaltered on the computers merely because that is the default .
The process of removing the software does appear to be fairly straightforward but requires users to put in the effort to do so .
Whether the intention of the mandate is to require the software to come pre-installed on all computers sold in China is still unclear .
One reading of the notification implies that pre-installation would be required on all new PCs sold in China after July 1 , 2009 .
A different interpretation would allow manufacturers to send the installation software on a CD with the new computer , effectively allowing consumers the option to install the software or not .
This will have a large influence on the adoption and continued use of the software in China .
Green Dam is designed to allow limited customization such that users can increase or decrease the level of filtering by choosing different categories of blocking , by adding sites to the blacklist , or by unblocking sites by adding them to a white list .
Again , the default settings are critically important .
The default options in the software we reviewed included the highest level of filtering , including not only pornography but also political content and the most intrusive methods of blocking , which kills applications on the computer .
These default options would then likely remain the choice of many users , because defaults tend to be sticky and the design of the software makes the relationship between configuration settings and application behavior unclear .
The influence of those that design and maintain this software is not limited to the defaults that are included in the software download package .
The automatic update function can be used to remotely alter the filtering profile that guides the software , adding more topics , web sites and keywords that trigger blocking .
The automatic update functionality could conceivably be used to reduce filtering as well .
In theory , users also are able to adjust the way in which they configure the software to compensate for any changes in the scale and scope of the updated filtering instructions .
In practice , this is highly impractical , even if users are given a detailed reporting of changes in the blocking lists and algorithms , which is also highly unlikely ; the lists of keywords that guide the filtering process are contained in an encoded file .
Although Green Dam technically offers parents considerable control over whether and how it is implemented , the practical level of control is small .
The most significant choices are whether the software is installed in the first place and the default settings that accompany the installation .
Privacy , Surveillance and Security
The potential for using this software to track browsing habits and communications of users is high .
We have not been able to confirm that personal information is being gathered centrally .
It is not hard to image that a similar system could be implemented that behaves as the Tom - Skype platform , where logs were recorded on a server when certain keywords were used .
The possibility of personal information leaking could also be quite high as well .
The powerful central coordination mechanism is also accompanied by a higher vulnerability to security breaches and malicious activity .
Several vulnerabilities have already been documented .
The potential perils of a software monopoly
The potential power of a single provider of filtering software and software updates is tremendous , particularly for software that can be updated automatically .
Moreover , the influence of the government with Green Dam is apt to be very high given that the company has been granted a monopoly position by the government , a privileged position that could just as easily be taken away .
In a different context , producers of filtering software that are competing for business are more likely to offer choices that are attractive to users and to be responsive to the needs of consumers .
A government mandated monopoly has little incentive to provide user - friendly top quality software .
Furthermore , some Chinese citizens are questioning the 40 million RMB spent by the government to secure a year - long contract with Jinhui , saying that if users uninstall the software , the expense is a waste of taxpayers ’ money .
One Beijing - based lawyer is challenging the policy ’s legality based on an October 2008 Chinese legislative notice that requests government agencies to “ hold hearings for items subject to examination and approval which concern the major public interests or the vital interests of the people ” ( the MIIT announced the Green Dam policy without holding a hearing ) .
Internet users are also questioning the policy based on the government ’s possible violation of China ’s anti-monopoly law or its law against unfair competition .
For controlling Internet content , the benefits to the government of a centralized single provider solution are clear .
This precludes the most effective elements in promoting innovation and quality assurance — user feedback , competition and market mechanisms — making this a highly questionable choice for promoting the development of effective , high - quality filtering software in China .
If the ultimate goal is protecting children , then this is a dubious policy decision .
Indeed , we think that , given the myriad problems we and others have unearthed with the tool , China will have to pull back from requiring installation of this tool in its current state .
Conclusions
A rapid review of the filtering software required for new computers in China corroborates the conclusions of other researchers : Green Dam is deeply flawed , poses critical security concerns for users and has a detrimental impact on normal computer activities .
The confusing interfaces and unpredictable functionality erode any pretense of parental control over the Internet browsing habits of their children and significantly reduce the control of all Green Dam users over their computers .
We find the Green Dam product mandate to be dangerous both as a model of centralized client control and in the implementation of the model through this specific product mandate .
Even if this software were a better implemented product , we find the overall policy model to be poorly conceived .
Requiring equipment manufacturers to install a specific software product is at odds with the development , improvement and maintenance of quality software .
Furthermore , the filtering behavior that we observed strays into the blocking of political and religious topics , suggesting that those maintaining the blocklists are interested in more than protecting children from material specifically damaging to children .
If this in fact turns out to be a means to extend the influence of the Great Firewall of China , it represents a new approach to large - scale censorship that leverages far more computing power than any centralized filtering system .
This would be consistent with a trend seen by ONI researchers in other countries of moving the implementation of filtering out towards the edges of networks , for example , employing filters in cybercafés and educational institutions .
The implication of moving filtering to individual computers is that it allows computationally - intensive dynamic analysis of Internet content , or in the case of Green Dam , any content created on a personal computer , facilitating a much more intrusive mechanism for filtering and surveillance than could be achieved otherwise .
There is broad support around the world for policies that help parents to limit the exposure of their children to harmful materials online .
This support varies widely , however , in relation to the share of responsibility and choice between governments , technology companies and parents .
Many favor leaving control solely in the hands of parents , while others support government policies that mandate large - scale filtering .
This legitimate debate has been superseded in China by a government mandate for new computers to be shipped with filtering software that is overly broad and excessively intrusive .
Requiring the installation of a specific product provides no apparent benefits for protecting children , suggesting that it might be intended to extend the regulatory reach of government authorities into personal computers .
This time , scientists are excited to find nothing .
In results announced today , a huge physics experiment builtto detect gravitational waves has yet to find any .
Rather than be disappointed by the null findings , physicistssay the results were expected , and in fact help them narrow down possibilitiesfor what the universe was like just after it was born .
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave ObservatoryScientific Collaboration ( LIGO ) is a set ofinstruments in Louisiana and Washington built to search for evidence of gravitationalwaves , which are theoretical ripples in space - time thought to be caused bythe acceleration of mass .
No one has yet directly detected these waves , thoughthey are predicted by Einstein 's theory of General Relativity , and are widelythought to permeate our universe .
In theory , every time mass accelerates - even when you riseup out of your chair - the curvatureof space - time changes , and ripples are produced .
However , the gravitationalwaves produced by one person are so small as to be negligible .
The wavesproduced by large masses , though , such as the collision of twoblack holes or a large supernova explosion , could be large enough to bedetected .
Null result
LIGO has only been running for a few years - the new resultsare based on measurements taken between 2005 to 2007 - and it is not yet at itshighest level of sensitivity .
The fact that this first period of observationsdid not detect gravitational waves allows researchers to rule out thepossibility of waves above a certain amplitude threshold .
Simply put , if therewere any waves big enough for LIGO to have detected them , it would have .
Sinceit did n't , they are n't likely to exist .
" I would n't say it 's surprising that we 're ruling themout , " said Vuk Mandic , a physicist at the University of Minnesota who ledthe new analysis .
Most physicists think the models that would have producedgravitational waves above the threshold that could have been seen so far areunlikely , he said .
The next phase of the project , called AdvancedLIGO , will improve the experiment 's sensitivity , allowing scientists toprobe a volume of space about 1,000 times larger than the current project ' srange .
" If Advanced LIGO does n't see gravitational waves Ithink people will be very surprised , " Mandic told SPACE.com .
" It islikely such a situation would require revision of General Relativity . "
In particular , scientists are hoping to eventually findevidence for gravitational waves created by the Big Bang , the explosion thoughtto have begun the universe .
According to theory , the Big Bang would have causeda flood of gravitational waves whose aftermath could still be seen today .
Thisaftermath of many waves of different sizes and directions superimposed on topof each other , much like the chaotic surface of a pond after rain has fallen onit , is called the " stochastic background . "
LIGO 's null result has limited the possible strength of thestochastic background .
Now that researchers know this background can't bestrong enough to have been detected so far , they can put new constraints on thedetails of how the universe looked in its earliest moments .
" The thing that makes this exciting is that this isreally the only way to probe the early universe , " said David Reitze , aphysicist at the University of Florida and the spokesperson for the LIGOScientific Collaboration .
" It 's starting to limit some of the exoticmodels of cosmology . "
For example , some models predict the existence of cosmicstrings , which are loops in space - time that may have formed in the earlyuniverse and gotten stretched to large scales along with the expansion of theuniverse .
These objects are thought to produce bursts of gravitational waves asthey oscillate .
Since no large - amplitude gravitational waves were found , cosmicstrings , if they exist at all , must be smaller than some models predict .
The results are detailed in the Aug. 20 issue of the journalNature .
Laser beam detectors
LIGO is composed of a series of L - shaped detectors .
At eachdetector , a laser beam is split in half , with each half routed through one ofthe arms of the L , and then the two are reunited .
If the two beams have travelledthe same distance in their separate arms , when they are merged again they willoverlap perfectly .
Gravitational waves are thought to stretch and compressdimensions of space - time perpendicular to the plane of the wave .
If a strong enough gravitational wave passes through thearea of the detectors , it will stretch one of the arms of the L and shrink theother , causing the first laser beam to be offset from the second .
Researcherswould notice this as a slight lessening of power in the resulting laser beam .
If the same signal is found at the detectors in bothLouisiana and Washington , scientists can rule out a local fluke for theresults .
" The experiments are challenging , " Caltechphysicist Marc Kamionkowski , who was not involved in the LIGO project , wrote inan accompanying essay in Nature .
" They require detection of minutechanges . "
Kamionkowski called LIGO " an experimental tour deforce . "
If LIGO does eventually detect gravitational waves , theparticularities of the waves , including their frequencies , will tellresearchers whether they are part of the stochastic background , or caused bysomething more recent , like a nearby supernova .

Among the six U.S. servicemember deaths so far reported in June , one soldier has become the 5,000th casualty of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Among the six U.S. servicemember deaths so far reported in June , one soldier has become the 5,000th casualty of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
According to Icasualties.org the wars have cost at least 4,308 lives in Iraq and 695 in Afghanistan .
The official count from the Department of Defense , however , has the total number of deaths at 4,996 in both military campaigns .
The D.O.D. figures often lag slightly behind those reported in the mass media .
These figures include both combat and non-combat deaths , as well as those servicemembers killed outside the main theaters of action .
In some cases , however , a servicemember who may have died months or years later of wounds received during service might not be included in official figures .
Military Families Speak
Out noted the milestone in a press release published today .
The antiwar group , which was formed by military families in 2002 , asked President Obama to swiftly end the wars , as promised during last yearâ€™s presidential campaign .
However , as the U.S. Congress returned from a weeklong Memorial Day break yesterday , the lawmakersâ€™ main war concern was not ending either campaign , but in finalizing a new war funding bill for the president to sign .
President Obama originally asked for $ 84.3 - billion to continue the wars .
Both chambers then added their own items , bringing the final tally for the House to $ 96.7 - billion and the Senateâ€™s to $ 91.3 - billion in additional funding .
Just found a nice post by Jason Pinter ( here ) on writers having to spend so much time marketing their work .
And really , on having to spend so much time and life energy marketing , instead of just writing whatever it is their mission in life to write about .
I added a comment and thought it might also fit on this blog :
I … agree that writers ’ preoccupation with marketing has gotten tedious .
It ’s not just the problem of so many authors having to be so preoccupied with marketing ( because publishers have discovered that they can drop that responsibility , like the good editing they used to provide , on the writers now and so we have to do it ) , but because it ’s so easy to confuse writing in order to market , with writing about marketing , as if our readers really care .
But the more insidious effect of this preoccupation is on the mental lives of writers .
As a psychologist and writer I can assure you that a writer ’s mental real estate is finite .
Time that should be spent reading literature ( whether Tolstoy or Chandler or Nancy Drew mysteries ) is devoted instead to reading our Tweets ( and other writers ’ blogs ) .
Time we really really truly NEED to spend perfecting our craft ( ten years at a minimum to be worth our first publication ; ten years AFTER our first publication before we will probably write our lifetime ’s best stuff ) gets spend doing easily scannable blog posts , clever tweets , composing elevator speeches .
Nobody much reads the old shrinks like Eric Fromm anymore ; they warned about this pressure in our culture to turn our personalities into marketing agencies .
It may mean that we limit our abilities a lot as we strive to become really good jingle writers , instead of really good writers .
Not that marketing can be avoided , of course .
I think it ’s really more a matter of striving for balance .
When I ’ve run my therapy practices , I had to spend some time “ marketing , ” but it was really important to have spent far , far more time learning the craft of therapy , reading those hundreds of hours on therapy and psychology in general , and yes , being a patient myself so I ’d know what it all felt like .
I have known a number of therapists who might be really good at presenting themselves publicly , at having the most inviting and charmingly reassuring websites , at recruiting lots of patients , but who were basically kind of undercooked in terms of their professional skills , their personal maturity , and most of all , in terms of that hard - to - define quality of “ wisdom . ”
People it ’s easy to find in the book ( because their marketing is so thorough ) , but whom you ’d never refer your mom to if she needed a shrink .
Same goes for writers .
I want to read good writers , not good marketers .
If they ’re good marketers too , that ’s fine — how else will we find them , maybe ?
But then again , maybe the master agents like Maas are right : the really great books mostly get promoted by word of mouth .
Somebody , somewhere , buys a copy .
Loves it .
It keeps her up all night .
And she tells two friends .
And so on .
I do n’t know if it ’s possible , of course , but when I dream , that ’s the kind of books I dream of writing .
The kind that keep somebody up late at night so they hate me in the morning when they have to get up for work after two hours ’ sleep … but all day they look for a chance to recommend the book to someone else .
8 people have been killed and many remain unaccounted for following a deadly explosion at Russia ’s largest power plant .
At least 68 people are still missing after water flooded the turbine hall at the Sayano - Shushenskaya dam in the Siberian region of khakassia .
Production at the plant has been halted but officials say there is no danger of the dam bursting .
Russia ’s Emergency Minister Sergey Shoigu said : ‘‘ There was and there is no chance of destruction .
There was a hydrolic surge in the zone of the second unit .
As a result the wheel was damaged and water rushed into the machine hall .
All ten units seized but the water fault is controlled . ’‘
Despite authorities saying there was no risk to towns downstream , panicked residents in the shadow of the soviet era dam reportedly fled the area .
Electricity has been cut to major aluminium and steel plants in the region forcing them to switch to alternative supplies .
This is actually a couple of years old but still good to watch if you have not seen it .
It ’s 40 minutes long .
It ’s probably subject to a take down .
The actor , who has appeared as a tubby villain in all six of the smash hit Harry Potter films , and a 19 - year - old friend were taken to a nearby police station .

There are still people in America who do not take video games seriously .
These are the same people who question the relevance of hip - hop and assume newspapers will still exist in twenty - five years .
It 's hard to find an irrefutably accurate statistic for the economic value of the video - game industry , but the best estimates seem to be around $ 28 billion .
As such , I 'm not going to waste any space trying to convince people that gaming is important .
If you 're reading this column , I 'm just going to assume that you believe video games in 2006 are the cultural equivalent of rock music in 1967 , because that 's ( more or less ) reality .
Okay !
So we all agree that video games are this consequential force , right ?
And we all assume that these games have meaning , and that they reflect the worldviews and sensibilities of their audience , right ?
And anyone who has played modern video games ( or has even just been in the same room with someone who was playing ) has undoubtedly noticed that games like Grand Theft Auto and Bad Day LA are visually transfixing , because the images are often beautiful and the movements of the characters are weird and hyperreal .
Everyone seems to agree that all of these notions are true .
Which prompts me to ask the following question :
Why are there no video - game critics ?
I realize that many people write video - game reviews and that there are entire magazines and myriad Web sites devoted to this subject .
But what these people are writing is not really criticism .
Almost without exception , it 's consumer advice ; it tells you what old game a new game resembles , and what the playing experience entails , and whether the game will be commercially successful .
It 's expository information .
As far as I can tell , there is no major critic who specializes in explaining what playing a given game feels like , nor is anyone analyzing what specific games mean in any context outside the game itself .
There is no Pauline Kael of video - game writing .
There is no Lester Bangs of video - game writing .
And I 'm starting to suspect there will never be that kind of authoritative critical voice within the world of video games , which is interesting for a lot of reasons .
This is not a simple mystery to solve .
It 's hard enough to figure out why something does exist , but it 's even harder to figure out why something does n't exist .
As an entry point , I contacted Steven Johnson , the author of Everything Bad Is Good for You , one of the only mainstream books that comes remotely close to the kind of gaming criticism I just described .
Johnson mostly attributes the void to mechanics .
" Games can't be analyzed using the aesthetic tools we 've developed to evaluate narrative art forms like books or films , " he explained via e-mail .
" Video games generally have narratives and some kind of character development , but -- almost without exception -- these are the least interesting things about them .
Gamers do n't play because they 're drawn into the story line ; they play because there 's something intoxicating about the mix of exploring an environment and solving problems .
The stories are an afterthought . "
This is all completely true .
However , I do n't think it explains why video - game criticism does n't exist .
When someone reviews Moby Dick or Kramer vs. Kramer , they do n't spend most of their time explaining the details of the plot ( or at least they do n't if they 're interesting ) .
The meaning of most art is usually found within abstractions .
So the problem is not that video games do n't have interesting narratives ; the problem is that it's hard to decide what it is about video games that is interesting .
" [ We ] need to talk about games in a way that is appropriate to the medium , " says Johnson .
" In some cases , they 're closer to architecture . "
Here again , Johnson is right .
But there 's one ( rather obvious ) difference between architecture and video games : Architecture is static .
I live in a building that has fourteen floors , and that 's always true .
I can't manipulate the floor plan of my apartment or the number of bricks in the wall .
What makes video - game criticism complex is that the action is almost never static .
Unlike a film director or a recording artist , the game designer forfeits all autonomy over his creation -- he can't dictate the emotions or motives of the characters .
Every player invents the future .
Look at it this way :
Near the end of Gone with the Wind , Scarlett O'Hara asks Rhett Butler what she 's supposed to do with the rest of her life , and he says that ( frankly ) he does n't give a damn .
Now , the meaning of those lines can be interpreted in many ways .
However , what if that dialogue happened only sometimes ?
What if this scene played out differently for every person who watched Gone with the Wind ?
What if Rhett occasionally changed his mind , walked back into the house , and said , " Just kidding , baby " ?
What if Scarlett suddenly murdered Rhett for acting too cavalier ?
What if the conversation were sometimes interrupted by a bear attack ?
And what if all these alternative realities were dictated by the audience itself ?
If Gone with the Wind ended differently every time it was experienced , it would change the way critics viewed its message .
The question would not be " What does this mean ? "
The question would be " What could this mean ? "
That , I think , is where video - game criticism should be going : toward the significance of potentiality .
Video games provide an opportunity to write about the cultural consequence of free will , a concept that has as much to do with the audience as it does with the art form .
However , I can't see how such an evolution could happen , mostly because there 's no one to develop into these " potentiality critics . "
Video - game criticism can't evolve because video - game criticism can't get started .
" It 's weird that Entertainment Weekly does n't have a video - game column , and that TheNew York Times only writes about gaming sporadically , " says Henry Jenkins , a professor of comparative media at MIT and the author of From Barbie to Mortal Kombat : Gender and Computer Games .
" Aesthetic criticism exists in this industry , but only as arguments among gaming scholars and game creators .
And the gaming industry suffers because of that .
There is a very conservative element to gaming because absolutely everything is built around consumerism .
Game designers are asking themselves questions about how a game should look and what it should do , but not about what the game is supposed to mean . "
And that , ultimately , is why the absence of video - game criticism is a problem .
If nobody ever thinks about these games in a manner that 's human and metaphorical and contextual , they 'll all become strictly commodities , and then they 'll all become boring .
They 'll only be games .
And since we 've already agreed that video games are the new rock music , we'd be facing a rather depressing scenario :
This generation 's single most meaningful artistic idiom will be--ultimately -- meaningless .
There is a void , but there is still time to fill it .
Somebody needs to become the first significant Xbox critic , stat .
If nothing else , I 'm sure he 'll get rich .

Somewhere between the time Sony removed backwards compatibility from the previous PS3 , and we knew there 'd be a new PS3 , people got to hoping that the feature would be brought back in the PS3 Slim .
It has n't .

Put a PS2 disc into the PS3 Slim and it wo n't play .
Which for some will mean nothing , but for others , will mean a great deal .
If that 's you , and you 're after an explanation , SCEA 's director of marketing John Koller has one .
" Now that we 're at a point where we 're three years into the lifecycle of the PS3 , " he told us earlier today , " there are so many PS3 disc - based games that are available that we think — and noticed this from our research — that most consumers that are purchasing the PS3 cite PS3 games as a primary [ reason ] " .

" And it 's not just like 50 or 60 percent .
It 's well into the 80 or 90 percentile range who are purchasing it for PS3 [ games ] .
We do know that there are next gen consumers wanting to come over the the PS3 .
Most of those are consumers who have not utilized their PS2 for a little while and they 're ready to jump into the PlayStation 3 . "
Shame .
A predictable shame , but a shame nonetheless .
BETHLEHEM , West Bank , Aug 12 ( Reuters ) -
The vote count for the parliament of the secular Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was set to begin on Wednesday after long delays , an election official said .
Final results of the complicated election process for the body known as the Revolutionary Council , could take two days and a recount was possible , the official added , after some 700 candidates vied for 80 places available in the 128 - seat body .
Abbas emerged strengthened from Tuesday 's vote for Fatah 's 23 - seat executive body , the Central Committee , as some 2,300 delegates chose 18 younger members and unseated many of the " old guard " of the late Yasser Arafat , Fatah 's founder .
Abbas , 74 , gambled by calling the first congress of his fractious movement in 20 years .
Analysts said the younger executive will rejuvenate Fatah and consolidate his position as its leader .
Senior Fatah members believe the faction is now better placed to seek a crucial reconciliation with its fierce rival , Islamist group Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , restoring some unity to the divided Palestinian nationalist cause .
A reinvigoration of Fatah , battered at parliamentary polls by Hamas in 2006 because of perceived corruption , cronyism and complacency , may also strengthen Abbas 's hand in talks with Israel as U.S. President Barack Obama readies a new peace plan .
Fatah 's marathon congress began in Bethlehem last Tuesday as Palestinians of the diaspora arrived from more than 80 countries for the 44 - year - old movement 's first convention on home soil .
They chose a new line - up of mostly middle - aged men raised under Israeli occupation , replacing some veterans viewed as a gerontocracy living in comfortable exile but clinging to power .
Several Central Committee members , like Arafat , had died .
Of 18 members elected to the 23 - member Central Committee , only one now lives abroad meaning Abbas will no longer have to convene meetings of Fatah 's decision - making body in Jordan .
Abbas will appoint four other committee members later and with him at the head the body will total 23 members .
The election official said the voting committee had received complaints that Revolutionary Council voting papers ended up in Central Committee ballot boxes and that a recount was held , although this did not change the results .
" We have completed the recount on some boxes but the result was unchanged , " Ahmad Sayyad , head of election commission , told Reuters .

Booker T Pulls Up On LL Cool J He Wants All The Smoke

Most cat lovers believe that their cats are smart , but how many would suspect that their pets could graduate from high school ?
Meet Oreo Collins , a tuxedo cat from Macon , Georgia , and the very first in her family to earn a high school diploma .
Rescued from a ditch when she was no more than a tiny ball of fluff by Kelvin Collins , president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Central Georgia , Oreo was always encouraged to achieve her educational potential , which she did by partaking in the BBB ’s ongoing investigation of online diploma mills .
In Collins own words : “ Oreo ’s a really smart cat … I am tickled pink to give her an opportunity to get an education .
We ( the BBB ) do a lot of stories on these diploma mills , but a lot of times consumers really do n’t get it until you show them an example of how they ( the diplomas ) are n't worth much . ”
In the spirit of full disclosure , it must be said that while Oreo garnered mostly A’s on the online test , Collins did help Oreo with both the answers and the essay .
But to be completely fair , Oreo stayed in his lap throughout the test , and Collins got a little help , too .
It must also be said that the GED people claim that Oreo ’s high school diploma is not the same as a GED diploma .
In the words of GED testing spokesperson , Cassandra M. Brown : “ The GED Tests can not be taken online .
They are only available for in - person testing at an Official GED Testing Center . ”
Still Brown also said that the GED Testing service has issued warnings about programs like Jefferson High School Online .
Meanwhile back at the ranch , Oreo remains qualified but unemployed .
He new diploma may be all the more invalid given the fact that Collins admittedly lied about Oreo ’s age on the test .
College seems doubtful and Oreo is disappointed but dealing with it by indulging in some extra whiffs of catnip and having fun with the automatic kitty litter box she received as a reward for her scholastic achievements !

According to news sources , a Better Business Bureau scheme to expose Internet diploma mills has revealed that a two - year - old tuxedo cat named Oreo has received a diploma from Jefferson High School Online following a test and a $ 200 fee paid for by her owner , Kelvin Collins .
It is suspected that she is the first in her family to graduate from school but that is a moot point as she wrote in her “ life experience essay ’ that she had been adopted .

Today 's Germans have not yet fully reconciled their post - Hitler conscience with the use of military force for anything beyond narrow homeland defense .
But Berlin has just tiptoed over another red line , in the Hindu Kush mountains .
To be sure , Germany 's recent first use of heavy weapons and tank - like vehicles in a two - week offensive against insurgents will hardly satisfy the American hope for more German combat action in southern Afghanistan .
Yet the new German assertiveness does augur a certain convergence .
Just as Berlin is getting drawn into easing national restrictions and letting its troops engage in American - style firefights to repulse Taliban intimidation of Afghan villagers , so is the Obama administration shifting American priorities toward German - style emphasis on local civilian development .
After World War II the ( West ) Germans recoiled against Hitler 's violent conquests and renounced possession of armed forces altogether .
Only after a decade – and a fierce controversy – did they acquiesce in forming a new , democratic Army called the Bundeswehr .
Legally they confined it to defense of NATO territory alone and subordinated it to the Western alliance 's command .
Even after the cold war ended in 1989 and Moscow withdrew the 20 Soviet divisions surrounding Berlin a thousand miles to the east – and the United States redefined NATO 's mission as global export of stability – the Germans moved gingerly .
A few Bundeswehr medics joined international monitors in Cambodia in 1992 ; then rather more medics and soldiers went to Bosnia to set up clinics in 1994 ; then German troops joined the NATO - led peacekeeping forces in Kosovo after the 1999 war there .
Only after the provocation of 9/11 did Germans overcome their lingering aversion to participating in combat and send troops to an actual war zone outside the European homeland , dispatching special forces to fight alongside US troops in Afghanistan .
Seven years later , the 4,300 German forces guarding the north Afghan sector constitute the third - largest foreign contingent in the country , after Britain 's 9,000 and America 's dominant 55,000 .
Until now the Tajik northern sector has been far more peaceful than the Pashtun east and south , where US combat forces are concentrated .
In their sector , the Germans could afford to focus on training Afghan troops and police on the one hand and building bridges and schools on the other ( while taking fewer casualties than their American and British allies ) .
But lately the Taliban have reinfiltrated the north and threaten to disrupt this month 's election there , too .
That 's why 300 German Quick Reaction Force troops recently reinforced the anti-Taliban offensive of 1,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen around Kunduz .
This new Bundeswehr posture is still too timid for Washington 's taste , but too bold for many German parliamentarians and voters .
Left Bundestag members and a rising 69 percent of citizens now say they want German soldiers to withdraw from Afghanistan , fast .
Yet at heart , as the new US counterinsurgency doctrine of last December stresses , US - style war fighting and German - style development are both essential .
Mobile infantry sweeps can never win the war if Afghan teenagers with no future prospects constantly replace killed insurgents .
And young Afghans can never imagine a peaceful future for themselves if the Taliban are not blocked from repeatedly blowing up those new schools and bridges .
Surely , transatlantic convergence is called for .

Dear Jane , I do not have any money so I am sending you this drawing I did of a spider instead .
I read recently of a ' qualified ' chiropractor that has been using distance healing for quite some time - claiming he can heal you from his living room .
There ’s no need to visit his office , just call or write and he will do the rest .
Apparently he discovered his special chiropractic skill while he was in his car ; his foot hurt and he told it to realign itself .

" Fuck 2010 " - Soccer for the People , Not for Profit
Activists Reclaim Jozi Streets for Soccer
Half a dozen anarchists , including members of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front , participated in a Reclaim the Streets inspired six - a - side soccer ' tournament ' this Sunday 2nd August in Newtown , Johannesburg .
They were invited to form an anarchist team by the organisers .

The soccer tournament was part of the Recess : Street Credit cultural event and art exhibition which coincided with the annual Khanya College Winter School .
The tournament took place on Henry Nxumalo street in Newtown , under the M1 highway - just a few hundred meters away from the Johannesburg Central Police Station - when activists and soccer enthusiasts cordoned off the road with plastic tape and started playing .
According to a call to participate in the event , the tournament was " intended to disrupt the normal flow of traffic in the square , hijacking the street for creative and political intentions .
The teams have been carefully selected , a minor representation of a larger socio- political body of organisations and collectives " , intending to " bring together a variety of cultural and socio- political activists , for reasons of networking , political engagement and having fun " .
Unfortunately not all of the eight teams invited to participate in the event turned up , but the Siyaphambili Youth Project and the Circled - A Team were present , together with two other teams .
The whole atmosphere of the tournament was against the 2010 World Cup , which is seen by many as the sole preserve of the rich .
The SYP team even had the letters to make up " FUCK 2010 " painted on the back of their teams shirts .
The Circled - A team lost 5 - 3 to a team of youngsters , the fourth and fifth goals being scored in the last two minutes when the anarchist team was looking for the winner ( and then equaliser ) .
The Circled - A team could perhaps have done better but some of the Soweto - based anarchists expected to play on the team were unable to attend because they could not raise the necessary transport money in time .
There has been talk of turning this into the start of a social movements six - a - side league .
In the Great Depression , many a destitute worker contemplated suicide , so what effect is the current recession likely to be having on death rates ?
To find out , David Stuckler at the University of Oxford and colleagues took mortality data on 26 European Union countries from 1970 to 2007 .
They correlated it with data on employment levels , GDP and social security expenditure .
For every 1 per cent increase in unemployment , both suicides and homicides rose by 0.8 per cent .
When employment fell by 3 per cent or more in one go , suicides leapt by 4.4 per cent and homicides by 6.0 per cent .
Although the study covers historic data , the researchers say it applies to the current recession .
In the US , unemployment shot up from 6.7 per cent in January to 9.5 per cent in June .
And in the UK , unemployment rose by about 1.9 per cent to 7.2 per cent in the year to April .

Suicide stopper
In Spain and some Eastern European countries , the jobless figures are climbing much faster .
Spain has 18.7 per cent unemployment , against 13.9 per cent a year ago .
Investing money in government programmes to help people find or keep jobs reduced suicide levels .
Every extra $ 100 spent per unemployed person per year reduced suicide rates by an average of 0.4 per cent , they found .
An unexpected benefit was a 1.4 per cent drop in road traffic deaths for every 1 percent rise in unemployment , probably due to people driving less to save money .
“ Traffic volume falls as people shift to walking and public transport .
Although car factories are suffering , some could see this as a lifestyle blessing in disguise , ” says Stuckler .

Blackberry phones in the United Arab Emirates recently received a text from Etisalat , a major provider in the UAE , prompting for users to download and install an update to enhance performance .
It was an ill radio wave that brought that text to phones because it turns out that the “ update ” downloaded was really software designed to collect received messages and send them back to a central server : essentially spyware .
It ’s still unknown just why Etisalat , which serves 145,000 Blackberry phones in the UAE , included the surveillance software in the update .
RIM ’s official tongue lashing ( by way of a statement ) said that the update not only decreased performance but also that it ’s “ a telecommunications surveillance application . ”
Spyware .
RIM also states that the “ update ” was not authorized by the company .
Etisalat contracted a California - based security software firm known as SS8 to design the update– a firm that has “ lawful intercept and surveillance solutions ” proudly published in clear HTML on the company overview page .
RIM further confirms , in general terms , that a third party patch cannot provide any enhancements
to network services as there is no capability for third parties to develop or modify the low level
radio communications protocols that would be involved in making such improvements to the
communications between a BlackBerry smartphone and a carrier ’s network .
Bad Etisalat .
Down .
In addition to RIM ’s chastisement , a Java programmer , Nigel Gourlay by name , adds his vehement comments to the carrier ’s shameful software push ( aside from calling Etisalat ’s claims “ rubbish ; ” another expert said they were “ completely bogus ” ) :
If you want to solve a problem like the one they are referring to – 2G to 3G handover – then you would address that in the firmware and it would be something that BlackBerry would need to do and not something that Etisalat would have any knowledge of doing .
Handover is done by the device , not by some code that is implemented using Java .
Java is for applications .
Despite all of this hard evidence against Etisalat , the company remains firm in that “ upgrades were required for service enhancements ” and that this entire unfortunate mishap was merely a “ slight technical fault ” – not spyware .
Mm , hmm .
And that vast assemblage of Furbies were n’t spying on us a few years back , either .
We know the truth … and now I ’m feeling some unexplainable urge to go get a roll of tinfoil at the market .
In all seriousness : whatever Etisalat ’s reasoning behind the obvious surveillance software , they had better spit it out soon or else contrive something fantastical enough to believe .
This entire business is both shady and fishy – a dark , dank combination .
In lieu of the sticky software , RIM has developed an application to remove the purported spyware for those who downloaded it .
In conclusion , representatives from Reasearch In Motion will be meeting with Etisilat to talk things over on Wednesday .
We ’ll see what ensues then .
As Wall Street returns to profitability , it is eagerly returning to business as usual .
Most notably it is preparing to pay enormous bonuses , like those that encouraged the sort of risk taking that set off the financial crisis .
That point was underscored in an article in The Times on Sunday by Gretchen Morgenson , which described a new study by James F. Reda & Associates , an independent compensation consultant in New York .
The study used proxy filings to analyze the pay plans at 191 of the nation ’s largest companies in the first half of 2009 .
Instead of seeing a greater reliance on long - term incentive programs , the report found that most companies have actually made short - term incentive pay a bigger part of the compensation package .
The report covered 21 financial firms .
Three , including Goldman Sachs , had reported no changes to their pay policies .
JPMorgan Chase , in contrast , had put more conditions on pay , generally allowing the bank to attach more performance benchmarks and to impose a longer wait before pay is awarded .
What ’s 2.5 miles wide , perfectly circular , and warm enough to melt ice ?
I do n’t know either , but there are at least two of them in Russia ’s Lake Baikal .
They were spotted in April from the international space station .

In this generation of gaming , developers and software publishers alike strive to innovate and re-envision the way we experience our favorite form of entertainment .
With motion control technology on the horizon , high definition gaming , and even eight channels of audio in the games we play , how much more involved with a television can consumers get ?
At the Consumer Electronic Show this year in Las Vegas , Nevada , Sony Computer Entertainment showed off their latest 3D technology for the PlayStation 3 .
Now that it ’s already confirmed to be headed to the PSP as well , multiplatform developers are jumping on the soon - to - be latest trend in gaming .
According to the S - 3D Gaming Alliance :
“ As a technology demo , Electronic Arts Inc. worked with Dynamic Digital Depth ( DDD ) to give a flawless glimpse of what their upcoming award - winning title , Need For Speed SHIFT , will look like when played with stereoscopic 3D drivers .
Other technology demos included Crytek ’s CryEngine3 running in S - 3D with native support , and a showing of Blitz Games Studios ’ Invincible Tiger : The Legend of Han Tao , arguably the first console game to support modern stereoscopic 3D technologies .
To add to the fun , all demos were presented on a huge RealD projection screen as part of SIGGRAPH ’s Computer and Animation Festival . ”
The S - 3D Gaming Alliance are working with manufactures of television sets and monitors to implement their standards of 3D technology , most likely in an attempt to prevent alienation of consumers with sets that do n’t support the 3D .
In any case , 2010 will be an interesting year for gamers everywhere with the new technology dropping .

A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near him .
One day without warning , her parents discovered that she was pregnant .
This made her parents angry .
The girl would not confess who the man was , but after much harassment , she named Hakuin as the father .
In great anger the parents went to the Zen Master and scolded him in front of all his students .
All Hakuin would say was  Is that so ? 
After the baby boy was born , it was entrusted to Hakuin 's care .
By this time he had lost his reputation .
His disciples have left him .
However Hakuin was not disturbed , and enjoyed taking care of the little boy .
He obtained milk and other essentials the boy needed from his neighbors .
A year later , the girl - mother could n't stand it any longer .
She confessed the truth to her parents  that the real father of the boy was not Hakuin but a young man working in the local fishmarket .
The father and mother of the girl went to Hakuin at once .
They asked his forgiveness and apologized profusely to get the boy back .
Although Hakuin loved the child as his own , he was willing .
In giving up the boy , all he said was :  Is that so ? 

Brett Favre told ESPN before the Minnesota Vikings ' game on Monday that he suspects he may have a cracked rib .
Favre has n't had an official diagnosis , but he says taking a deep breath causes discomfort .
The 39 - year - old quarterback was n't listed on the injury report and no other other Vikings official mentioned the injury pregame .
The three - time MVP says he has no plans to wear any kinds of special padding , saying " the damage is done . "
Favre started and is expected to play the entire first half against the Houston Texans .
Favre did n't appear to be in any pain when he handed off to Adrian Peterson on the first play of the game , and Peterson scored on a 75 - yard run .
Favre 's agent Bus Cook wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press that he did n't know if Favre has a cracked rib .
Favre , who signed a $ 25 million deal with the Vikings on Aug. 18 , completed just one pass for four yards over two series in his Minnesota debut just days later .
Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Toyota 's decision to stop making cars in Fremont in March will idle 4,700 workers at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. factory and send a shudder of job losses through more than a thousand California companies that supply parts to the only automotive plant on the West Coast .
The fate of the factory has been in question since June , when General Motors withdrew from the partnership with Toyota that created Nummi in 1984 .
Toyota on Thursday confirmed rumors that had been swirling for weeks that it will close the plant , regardless of financial incentives offered by the state .
" Today is a sad day in the history of Fremont as California joins the ranks of states adversely affected by the bankruptcy of General Motors and the worldwide collapse in demand for automobiles , " said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , adding that the state will now focus on retraining workers and finding alternative uses for the roughly 5 million - square - foot plant .
Nummi worker Ken Villegas said employees learned of the shutdown at a giant plant meeting .
" I do n't think anybody was very surprised , " he said .
" The news has all been bad for months , and we were getting plenty of signals this was coming . "
The East Bay Economic Development Alliance estimated the plant pays an average production wage of $ 65,000 and has a direct payroll of roughly $ 512 million a year .
It also estimated that Nummi supports an additional 18,800 jobs at more than 1,100 supply firms throughout the state with an indirect payroll of $ 904 million .
50,000 jobs may be hit
Other sources have estimated the Nummi effect as even higher , from 30,000 to as many as 50,000 jobs .
Richard Basurto , a 61 - year - old delivery worker at Nummi whose wife is also employed at the factory , said it 's not just income that is imperiled , but health benefits .
" This is going to impact a lot of families , " said Basurto , who considers himself comparatively lucky because he is close to retirement and has a pension .
" There 's a lot of younger families I really feel for . "
Word of the closure rippled through the network of Nummi suppliers .
At Vuteq California Corp. in Hayward , which provides Nummi and another Toyota plant in Mexico with automotive glass and plastic parts , manager Mike " Doc " Skinner was considering how the shutdown would affect his operation and its roughly 70 workers .
" Everything is under review and it is n't clear what happens next , " Skinner said .
Daren Fields , economic development director for the city of Fremont , said an official from Toyota 's North American division said the company simply had too much capacity and could not afford to keep Nummi open , especially without GM as a partner .
Fields said it is too soon to know what will happen to the roughly 300 - acre site because Toyota and the old GM are still negotiating how to dissolve their partnership .
" Nummi is like the child of divorced parents , and they 're still fighting over the assets , " Fields said .
Toyota overbuilt
David Cole , with the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan , said Toyota had overbuilt production just as the recession crippled sales .
" The only way to get rid of capacity is to shut plants down , " he said .
Toyota issued a statement saying " we deeply regret having to take this action , " but that it had decided to shift the production of Tacoma trucks now made at Nummi to a plant in San Antonio , and to assign the Fremont - built Corollas to plants in Japan and in Ontario , Canada .
At the Fremont office of United Auto Workers Local 2244 , which represents plant workers , volunteers continued to prepare for a previously planned Saturday rally in San Francisco .
" This is my second closure , " said Nummi employee Lynn Chess , 53 , who worked for GM before it shut the plant in 1982 only to reopen it later with Toyota .
" That building was there before , " she said , waving at the huge factory across the road , " and I have a feeling it 's going to continue building cars somehow . "

The proportion of young Neets has increased overall
One in six teenagers out of work or education for a long period could be dead within 10 years , a senior government education advisor says .
Jon Coles , director of schools for England at the Department for Children , Schools and Families quoted anecdotal research from the north of England .
He said he was " profoundly shocked " by the figures and that he hoped they were not replicated across England .
Ministers said the research did not represent the national picture .
But he quoted research which looked back at the so - called ' Neets ' ( not in education , employment or training ) of 10 years ago , and discovered that 15 % of those studied had already died .
He told the Westminster Education Forum there was a very clear social cost when young people ceased to have any engagement with society .
He said of the researchers : " They had found one profoundly shocking thing ... that of their long - term Neets of 10 years ago , those who had been outside the system for a long period of time , whether because they were permanently excluded or simply because they had dropped out at the end of compulsory schooling and had not got into anything else , 15 % of those young people of 10 years ago were dead by the time that the research was being done . "
He went on : " For those of us who sometimes console ourselves with the thought that education is not a matter of life and death , actually for those young people , for the most vulnerable children and young people in our society , it really is . "
He also said that a focus on attainment was not enough : " Being focused on attainment and on improving attainment for every single child is a good thing , it 's a profoundly important thing ... but schools need to be bothered , as so many schools already are , about the broader wellbeing and development of children . "
' Guarantee '
The proportion of 16 to 18 - year - olds in England not in education , employment or training in 2008 increased to 10.3 % - up from 9.7 % in 2007 .
Figures from January this year obtained by the Conservatives showed people aged 16 to 24 not in work , education or training went up by 94,000 to 850,000 between 2003 and 2007 .
The Youth Cohort study of the activity of young people in England said in 2007 , 1 % of 16 - 18 year olds were considered " long - term Neets " .
The Conservatives said the government had failed to tackle the problem even before the current recession forced more young people to drop out .
A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokesperson said : " The official made clear that this was one bit of local research which could not be taken as representative of the whole country .
" To extrapolate on what he said to paint a national picture is completely misleading .
" However , it is clear that young people who are NEET are at greater risk of poor health and negative outcomes in later life , which is one of the key reasons we see reducing the NEET numbers as such a high priority . "
She added that since 2007 , the September Guarantee aimed to ensure that every student who wanted to continue in education after their GCSE had the offer of a suitable place in learning .

I 'm going to be speaking next week at Gnomedex , a premier tech conference held annually in Seattle and run by my friend the übergeek Chris Pirillo ( and I mean that in a good way ) .
I 'll be talking about the spread of information and misinformation through social media , specifically Twitter .
Remember the Texas fireball , and how the ( wrong ) idea that it was debris from a satellite collision spread like wildfire on Twitter ?
That 's the sort of thing I 'll be discussing .
I 'm also going to talk about other social media / networks like Digg and Reddit .
I happen to find both of those sites useful , but both have their disadvantages too .
This blog gets linked commonly from both , and I 'm looking into trending and such on them .
But I want to get opinions from people who have used one or both of them : what do you like and dislike about them ?
Which one ( if either ) is easier to use , has more reliable commenting , links to better stuff ?
I 'd post this on those sites , but that would be like walking into an Apple store and declaring IE 8 to be the best browser ever .
I prefer to keep any firefights local , thankyouverymuch .
So let me know what you think in the comments below !
I can't promise to use anything specific in the talk -- and I 'm sure I 'll be able to make some general observations based on what y'all say -- but if you have specifics , let 's hear it !
Whistleblower Office Home
The IRS Whistleblower Office pays money to people who blow the whistle on persons who fail to pay the tax that they owe .
If the IRS uses information provided by the whistleblower , it can award the whistleblower up to 30 percent of the additional tax , penalty and other amounts it collects .
News from the Whistleblower Office
The Secretary of the Treasury reports to Congress each fiscal year on the use of Internal Revenue Code section 7623 .
The Whistleblower Office Report to Congress PDF for the fiscal year ending September 30 , 2019 was released on January 6 , 2020 .
Reports for prior years are also available .
for the fiscal year ending September 30 , 2019 was released on January 6 , 2020 .
Reports for prior years are also available .
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 adds a new Internal Revenue Code subsection – 7623 ( c ) expanding the definition of proceeds for whistleblower awards .
This applies to any open whistleblower claim .
Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement Memorandum on Debriefing dated August 4,2017 PDF
Treasury issued final regulations to implement section 7623 effective on August 12 , 2014 :
The regulations generally apply to claims that are open as of the effective date .
Section 301.7623 - 4 , which contains the rules for determining the amount and payment of awards , applies to claims for award under section 7623 ( b ) that are open as of August 12 , 2014 , and to information submitted after that date .
The amount and payment of awards under 7623 ( a ) for information received prior to August 12 , 2014 will be paid under the rules described in the Internal Revenue Manual .

Information About Submitting a Whistleblower Claim
Who can get an award ?
The IRS may pay awards to people who provide specific and credible information to the IRS if the information results in the collection of taxes , penalties , interest or other amounts from the noncompliant taxpayer .
The IRS is looking for solid information , not an “ educated guess ” or unsupported speculation .
We are also looking for a significant Federal tax issue - this is not a program for resolving personal problems or disputes about a business relationship .
What are the rules for getting an award ?
The law provides for two types of awards .
If the taxes , penalties , interest and other amounts in dispute exceed $ 2 million , and a few other qualifications are met , the IRS will pay 15 percent to 30 percent of the amount collected .
If the case deals with an individual , his or her annual gross income must be more than $ 200,000 .
If the whistleblower disagrees with the outcome of the claim , he or she can appeal to the Tax Court .
These rules are found at Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 7623 ( b ) - Whistleblower Rules .
The IRS also has an award program for other whistleblowers - generally those who do not meet the dollar thresholds of $ 2 million in dispute or cases involving individual taxpayers with gross income of less that $ 200,000 .
The awards through this program are less , with a maximum award of 15 percent up to $ 10 million .
In addition , the awards are discretionary and the informant cannot dispute the outcome of the claim in Tax Court .
The rules for these cases are found at Internal Revenue Code IRC Section 7623 ( a ) - Informant Claims Program , and some of the rules are different from those that apply to cases involving more than $ 2 million .
If you decide to submit information and seek an award for doing so , use IRS Form 211 PDF .
The same form is used for both award programs .

Historical Information
NEW ORLEANS — On Dec. 5 , 1994 , seven daily newspapers in Mexico City ran half - page ads with a photograph of the Legionaries of Christ founder , Father Marcial Maciel Degollado , kissing the ring of Pope John Paul II .
An open letter from the pope , celebrating Maciel 's 50th anniversary as a priest , called him " an efficacious guide to youth . "
On Tuesday in Mexico City , an attorney named Jose Bonilla announced that Maciel had six children .
Two daily papers , La Jornada and Milenio reported that Bonilla was taking legal action against Maciel 's estate on behalf of three of them , who are now adults .
Bonilla is seeking legal recognition for his clients as heirs to Maciel .
Only one has been identified .
Norma Hilda Rivas , 23 , reportedly born in Mexico , now lives in Madrid " and enjoys a level of affluence such that she does not work [ and ] lives in a luxury apartment ... acquired by Marcial Maciel with money from the congregation 's benefactors , " according to La Jornada .
Bonilla 's announcement is just the latest action against Maciel , who died in 2008 at the age of 87 .
In 1941 , Maciel founded the religious order the Legionaries of Christ and became the greatest fundraiser of the modern church .
John Paul never wavered in his support of Maciel , even after a 1998 canon law case filed in a Vatican tribunal by eight former Legionaries accused him of abusing them as seminarians .
The case gathered dust until 2004 , when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in the final months of John Paul 's life ordered an investigation of Maciel .
A few months later Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI .
In 2006 , Benedict dismissed Maciel from active ministry , though without specifying why .
In February , the Legion shocked its followers by disclosing that Maciel had fathered a daughter out of wedlock .
The Vatican announced a new investigation , this time of the Legion itself .
Catholic blogs have raised questions about the daughter , her mother , whether they have financial support from the Legion , how much — and how long — Legion officials knew about them .
In June the Holy See named six bishops from as many countries as " visitators " to gather information from Legion schools , seminaries and colleges in Latin America , North America and Europe .
As the investigation progresses , it seems that one of Maciel 's hidden connections has gone public .
Rivas 's mother was interviewed in an Aug. 9 report in the Madrid webmagazine PeriodistaDigital .
" When I met this man I was under aged , " Norma Hilda Banos , identified as 48 and a native of Acapulco , said of Maciel .
" Neither my daughter nor I knew who this man really was until the very end . "
The daughter " was abused by her father , Maciel , " PeriodistaDigital quoted Hilda Banos as saying .
" She suffers from severe trauma from her childhood and I do n't believe she is ever going to get over it . "
The site further reports that Maciel left Hilda Banos " two homes in her name in the exclusive Madrid building where she lives and three [ other ] places , all valued at about 2 million euros . "
The report states that mother and daughter receive a generous monthly stipend from the Legion in exchange for their silence , citing Bonilla as a source .
Bonilla won a civil judgment against the Legion several years ago in a suit on behalf of his own child , who was sexually abused by a teacher at the Legion 's elite Oxford School in Mexico City , according to Milenio .
As the Holy See presumably awaits the results of the Apostolic Visitation by the investigating prelates — including Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput and Bishop Ricardo Blazques of Balboa , Spain — a larger question concerns the church itself .
How long have Vatican officials known that Maciel had a child , or children ?
Father Alvaro Corcuero , the Legion director - general chosen by Maciel to succeed him when the founder stepped down in 2004 , undoubtedly had access to the Legion 's financial records .
At what point did he advise Benedict of what he knew ?
The decision by which Corcuero began disclosing that Maciel had " a double life " to Legionary members last February clearly was not his alone .
The Vatican understandably wanted to put distance between Benedict and the Legionaries .
In that sense , the bishops ' investigation of the Legion is also providing cover for the pope .
The issue now is not just Maciel 's sordid secret life but financial accountability .
If the Legion gave material support to one or more children of Maciel , any number of benefactors he cultivated in establishing a religious order with a $ 650 million budget for schools and colleges in North America , South America and Europe were duped , if not defrauded in a legal sense .
The Legion 's legendary fundraising operations drew heavily on videotapes in which Maciel appeared with Pope John Paul II .
In one video , John Paul tells a large gathering from the balcony at St. Peter 's , " You are all sons and daughters of Father Maciel . "
Jason Berry is coauthor of " Vows of Silence , " a book about Maciel , and producer of a documentary about the 2006 Vatican prosecution .
Tijuana , BC .
La entidad ocupa el segundo lugar nacional en generación de empleos formales durante enero de este año , con la apertura de 10,898 nuevas plazas aseguradas en el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social ( IMSS ) , sólo detrás de Nuevo León , de acuerdo con datos de la Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Estado .
Sin embargo , la queja recurrente es que los salarios de estos empleos oscilan entre los 1,200 y 1,500 pesos semanales , insuficiente para hacer frente al crecimiento en los precios al consumidor , que en los casos de Mexicali y Tijuana alcanzó 6.34 y 6.55 % anual en la primera quincena de febrero del 2017 .
El director ejecutivo de Empleo Nuevo , Noé Morales , dijo que el rechazo que la población ha mantenido para ingresar a un trabajo con estos salarios ha obligado a que las empresas locales incrementen los sueldos o cambien de estrategia para hacer los empleos más atractivos .
Hay una empresa que hace rines que apenas en diciembre pagaban 1 , 200 pesos y hoy lo mínimo son 1 , 600 pesos .
Y lo hicieron porque no tuvieron de otra , la gente no quiere estos salarios porque no les alcanza , y las fábricas se están quedando sin gente .
Además , advirtió que en Tijuana por lo menos unas 170,000 personas cobran 1,200 pesos cada semana , aunque hay otras , en menor proporción , que alcanzan los 1,600 pesos junto con prestaciones , pero hay casos aislados como Toyota donde el sueldo llega hasta los 2,700 pesos semanales .
Por su parte , el director del Servicio Nacional de Empleo en Baja California , Rodolfo Enríquez Martínez , afirmó que estos salarios continúan siendo un problema para la gente , que piensa en la escalada de precios que arrancó desde inicio de año , primero con el costo de la gasolina , el gas , la electricidad e incluso la canasta básica .
Lo primero que le pedimos a las empresas que nos piden ayuda para contratar es que los salarios sean atractivos , sabemos que es lo primero que la gente rechaza y por eso no se queda , es un problema constante porque no hay salario que alcance .
Explicó que el problema para las empresas es que no todas pueden incrementar sus salarios cuando también les aumentó el costo de los insumos , ya que con la depreciación del peso frente al dólar los productos que compran también tienen un precio más alto .
Nivel de ingresos
Además , se suman otros factores que merman el mercado laboral .
El primero es el salario diario asociado a trabajadores asegurados en el IMSS en la entidad , que en enero del presente año aumentó 1.89 % a tasa anual , el menor nivel en 14 meses .
El segundo , según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía ( Inegi ) , de la población ocupada de Baja California ( 1.6 millones de personas ) , 31.9 % recibe de dos hasta tres salarios mínimos , 21.6 % de uno a dos y 4.9 % , hasta un salario mínimo ; mientras sólo 8.3 % de los ocupados recibe más de cinco salarios mínimos .

I was talking to Ricky Jay about lying and deception .
I had an example from the Bible , specifically about Jacob and his 12 sons .
( Five of them are depicted by Velazquez , above . )
Ricky interrupted : “ Which one ?
Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah , Dan , Napthali , Gad , Asher , Issachar , Zebulon , Joseph or Benjamin ? ”
“ Uh . . . Joseph . ”
Ricky Jay is an actor , bibliophile , historian of magic , arguably the greatest living sleight - of - hand artist , and a master of the art of deception .
He seemed to be the perfect person to consult on the relationship between deception and lying .
After all , it ’s his business .
I was telling the story about how the brothers sell Joseph into slavery .
ERROL MORRIS :
They take his coat , rip it , smear it with blood , and show it to Jacob .
They do n’t tell Jacob that Joseph was eaten by a wild beast ; Jacob makes the false inference himself .
My theory is that deceit does not require language .
To lie , you have to make a statement .
You have to say something in words for it to be a lie .
But deceit only requires misdirection .
All it requires is the intent to have someone think something that is different from what you believe .
RICKY JAY : Right , it can be verbal .
ERROL MORRIS :
It can be , but it does n’t have to be .
Whereas lying has to be verbal .
RICKY JAY : Lying has to be verbal .
Do I believe that ?
[ a pause ]
ERROL MORRIS : And it ca n’t be accidental .
You can accidentally deceive somebody , but you ca n’t accidentally lie to somebody .
If you ’re lying to somebody , you have to know you ’re doing it .
RICKY JAY : I ’ve written about verbal deception , for example , the P.T. Barnum sign – “ TO THE EGRESS ” — to make someone believe something that was other than what was intended .
Even though there was nothing wrong with it — it ’s deceptive .
[ The sign is intended make people believe that they are about to visit some exotic animal , rather than heading to the exit . ]
I wrote an article about verbal deception in “ Jay ’s Journal ” on the Bonassus .
“ Jay ’s Journal of Anomalies , ” courtesy of Ricky Jay
The Bonassus was presented in 1821 as this extraordinarily exotic creature .
I ’ll read just the opening : “ The Bonassus , according to contemporary handbills , has been captured as a six - week - old cub deep in the interiors of America … ” — blah , blah , blah …
“ It was presented to a populous eager for amusement and edification ” — this was in London — “ whose appetite for curiosities both animal and human was insatiable . ”
The attraction said , “ A newly discovered animal , comprising the head and eye of an elephant , the horns of an antelope , a long black beard , the hind parts of a lion , the foreparts of a bison , cloven - footed , has a flowing mane from shoulder to fetlock joint and chews the cud . ”
And underneath the line , “ ‘ Take him for all in all , we ne ’er shall look upon his like again . ’ — Shakespeare . ”
“ Jay ’s Journal of Anomalies , ” courtesy of Ricky Jay
And I say ,
“ Using every conceivable method of prevarication , the playbills of the day unabashedly conceal the true identity of the newly discovered Bonassus , this new genus ” — that ’s a quote — “ of the African Kingdom had never before been seen in Europe .
He was none other than the American Buffalo .
As for never seeing his like again , in 1821 the buffalo was the most numerous hoof - footed quadruped on the face of the earth . ”
ERROL MORRIS : Perfect .
RICKY JAY : This is an issue called “ Verbal Deception Deciphered . ”
ERROL MORRIS :
You were also telling me about a magician who refuses to lie .
RICKY JAY : He died recently .
His name was Jerry Andrus , and he lived in Albany , Ore .
And he always claimed that it was because he lived in Oregon that he had to invent his own stuff .
He really was an original thinker in terms of magic .
He just died .
He was almost 90 . [ 1 ]

But he would n’t lie in doing an effect .
So if he said , “ I ’m going to place this card in the middle of the deck , ” then that ’s what he did .
[ Ricky picked up a deck of cards and proceeded to offer an impressive display of legerdemain . ]
If I say to you , “ I ’m going to take this card , whatever it is , the King of Clubs , and you can see that I ’m going to push that , right , into the center of the deck . ”
O.K. , you saw me do that clearly ?
ERROL MORRIS : Yes .
RICKY JAY : And yet , the King of Clubs is right here .
[ It is sitting at the top of the deck . ]
So I truly did not push it into the center of the deck .
I made you think that I pushed it into the center of the deck .
But I did n’t push that card into the center of the deck and then show it to you on the top of the deck .
ERROL MORRIS :
You may not be lying , but you ’re still deceiving me .
RICKY JAY : Right , I ’m absolutely deceiving you .
He would also deceive you .
He might go so far as to say , “ It may appear as though I ’m putting the card in the center of the deck . ”
But he would never say , “ I am putting the card in the center of the deck . ”
He would not lie .
ERROL MORRIS : But does n’t that alert people to the fact that they are being deceived ?
Does n’t that make it more difficult to perform the trick ?
RICKY JAY : Yes !
It does make it more difficult , but that ’s just the kind of guy he was .
So he would never say , “ I ’m dealing the King of Clubs on the table , ” and deal the bottom card and not the King of Clubs .
He would not lie .
He was an enormously principled fellow .
ERROL MORRIS : But do you have a problem lying ?
RICKY JAY : Not only do I lie , I take real pleasure in lying , in the transmission of magic effects .
It ’s creative , how you do it .
I could , indeed , put the King of Clubs in the center of the deck .
So in this case , I want you to see that the King of Clubs is in the center of the deck .
All right ?
That ’s not a lie .
And yet the King is now on top .
I do n’t think this was in his repertoire .
But in that effect I did not lie to you at all .
So that ’s kind of fascinating .

ERROL MORRIS : I wonder if this bears out what I was saying before , the difference between a lie and a deception , that he would not allow himself a verbal lie .
RICKY JAY : But he would still absolutely deceive you .
ERROL MORRIS : But not lie .
Private Collection of Ricky Jay
RICKY JAY :
You could wonder whether I ’m lying to you now , about those two things and how they differ , because you do n’t know .
Because I know that you ca n’t follow the sleight of hand I ’m doing to absolutely know for certain .
And I ’m not going to expose the method to show you that , but as your friend , I ’m going to tell you that nothing about this was a lie .
Everything I said in the transmission of these two effects was true .
But in magic , there is magician to magician lying and obfuscation .
To obfuscate the reconstruction of the effect – when a magician is fooled by another magician doing magic .
In my career that ’s not been the major passion , but it ’s been the passion of a number of my mentors .
The crowning achievement for them would be to create magic good enough to fool other magicians .
For me , the most exciting thing is to create good magic that ’s entertaining for an audience , and it would be lovely if a magician was fooled as well .
But it ’s an entertainment art .
Dai Vernon , the greatest sleight of hand figure in the history of the art , rarely performed .
But he invented magic and had an enormous influence on the whole range of sleight of hand .
And so often the magic he was doing was to fool other magicians .
You do n’t want the magicians to be able to reconstruct it .
So in the course of it , the other magician is not only being fooled by the physical deception , but made to think that something might have happened which did not happen , and if you thought that , you could never reconstruct how the effect was done .
ERROL MORRIS :
So there ’s a misdirection followed by a lie .
RICKY JAY : In any order .
But you ’re right , the lie part is verbal .
You ’re saying , “ Remember , you shuffled the cards .
Remember , you divided the deck . ”
And in this list of things you ’re doing , one of them may be untrue .
You may be lying .
Ah , I did shuffle the cards .
I did this but I did n’t do that .
You ’re reinforcing something that never happened .

ERROL MORRIS : A deception and a lie .
RICKY JAY : Deception is one of the things that I ’m interested in .
It ’s a major component of my work .
If someone said you had to sum up your interests in life in one word , the word would probably be “ deception . ”
I think it encompasses more things I ’m interested in than any other single word I can think of .

You might think that once we have distinguished between lying and deception ( and two kinds of deception , verbal and otherwise ) that our problems are over .
But lying is often identified with the avoidance of the truth or the acceptance of a falsehood .
And it is to the theme of lying , truth and falsehood that I turn in the second part of this essay .

Take a look at the contrasting headlines from the NY Times and Politico ( via TPM ) :
New York Times : " False ' Death Panel ' Rumor Has Some Familiar Roots " Politico : " Sarah Palin and " death panels " - is she helping or hurting her political future ? "
Politico does some interesting reporting , no doubt about that .
If you want to check the latest gossip on Capitol Hill , Politico is the place to go .
But if you 're looking for objective reporting , Politico is n't exactly the symbol of journalistic integrity .

Politico , much like the Main Stream Media , view politics as a sport .
Sarah Palin's assertion that the Obama Administration would run health care ' Death Panels ' is demonstrably false , yet Politico reports on the statement it in terms of its political effectiveness .
Extending the corporate media 's journalistic culture to the web may be an effective business model , but it goes agains the spirit of the alternative media .
It is our job to call B.S , not promote it for ratings .
Ann Valentine is in the Department of Chemistry at Yale University , and works on how biology handles metal ions that are very sensitive to hydrolysis .
1 . What made you want to be a chemist ?
It was a “ Goldilocks ” decision … I loved basic science , but biology is too big ( and also too complicated ) , and physics is too small ( particle physics ) …
AND too big ( astrophysics ) .
Chemistry ‘ the molecular scale ’ was just right .
Also , in my sophomore year of high school , my science club mentor , Ada Margaret Hutchison , let us have free rein in the lab for most of the year .
I set a lot of things on fire .
And I thought : sign me up for THIS !
2 . If you were n’t a chemist and could do any other job , what would it be – and why ?
I ’d be a middle school science teacher .
I love doing outreach programs with that age group – when kids are n’t too cool to get unabashedly excited about science .
High school kids , on the other hand , terrify me .
There have been exceptions , but they ’re often too busy impressing each other to really get into science .
3 . What are you working on now , and where do you hope it will lead ?
In one of our projects I ’m thinking about this afternoon , we ’re working out some fundamental interactions of Ti( IV ) with biomolecules that I hope will lead one day to a wide appreciation for a role for this metal ion in biology .
Right now we all think of titanium as being mostly inert , but I find it hard to accept that biology would never have found a productive use for this incredibly abundant element for which humans have found many applications .
4 . Which historical figure would you most like to have dinner with – and why ?
I ’d pick Ed Ricketts , a sort of renegade marine biologist who worked in Monterey , CA until the 1940s .
He was a buddy of John Steinbeck and the inspiration for his character “ Doc ” in Cannery Row .
Steinbeck wrote a tribute called About Ed Ricketts that ’s now published with The Log from the Sea of Cortez , a book which describes their great adventure together .
Reading that tribute makes me want to have a meal – or maybe a beer – with Ricketts .
I imagine it would be scientifically enlightening but mostly really , really entertaining .
5 . When was the last time you did an experiment in the lab – and what was it ?
My most recent lab notebook entry is June 22 , 2007 .
I was trying to troubleshoot the purification of a ferritin protein by getting in there and doing it all myself .
The final gel is missing because I got distracted by some other demand on my time and left the gel in destain for a week .
More often now , rather than trying to do anything myself , l spend a few hours alongside a grad student “ helping ” them with an experiment or an instrument they ’re having trouble with – most often they figure it out themselves just to get me out of their way .
6 . If exiled on a desert island , what one book and one music album would you take with you ?
Wow , the urge is so strong to pick some highbrow thing that will make me sound smart and impressive .
But I ’ll be honest – the one book I re-read every few years is A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving .
And an album I ’d listen to anytime would be by Marc Cohn – let ’s say his “ Live 04 - 05 ” disc for a mix of older and newer .
7 . Which chemist would you like to see interviewed on Reactions – and why ?
Have you interviewed Harry Gray yet ?
He can always be counted on to be entertaining – I ’ll bet he ’d have great answers to your questions .
Dick Bove points out this is insane :
It is being reported that China Investment Corp ( CIC ) intends to purchase $ 2 billion of AAA rated , distressed mortgages in the United States .
The press reports are suggesting that CIC is presently interviewing 9 American money managers .
These managers have been approved by the Treasury to participate in the PPIP program as servicers .
CIC will pick one or perhaps two to manage its investment program .
Note that the PPIP program :
Has the Treasury matches whatever a private investor puts up , then credits 6X as much capital .
So if the Chinese are buying $ 2 billion , the US puts up $ 2 billion , and then the PPIP allows the purchase of $ 24 billion of distressed assets in the open market .
All for $ 2 billion dollars .
Oh , and the FDIC would guarantee the debt being issued by the PPIP .
Hence , taxpayer dollars are subsidizing Chinese purchases of U.S. assets at a discount .
This is insanity . . .
Computers may be good at crunching numbers , but can they crunch feelings ?
The rise of blogs and social networks has fueled a bull market in personal opinion : reviews , ratings , recommendations and other forms of online expression .
For computer scientists , this fast - growing mountain of data is opening a tantalizing window onto the collective consciousness of Internet users .
An emerging field known as sentiment analysis is taking shape around one of the computer world ’s unexplored frontiers : translating the vagaries of human emotion into hard data .
This is more than just an interesting programming exercise .
For many businesses , online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency that can make or break a product in the marketplace .
Yet many companies struggle to make sense of the caterwaul of complaints and compliments that now swirl around their products online .
As sentiment analysis tools begin to take shape , they could not only help businesses improve their bottom lines , but also eventually transform the experience of searching for information online .
The design for the Melbourne Theater Company begins with the dramatic façade : 3D iridescent steel tubing folds and bends against black aluminum cladding – just as an actor brings performance to life against a dark backdrop .
The interior is comprised of the Sumner Theater , a 500 - seat hall noticeably without a balcony or mezzanine space , but still allowing exceptional site lines to the stage regardless of where your season tickets land you .
The most striking element inside the main theater is the Word Wall – 70 quotes from different plays are illuminated when the stage is dark .
The building also houses a full rehearsal hall that can be used as an event space or a smaller performance space , as well as a café and bar at the front of the house .
This blog post is written by Matthew Miner who is working on a cutscene editor for Unity .
The cutscene editor is one of four selected projects that were selected for the Unity Summer of Code .
As described in an earlier blog post , the Cutscene Editor is a tool for creating realtime cutscenes without touching a script .
This allows both veteran Unity developers and those new to the engine to easily toss together a scene without too much fuss .
It works similar to modern video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere , with a media browser and a preview window and a timeline .
Anyone who has ever edited together a movie on their computer will find a familiar user interface which has been designed with ease - of - use in mind .
It ʼs perhaps important that I emphasize the realtime aspect .
This is not a tool for preparing pre-rendered scenes , as pretty as they can be .
The visual quality of the scene will depend on the player ’s hardware just as the rest of the game does .
There are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach , but as some famous man once said , “ realtime is the only time .
For real . ”
How ’s It Going ?
With not much more than a week to go , development of the Cutscene Editor is going well .
It is n’t done yet ( ha , I wish ! ) , but with a few more late nights and a bit of fairy magic it will be .
In its current state the basics of creating a cutscene are there .
You can add a bunch of camera shots , toss them on the timeline , throw in a few explosion animations here and there , maybe chuck in some heavy metal background music , and it will play as expected when you call scene .
PlayCutscene ( ) .
Where a lot of works needs to be done before the August 31st deadline is the ease by which the developer using the editor can modify the timing of clips on the timeline .
Initially thereʼs going to be two tools : the multi- purpose trim - n - drag for moving clips around , and the razor blade for splitting clips into two .
Right now these donʼt really work .
Neither does the preview window , an arguably essential part of the editor .
So itʼs not quite in a “ gee willikers , it just works ! ” stage , but once these features are implemented and a bit more polish added itʼll be close to the original vision .
Golly , Do Tell Me More !
Above is a screenshot of the Cutscene Editor in its current incarnation .
There are four main panes : options , media , effects , and the timeline .
The editor introduces some concepts blatantly stolen from the film world .
Shots : a cameraʼs view in a limited amount of time ; an animation can be attached to replicate moves like dolly or crane shots
Actors : animated game objects
Audio : dialog , sound effects , background music
Subtitles : captions that transcribe the current dialog / narrative
For clarityʼs sake , each track can only hold a particular media type .
That is , you canʼt throw a camera shot onto the same track as an audio clip .
The timeline can be zoomed in when precision editing is desired .
Clips are added to the track by clicking the “ Insert ” button beside each piece of media , which will place them with their default time at the position of the playhead .
Drag and drop ability was desired , but at this point it may not happen .
Version 1.1 perhaps ?
For the most part it should feel intuitive .
I referred extensively to how the interface of Final Cut Pro works , so those coming from a video editing background should feel right at home .
Challenges
Most of my time has been spent building the user interface .
Anyone who has used Unityʼs GUI system knows that it ’s not a drag - and - drop affair ; every label and button is created in code .
This works great most of the time , but creating an editor as customized as a timeline has been difficult .
Creating a basic GUI is smooth sailing , do n’t get me wrong , but there was no documentation on how to , say , draw a line over the timeline to appear as a playhead .
It has certainly been a learning experience .
Despite the challenges , I ’m blown away by how extensible the Unity editor is .
It completely rocks being able to build my own tools so easily , and I plan to continue working on similar projects in the future .
Rahm Emanuel 's request came on the same day that Obama himself told a meeting of Democratic senators that he did n't like seeing dollars used by liberal groups to target congressional Democrats .
Rahm warns liberal groups to stop ads
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel warned liberal groups this week to stop running ads against Democratic members of Congress .
The powerful top aide to President Obama made his feelings known at the weekly closed - door strategy session of an array of progressive organizations , according to two sources who were there .

Emanuel ’s request came on the same day that Obama himself told a meeting of Democratic senators that he did n’t like seeing dollars used by liberal groups to target congressional Democrats .
Some on the left believe administration officials are making such statements only as a favor to Democratic legislators whose votes they ’ll ultimately need .
But the White House indicates to POLITICO that it truly believe the ads aimed at Democrats are counter - productive and largely ineffectual .
There is no winking and nodding when Obama and Emanuel deliver their message , say West Wing officials .
Moderate Democrats who are elected and re-elected in GOP - leaning districts and states earned their spurs in part by running away from liberal orthodoxy and are unlikely to be moved by outside progressive groups , goes the White House thinking .
It ’s a delicate issue for Obama , who wants his own supporters to aggressively lobby their representatives during the August recess but also does n’t want to create a backlash among centrist Democrats who relish their independence and the power that comes with being a swing vote .
Organizing for America , the president ’s political arm , is engaged in an intensive grassroots effort to rally support for healthcare reform legislation , going so far as to air ads in the states and districts of targeted Democratic members of Congress .
But the spots were tame , not mentioning the names of the members , and White House officials indicated that they were being run to give their allies air cover to support the legislation .
Representatives from progressive groups say they have not heard directly from Obama officials on their Democratic ads , but the White House points to Emanuel ’s statement Tuesday when asked whether they ’ve made their feelings known to third - party organizations .
The liberal groups say they have no intention of pulling down ads aimed at Democrats – and note that they ’re also targeting Republicans .
“ We continue to run ads supporting health care reform in states and districts of both Republican and Democratic members of Congress , ” said Jacki Schechner , spokeswoman for Health Care for America Now .
Democracy for America , the organization founded in the wake of Howard Dean ’s presidential bid , is partnering with another progressive group to target Democrats and has tangled with Sen.
Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , who suggested the ads being aired against him made it less likely that a healthcare bill would pass .
“ We have not heard from the White House , ” said Jim Dean , the chair of Democracy for America and the former DNC chair ’s brother .
“ The ads are part of a much larger campaign that we are conducting to mobilize one million DFA members to engage all congressionals – Republicans and Democrats alike — in various ways ( meetings with staff , petitions , ads , etc. ) to support the President 's plan . ”
Janet Napolitano on Bill Maher Show
By Allan Lengel
ticklethewire.com
HBO tv host Bill Maher can be downright tough as an interviewer .
But Friday night was just short of a love fest when Homeland Security Sec. Janet Napolitano appeared via satellite on his 11 p.m. show “ Real Time With Bill Maher ” .
She must have the right touch .
After several questions — mostly softballs —
Maher ended the the brief interview by saying : “ Well again , I thank you so much for being here and I thank what you ’re doing for our country . ”
One of the tougher points
Maher tried to make went like this : “ GAO investigators recently smuggled bomb making materials , well , as a test into 10 high - security federal buildings including a Homeland Security Building , the Justice Department , the State Department and they got in everywhere and they said it cost them $ 150 to buy the materials off the Internet and they assembled them in four minutes . ”
Napolitano responded : “ What it tells me is what we ’re doing to protect some of these federal buildings is not adequate and we ’re busy at work now looking at what ’s been done in the past and reforming that entire system . ”
Maher was downright playful at times , complaining at one point about having to check in luggage because of airport bans on liquids .
“ Between arriving two hours early and having to check baggage and having to put the pot in my deo … ”
He stopped .
Laughter erupted in the audience .
“ Boy did I say that to the wrong person .
Ok , forget that quote , ” he said .
Napolitano took it all good naturedly and responded : ” “ What we find is Americans overall are understanding of why these restrictions are on . ”
If she appears on the show two years from now and still gets the same warm and fuzzy reception , it ’s probably because she ’s done a darn good job as chief of Homeland Security .
Time — and possibly Bill Maher — will tell .
Blackwater staff provided security for US officials in Iraq
The CIA hired contractors from the US private security firm Blackwater as part of a secret programme to track and kill top al - Qaeda figures , reports say .
The New York Times quotes current and ex-government officials as saying Blackwater helped the CIA with planning , training and surveillance .
Several million dollars were spent on the programme but no militants were caught or captured , the report says .
Blackwater staff were used to guard US government personnel in Iraq from 2003 .
But they were accused of using excessive force on a number of occasions , including the killing of 17 civilians in Baghdad in 2007 .
The North Carolina - based firm has not had its licence to operate in Iraq renewed .
The company , which was founded by Erik Prince , has since been re-named Xe. Lethal authority '
The New York Times reports that the CIA did not have a formal contract with Blackwater for the programme to locate and kill senior members of al - Qaeda .
Profile : Blackwater Worldwide Instead , they had individual agreements with top officials in the firm , the paper goes on to say .
It is not clear whether the US spy agency planned to use Blackwater contractors to actually capture and kill the militants , or just help with the training and surveillance of the programme , the report says .
Meanwhile , the Washington Post reports that the assassination programme was initially launched in 2001 as a CIA - led effort to kill or capture top al - Qaeda figures using the agency 's paramilitary forces .
But in 2004 , after briefly terminating the programme , the CIA decided to revive it using outside contractors , the Post quotes officials as saying .
Leon Panetta - who became director of the CIA under President Obama 's administration - is said to have learnt about the secret programme in June .
The next day he called an emergency meeting with congressional intelligence committees to tell them about its existence , and to say that it was being cancelled .
The New York Times quotes officials as saying the fact that the CIA used an outside company for the programme was a major reason Mr Panetta became alarmed and called the meeting .
Although some controversial work , including the interrogation of prisoners , has been outsourced in recent years , the fact that outsiders were used in a programme with " lethal authority " raised concerns about accountability in covert operations , officials were quoted as saying .
The House of Representatives ' intelligence committee is investigating whether the CIA broke the law by not informing Congress about the programme for eight years .
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee , said last month that Mr Panetta told Congress former Vice - President Dick Cheney was behind the secrecy .
But some Republicans accuse the Democrats of trying to make political capital from the situation .
" I think there was a little more drama and intrigue than was warranted , " Representative Peter Hoekstra , the most senior Republican on the House intelligence committee , told the Times .

House speaker Nancy Pelosi gave her minions ( the House democrats ) a tiny little note card that they are to “ never leave home without . ”
The note card is essentially , as politico.com put it , “ a personalized cheat sheet to help Democratic members tell their constituents what they 'll gain fromhealth carereform . ”
Even more humorously , the GOP strategy is to simply “ ram it down their throats . ”
The logic is that since most Americans hate this health care reform bill , you might as well take the fight straight to the democrats .
I 've put the article in the link above .
The point in mentioning the article is that it sheds light on something I 've been noticing for a while now .
Some call it “ politics as usual ” , I call it greedy politicians trying to dupe the American people .
Apparently duping the American people is n't very hard , considering they do it every election .
I 'm not exactly agreeing with Bill Maher or anything , but he is n't exactly wrong either .
What I mean to say is , not only do the Democrats NOT have an answer for our failing health care system , neither do Republicans .
I have not heard once from Michael Steele on what exactly THEIR plan is .
I could be misinformed and if I am , please enlighten me .
History has shown that a free market model of health care works the best .
According to Ron Paul , in his book The Revolution : A Manifesto , we had a system like that as early as the 1950's !
What went wrong ?
Well , increased government bureaucracy , which in turn raised prices , which led to more government interference , which led to …well you get my point .
Both parties appear out of touch and slowly fading away .
This health care issue is also shedding light on that as well .
What I 'm seeing now is a Democratic party in way over their head , and a Republican party trying not to get rubbed out as the primary party for economic and individual freedom .
The Libertarian party seems to be growing strong , but who knows when they 'll hit their stride .
The next time I go to vote , and I do n't expect anyone else to follow my example , I vote independent .
Voting Republican OR
Democrat is just setting yourself up to get duped for the umpteenth time .
I would rather support someone I completely disagree with , but who has convictions on his beliefs , then some typical partisan politician .
Of course the exception to the rule is someone with fascist or neo -nazi beliefs .
In that case , I would stay home on Election day .

In Java you do n’t see a lot of linked lists , and if you do it ’s almost always java.util .
LinkedList .
People never write their own lists .
They do n’t really need to , I suppose .
The one from java.util is fine .
Plenty of people are leading fulfilling software careers never having implemented their own linked list .
But it ’s kind of a shame .
Knowing how your data structures work makes you a better programmer .
It ’s even rarer for a person to implement his own linked list in Scala .
Scala ’s scala .
List is one of the most used classes in the language , so it ’s packed with functionality .
It ’s abstract , covariant , it has helper objects such as List and Nil and the little - known ‘::’ class , it inherits from Product , Seq , Collection , Iterable , and PartialFunction .
The machinery of List pulls in Array , ListBuffer , and more .
It can be hard to take it all in .
So let ’s build our own linked list .
We ’ll start out with something very basic and un -Scala - like .
Then we ’ll improve it gradually until we have something a little closer to scala .
List .
I encourage you to fire up your Scala interpreter and follow along .
Back to Basics
First , a short review of linked lists .
A linked list is a chain of nodes , each referring to exactly one other node until you get to the end of the chain .
You refer to the list by its first item and you follow the chain of references to reach the other nodes .
What are the requirements for our first try ?
Our node should be able to hold a piece of data , and refer to the next node .
It should also be able to report its length , and provide a toString method so we can visualize the list .
Here we go .
class MyList ( val head :
Any , val tail : MyList ) { def is Empty = ( head == null && tail == null ) def length : Int = if ( isEmpty ) 0 else 1 + tail .length override def toString : String = if ( isEmpty ) " " else head + " " + tail }
The value ‘ head ’ holds the data for the node , ‘ tail ’ refers to the next element in the chain .
The ‘ is Empty ’ method is true if the head and tail are both null .
The length and toString methods are both defined using a similar pattern : if ( isEmpty ) [ base result ] else [ data for current node + result of same method on tail ] .
Here ’s what it looks like when we use this class :
scala > var list = new MyList ( null , null ) list : MyList = scala > list .
length res0 : Int = 0 scala > list .isEmpty res1 : Boolean = true scala > list = new MyList ( " ABC " , list ) list : MyList = ABC scala > list.
length res3 : Int = 1 scala > list .isEmpty res4 : Boolean = false scala > list = new MyList ( " XYZ " , list ) list : MyList = XYZ ABC scala > list = new MyList ( " 123 " , list ) list : MyList = 123 XYZ ABC scala > list.tail.head res7 : Any = XYZ
Not bad .
It gets the job done .
But it has some problems .
First is the use of ‘ null ’ .
Use of null references is sloppy and increases the odds of a null pointer exception so , ideally , we do n’t want to see that .
It has other problems , too .
It ’s too verbose .
It ’s not typesafe .
But for now let ’s concentrate on getting rid of the nulls .
No Nulls Is Good Nulls
How can we do it ?
We ’re using the null as a special value , a marker to tell us when a node is at the end of a list .
So we ’ll just use something else as that marker instead .
What can we use ?
We ’ll create a special object for the empty list .
It will be recognized as empty just based on its identity , not on null values .
So let ’s try it :
class MyList ( val head :
Any , val tail : MyList ) { def is Empty = false def length : Int = if ( isEmpty ) 0 else 1 + tail .length override def toString : String = if ( isEmpty ) " " else head + " " + tail } object MyListNil extends MyList ( " arbitrary value " , null ) { override def isEmpty = true }
That ’s better .
( The observant reader will note the similarity of MyListNil to scala .
List ’s Nil object . )
We got rid of the nulls in the isEmpty method , but we still have to put something in the head and tail parameters of the MyList constructor .
We put an arbitrary non-null value in head , but what do we put for tail ?
Either null or create a new MyList .
And how can that MyList be instantiated ?
It also needs a tail .
Vicious circle .
So this solution leaves us still stuck with a null .
Earlier , the null was there to mark a special node .
We factored out that usage .
Now it ’s there to allow us to create the MyListNil .
How can we factor that out ?
MyListNil is required to call its parent ’s constructor .
What if had no parent ?
Then it would n’t be a MyList anymore .
What if it had an abstract parent ?
Now you ’re talking .
Let ’s see what that would look like .
abstract class MyList { def head :
Any def tail : MyList def isEmpty : Boolean def length :
Int } class MyListImpl ( val head :
Any , val tail : MyList ) extends MyList { def is Empty = false def length : Int = 1 + tail .length override def toString : String = head + " " + tail } object MyListNil extends MyList { def head :
Any = throw new Exception ( " head of empty list " ) def tail : MyList = throw new Exception ( " tail of empty list " ) def is Empty = true def length = 0 override def toString = " " }
It ’s a little more code , but much neater .
There are no nulls anywhere .
Here ’s how it looks when we use this new MyList :
scala > var list : MyList = MyListNil list : MyList = scala > list = new MyListImpl ( " ABC " , list ) list : MyList = ABC scala > list = new MyListImpl ( " XYZ " , list ) list : MyList = XYZ ABC scala > list = new MyListImpl ( " 123 " , list ) list : MyList = 123 XYZ ABC scala > list .
length res3 : Int = 3 scala > list.tail.head res4 : Any = XYZ scala > list.tail.tail.tail.head java.lang .
Exception : head of empty list at ...
Pretty neat .
The equivalent of MyListImpl in the Scala ’s real List implementation is a class called ‘::’ , which has that funny name , by the way , because it looks nice in pattern matching code .
Sometimes ‘: :’ is referred to as cons .
With nulls finally eliminated , we can concentrate on other issues .
Brevity Is The Heart Of List
The thing that I notice at this point is that a lot of typing ( on the keyboard ) is required to use this list .
We have to type out “ list = new MyListImpl ( … , list ) ” every time we add an item .
We can improve this with a new method .
abstract class MyList { [...] def add ( item : Any ) : MyList = new MyListImpl ( item , this ) }
Now we have classes referring to each other .
MyList creates new MyListImpls , and MyListImpl extends MyList .
So you ’ll need to put these classes in a . scala file and compile them instead of just typing them into the Scala interpreter .
But , wow !
Look how much easier it is to use MyList now :
scala > var list = MyListNil add ( " ABC " ) add ( " XYZ " ) add ( " 123 " ) list : MyList = 123 XYZ ABC scala > list .
length res1 : Int = 3
So much easier !
One thing I notice , though , is that the order of items in the code is different from the order produced by toString .
We can change our ‘ add ’ method so that is right - associative instead of left - associative by using a method name that ends in ‘:’ ( colon ) .
We ’ll use ‘: :’ as the method name since that ’s what scala .
List uses .
abstract class MyList { [...] def ::( item : Any ) : MyList = new MyListImpl ( item , this ) } scala > var list = " ABC " :: " XYZ " :: " 123 " :: MyListNil list : MyList = ABC XYZ 123
Now we ’re really getting somewhere .
This is starting to look more like scala .
List .
One other thing that the standard list implementation gives you is a shortcut for initializing lists .
It looks like “ List ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) ” .
Notice there ’s no ‘ new ’ keyword .
This is done using the scala .
List helper object and its ‘ apply ’ method .
Below is our own MyList helper object .
object MyList { def apply ( items : Any * ) : MyList = { var list : MyList = MyListNil for ( idx <- 0 until items.length reverse ) list = items ( idx ) :: list list } } scala > var list = MyList ( " ABC " , " XYZ " , " 123 " ) list : MyList = ABC XYZ 123 scala > list = " Cool " :: list list : MyList = Cool ABC XYZ 123
Better Type -Safe Than Sorry
Better .
Our code looks much neater now when we use MyList .
I ’ll introduce just one more improvement to MyList .
It still has a rather glaring problem .
It provides no type information .
It keeps all of its data using a reference to Any .
If you do n’t see why this is a problem , let ’s see what happens when we want to get the length of some items in a MyList :
scala > var list = MyList ( " ABC " , 12345 , " WXYZ " ) list : MyList = ABC 12345 WXYZ scala > list.head.length < console >: 6 : error : value length is not a member of Any list.head.length ^ scala > list.head.asInstanceOf[ String ].length res10 : Int = 3 scala > list.tail.head.asInstanceOf[String].length java.lang.ClassCastException : java.lang .
Integer cannot be cast to java.lang .
String at .< init >( < console >:6 )
Ouch !
First , when we try to call method ‘ length ’ on list .
head Scala complains that list .
head is a reference to Any .
Any does n’t have a length method .
This is n’t a dynamically typed language like , say , Ruby .
An object has to have the right type before we can start calling methods .
What to do ?
You could implement a MyStringList where the head has type String .
But then you ’ll need a MyIntList , MyDoubleList , etc .
What we need is a way to specify the type of data in the list when we create the MyList instance .
What we need is a type parameter .
Here ’s the complete MyList code using a type parameter , and a little demonstration code :
abstract class MyList [ A ] { def head : A def tail : MyList [ A ] def isEmpty : Boolean def length :
Int def ::( item : A ) : MyList [ A ] = new MyListImpl [ A ] ( item , this ) } class MyListImpl [ A ] ( val head : A , val tail : MyList [ A ] ) extends MyList [ A ] { def is Empty = false def length : Int = 1 + tail .length override def toString : String = head + " " + tail } object MyListNil extends MyList [ Nothing ] { def head : Nothing = throw new Exception ( " head of empty list " ) def tail : MyList [ Nothing ] = throw new Exception ( " tail of empty list " ) def is Empty = true def length = 0 override def toString = " " } object MyList { def apply [ A ] ( items : A* ) : MyList [ A ] = { var list : MyList [ A ] = MyListNil.asInstanceOf[ MyList[ A ] ] for ( idx <- 0 until items.length reverse ) list = items ( idx ) :: list list } } scala > var list = MyList ( " ABC " , " WXYZ " , " 123 " ) list : MyList[ java.lang.String ] = ABC WXYZ 123 scala > list.head.length res0 : Int = 3 scala > 3.14159 :: list < console > : 6 : error : type mismatch ; found : Double required : java.lang .
String 3.14159 :: list ^ scala > var list = MyList ( " ABC " , 123 , 3.14159 ) list : MyList [ Any ] = ABC 123 3.14159
Look at line 32 .
The “ MyList ( … ) ” returns a MyList [ String ] .
Scala figures out from the parameters what type to use .
In line 35 , you can see how much easier it is to use the list contents when you know the type at compile time .
If you try to mix types , as in line 45 , Scala determines the nearest common ancestor of the types ( Any , in this case ) and uses that .
However , if the type parameter is already determined , as in line 38 , it wo n’t change when you try to add data of a different type .
To make line 38 work , we can make a small change to the ‘: :’ method :
abstract class MyList [ A ] { [...] def ::[ B >: A ]( item : B ) : MyList [ B ] = new MyListImpl ( item , this .asInstanceOf[ MyList [ B ] ] ) } scala > var list = MyList ( " ABC " , " XYZ " ) list : MyList[ java.lang.String ] = ABC XYZ scala > 3.14159 :: list res0 : MyList [ Any ] = 3.14159 ABC XYZ
This says that ‘::’ takes a parameter of type B , which is either A or a superclass of A , and returns a MyList [ B ] .
So if you have a MyList [ String ] and you call ‘::’ on it with a Double parameter , Scala figures out that although Double is not a superclass of String , String and Double are both descendants of Any , and it returns a MyList [ Any ] .
Conclusion
That ’s a good stopping point for now .
Obviously you can take the MyList class a lot further and add a lot more methods , but we ’ve created some code that approximates the basics provided by scala .
List .
In fact , you could take several of the scala .
List methods ( foldLeft , for example ) and basically drop them right into MyList and they ’d work fine .
Ever dropped a stone into a hole to find out how deep it goes ?
Had Jason
Fleming done so while peering into the overgrown hollow that marks the start of Shadow Complex , no splash would have echoed back .
This opening , into which his girlfriend descended not two minutes earlier , is the mouth of an abyss ; a rabbit hole that will lead him unwittingly into an underground military complex , the role of would - be national saviour and the belly of one of gaming 's long lost genres .
By the time he re-emerges , triple - jumping into the sun , you 'll have mapped tens of miles of subterranean corridors , thwarted a plot to blow up San Francisco and seen Jason Fleming transformed from country - bumpkin into cyber - ninja .
Shadow Complex is Super Metroid re-imagined by J.J.Abrams .
Its story is pulp thriller , throwing an ordinary Joe into extraordinary circumstances under which he stiffens implausibly into a one - man army .
Fleming is an all - American action hero , hurling grenades and missiles with thoughtless abandon one moment ; creeping death through ventilation shafts in search of his snatched girlfriend the next .
" You do n't look like the kind of guy who'd pull the trigger , " challenges one enemy he meets .
Two seconds later , as Fleming steps over a puddle of warm , Unreal Engine - pumped blood , you can almost hear Mark Rein in the background , fist - pumping the air to chants of : " USA ! USA ! "
But for all its Hollywood bombast , Shadow Complex is born from nothing but the purest of Japanese pedigrees .
For once the Super Metroid reference is n't a lazy critic 's crutch .
Epic Games has always declared its intention to resurrect the classic 2D side - scrolling exploration game , once popularized by Nintendo 's seminal space adventure , later perfected by Konami's Castlevania : Symphony of the Night .
So while Shadow Complex 's story and setting may be popcorn nonsense , the mechanics they clothe are golden .
A number of VR missions provide yet more content for the completist , presenting a suite of timed , score - attack runs that encourage competition across Xbox Live .
In reviving a genre that the Japanese left for dead , the game offers a telling snapshot of the global games industry in 2009 .
Here is an American developer so emboldened by recent successes that it feels qualified to reimagine one of Japan 's sacred classics .
It 's like Bungie sat down to remake Super Mario .
Unthinkable .
Yet somehow , the gambit 's paid off .
In fusing classic game design with contemporary techniques and sensibilities , Epic Games and Chair Entertainment have triumphed where Japanese developers continue to flounder .
The result is nothing short of one the best games of this generation .
Despite appearances , Shadow Complex remains a 2D game at heart .
The shift to 3D visuals adds depth to the world , and allows for a few flamboyant perspective - shifting set - pieces , but Fleming 's movements are restricted to up , down , left and right .
Bullets automatically fire off into the Z - axis if an enemy 's standing in the background , but otherwise their trajectory moves in arcing step with your analogue - stick sweeps .
At the surface level , this is a pure action game : choke out guards with the B- button , leap electric fences with the A - button , Rambo your way up staircases of enemies with a squeeze of the triggers .
But like those titles it so carefully apes , it 's also a cartography game , challenging players to map every corner and crevice of the base in search of that 100 per cent badge of completion .
Locked doors and obstacles hinder access to the base .
But rather than asking you to locate keys to unlock these areas , you must instead find the power - ups that allow Fleming to overcome each type of blockage .
Until you pick up the missile attachment for your gun , for example , every area closed off by an object that can only be destroyed by missiles remains off - limits .
Shine your flashlight on an object and it'll glow the colour of the power - up needed to destroy it : orange for bullets , green for grenades , purple for foam and so on .
Until you have the relevant power - up , all instances of that object will be impassable , allowing the designers to carefully drip - feed access to the sprawling complex .

The recession is close to ending , Fed chairman Ben Bernanke says Silicon Valley is stirring back to life , following a bruising economic downturn , according to industry insiders and start - up entrepreneurs .
The view seems to underscore Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke 's belief that the US recession has ended .
He told a Washington think - tank that " from a technical perspective the recession is very likely over " .
Wall Street shares that optimism - with the Dow Jones having been on a steady rise for the last six months .
" In the Valley we are seeing real signs of life , " said Satish Dharmaraj , a partner with Redpoint Ventures , a firm specialising in internet start - ups .
" We are seeing an enormous amount of really good companies coming up and good people leaving their jobs and joining start - ups , which is always a sign of confidence , " Mr Dharmaraj told BBC News .
Recent acquisitions in the hi-tech field include the purchase of Mint.com by Intuit for $ 170 m ( £ 102 m ) , Adobe buying Omniture for $ 1.8 bn ( £ 1.08 bn ) , the sale of Skype to a private equity syndicate for $ 2bn ( £ 1.2bn ) and the purchase of SpringSource by VMware for $ 420 m ( £ 254 m ) .
" Looks like the economy , and with it the urge to splurge , is back - especially in Silicon Valley , " said Om Malik of tech blog Gigaom.com .
" What 's even more encouraging is that none of these deals are the small micro - transactions that Silicon Valley got used to over the past few years , " he added .
" Opportunity "
While empty offices still dot the Silicon Valley landscape and the unemployment levels are only slightly down from a record high of 11.9 % , there is plenty of optimism to go round .
Not least from David Kralik who just launched his company on Tuesday at the TechCrunch 50 conference in San Francisco , which showcased 50 start - ups in front of an audience of investors , analysts , entrepreneurs , and journalists .
CitySourced has an app so citizens can report problems like graffiti and trash CitySourced is a " real - time mobile civic engagement tool " - aimed at empowering citizens to use their smartphones to identify things such as potholes , graffiti , rubbish , snow removal and so on .
" The recession has been a great opportunity , and if you think about it Microsoft , Google and Cisco all started in a down economy , so starting a business now seemed like just as good a time as any , " said Mr Kralik .
" A lot of companies starting today are all appealing to how we can save money .
Our business offers a huge opportunity for cities to save money by preventing , predicting and identifying urban blight .
" Graffiti clean up is a $ 12bn ( £ 7.25 bn ) a year industry and if we can disrupt just 10 % of the market we will be a game changer , " said Mr Kralik .
San Jose has just signed up for the service , and the company said it is in talks with ten other cities .
At the Conference , 50 start - ups pitched their ideas to an industry audience " New reality " Before the champagne corks can be popped over news that the economy is in recovery mode , Mr Bernanke pointed out that " it is still going to feel like a very weak economy for some time as many people still find their job security and their employment status is not what they wish it was " .
" We are entering a stage of new reality , " said Redpoint Ventures partner Mr Dharmaraj .
" I would hope the way people do business has changed .
" The recession was a big slap in the face and all of us are learning , maybe we have entered a new kind of normalcy , " he said .
And that new normal means doing things in a more frugal and cost conscious way .
" Businesses today are undoubtedly leaner and smarter , " said Kevin Rose , the founder of Digg.com which lets people share and discover content from anywhere on the web .
" There are no lavish parties and hiring crazy rock starts to perform at your events as there once was in the past .
" It 's more about tweet - ups and meet - ups at bars and stuff .
It 's a more grassroots way to spread the word and get the message out about what you are trying to create , " added Mr Rose .
While there has been a lot of focus on staying lean to ride out the rough times , angel investor Ron Conway said many new companies have weathered the storm well .
" All the start - ups I know are getting funding .
The beauty is that not many are going out of business and the survival rate is very high .
" In fact it really is a great time to start a company right now , to be poised to capitalise on the economy when it finally gets back to normal , " said Mr Conway .

Community Alert :
Three out of six attacks in the last month on the Upper East Side investigated as anti-LGBT Hate Crimes .
This morning , the New York City Anti-Violence Project learned of six violent attacks on the Upper East Side that have occurred in the span of just over a month , but most between June 26th through June 28th .
A disturbing commonality in at least two of the incidents has been the use of slews of anti-gay epithets during the attacks , regardless of the self - identity of the victims .
Three of the incidents are being investigated as Hate Crimes by the NYPD ’s Hate Crimes Task Force .
The Anti-Violence Project is urging the NYPD to investigate all six as possible hate crimes .
All of the attacks occurred in the early morning hours .
The news comes just after the release of the 2008 Hate Violence against Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender People in the United States report , which includes the New York City Anti-Violence Project ’s data on anti-LGBT hate violence in New York City .
The report documents that in NYC there was a 12 % decrease in reports of incidents , but an increase in the severity of the attacks .
Murders alone increased 67 % ; robbery and larceny rose 140 % , and sexual assaults increased 171 % .
The recent reports from the Upper East Side have made clear that the trend in severity appears to be continuing .

Meat - eating – and diseases that come with it – have a long history among our ancestors , suggests a new study of an ancient hominin skeleton .
The analysis of 1.5 to 2.8 million - year - old vertebrae of Australopithecus africanus recovered in South Africa reveals signs of a bacterial infection that is normally contracted from eating meat or dairy foods .
“ This is the most ancient case of an infectious disease in a hominin , ” says Ruggero D’Anastasio , a palaeoanthropologist at State University “ Gabriele d’Annunzio ” in Chieti , Italy , who diagnosed the skeleton with a disease called brucellosis .
First uncovered in the 1970s in the Sterkfontein caves , not far from Johannesburg , two of the vertebrae belonging to an older male are dotted with visible lesions .
One study concluded that this damage was caused by ageing .

However , after collecting X - rays and scanning electron micrographs of the bones , D’Anastasio now contends that brucellosis better explains the lesions .
Spine clues
Brucellosis causes a flu - like illness in humans , but if the bacteria reach muscles and bones , they tend to infect the same spinal vertebrae that are damaged in the Australopithecus bones .
Other infections , like tuberculosis , also infect spinal bones , but they tend to be less discriminate and go after other vertebrae .
D’Anastasio ’s team think ageing is an unlikely explanation for the damage for similar reasons .
“ I think it ’s more probable that these lesions could be due to an infectious disease , and I think brucellosis is the most probable infection , ” D’Anastasio says .
It ’s impossible to determine how this individual contracted the disease , but contemporary patterns of infection suggest the bacteria probably came from an ungulate .
Humans usually contract the Brucella bacteria from unpasteurised milk and cheese , however zebras , antelope and other South African fauna can carry a species that causes spontaneous abortions , Brucella abortus .
This australopithecine may have acquired brucellosis by eating fetal tissue from a similar animal , D’Anastasio says .
“ I think the consumption of meat was occasional in Australopithecus . ”
Mystery remains
A chemical analysis of Australopithecus teeth also supports that conclusion .
A team led by Matt Sponheimer , at the University of Colorado in Boulder , analysed carbon isotopes in 3 - million - year - old teeth , and found a chemical signature indicative of fruits , leaves and grasses .
The team suggest that the grass signature was probably acquired through eating a herbivore .
Meanwhile , other research has suggested that Australopithecus had teeth adapted for meat eating .
However , none of these studies – the latest work included – can definitively determine the importance of meat in the australopithecine diet , says Sponheimer .
Many anthropologists contend that meat eating did n’t make up the bulk of our ancestor ’s calories until after the emergence of Homo erectus , roughly 2 million years ago .
Given the opportunity , chimpanzees eat monkeys , bugs , and small forest antelopes .
“ It would be strange if any of our more recent ancestors were not eating meat to some degree , ” Sponheimer says .

( CNN ) --
An Arizona man caught leaving water bottles in the desert for illegal immigrants has been sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a year of probation , an aid group said .
Walt Staton was convicted in June of littering by leaving jugs of water in a wildlife refuge .
Walt Staton , a member of the group No More Deaths , left full water bottles in December in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge for the illegal immigrants who routinely pass through the 18,000 - acre refuge , according to court documents .
A judge sentenced him Tuesday to 300 hours of picking up trash on public property and a year of probation , No More Deaths said in a written statement .
He is also banned from the refuge during that time , the group said .
Although the case involved only a misdemeanor charge , both sides used the divisive issue of illegal immigration in their arguments ; Staton 's lawyer argued that Staton 's actions were humanitarian , but the government said otherwise .
In a sentencing memo , the federal prosecutors wrote that Staton 's " actions are not about humanitarian efforts , but about protesting the immigration policies of the United States , and aiding those that enter illegally into the United States . "
Noting the phrase scrawled on many of the plastic water jugs -- " buena suerte , " or " good luck " in Spanish -- the prosecutors said , " The obvious conclusion is that the defendant and No More Deaths wish to aid illegal aliens in their entry attempt . "
They also said , as did the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , that leaving the full plastic jugs on the refuge is detrimental to the health of the animals that live there .
Citing a biologist , the prosecutors said that animals could eat the plastic and that others could get feet or antlers caught on the bottles .
Prosecutors had requested a $ 5,000 fine , along with five years of probation , according to court documents .
Staton , who No More Deaths says is to begin seminary school at the Claremont School of Theology in Claremont , California , had initially refused to pay a $ 175 fine for littering , said Staton 's lawyer , Bill Walker .
After his refusal , the government enhanced the charges against him , arguing that he " knowingly littered , " said Walker , who is also a member of No More Deaths .
The charge can carry a $ 100,000 fine and a year in jail , Walker said .
Charges against three other people who were cited with Staton in December were dropped , he said .
A jury convicted Staton in June of littering .
Walker said he is appealing .
" We think that Walt did nothing wrong , " he said .
" We do not think that this conviction will be upheld on appeal . "
He described Staton as " the kind of guy you 'd want to have as your next door neighbor . "
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's office in Arizona declined comment .
Mike Hawkes of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge said Thursday that although he had no issue with groups leaving water out for illegal immigrants , " there 's ways to do it without leaving plastic jugs out there . "
He said the plastic jugs were strewn throughout the refuge , which is home to hundreds of bird , reptile and mammal species , according to its Web site .
" We have sympathy for what they have to do , " he said .
But " they have do to do it without putting plastic bottles out there .
...
You ca n't go anywhere in the refuge without seeing plastic bottles through the countryside . "
Hawkes said refuge officials and members of No More Deaths had met and were trying to come up with methods that do n't involve plastic bottles .
Staton is the second member of No More Deaths to be convicted of littering , according to court documents ; however , the other received a suspended sentence .
Walker said that after Staton 's conviction , 13 No More Deaths members were charged with littering on the refuge .
With tens of thousands of illegal immigrants crossing through the refuge -- Hawkes said last year 's number was about 54,000 , down from hundreds of thousands years earlier -- the last water - related death there was in June 2008 , he said .

Even as I include the following qualification to this piece , it ’ll still probably be misinterpreted .
Nickelback is a terrible band , OK .
I get it .
They ’re the band everyone points to when discussing all that ’s wrong with modern music , specifically rock .
Yes , Chad sounds like the bastard child of a rather violent hate - fuck orgy including Eddie Vedder , Scott Weiland and Scott Stapp .
Yes , none of the band members are particularly talented musicians , save former drummer Ryan Vikedal who occasionally did double kick - drums ( or used triggers ) .
They ’re the pinnacle of shit .
They ’re the best of the worst .
They ’re antithetical to quality .
Their continued success is proof that the Devil exists , or that God hates us .
I could go on .
But , damn are they a hit - making machine .
They ’re a rock band that has multi-platinum records during an era in which gold is considered diamond .
Besides Coldplay and U2 , who else has this kind of success , and this consistently ?
This just is n’t supposed to happen to a band like Nickelback .
Post - grunge is dead and its biggest entity , Creed , was DOA during the band ’s entire ascension to the throne , making the reality of it that much more impressive ( read : depressing ) .
The only explanation is the the series of ( undeniable ) hits over the last eight years .
Shake your head and roll your eyes all you want , but admit it : even as you read this , there ’s a Nickelback single stuck in your head .
And if there was n’t before , that last sentence did it .
Maybe it ’s “ How You Remind Me . ” Perhaps “ Photograph . ”
Which ever single it is , it ’s fucking catchy and you damn well better accept it .
And they ’re sticky songs because of the ( kinda brilliant ) melodies that exist within these hits .
Nickelback melodies are n’t complicated or intelligent by any standard of comparison ( hell , neither are the lyrics ) but they are memorable .
And that ’s the key : the melodies do n’t have to be complex in order to stick in your head .
It ’s as if the Chad and his merry band of half - wits are a bizarre , four - headed land - monster King Midas clusterfuck of the music world .
Hate the band all you want , but even I have to acquiesce that Nickelback as a business has made every right move .
The band ’s put out best - selling records that include multiple hits across multiple radio formats , recorded with some great producers and even Mutt Lange , and toured everywhere fans buy its albums .
It ’s avoided just about every possible mistake by , simply stated , keeping to what works – to a fault .
Nickelback has never put out the experimental or arty record , or the acoustic album for that matter .
Nope , every single ( successful ) album contains the same elements : a big , dumb , hard rocking single ( “ Animals , ” “ Something in Your Mouth “ ) , an acoustic - driven rocker that usually follows or precedes the rocker ( “ Photograph , ” “ Rockstar “ ) , and two or three throwaways that somehow still garner substantial airplay ( “ Figured You Out , ” “ Side of a Bullet “ ) .
In addition , Nickelback ’s catalogue of hits is basically comprised of universal themes : sex , drugs , rock ‘ n ’ roll , family issues , etc .
So , even if you loathe the music , you can at least take solace – albeit , a rather miniscule amount – in Chad ’s words .
Well , probably .
Take “ Animals , ” for example .
It ’s about fucking in a car and then being caught by the girl ’s dad .
Who has n’t either had part of that or all of it happen to them ?
Backseat joy is a pervasive theme for teenagers .
Lyrically ( and musically ) it ’s really , really dumb fun .
Emphasis on the dumb .
Or how about “ Too Bad , ” a song discussing a broken family due to an absent father .
With the statistic that Chris Titus cited during his one - man show all those years , this particular single must also be damn near omnipresent .
“ Rockstar , ” of course , is a satirical take on the excess ( es ) of the rock lifestyle .
Breakups ?
“ How You Remind Me ” and “ Someday . ”
Incidentally , the pair of songs are both similar in lyrical focus and , well , everything else .
Drugs ?
“ Leader of Men . ”
And they ’ve even gone beyond the universal , or at least they used to .
“ Never Again ” is an anti-domestic violence anthem .
Then there ’s the quasi- philosophical songs from the early days : “ Breathe ” is probably about something important , though exactly what is hard to pinpoint .
Even with the few obscure themes , Chad and company try to keep it all - inclusive for maximum ( radio ) impact .
As Evan Dickson eloquently put it :
Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want and precisely how far he can go .
He turned out an extremely racy album [ Dark Horse ] that ’s loaded with songs about gettin ’ drunk and doin ’ it all without breaking any taboos , and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the mainstream .
Rejoice , North America .
This is your world .
[ emphasis added ]
So , yeah , Nickelback know what they ’re doing .
Even with the production side of their music the band ’s gotten better from album to album .
Their early albums , Curb and The State , were rather thin sonically , lacking any real punch of successive collections .
Then came Silver Side Up , which was the first in the upward trend of arena - sounding records .
While still thin , the guitars were thicker but sounded as if they were recorded in a tunnel , the bass was pushed up in the mix and drums were powerful despite being buried in the mix .
It ’s with Silver that the band started to work with big - league producers .
Silver featured famed grunge and post - grunge icon Rick Parashar who ’s worked with Pearl Jam ’s Ten and Temple of the Dog ’s eponymous album .
Follow - up album The Long Road finds the band finally taking control of its sound .
Sure , Joey Moi has a co-credit , but this is the start of self - control to be sure .
Coincidence ?
If it ’s more than that , nobody will admit it .
Road ‘s mix is vastly improved over Silver : beautifully mulit - tracked guitars that are seriously chunky , bass that ’s audible and thick but not dominating and drums moved up in the mix that hit hard .
Then came All The Right Reasons where the band essentially made a ( near - ) perfect sounding modern rock record .
The mix is not only Hysteria - level impenetrable , but clear and , most importantly , not audio - clipped .
Finally , we arrive at what is the band ’s aural zenith known as Dark Horse .
The reason , of course , is “ Mutt ” Lange .
He took the Reasons mix and just made it …better .
He gave the songs a crispness that was n’t there before .
The guitars gained brightness they did n’t necessarily need but still was a splendid addition .
The bass , duh , was made more audible and denser , resembling Brendan O’Brien ’s work .
And those drums ?
Holy hell , they knock shit loose in your head .
It ’s simply wonderful .
Nickelback ’s next album might actually run the risk of death if played .
Take that as a compliment or a joke , depending on your sensibilities .
Let ’s be clear about one thing : Nickelback is not the worst thing in music .
There are a manifold of artists that are worse – like this and this .
Hell , even the proliferation of Auto - tune is worst than Nickelback by at least a few orders of magnitude .
That said , Nickelback are not a good in a critical sense .
Yes , they can churn out hit after hit with an implausible consistency , but that does n’t make them a great band .
Chad ’s voice is horrifyingly grating , post - grunge is ( still ) as much of a scene - genre as screamo - crunk and , honestly , their albums are padded with filler .
But that ’s not the real point here .
The point is that Nickelback , while a terrible plague on the world , are actually talented insomuch as there ’s actual songwriting with addictive hooks album after album
And they did it without T - Pain , something everyone should get behind .
America owes Nickelback a ‘ thank you ’ just for that .
Commander Simon Bray said : " Meth does not yet appear to be an established problem here but , having examined the experience of other countries , there is every possibility that use of the drug could increase . "
Islam : A Scientific View of God 's Message to Humanity 3 The Scientific Evidence That God Exists and the Holy Quran Is His Message to Humanity By Hassan Ali El - Najjar Updated on 6th of Shawwal , 1441 - May 29 , 2020 *** الدَّلِيلُ الْعِلْمِيُّ عَلَى وِجُودِ اللهِ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى وَعَلَى أَنَّ الْقُرْآن َ الْكَرِيمَ هُوَ رِسَالَتُهُ لِلْبَشَرِيَّةِ تأليف حسن علي النجار تمت مراجعة هذا الفصل في السادس من شوا ل 1441 - 29 مايو 20 20 *** أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم I seek refuge with God from the Stoned Shaitan ( Satan ) In the Name of Allah , the Beneficent , the Merciful *** Introduction * At the beginning of the 21st Century , many people in the world no longer believe in God .
Even some of those who profess such belief are not sure .
Others have a distorted belief , which makes them behave in misguided and dangerous ways .
In brief , there is a lot of ignorance on this Planet , at this time , about the Creator of life and about His message to humanity , which has been told in the religious Holy Books .
But before addressing the problem of misguided believers , it is more essential to address the question of atheism , or the belief that God does not exist in the first place .
This belief has developed as a result of lack of scientific evidence in teaching about God .
Many world religions involve illogical myths and weird rituals that belittle the human mind , leading to the disbelief that these myths and rituals are from a Supreme Being , who is supposed to be more intelligent than the human beings
He has created , and as a result is worthy of being worshipped by them .
Another important reason for atheism is that leaders of many religions , including the major ones , put themselves in a collision course with science .
This has alienated the most educated and most intelligent people and made them susceptible to atheism , indifference , or at least not taking religion seriously .
So , how can this problem of God ’s existence be resolved ?
To convince the most intelligent beings on this Planet that there is a God and that He does exist , scientific evidence supporting this fact has to be brought to the discussion .
The Holy Quran ( pronounced in two separate syllables Qur - an ) is full of such evidence .
Actually , the Islamic Holy Book can be broadly divided into two parts .
The first involves the scientific evidence that its ultimate author is the Creator of life Himself , in order to convince humans that He exists and that the Holy Quran is His message to humanity .
The second part involves
His teachings , the Shari'a , which if followed by humans will lead them to happiness in this life and in the everlasting Hereafter .
The story of life on Planet Earth , including human life , is told in the Holy Quran in a way that would light up the eyes of scientists if they read it .
It ’s the same story , which is told to students of biology .
It leaves no doubt about the fact that life started in a very simple way a long time ago and kept evolving ever since ( See Chapter I.4 , " Creation and Evolution in the Holy Quran " ) .
The scientific story of creation of life is just one example of how the Holy Quran convinces its readers that no human on this Planet could have authored this Book .
Many of the scientific facts revealed became known only in the last century or so .
The Messenger of God , Prophet Muhammed ( Peace and blessings of God be upon him ) was an illiterate man .
It was impossible for him or for any other human being more than 1400 years ago to know about such facts .
This Chapter is divided into three parts .
The first includes examples of verses , containing facts just explained or discovered recently by scientists , about the creation of the heavens and the Earth , as well as the existence of intelligent beings , other than humans .
The second part includes examples of verses , mentioning facts just explained or discovered recently by scientists , about life on Earth , in relation to the darkness of ocean waters , formation of clouds , plant pairs , and sex of insects .
The third part of this Chapter provides information about the numerical miracle in the design of the Holy Quran .
This is an emerging research area , which demonstrates , through so many examples , that the letters , words , and chapters of the Holy Quran are designed and arranged according to numerical relationships .
As a result , this Book could not have been authored by any human being .
It ’s the Word of God and His Message to humanity .
First , Examples of Verses Containing Scientific Facts , Just Explained or Discovered Recently , About the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth , as Well as the Existence of Intelligent Beings , Other than Humans 1 .
Verse 11 : 7 tells us that God 's Throne had been on water before
He created the heavens and the Earth .
وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ ( هود ، 11 : 7 ) .
And it is
He who created the heavens and the Earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water ( Hood , 11 : 7 ) .
This means that water preceded other elements , and consequently the formation of our solar system , as scientists concluded in their most recent research , in 2014 .
They found that some of the water we have is older in age than the Earth age , which is estimated at about 4.6 billion years .
It is even older than the Sun .
This is a confirmation to this verse , and consequently a piece of evidence that the Holy Quran is the Word of God .
In interpreting this verse , Al - Tabari mentioned a ' Hadith in which the Messenger of God was asked , " Where had our Lord been before He created the heavens and the Earth .
He said that " He was in clouds , and there was air above and below Him .
Then , He created His Throne on Water . "
The three renowned interpreters of the Holy Quran ( Al - Tabari , Al - Qurtubi , and Ibn Katheer ) , also mentioned an explanation by Ibn ' Abbas , who said , " The water was over the wind . " [ 1 ]
2 . Verse 21 : 30 tells us that the heavens and the Earth were a joined entity .
Then , Allah splintered them ( causing them to scatter in space ) .
The verse also tells us that Allah created every living thing ( in them ) out of water , which was already there .
أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا ۖ وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ ۖ أَفَلَا يُؤْمِنُونَ ( الأنبياء ، 21 : 30 ) .
Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the Earth were a joined entity , and We splintered ( separated ) them and made from water every living thing ?
Then , will they not believe ?
( Al - Anbiya , 21 : 30 ) .
At the beginning of the 20th Century , some astrophysicists estimated the age of the universe between 10 and 20 billion years .
However , more recent estimates date it back to about 13.8 billion years .
This is according to the Big Bang theory , which is agreed upon by most contemporary astrophysicists .
Though the theory described the beginning of the universe as a result of a big bang , astrophysicists now agree that it was an event , not necessarily a bang .
This is evidence about the accuracy of the verb " fataqa " used in the verse , which refers to splintering a substance ( like ice ) , causing it to scatter into smaller pieces .
Astrophysicists tried to explain how the event happened , as a result of the interaction between elements , energy , and time , without mentioning the logical existence of God , who caused the event to happen .
The evidence that He did , is that He told us about it in this verse , with this accuracy of the description , many centuries before the existence of astrophysics .
He is the First , the Originator , the Creator of the Heavens and Earth , the Great , and Most High ( See Chapter 16 , " Allah , as He described Himself in the Holy Quran " ) . [ 2 ]
3 . Verse 51 : 47 tells us that Allah built the heaven , which is continuously expanding .
وَٱلسَّمَآءَ بَنَيۡنَـٰهَا بِأَيۡيْدٍ۬ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُون ( الذاريا ت ، 51 : 47 ) .
We built the heaven with ( Our ) hands , and We are expanding ( it ) ( Al - Dhariyat , 51 : 47 ) .
In this verse , Allah ( God ) is telling us that He built heaven , using the past tense of the verb ( built ) , which means that the act of building was completed in the past .
Then ,
He tells us that He is expanding it , using the present continuous tense of the verb , to indicate that the expansion of heaven is continuously happening .
While the three renowned Islamic scholars pointed to the vastness of heaven , astrophysicists of the 20th Century were very specific about this scientific fact , describing it as " the expanding universe , " which is precisely described as such in the Holy Quran . [ 3 ]
4 . Verse 67 : 3 tells us that Allah created seven heavens , as straight layers , one over the other , without a faulty difference between them , whether you look at them once or more than once .
الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَـٰن ِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ فَارْجِعِ الْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍ ( الملك ، 67 : 3 ) .
( It is Allah ) Who created seven heavens , in layers ( strata ) .
You do not see in the creation of the Beneficent any inconsistency .
So return ( your ) vision ( to the sky ) , do you see any breaks ?
( Al - Mulk , 67 : 3 ) .
The scientific fact mentioned in this verse , about heavens as parallel layers , was confirmed by many astrophysicists , who argue that there are several parallel universes .
The only difference is that they use the word " universe " instead of the word " heaven " mentioned in this verse . [ 4 ]
5 . Verse 84 : 19 is related in meaning to the above - mentioned Verse 67 : 3 , particularly in describing heavens as parallel layers , one over the other , but it adds a prophecy about the human space travel , from one layer of heavens to another .
لَتَرْكَبُنَّ طَبَقًا عَن طَبَقٍ ( الإنشقاق ، 84 : 19 ) .
You will surely ride ( travel ) from one layer ( of heavens ) to another layer ( Al - Inshiqaq , 84 : 19 ) .
The three renowned Islamic interpreters of the Holy Quran agreed with this meaning , by mentioning the interpretations of Ibn ' Abbas and Al - Shi'bi , who limited space travel from one heaven to another to the Messenger of Allah .
Al - Qurtubi added a question , wondering if the Verse was a prophecy about the Prophet 's Night ـ Journey ( Al - Issra Wal Mi'raj ) .
In answering Al - Qurtubi 's question , it 's clear that Surat Al - Inshiqaq ( Chapter 84 of the Holy Quran ) , including verse 19 , was a Makkan Chapter , and it was revealed after the Night Journey , which was also described in Surat Al - Najm ( Chapter 53 ) .
If the Prophet alone was the one intended by this Verse , then the verb used would be in the past tense .
However , the verb used in this Verse is in the present tense , which also conveys the future .
This means that it is a prophecy about human space travel , in general , from one planet to another , from one solar system to another , and from one galaxy to another . [ 5 ]
6 . Verse 55 : 33 is related to the above - mentioned verse ( 84 : 19 ) , as it contains an invitation , which amounts to a prophecy , for humans and Jinn to attempt space travel .
يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَن تَنفُذُوا مِنْ أَقْطَارِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ فَانفُذُوا ۚ لَا تَنفُذُونَ إِلَّا بِسُلْطَانٍ ( الرحمن ، 55 : 33 ) .
O company of Jinn and humans , if you are able to penetrate ( pass ) through the zones of the heavens and the Earth , then penetrate .
You will not penetrate except by power ( of science ) ( Al - Ra'hman , 55 : 33 ) .
This prophecy was fulfilled for the Jinn first , as we are told by Verse 72 : 8 , which tells us that the Jinn have reached heaven but its powerful guards repelled them with burning flames .
We take this information from the Holy Quran as a given because we are not qualified yet , as humans at this stage of our knowledge , to investigate it .
وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَاءَ فَوَجَدْنَاهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَسًا شَدِيدًا وَشُهُبًا ( الجن ، 72 : 8 ) .
And we ( Jinn ) have touched the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames ( Al - Jin , 72 : 8 ) .
Then , this prophecy started to be fulfilled for humans during the second half of the 20th Century ( 14th Century of Hijra , Islamic Calendar ) , when the Soviets and Americans started their space travels , followed by Europeans , then Asians afterwards .
For centuries , readers of the Holy Quran , including the three renowned interpreters , could not interpret this Verse as a future possibility of human space travel between heavenly bodies .
However , this issue has become a normal bit of news in the media now adays , as space travels occur almost monthly , not only for orbiting Earth and docking to the international space station , but also for the exploration of outer space , other planets , and even going beyond our solar system . [ 6 ]
7 . Verse 65 : 12 tells us that Allah created seven heavens and seven Earth - like planets .
اللَّـهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ الْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِتَعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّـهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّـهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عِلْمًا ( الطلاق ، 65 : 12 ) .
It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the Earth like of them ( seven planets like Earth ) .
( His ) command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge ( Al - Talaq , 65 : 12 ) .
This Verse means that there are seven heavens inhabited by angels , and that God 's commands descend among them .
Likewise , there are seven planets like Earth , inhabited by others of God 's creatures , and that God 's commands also descend among them .
The three renowned Islamic interpreters agreed that there are seven Earth - like planets .
Al - Tabari interpreted the Verse , saying : " There is no disagreement about that the heavens are seven , layered one over the other , as evidenced from the ' Hadith of Al - Issra Wal Mi'raj ( the Prophet 's Night Journey ) , and other ' Hadiths . "
Then , Al - Tabari added that " there are also seven Earth - like planets .
The majority of scholars agree that these planets are also layered , one over the other , and that the distance between one Earth - like planet and anther is like the distance between one heaven and another , and that there are God 's creatures inhabiting each one of them . "
Thus , this Verse is an invitation for researchers to look for these Earth - like planets , discover them , and their intelligent inhabitants .
It 's thrilling that we are living at a time in which space scientists are actively searching for evidence about the existence of life on other planets , in our solar system , as well as in other solar systems in our galaxy , and even in other galaxies .
The most important evidence of life they look for is whether water exists on a planet or not , which is in total agreement with the Holy Quran Verse 21 : 30 mentioned above .
On February 22 , 2017 , NASA published a report about the discovery of a solar system , which scientists called Trappist - 1 .
It is located in the in the constellation Aquarius , which is about 39.6 light years ( about 235 trillion miles ) away from our Earth .
The report mentioned that there are seven planets the size of our Earth , all orbiting their sun , with a possibility of water on all of them , and the possibility of life on three of them , at least .
Though the report is not giving absolute evidence of water or life on these planets , it opens the door for the possibility of discovering that in the future , whether in this group of planets or in others .
Thus , this NASA discovery supports the scientific facts mentioned in this Verse . [ 7 ]
8 . Verse 14 : 19 tells us that Allah created the heavens and the Earth with the right proportions .
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيدٍ ( إبراهيم ، 14 : 19 ) .
Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the Earth with the right proportions ?
If He wills ,
He can do away with you and bring a new creation ( Ibrahim , 14 : 19 ) .
Allah used the Arabic word " haq " to describe how He created the heavens and the Earth .
In Arabic dictionaries , " haq " means right , truth , justice , and balance .
It is also the opposite of wrong and falsehood .
Thus , the meaning of the Verse is that Allah created the heavens and the Earth with the right proportions .
This refers to the precision and perfect balance in the relationships between components of the Universe .
In its orbit around the Sun , the Earth occupies an ideal location , which has enabled life to start , continue , and flourish on it .
The wonderful diversity of the fauna and flora on this planet is the result of its optimal and balanced relationship with the Sun , the Moon , and other planets of the solar system .
In particular , life on Earth flourished as a result of turning around itself , which creates the 24 - hour cycle of day and night .
It is also a result of its annual orbit around the Sun , which leads to the seasonal changes .
Moreover , the different geographical regions have been created in reaction to the differences in the sun light reaching these regions .
Water constitutes 70 % of Earth and the human body as well , which is another example of balance and precision between the Earth and its inhabitants .
There is also a balance in the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide , both of which are necessary for plants and animals on the planet .
Further , there is a balance between the ozone layer and other gases , particularly those resulting from the industrial pollution .
If this balance is disturbed , the ozone layer may lose its capability to protect the Earth from the harmful cosmic radiations .
Thus , all these examples refer to the precision and balance in the components of the Universe , and among them , as expressed by the word " haq " ( right proportions ) mentioned in this Verse . [ 8 ]
9 . Verse 79 : 30 tells us that the Earth is egg - shaped ( not flat , as some humans believed , or even a perfect circular globe ) , which is a scientific fact , just recently discovered .
وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا ( النازعات ، 79 : 30 ) .
And the Earth , after that , He made it egg - shaped ( Al - Nazi'at , 79 : 30 ) .
The scientific fact included in this Verse is specifically mentioned in the verb ( da'haha , دَحَٮٰهَآ ) .
Many translators incorrectly translated it as " extended it . "
The correct translation is that He made it egg - shaped .
The evidence for this meaning of the verb is that the noun " da'hya " is used by North African Arabs in reference to an " egg . "
The author of this book heard it by himself , during his stay in Libya , from 1972 to 1976 .
Allah wanted to describe to humans how the Earth looks like , using something they were familiar with at that time , which is the egg of a chicken or a bird .
For the later generations of humans , the egg shape is the most accurate description of how the Earth looks like , as it has been discovered recently that the Earth is less than a perfect circular globe .
Today , we have wonderful photos of our beautiful blue planet , showing it in a circular shape , taken by astronauts , satellites , space telescopes , and the international space station .
This scientific fact was not known to Arabs before Islam but many Islamic scholars of natural sciences mentioned it in their writings .
It 's interesting that the three renowned interpreters did not know about the meaning of da'hya as an egg .
Otherwise , they would have mentioned that meaning in their interpretations , which usually include as many meanings as possible .
[ 9 ]
10 .
The following verses tell us that the heavens are inhabited by intelligent beings ( the angels ) , who submit to their Lord , Allah , and worship him as do many people on Earth .
وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَاءُ قَدِيرٌ ( الشورى ، 42 : 29 ) .
And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the Earth , and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures .
And He , for gathering them when He wills , is competent ( Al - Shoura , 42 : 29 ) .
وَلَهُ ۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلأرۡضِ‌ۖ ڪُلٌّ۬ لَّهُ ۥ قَـٰنِتُونَ ( الروم ، 30 : 26 ) .
And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the Earth .
All are to Him devoutly obedient ( Al - Roo , 30 : 26 ) .
أفَغَيۡرَ دِينِ ٱللَّهِ يَبۡغُونَ وَلَهُ ۥۤ أَسۡلَمَ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلأرۡضِ طَوۡعً۬ا وَڪَرۡهً۬ا وَإِلَيۡهِ يُرۡجَعُون َ ( آل عمران ، 3 : 83 ) .
So , is it other than the religion of Allah they desire , while to Him have submitted ( all ) those within the heavens and the Earth , willingly or by compulsion , and to Him they will be returned ?
( Al - ' Imran , 3 : 83 ) .
أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ ۥ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلأًرۡضِ وَٱلطَّيۡرُ صَـٰٓفَّـٰتٍ۬ كُلٌّ۬ قَدۡ عَلِمَ صلاتَهُ ۥ وَتَسۡبِيحَهُ وَٱللَّهُ عَلِيمُۢ بِمَا يَفۡعَلُون َ ( النور ، 24 : 41 ) .
Do you not see that Allah is exalted by whoever is within the heavens and the Earth and ( by ) the birds with wings spread ( in flight ) ?
Each ( of them ) has known his prayer and ( his ) exalting ( of Allah ) , and Allah is Knower ( Knowledgeable ) of what they do ( Al - Noor , 24 : 41 ) .
***
The following verses also tell us that there are other intelligent beings , who inhabit what is in between the heavens and the Earth , ( the Jinn ) .
Some of these also submit to their Lord , Allah , and worship Him , as many humans do on Earth .
قَالَ فِرْعَوْنُ وَمَا رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ ﴿ ٢٣ ﴾ قَالَ رَبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا إِن كُنتُم مُّوقِنِين َ ﴿ ٢٤ ﴾ ( الشورى ، 26 : 23-24 ) .
( The ) Pharaoh said , " And what is the Lord of the worlds ? " ( 23 ) ( Moussa , Moses ) said , " The Lord of the heavens and the Earth and what is in between them , if you should be convinced " ( Al - Shoura , 26 : 23 - 24 ) .
قُلْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنَّهُ اسْتَمَع َ نَفَرٌ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَقَالُوا إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْآنًا عَجَبًا ( الجن ، 72 : 1 ) .
Say , ( O Muhammed ) , " It has been revealed to me that a group of the Jinn listened and said , ' Indeed , we have heard an amazing Quran " ( Al - Jin , 72 : 1 ) .
وَأَنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَاءَ فَوَجَدْنَاهَا مُلِئَتْ حَرَسًا شَدِيدًا وَشُهُبًا ( الجن ، 72 : 8 ) .
And we ( Jinn ) have touched ( reached ) the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames ( Al - Jin , 72 : 8 ) .
وَأَنَّا مِنَّا الْمُسْلِمُونَ وَمِنَّا الْقَاسِطُون َ فَمَنْ أَسْلَمَ فَأُولَـٰئِكَ تَحَرَّوْا رَشَدًا ( الجن ، 72 : 14 ) .
And among us ( Jinn ) are Muslims ( who submit to Allah ) , and among us are the unjust .
And whoever have become Muslims - those have sought out the right course ( Al - Jin , 72 : 14 ) .
The above verses tell us that there are intelligent beings in heavens ( the angels ) , who believe in Allah ( God ) and worship Him .
The verses also tell us that there are other intelligent beings , who live in between the heavens and the Earth ( the Jinn ) .
Some of them believe in Allah and worship Him but others do not .
Thus , these verses attract our attention to the possibility of communication and interaction between us and them in the future , as did happen in the past with Prophet Sulayman ( Solomon ) .
وَحُشِرَ لِسُلَيْمَانَ جُنُودُهُ مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنسِ وَالطَّيْرِ فَهُمْ يُوزَعُون َ ( النمل ، 27 : 17 ) .
And gathered for Sulayman ( Solomon ) were his soldiers of the Jinn , humans , and birds , and they were ( marching ) in rows ( Al - Naml , 27 : 17 ) .
The possibility of communication and interaction with aliens has increased recently with the advances in human space discovery endeavors , such as the various kinds of telescopes on Earth and in space , and the various devices sent to outer space .
There is also a possibility that such intelligent beings may reach us first before we reach them , whether in communication or in actual arrival of their astronauts to our planet .
When this happens , it should not be a surprise to people on Earth , particularly to the believers , who know about this issue from God 's Book , the Holy Quran .
Their arrival should not be a shock , which shakes people 's faith .
To the contrary , if these intelligent beings are believers , we should rejoice the event , which may lead to benefiting humanity .
However , if they are not believers , then we need to be careful about dealing with them , as they may cause us harm . [ 10 ]
*** Second , Examples of Verses Containing Scientific Facts , Just Explained or Discovered Recently , About Life on Earth , in Relation to the Darkness of Ocean Waters , Formation of Clouds , Plant Pairs , and Sex of Insects 11 .
Verse 24 : 40 , provides us with an accurate description of deep - water levels of darkness in the ocean .
أوۡ كَظُلُمَـٰتٍ۬ فِى بَحۡرٍ۬ لُّجِّىٍّ۬ يَغۡشَٮٰهُ مَوۡجٌ۬ مِّن فَوۡقِهِۦ مَوۡجٌ۬ مِّن فَوۡقِهِۦ سَحَابٌ۬‌ۚ ظُلُمَـٰتُۢ بَعۡضُہَا فَوۡقَ بَعۡضٍ إِذَآ أَخۡرَجَ يَدَهُ ۥ لَمۡ يَكَدۡ يَرَٮٰهَا‌ۗ وَمَن لَّمۡ يَجۡعَلِ ٱللَّهُ لَهُ ۥ نُورً۬ا فَمَا لَهُ ۥ مِن نُّورٍ ( النور ، 24 : 40 ) .
Or ( the Unbelievers ' state ) is like layers of darkness in a vast deep ocean , overwhelmed with waves topped by waves , topped by clouds : Layers of darkness , one above another , if a person stretches out his hand , he can hardly see it !
For anyone to whom Allah does not make light , he has no light ( Al - Noor , 24 : 40 ) .
This scientific fact was discovered only few decades ago .
Nobody could dive deep enough in the ocean , more than 1400 years ago , and come back to tell about what he / she saw there .
Only in the 20th Century , humans were capable of seeing that after using their military submarines .
For the general public , this happened in the 1980s , when the French oceanographer Philippe Causteau and his crew showed us some videos about the upper parts of the ocean depth , in their TV series .
Now , we know that there are three levels of light and darkness in ocean waters .
The first level extends from the water surface to about 600 feet down , where the sun light can penetrate enough to enable us to see .
The second level extends from 600 feet to about 3,000 feet under the sea surface , which allows only a small degree of the sun light and consequently a very small vision capability .
The third level starts below 3,000 feet , which represents 90 % of the ocean waters .
This is the level of complete darkness , where a person may not be able to see his hand , as accurately described in this Verse . [ 11 ]
12 . Verses 30 : 48 and 24 : 43 provide an accurate description of the water cycle , from winds to clouds , then to rain .
ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى يُرۡسِلُ ٱلرِّيَـٰحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابً۬ا فَيَبۡسُطُهُ ۥ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ كَيۡفَ يَشَآءُ وَيَجۡعَلُهُ ۥ كِسَفً۬ا فَتَرَى ٱلۡوَدۡقَ يَخۡرُجُ مِنۡ خِلَـٰلِهِۦ‌ۖ فَإِذَآ أَصَابَ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ مِنۡ عِبَادِهِۦۤ إِذَا هُمۡ يَسۡتَبۡشِرُونَ ( الروم ، 30 : 48 ) .
It is Allah Who sends the Winds , and they raise the Clouds .
Then ,
He spreads them in the sky as He wills , and breaks them into fragments , until you see rain - drops coming out from the midst of it .
When
He makes them reach whoever
He wills of his servants , then they rejoice !
( Al - Room , 30 : 48 ) .
ألَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُزۡجِى سَحَابً۬ا ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيۡنَهُ ۥ ثُمَّ يَجۡعَلُهُ ۥ رُكَامً۬ا فَتَرَى ٱلۡوَدۡقَ يَخۡرُجُ مِنۡ خِلَـٰلِهِۦ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مِن جِبَالٍ۬ فِيہَا مِنۢ بَرَدٍ۬ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَصۡرِفُهُ ۥ عَن مَّن يَشَآءُ‌ۖ يَكَادُ سَنَا بَرۡقِهِۦ يَذۡهَبُ بِٱلأًبۡصَـٰرِ ( النور ، 24 : 43 ) .
Do not you see that Allah makes the clouds move gently , then joins them together , then makes them into a heap ?
Then , you will see rain coming out of it .
And He sends down hail from the sky mountains ( of clouds ) .
He strikes whom He wills with it , and He turns it away from whom He wills .
The vivid flash of its lightning is close to blinding the sights ( of people ) ( Al - Noor , 24 : 43 ) .
These two verses accurately describe the water cycle , which starts with the evaporation of water from oceans , seas , rivers , and lakes , as a result of the sun heat .
The wind helps water vapor molecules to become more condensed , as clouds .
Then , winds carry clouds to other places , and up to the colder and higher layers of air , where water molecules become more condensed .
At that point , water molecules become too heavy for the wind to carry , and drop down , in what we call as rain .
Concerning hail , it forms as a result of more condensation of water molecules , when these are carried by wind to higher and consequently colder layers of the atmosphere .
There , water molecules freeze as icy balls , which drop down as hail because clouds cannot carry them any more . [ 12 ]
13 .
Verse 36 : 36 mentions that Allah , praise to Him , has created pairs for reproduction purposes , including human and plant pairs , as well as others unknown to us .
سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْأَزْوَاجَ كُلَّهَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الْأَرْضُ وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ( يس ، 36 : 36 ) .
Exalted is
He who created all pairs - from what the earth grows , and from themselves and from that which they do not know ( Ya Seen , 36 : 36 ) .
In addition to this verse , which mentions the word “ pairs , ” there are other verses , which also mention it as singular ( pair ) and plural ( pairs ) .
These words refer to the male and female elements , which are necessary for the sexual reproduction in humans as well as in plants .
The word " pairs " mentioned in the above verses refers to the sexual reproduction in plants through the interaction between the male and female elements .
This pairing can be found in two separate plants producing the same fruit ( such as date - palm trees ) , or in two different flowers in the same plant ( such as cucumbers ) , or in the same flower containing male and female organs ( pistils and stamens ) , such as tomatoes .
Insects and winds play a major role in carrying the male pollens to fertilize the female organs of various kinds of plants .
These facts became accurately known recently , after the establishment of modern sciences and the invention of the telescope . [ 13 ] 1 4 . The following verses mention eight kinds of insects .
The first four verses mention bees , ants , mosquitos , and spiders , as singular female nouns .
The other four verses mention flies , butterflies , locusts , and lice are mentioned in the plural form .
This difference in referring to these insects represents scientific facts , which were discovered more than 13 centuries after revelation , when microscopes were invented , allowing scientists to distinguish male and female insects from each other . [ 14 ]
The first four kinds of insects were accurately mentioned in the singular female noun because only females are the active workers .
It is the female bee , which works outside the nest and produces honey .
Likewise , it is the female ant , which works outside the colony .
Moreover , it is the female mosquito , which attacks humans and animals to suck their blood .
Finally , it is the female spider , which builds its web - house to hunt other insects .
Concerning the male bees , ants , and spiders , they are either killed or die after mating .
For the male mosquito , it does not have the sucking needle that the female has .
Consequently , it does not bite humans and animals to suck their blood as the female mosquito does .
In Verses 16 : 68 - 69 , there are three words that refer to the bee in the singular female form , as expressed in the three commands " ittakhidhi , " ( اتَّخِذِي ) " Kuli , " ( كُلِي ) and " fasluki " ( فَاسْلُكِي ) ( take , eat , and follow ) .
Verse 27 : 18 refers to the female ant with the singular female noun " namlaton . "
Likewise , Verse 2 : 26 refers to the female mosquito with the singular female noun " ba'oudhatan . "
Verse 29 : 41 refers to the spider in the singular female form , as expressed in past tense of the verb " " ittakhadhat ( she took ) .
In Verses 16 : 68 - 69 , we are told that it is the female bee that makes honey , a very recent bit of knowledge for humans .
We know now that male bees die after mating with the queen and live only for about 90 days .
Only female bees survive to be the workers , which gather nectar and make honey .
This bit of knowledge could never be known to humans before the invention and use of microscopes .
وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى النَّحْلِ أَنِ اتَّخِذِي مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ الشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُون َ ﴿ ٦٨ ﴾ ثُمَّ كُلِي مِن كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ فَاسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلًا يَخْرُجُ مِن بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُّخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِّلنَّاسِ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُون َ ﴿ ٦٩ ﴾ ( النحل ، 16 : 68-69 ) .
And your Lord inspired the ( female ) bees to take ( build ) its houses ( hives ) on mountains , trees , and in ( people 's ) gardens ( 68 ) Then ( you female bee ) eat from all the fruits and ( you female bee ) follow the ways of your Lord laid down ( for you ) .
There emerges from their bellies a drink , varying in colors , in which there is healing ( cure ) for people .
In that , ( there ) is a sign for a people who give thought ( Al - Na'hl , 16 : 68-69 ) .
In Verse 27 : 18 , there is a reference to a female ant speaking to other ants , which is also a recent bit of knowledge .
We know now that male ants die after mating with the queen , and only female ants survive to be the workers , just like the case with bees mentioned above .
This bit of knowledge could have never be known to humans before the invention and use of microscopes and the advanced studies in biology .
قَالَتْ نَمْلَةٌ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّمْلُ ادْخُلُوا مَسَاكِنَكُمْ ۡ ( النمل ، 27 : 18 ) . " ... a female ant said : " O you ants enter your dwellings " ( Al - Nahl , 27 : 18 ) .
Verse 2 : 26 refers to the mosquito with the singular female noun " ba'oudhatan . " إِنَّ اللَّـهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ( البقرة ، 2 : 26 ) .
Indeed , Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a female mosquito or what is bigger than it ( Al - Baqara , 2 : 26 ) .
This reference to the mosquito in the female noun form distinguish it from male mosquitos , for its different characteristics .
Female mosquitos live twice the life of males .
It is the one which sucks human and animal blood , which is necessary for production of its eggs .
It is capable of doing that because it has a sucking needle that males do not have .
That 's why males feed on plant food .
Verse 29 : 41 refers to the spider in the singular female form , as expressed in the past tense of the verb " " ittakhadhat ( she took ) , because it is the female spider , which builds its web - house to hunt other insects .
Males do not participate in building the house or are allowed to live in it .
That 's why the Verse refers to the house as the female spider house .
Moreover , the Verse tells us that spider house is the weakest of houses , in a reference to the familial relationship between the female spider and her male mate .
We know now that female spiders eat their male mates after the sexual intercourse .
In some kinds of spiders , females lure males for mating in order to eat them .
These scientific facts could not be known until the invention of microscopes and the establishment of the modern biology science .
مَثَلُ الَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِ اللَّـهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ كَمَثَلِ الْعَنكَبُوتِ اتَّخَذَتْ بَيْتًا وَإِنَّ أَوْهَنَ الْبُيُوتِ لَبَيْتُ الْعَنكَبُوتِ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ ( العنكبوت ، 29 : 41 ) .
The example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the ( female ) spider , who takes a home .
And indeed , the weakest of homes is the home of the ( female ) spider , if they only knew ( Al - ' Ankaboot , 29 : 41 ) .
***
The other four kinds of insects , which are mentioned in the Holy Quran , are referred to in the plural noun form , applying to both males and females , reflecting scientific facts about them , which were discovered only lately after the invention of the microscope and the establishment of the modern biology science .
In these four kinds of insects , both males and females work and females do not kill males , as in the cases of the four species mentioned above .
Verse 22 : 73 mentions flies twice , in the plural form , reflecting a scientific fact .
Biologist discovered that the fly life span is about 35 days , for both males and females .
That is why the Verse referred to both of them in plural , without distinguishing one of them from the other .
يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ضُرِبَ مَثَلٌ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُون َ مِن دُونِ اللَّـهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ وَإِن يَسْلُبْهُمُ الذُّبَابُ شَيْئًا لَّا يَسْتَنقِذُوهُ مِنْهُ ضَعُفَ الطَّالِبُ وَالْمَطْلُوبُ ( الحج ، 22 : 73 ) .
O people , an example is presented , so listen to it .
Indeed , those you invoke besides Allah will never create flies , even if they gathered together for that purpose .
And if the flies should steal away from them a ( tiny ) thing , they could not recover it from ( the flies ) .
Weak are the pursuer and pursued ( Al - ' Haj , 22 : 73 ) .
Verse 101 : 4 describes how people will look like when they year the first blow of the Trumpet , ushering the beginning of the Hour , and starting the Last Day .
At that moment , people will be disoriented and dispersed on Earth like the butterflies .
يَوْمَ يَكُونُ النَّاسُ كَالْفَرَاشِ الْمَبْثُوثِ ( القارعة ، 101 : 4 ) .
It is the Day when people will be like the butterflies , dispersed ( Al - Qari'a , 101 : 4 ) .
The Verse mentions the butterflies in the plural noun form , reflecting a scientific fact .
There is no difference between male and female butterflies in their life span or work .
Females are not distinguished from males in any important characteristic .
Therefore , the plural noun form was used in the Verse .
Finally , in Verse 7 : 133 , locusts and lice are also mentioned in the plural noun form for each one of them , reflecting a scientific fact .
There is no difference between males and females , in these two species , in their life span or stages of development .
فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الطُّوفَانَ وَالْجَرَادَ وَالْقُمَّلَ وَالضَّفَادِعَ وَالدَّمَ آيَاتٍ مُّفَصَّلَاتٍ فَاسْتَكْبَرُوا وَكَانُوا قَوْمًا مُّجْرِمِينَ ( الأعراف ، 7 : 133 ) .
So ,
We sent upon them the flood , locusts , lice , frogs , and blood , as distinct signs , but they were arrogant and were a criminal people ( Al - A'araf , 7 : 133 ) .
Locusts are also mentioned in another verse of the Holy Quran ( 54 : 7 ) , which describes people 's condition after the second blow of the Trumpet , after they rise up from under the earth to its surface .
They will be like the spreading locusts .
خُشَّعًا أَبْصَارُهُمْ يَخْرُجُون َ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ ( القمر ، 54 : 7 ) .
Their eyes humbled , they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading ( Al - Qmar , 54 : 7 ) .
Scientists estimate the size of spreading locusts about 10 billion in each swarm .
This is the closest image that we can imagine about the number of people who will come out of earth for Judgment , in the Last day .
They will come out in waves , as Verse 78 : 20 tells us : يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ فَتَأْتُون َ أَفْوَاجًا ( النبأ ، 78 : 18 ) .
The Day the Trumpet is blown , you will come forth in waves ( Al - Naba , 78 : 18 ) .
The world population now is more than 7 billion people , which is only one wave .
Only God knows how many waves of humans will be there .
*** 15 . The topic of the scientific facts in the Holy Quran has been addressed in many books , book chapters , and articles , which can be considered supplemental to this Chapter .
These include various chapters of this book , particularly the fourth Chapter , “ Creation and Evolution in the Holy Quran . ”
Examples of other works , which address this topic are those authored by Zaghloul El - Naggar , Maurice Bucaille , Ibrahim and others , Shah Alam , Ebrahim Azarpour , Yahiya Emerick , and Mohammad Humayoun Khan . [ 15 ] 16 .
Since the last few decades of the 14th Hijri Century ( 20th Christian Century ) , a new category of Muslim researchers has emerged with a focus on the numerical miracles of the Holy Quran .
Needless to say that their works are still at the early stages , incremental , selective , and without agreed upon methods of research .
However , their findings showed that the letters , words , verses , and chapters of the Holy Quran are mentioned in calculated numbers and in a tight numerical system .
Thus , their works demonstrate that it is the Book of God , which could have never been authored by anyone else , except Him , as stated in verse 17 : 88 .
قُل لَّئِنِ اجْتَمَعَتِ الْإِنسُ وَالْجِنُّ عَلَىٰ أَن يَأْتُوا بِمِثْلِ هَـٰذَا الْقُرْآن ِ لَا يَأْتُون َ بِمِثْلِهِ وَلَوْ كَانَ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ ظَهِيرًا ( الإسراء ، 17 : 88 ) .
Say , " If humans and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Quran , they could not produce the like of it , even if they backed up each other ( with help and support ) " ( Al - Issra , 17 : 88 ) .
Moreover , their research findings provide evidence that such tight numerical system of the Holy Quran represents a guarantee that the Book of God will stay intact , without any changes , alterations , additions , or omissions .
If any changes happen , then the numerical balance in the relationships of letters , words , verses , and chapters would have been affected , which would be discovered by researchers .
Thus , Allah , praise to Him , has guarded His Book by making it self - preserving , as stated in verse 15 : 9 . إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ ( الحجر ، 15 : 9 ) .
Indeed ,
We sent down the Quran and We will be its guardian ( Al - ‘ Hijr , 15 : 9 ) .
Examples of Research on the Numerical Miracles of the Holy Quran
There have been hundreds of researchers , who focus on the numerical miracles of the Holy Quran .
Here are brief introductions about four of them , just as examples , without any implication that other researchers are less important in their work or findings .
Rashad Kh alifa ( 1973 , 1981 ) was the first researcher in this category to discover the importance of number 19 , as evidence for the tight numerical system in the Holy Quran .
He started with the first verse of the Book of God , Al - Basmala .
He found that it is composed of 19 letters .
He also found that each of its words is repeated in the Holy Quran with a number , which is a perfect multiplier of the number 19 .
Further , he found that the separate letters , at the start of 29 chapters ( Suras ) of the Holy Quran , have specific numerical indications .
For example , the separate letters ( muqatta’at ) : Alif , Lam , Meem ( A L M ) , at the start of Chapters 2 , 3 , 29 , 30 , 31 , and 32 , are repeated in the Holy Quran 9,899 times , which is a multiplier of number 19 .
The findings of his research encouraged many researchers to follow his path , in their attempts to find more letter and word counts , which are multipless of number 19 , and number 7 later on .
However , despite his pioneering work , which triggered research in this area , Rashad Kh alifa started to focus more on supporting his theory by any means than accepting his research findings .
This led him to twist the data , to the extent that he suggested the exclusion of two verses , which did not suit his calculations . [ 16 ]
Bassam Jarrar ( 2003 ) addressed the topic of number 19 , showing its importance for the numerical miracle of the Holy Quran .
He also used the gematrical ( Jummal ) calculation method , in assigning specific numerical values to the researched letters and verses .
For example , he demonstrated that there is a numerical resemblance between the words “ Adam ” and “ Eissa ” ( Jesus ) , both of which are mentioned in verse 3 : 59 , as follows : إِنَّ مَثَلَ عِيسَىٰ عِندَ اللَّـهِ كَمَثَلِ آدَمَ ۖ خَلَقَهُ مِن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ قَالَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُون ُ ( آل عمران ، 3 : 59 ) .
Indeed , the example of ‘ Eissa ( Jesus ) to Allah is like that of Adam .
He created him of the earth matter ( dirt or soil ) ; then He said to him , " Be , " and he was ( Al - ‘ Imran , 3 : 59 ) .
He observed that the name of “ ‘ Eissa ” ( Jesus ) , peace be upon him , is repeated in the Holy Quran 25 times .
So does the name of “ Adam , ” peace be upon him , which is also repeated 25 times .
Counting the word “ ’ Eissa ” from the beginning of the Holy Quran until verse 3 : 59 , he found that it is repeated 7 times , so does the word “ Adam , ” which is also repeated 7 times .
He also looked for another resemblance , in another chapter , which he found in Surat Maryam ( Chapter 19 ) .
It ’s known that Maryam was the daughter of ‘ Imran , and the first resemblance was in Surat Al - ‘ Imran ( Chapter 3 ) , where the first moment of the creation of ‘ Eissa ( the inception ) was mentioned .
However , more details about his creation came in Chapter 19 .
The word ‘ Eissa ( Jesus ) was mentioned in Surat Maryam ( Chapter 19 ) only once , in verse 34 , and that was the 19th time , counting from the beginning of the Holy Quran text .
That was also the case for the word “ Adam , ” which was mentioned once , in verse 58 of the same Chapter , and that was also the 19th time , counting from the beginning of the Holy Quran text .
Thus , in Chapter 19 , the words “ ’ Eissa ” was mentioned in the Holy Quran for the 19th time , so was the word “ Adam . ”
Moreover , if we count starting from verse 34 , which mentions ‘ Eissa , peace be to him , we find that verse 58 ( which mentions Adam , peace be upon him ) is the 25th verse .
This is one more confirmation about the similarity between them .
In addition to his valuable efforts in showing the numerical miracles in the Book of God , Bassam Jarrar is one of the contemporary interpreters of the Holy Quran .
His interpretations are characterized by a linguistic depth and by using evidence from social life and facts of science , which gave his videos much following on the internet . [ 17 ]
‘ Adnan Al - Rifa - ‘i ( 2009 ) was also interested in number 19 .
He reorganized the Arabic alphabet in a certain way , giving each letter a different numerical value .
Then , he applied his gematrical system to the first verse of the Holy Quran , Al - Basmala , which he described as the key to understand the numerical miracle of the Book of God , as it is composed of 19 letters .
He also mentioned verse 30 of Surat Al - Muddathir ( Chapter 74 ) , “ عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ ” , as the only verse in the Holy Quran , which mentions number 19 .
It states that “ over ( the hellfire ) , there are 19 ” ( angels in charge ) .
He found that the total gematrical value of its letters is 114 , which is the total number of the Holy Quran chapters , and it is a multiple of number 19 .
He added that if we exclude the repeated separate letters ( muqatta ’at ) , the total gematrical value of the remaining letters will be 361 , which is a multiple of number 19 .
Further , he pointed that the total gematrical value of verses 30 - 37 of Surat Al - Muddathir ( Chapter 74 ) is 2,185 , which is a multiple of number 19 .
In addition , he provided many examples of verses and verse parts , the gematrical values of which are multiples of number 19 .
All in all , ‘ Adnan Al - Rifa - ‘ I ’s contributions and hard work deserve to be recognized , despite his selectivity in onlhy giving examples of the cases which apply to his arguments , while not mentioning others which do not apply .
Thus doing , his research method has the basic selectivity problem , which is facing the numerical miracle research in general . [ 18 ]
Abdul Da-im Al - Ka ’heel ( 2006 ) has become one of the famous researchers in the topic of the numerical miracle of the Holy Quran , particularly because of the spread of his videos about that in the internet .
He criticized the selectivity of other researchers , particularly Rashad Kh alifah , who gave himself the liberty to delete the letters and words which did not fit his argument about number 19 .
He pointed that there are other miraculous numbers in the Holy Quran , in addition to number 19 , such as number 7 , which he considered as the base for the numerical system of all words , verses , and chapters of the Holy Quran .
He found that number 11 is present in the letters of verses , which mention the Oneness of God .
He also found number 13 as representing the number of years of the Prophet ’s mission in Makkah , number 23 as representing the number of years in which the Prophet , pbbuh , received revelation , and number 29 as representing the number of chapters which start with separate letters ( muqatta’at ) .
He also provided many numerical facts in the Holy Quran , including its first verse and first chapter , showing the numerical harmony ( consistency ) of number 7 in Surat Al - I kh las ( Chapter 112 ) of the holy Quran .
Al - Ka ’heel criticized other researchers who used gematrical systems , such as ‘ Hisab Al - Jummal , to give numerical values for the letters , words , and chapter numbers of the Holy Quran .
He mentioned that such a method is scientifically baseless and whatever findings researchers found were the result of using selected examples .
Further , he warned researchers to stay away from predicting dates of future events , because these are part of the unknown , which is the sphere of Allah alone .
He also observed that the current numerical miracle research is limited to the use of Al - Mu s ’haf Al - Imam text of the Holy Quran , which is based on the reading of ‘ Haf s from ‘ A s im .
Moreover , he called on researchers to come to an agreement on consistent research methods and on the used data , which should be from the Holy Quran text .
He argued that if the methods and the data are correct , then the findings will be correct , which should represent a true miracle , not just a coincidence .
Actually , he took the initiative ( 2012 ) to address the problem of inaccuracy among some researchers , in counting the letters and words of the Holy Quran .
He formed and chaired a Committee of experts from various Arab countries , which worked for about seven years , for that purpose .
The main established standard the Committee came up with was counting a letter if it is physically written , not how it is pronounced .
The Committee also developed a digitized copy of the Holy Quran , with search functions , and launched it to be used by researchers and the general public ( 2018 ) . [ 19 ]
Khalid Al - Faqih ( 2017 ) wanted to avoid the selectivity problem , which was experienced by other researchers .
Therefore , he embarked on a research endeavor , which applies to the whole text of the Holy Quran , using the gematrical system of ‘ Hisab Al - Jummal .
He observed the rules and guidelines established by Abdul Da-im Al - Ka ’heel ( 2012 ) and his Committee , in order to be as accurate as possible in counting the letters and words of the Holy Quran .
In particular , a letter is counted if it is physically written , not how it is pronounced .
This means that the stressed letters are counted once , not twice as some researchers did .
He started with the calculation the Holy Quran Constant ( HQC ) , by dividing its gematrical value ( 23,506,544 ) by the cumulative sum of verse numbers ( 333,667 ) .
The result was that the HQC is : 70.44911244 , which resembles the way the Quran was mathematically designed , structured and configured .
He argued that it must have the keys to unlock the secrets of the Quran , such as unleashing the Quran statistics ( words , verses and chapters ) and revealing its numerical connection with the golden ratio of living and non-things ( Ф ) .
He calculated the Holy Quran Golden Ratio ( HQGR ) , to compare it with the golden ratio , by dividing the number of the Holy Quran chapters ( 114 ) by the HQC ( 70.44911244 ) .
Thus , he found that the HQGR is : 1.618189304 , which resembles the golden ratio of things ( 1.6180339887 ) , with 99.99 % accuracy .
He considered that finding a clear piece of evidence that the Holy Quran is the Book of Allah , who designed His Book to match His other designs , in His dominium . [ 20 ]

Notes : *
This author ’s translation of the meanings of the verses mentioned in this book is solely his responsibility though he consulted with several translations of the Holy Quran , such as Sahih International , Yusuf Ali , Hilali & Khan , as well as Qaribullah & Darwish , which are carried by www.quranexplorer.com and www.tanzil.net.
The author also made use of the interpretations offered by the three renowned the Holy Quran ( Al - T abari , Al - Qur t ubi , and Ibn Katheer ) .
Readers are advised that it is the meaning of the verses which is translated and interpreted here .
It is a human effort that may be fallible and erroneous .
Further , there are differences between a translator and another and between an interpreter and another due to differences in their linguistic , academic , and cultural backgrounds .
There is no claim of ultimate accuracy in the translation , as verses of the Holy Quran can be best understood through the Arabic text of revelation .
Yahiya Emerick mentioned some of the above verses on pages 24 - 27 of his educational book , " What Islam Is All About . " ( 1997 ) .
New York : IBTS .
Note About the transliteration of the Arabic sounds :
There are three Arabic vowels and their three strong forms ( Tanween , i.e. adding " N " ) .
The first is the Fat 'h a , which maybe expressed in English by the sound / a / , with its strong form of / an /.
The second is the Kassra , which maybe expressed by the sound / i / , with its strong form of / in /.
The third Arabic vowel is the Dh amma , which maybe expressed by the sound / u / , with its strong form of / un /.
Thus , following Arabic grammatical rules , the six vowel forms maybe illustrated in how a common noun , such as bab ( door ) , maybe written and pronounced as baba , baban , babi , babin , babu , and babun .
While all these six vowel forms are written in the Arabic text of the Holy Quran , not all of them are pronounced in recitation , particularly at the end of each verse .
However , they maybe pronounced when several verses are continuously recited .
Arabic written words are mainly composed of consonants ; vowels are added as symbols over or under a letter , as in the case of the text of the Holy Quran .
However , in books and written media , only basic consonants and essential vowels are written as letters .
No vowel symbols are added , as it is expected from an average educated Arabic speaker to know how to pronounce the words without vowel symbols .
Underlined letters in the Quran transliteration Some Arabic letters and sounds have no counterparts in the English alphabet and the English phonetic transcription .
There are nine Arabic sounds which have no equivalence in the English alphabet .
These are ( ح خ ص ض ط ظ ع غ ق ) .
Some translators underline the closest English letters to these Arabic letters , in order to tell readers that these are pronounced differently in Arabic .
The closest sounds expressing the Arabic letters in parentheses , from right to left , are ( h , kh , s , dh , t , tdh , a , gh , q ) .
However , underlining them as ( h , kh , s , dh , t , tdh , a , gh , q ) conveys the message that these are different from the English sounds expressed by the letters of the English alphabet .
The Arabic letter and sound of Tha ( ث ) does not have an equivalent letter and sound in English .
Therefore , it is transliterated by the two underlined English letters " th " to indicate that this is just one Arabic letter and sound .
This is the case of the sound pronounced at the beginning of the English word " three . "
Another examples is that of the Arabic letter and sound of Dh al ( ذ ) , is transliterated by the two underlined English letters / dh / to indicate tht this is just one Arabic letter and sound .
This is the case of the sound pronounced at the beginning of the English word " that . "
This author uses this same method of underlining these letters , with the exception of the two Arabic letters expressed by the / h / and / a / sounds .
Instead of underlining them , he adds an apostrophe before the letter to become / 'h / and / ' a / respectively .
Using an apostrophe instead of underling a letter is for practical reasons only .
First , these two letters are more frequently used than the other letters in the list .
Second , it is easier to use the apostrophe on keyboards than adding underlining after writing .
As an example , an apostrophe is used before the English letter / a / to express the eighteenth letter of the Arabic alphabet / ' ayn / , as in the case of the transliteration of the Good Name of God , Al - ' Azeez , the tenth on the list .
An apostrophe is also used before the English letter / h / to express the sixth letter of the Arabic alphabet / ' ha / , as in the case of translating the Good Name of God , Al - A'had , The above usage of an apostrophe to help express the Arabic sound / ' a / may not be enough if the sound occurs at the end of a word , such as in the case of the Good Name of God , number 30 , " Al - Samee'u . "
This Good Name of God is pronounced as " Al - Samee ' " without conjugation .
However , because the sound / ' a / occurs at the end of the word , the pronunciation may become distorted as / as - samee 'a / instead of / as - samee ' /.
As a solution , this author is using the conjugated form of the noun as a subject to become / as - samee 'u / , the closest to the Arabic pronunciation . [ 1 ]

The first mentioned ‘ Hadith was narrated by Companion Abu Razeen Al - ‘ Uqayli , and recorded in Sa’hi’h Ibn ‘ Habban : 6141 , Al - Tirmi dh i : 3109 , Al - Dh ahabi : 18 , Al - T abari : 1/40 , with little difference .
The Arabic text of the ' Hadith is as follows : ذكر الطبري في تفسير هذه الآية حديثاً مروياً عَنْ أَبِي رَزِين الْعُقَيْلِيّ ، الذي قَالَ ، قُلْت : يَا رَسُول اللَّه ، أَيْنَ كَانَ رَبّنَا قَبْل أَنْ يَخْلُق السَّمَوَات وَالْأَرْض؟ قَالَ : " فِي عَمَاء ، مَا فَوْقه هَوَاء ، وَمَا تَحْته هَوَاء ، ثُمَّ خَلَقَ عَرْشه عَلَى الْمَاء " ( صحيح ابن حبان : 6141 ، الترمذي : 3109 ، والذهبي : 18 ، والطبري : 1 \ 40 ، باختلاف يسير ) .
The second ‘ Hadith , which included Ibn ‘ Abbas ’s answer , was narrated by Sa’id Bin Jubair , and authenticated by Al - Albani : 584 .

Many contemporary Islamic researchers agree with the three renowned interpreters of the Holy Quran , on that this Verse is a prophecy about human space travel .
Among these are Abul Dayim Ku'hail , Muhammed Samir Al - ' Arsh , Shaikh Muhammed Amin Al - Shanqiti , and Muhammed Zaghlool El - Najjar .
See for example the article written in Arabic , under the title of " The scientific miracle in Verse 84 : 19 , " by Husni Hamdan Hamama , which was published on October 13 , 2016 , at : www.alukah.net/sharia/0/108483/. [ 6 ]
In their interpretations of the meanings of Verse 55 : 33 , the three renowned interpreters did not attempt even to think about the possibility of human space travel between Earth and heavenly bodies .
Al - Tabari , who is the earliest of them , interpreted it as the human space travel may happen during the Last Day , when humans and Jinn may try to flee from death by traveling to faraway zones ( regions ) of heavens and Earth .
Al - Qurtubi followed him in that interpretation but added that the verb " tanfudhoo " ( to penetrate ) may mean " to learn . "
Thus , his interpretation was that humans and Jin will try to know about the heavens and the Earth but they will not know until Allah permits that , giving them help through His angels .
Ibn Katheers followed them in that the Verse describes what will happen in the Last Day but he did not mention the zones of heavens and the Earth . [ 7 ]

Al - Tabari interpreted the verb " da'haha " as extended or flattened it for people to earn their living .
He added Verse 79 : 31 , as an explanation because it mentions water and pasture land .
Al - Qurtubi agreed with him , so did Ibn Katheer but he did not analyze the word linguistically , as they did .
For many centuries ago , Muslim scholars , including natural scientists , knew that the Earth is circular in its shape , not flat , using the Quran verses about the subject .
Among these were Ibn ' Hazm , Al - Razi , Ibn Khurdatheba , Ibn Rasta , Al - Mass 'oudi , Al - Irdeessi , and Al - Qizweeni .
See a survey of these Muslim scholars in the Arabic article , titled " Muslims who proved the circular shape of Earth , " by Raghib Al - Sirjani , published at the " Islam Story " website , at : https://islamstory.com/-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86_
Recently , calculations showed that the Earth shape is less than a perfect circular globe .
The diameter of the Earth at the equator is about 43 kilometers ( 27 mi ) larger than the pole - to - pole diameter .
As a result , the latest measurements indicate that the Earth has an equatorial diameter of 12,756 km ( 7926 mi ) , and a polar diameter of 12713.6 km ( 7899.86 mi ) .

Human attempts to find out about intelligent life on other planets has increased recently , in various countries .
China , for example , has just built the biggest radio - telescope in the world , for this purpose , with a diameter of 500 meters .
This is bigger than the largest American telescope , which was built in Puerto Rico , with a diameter of 350 meters .

Other verses which mention pairs of plants : وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً۬ فَأَخۡرَجۡنَا بِهِۦۤ أَزۡوَٲجً۬ا مِّن نَّبَاتٍ۬ شَتَّىٰ ( طه ، 20 : 53 ) . " ... and ( God ) has sent down water from the sky .
With it ,
We have produced diverse pairs of plants ( Taha , 20 : 53 ) .
وَمِن كُلِّ ٱلثَّمَرَٲتِ جَعَلَ فِيہَا زَوۡجَيۡنِ ٱثۡنَيۡنِ‌ۖ ( الرعد ، 13 : 3 ) .
" and of all fruits , He made in them pairs , two each ( a male and a female ) ( Al - Ra'd , 13 : 3 ) .
وَأَنزَلۡنَا مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً۬ فَأَنۢبَتۡنَا فِيہَا مِن ڪُلِّ زَوۡجٍ۬ كَرِيمٍ ( لقمان ، 31 : 10 ) .
We send down water from the sky , ( in order that )
We cause goodly pairs to grow out of it ( of earth ) ( Luqman , 31 : 10 ) .
سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْأَزْوَاجَ كُلَّهَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الْأَرْضُ وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ( يس ، 36 : 36 ) .
Glory to Him ,
Who created all pairs , of what the earth produces , of themselves ( humans ) , and of others unknown to them ( Ya Seen , 36 : 36 ) .
The word " pairs " mentioned in the above verses refers to the sexual reproduction in plants through the interaction between the male and female elements .
This pairing can be found in two separate plants producing the same fruit ( such as date - palm trees ) , or in two different flowers in the same plant ( such as cucumbers ) , or in the same flower containing male and female organs ( pistils and stamens ) , such as tomatoes .
Insects and winds play a major role in carrying the male pollens to fertilize the female organs of various kinds of plants .
These facts became accurately known recently , after the establishment of modern sciences and the invention of the telescope . [ 14 ]

Abdul Da-im Al - Kaheel ( 2006 ) demonstrated the importance of number 7 in the Holy Quran by providing many statistics about it .
He used the method of lining up ( joining together ) numbers of letters , verses , and chapters , resulting in cumulative numbers which are multiples of number 7 .
He mentioned many verses , which include number 7 or its multiples , such as 7 spikes ( ears ) of grain ( Al - Baqara , 2 : 261 ) , 70 men ( Al - A’araf , 7 : 155 ) , 70 times ( Al - Tawba , 9 : 80 ) , 7 cows and 7 spikes ( ears ) of grain ( Yousuf , 12 : 42 ) , 7 gates ( Al - ‘ Hijr , 15 : 44 ) , 7 young men ( Al - Kahf , 18 : 22 ) , 7 seas ( Luqman , 31 : 27 ) , 7 heavens and 7 earths ( Al - T alaq , 65 : 12 ) , 7 nights ( Al - ‘ Haaqqa , 69 : 7 ) , and 70 dh ira ’s : about 20 inches each ( Al - Haaqqa , 69 : 32 ) .
The word Al - Qiyama ( the Rising Day ) was mentioned 70 times , and the word Jahannam ( the Hell ) was mentioned 77 times .
In addition , he found that there are 7 chapters of the Holy Quran , which start with exalting Allah ( tasbee’h ) .
These are Al - Issra ( 17 ) , Al ’ Hadeed ( 57 ) , Al - ‘ Hashr ( 59 ) , Al- S aff ( 61 ) , Al - Jumu ’a ( 62 ) , Al - Ta gh abun ( 64 ) , and Al - A’ala ( 87 ) .
He also found that there are 7 verses about the creation of the heavens and the Earth in six days .
These are Al - A’araf , 7 : 51 ; Younus , 10 : 3 ; Hood , 11 : 7 ; Al - Furqan , 25 : 59 ; Al - Sajda , 32 : 4 ; Qaf , 50 : 38 ; and Al ’ Hadeed , 57 : 4 . Moreover , number 7 is associated with the number of the 7 heavens , which are mentioned in 7 verses .
These are Al - Issra , 17 : 44 ; Al - Muminoon , 23 : 86 ; Fu ss ilat , 41 : 12 ; Al - T alaq , 65 : 12 ; Al - Mulk , 67 : 3 ; and Noo’h , 71 : 15 .
Further , he pointed to the fact that the Holy Quran is written with the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet , which is a multiple of number 7 .
Then , he mentioned that Surat Al - Fati’ha ( the first Chapter of the Holy Quran ) is composed of 7 verses ( as confirmed in Surat Al - ‘ Hijr , 15 : 87 ) and that it is written with 21 letters of the Arabic alphabet , which is a multiple of number 7 .
He added that there are 14 chapters of the Holy Quran , which start with separate letters ( muqatta ’at ) that are not repeated in other chapters .
This is also a multiple of number 7 .
Finally , he mentioned several facts which are related to number 7 , such as the seven electron shells around an atom , the seven days of the week , the seven colors of the spectrum , the seven layers of Earth , the seven circumambulations around the Ka’ba , and the seven runs between Safa and Marwa , during the pilgrimage in Makkah .

According to Al - Faqih ( 2017 ) , the total Abjad value ( AV ) of the Quran is equal to the sum of the Abjad ( gematrical ) values of the three divine components of the Quran .
First , the calculated Abjad value of the Quran ( 114 chapters , 6,236 verses , 86,967 words and 322,604 letters ) equals 23,378278 .
Second , the total Abjad value of the 19 letters that constitute the Bismillahis 786 , thus the total Abjad value of the 112 un - numbered Bismillahs is ( 112×786 ) = 88032 .
Third , the total Abjad value of the 652 letters of the names of the 114 chapters is 40234 .
Thus , the total Abjad value ( AV ) of the Holy Quran is the sum of the three components ( 23378278+88032+40234 ) , which equals 23,506,544 .

GRAND JUNCTION —
Four burly , hairy men are gathered around a sputtering garage - sale lawnmower on a Saturday morning , diagnosing its problems as shoppers browse the guys ’ other castoff offerings .
The men are holding this sale to raise money for their club .
In their ballcaps and well - worn logo T - shirts , and given their prowess at fixing lawnmowers , they could be members of the local Moose or Elks lodge .
But these are members of the Western Slope Bears , a brotherhood of gay men linked by their tendency toward heft and hairiness .
Bears have aligned in major cities since the 1980s , but the clubs have begun to migrate to rural communities across the country , and the Western Slope Bears are one of the newest .
Generally , Bears are men proud of their ample girths , their thatches of facial and body hair and their attraction to men who look like the title characters in “ Grizzly Adams ” and “ Quigley Down Under . ”
They are as far removed from the stylish gay men stereotypically portrayed in TV sitcoms as a Dodge Ram is from a Prius .
As Charles Vigil , the 6 - foot , 220 - pound president of the Front Range Bears , puts it , “ We obviously do n’t look like the guys on the cover of GQ . ”
That ’s not to say that all members sport pelts or prefer a Budweiser to a good bottle of wine .
One of the credos of Bear clubs is that they accept anyone , however hairless and svelte they might be .
“ Bearness is a state of mind , more than a physical type , ” said Sergio Antillon , president of the Western Slope Bears .
Bears say they gravitated into their own organization within the gay culture because they never felt like they fit in with the more mainstream gay community .
Bears have banded together in clubs in 35 countries .
There are about 45 clubs in the United States , from the Junction City Teddy Bears in Kansas to the Green Mountain Growlers in Montpelier , Vt .
The Front Range Bears , who have been meeting for 20 years , have their own very busy Bear bars .
Theirs is one of the oldest Bear clubs in existence , and this October it will hold what is billed as the oldest organized Bear event in the country , Octobearfest , at a Cherry Creek hotel .
“ It ’s built around socializing .
It ’s all about brotherhood , ” said Stephen Fitzhenry , vice president of the Front Range Bears .
“ It ’s the Elks of the gay community . ”
Bears emerged as an offshoot of the gay leather movement in San Francisco in the 1980s .
A forum followed , with Bear magazine , as did a book , simply called “ Bears . ”
The Bears have their own flag with a bear paw on a field of rainbow - striped bear fur .
Bears say they are n’t easily identified by those who are n’t aware of the culture .
“ You would n’t know a Bear unless he wants you to know , ” said Rick , a 6 - foot , 200 - pound member from Grand Junction , who asked that his last name not be used because he lives in a conservative community .
Bears have fashioned their own tongue - in- cheek test for “ beariness ” — a la Jeff Foxworthy ’s “ You might be a redneck ” riff — that includes :
• “ If you ’ve been told you ’re too straight to be gay , you might be a Bear . ”
• “ If you know what your mechanic is talking about , you might be a Bear . ”
Bears also have many subcategories within each group : Polar Bears are the older , white - haired members .
Pandas are of Asian descent .
Otters are skinnier versions of Bears .
There are also related groups .
The Mirth and Girth movement grew out of the Bears but hews more strictly to the bigger body type .
Members of Chubby Chasers might also be Bears or part of Mirth and Girth but have a definite preference for overweight men .
The Denver - based Cycle Sluts and the neighboring Utah Cyber Sluts are gay men with Bear physical characteristics who like to dress in outrageous drag and put on shows and host charity bingo games .
There are Bear gatherings and events across the country — picnics , rafting , rodeos , camping , bowling , four - wheeling and football — Bear websites , a Bear radio station , Bear bars and Bear fundraisers for many charitable causes .
Like the real ursine species , Fitzhenry said , “ we pop up in the strangest places . ”

“ We have it in our power to begin the world over again , ” wrote Thomas Paine in “ Common Sense , ” the revolutionary pamphlet published in January 1776 .
Ronald Reagan quoted those words on July 17 , 1980 , when he addressed the Republican National Convention and accepted his party ’s presidential nomination .
Reagan led a coalition of corporate oligarchs , imperial crusaders and Christian fundamentalists to power , and to this day Reaganism remains the official gospel of the old guard in the Republican Party .
The republican and social democratic ideals of Paine are long lost to many modern partisan Republicans and Democrats , but many memorable phrases of Paine still fill the mouths of career politicians .
When the Iraq war , a broken health care system and a plunging economy gave the Democratic Party a political advantage , Barack Obama raised hopes and promised change .
When Obama gave his inaugural address on Jan. 20 , 2009 , he too quoted Paine , this time from the first of 13 articles collected in “ The American Crisis ” — an article Gen .
Washington ordered read to his troops before crossing the Delaware River on Christmas 1776 to fight the Hessian mercenaries of King George III : “ Let it be told to the future world … that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive … that the city and country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet it . ”
Reagan and Obama each lifted some good lines from Paine for their own rhetorical purposes ; but each likewise cared more for stagecraft than for the original script .
Thomas Paine was born Jan. 29 , 1737 , in Thetford , England , and died on June 8 , 1809 , in Greenwich Village , New York .
He was an active participant in the American and French revolutions , and once said to George Washington , “ a share in two revolutions is living to some purpose . ”
Through his writings he also left a lasting legacy in the British working - class movement .
During his life , his books and pamphlets became instant best - sellers , since he was a pioneer in addressing a wide public in plain language .
He is , in fact , sometimes described as a “ pamphleteer , ” and it is true that even his books are written in the style of pamphlets writ large .
This is entirely to his credit .
In 1943 , Orwell wrote a short piece titled “ Pamphlet Literature , ” and claimed “ that the pamphlet ought to be the literary form of an age like our own .
We live in a time when political passions run high , channels of free expression are dwindling , and organized lying exists on a scale never before known .
For plugging the holes in history the pamphlet is the ideal form . ”
In the age of Murdoch and Berlusconi , the traditional print and broadcast media often serve as megaphones of phony populism .
Nor does organized lying cease to exist simply because the Internet carries a cacophony of voices .
In this sense , “ plugging the holes in history ” is still the aim of political writers , and Paine is still good for morale and instruction .
In the United States , Paine wrote “ Common Sense ” and “ The American Crisis , ” rallying citizens to support independence , and then literally rallying the troops for battle .
When Paine went back to England to promote his own design for a bridge , history had a bigger design for him .
He had become acquainted with Edmund Burke , who argued in the British Parliament that lenience would preserve the loyalty of the colonists , and who finally added his qualified support to the American Revolution .
In a famous speech Burke gave in the House of Commons on March 22 , 1775 , he said , “ In this character of the Americans a love of freedom is the predominating feature . …
This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies , probably , than in any other people of the earth . ”
So long as Burke and Paine had that much common ground , Paine was even glad to visit Burke at his country home .
But in 1789 the French Revolution broke out , and by the next year Burke was making deeply conservative arguments for hereditary rule and property in his book “ Reflections on the Revolution in France . ”
The leading British radicals and republicans , whom Paine knew well , waged a literary war against Burke .
William Godwin wrote his “ Inquiry Concerning Political Justice , ” and Mary Wollstonecraft wrote her “ Vindication of the Rights of Woman . ”
But once again , the runaway best - seller proved to be the first part of Thomas Paine ’s “ The Rights of Man , ” published in 1791 and dedicated to George Washington .
Paine defended the French Revolution , and renewed his attacks against monarchy and all hereditary privilege .
Arguing pointedly against Burke , Paine wrote :
“ The vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies .
Man has no property in man ; neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow . ”
William
Pitt the younger , George III ’s prime minister , led a campaign of repression against radicals and republicans in the early and middle 1790s .
Members of the Church and King Society broke up radical meetings and burned down their camps .
On Nov. 22 , 1792 , a mob of royalist patriots burned an effigy of Paine at Chelmsford , Essex .
Two months earlier , Paine had fled to France ( at the strong advice of William Blake and others ) after he had been charged with sedition .
The trial took place in December , and he was found guilty in absentia , outlawed from ever returning under penalty of imprisonment .
He remained in France 10 years , serving as a deputy in the revolutionary National Convention in Paris ( though he knew little French ) , and he was even appointed in October 1792 to the Committee of Nine to write the new French Constitution .
He kept company with the Girondin faction in the Convention , which already made him a marked man in the eyes of Robespierre and his faction .
He further alienated Robespierre and Marat when he argued that the former king ’s life should be spared .
Paine had fallen afoul of government once again .
In December 1793 Paine was arrested and imprisoned , and the next year “ the Angel of Death ” made a customary chalk mark on his open cell door .
But when the door was closed , Paine and his three cellmates were overlooked as the next cartload of prisoners was taken to the guillotine .
During his 10 months in prison , when he was not disabled by fever , Paine worked on “ The Age of Reason . ”
Like all his other books , this became a best - seller ; and though he argued for deism , he would be branded as an atheist .
The American minister in France , Gouverneur Morris , ignored Paine ’s appeals for help .
Paine also grew convinced that Washington had abandoned him , and he poured out his public grievances later in his “ Letter to Washington . ”
Only when Morris was replaced by James Monroe was Paine finally released , in the fall of 1794 .
By that time Robespierre and most of his party had been guillotined , and the Convention was now called the Assembly .
Paine was elected to this assembly in December 1794 , and wrote his last major works : the last parts of “ The Age of Reason , ” “ Dissertations on the First Principles of Government ” and , finally , in 1797 , “ Agrarian Justice . ”
In 1802 , at the invitation of Thomas Jefferson , Paine returned to the United States .
As the political struggle between the Jeffersonian and the Federalist factions had sharpened , Paine contributed most often to the Jeffersonian press and cause .
Jefferson was among the very few people who still honored Paine .
Paine received a modest financial grant for his services to the republic , and the state of New York gave him a small farm in the town of New Rochelle .
After he died in 1809 in Greenwich Village , his body was taken to be buried on his farm in New Rochelle .
Paine had requested burial in the cemetery of the local Quaker meeting , but the elders had refused .
Madame Bonneville , who had been the wife of one of Paine ’s comrades in France and who became Paine ’s housekeeper , made his final funeral arrangements .
By some accounts , only five or six people attended his burial , including Bonneville and her son , two African men who had walked many miles in gratitude for Paine ’s work against slavery , and one man in Quaker garb who refused to disown the free thinker .
Madame Bonneville later gave an account of “ an obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land , ” writing :
“ Looking round me , and beholding the small group of spectators , I exclaimed , as the earth tumbled into the grave , ‘ Oh ! Mr. Paine !
My son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America , and I , for France ! ’
This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and philosopher ! ”
Though only a handful of people stood by when his body was buried , his skull and bones are now claimed as relics around the world .
None of those bones have been proved to be Paine ’s , though we do know his grave was robbed in 1819 by a journalist and publisher named William Cobbett .
In Paine ’s last years , Cobbett had been one of his rabid foes ; but when Paine was dead , Cobbett read the man ’s books in earnest and became such a thorough convert that the two men had a long intertwined afterlife in the culture of the British working class .
Since the United States had raised no proper memorial for Paine , Cobbett decided to dig up the remains and take them to England .
Cobbett ’s timing was bad .
The old wave of anti-Jacobin sentiment had given way to a new wave of anti-Napoleonic , nationalist and royalist sentiment .
Cobbett was not able to raise a bronze and marble monument , though he raised a chorus of ridicule from British journalists and cartoonists .
Paine ’s father was a Quaker and a master stay - maker ( a maker of the whale - bone corsets worn by fashionable women at the time , not the usual line of work among Quaker artisans ) .
Paine ’s mother was a member of the Church of England , and must have had a streak of independence to marry a Quaker of any trade or social rank .
As a boy and young man , Tom often went with his father to the local Quaker meeting in Cage Lane , adjoining the jail , the pillory and the gibbet .
( In later life , Paine readily claimed that he had received “ an exceeding good moral education ” from the Quakers . )
Twice in his late teens Paine ran away from home to the London docks , seeking employment as a privateer .
The first time , he was found by his father at the docks and was persuaded to come home .
The second time he did go to sea and he came back with 50 pounds , good wages at that time .
He bought a set of clothes fit for a gentleman , but was out of funds a few months later .
Paine married twice while living in England .
His first wife died in childbirth , and the child did not survive .
He obtained a legal separation from his second wife , and they had no children .
He tried several lines of work — as a stay - maker , teacher , tobacco shop owner and tax collector .
In 1772 , he published his first political article , “ The Case of the Officers of Excise , ” a petition for better wages and working conditions .
He moved to London , and there , in the clubs and coffeehouses where artisans , merchants and aristocrats often mixed , he joined in conversations about culture and politics .
He also attended public lectures on astronomy and other sciences .
He took a practical interest in engineering , and he got a British patent for his design of a single - span iron bridge .
In London he met the radical Unitarian minister Joseph Priestley , one of the two discoverers of oxygen .
He met the Scottish astronomer James Ferguson .
And , most important , he met a man with whom Ferguson was collaborating on the design of a new clock , Benjamin Franklin .
As Craig Nelson wrote in “ Thomas Paine : Enlightenment , Revolution , and the Birth of Modern Nations , ” “ Though the Enlightenment would sweep through every social niche , its most ardent disciples would be workingmen or artisans — self - employed master craftsmen and wage - earning journeymen who made , in that pre-industrial era , pretty much everything money could buy .
…
In the 18th century they called themselves ‘ mechanics ’ , and their great hero was the world ’s most celebrated self - made mechanic , Benjamin Franklin . … ”
Franklin ’s gospel of thrift , patience and self - improvement may well have brought a new focus and resolve to the life of Paine .
This whole period in London encouraged Paine to test his own powers and set himself new tasks .
In Nelson ’s view , “ Those two years would make him a central figure in the creation of the modern world . ”
Franklin encouraged Paine to make his future in the American colonies .
In October 1774 , Paine sailed from London and he arrived in Philadelphia on Nov. 30 .
He was 37 years old .
He spent his first weeks recovering his health after being stricken by the typhus fever that swept through crew and passengers during the ocean crossing .
But he also held several letters of recommendation from Franklin , and these served as his key to the city .
Paine rented a room at the corner of Front and Market , and in Robert Aitken ’s bookshop next door he soon learned that Aitken owned a printing press .
Aitken offered Paine a job as chief editor of the new Pennsylvania Magazine , and Paine readily accepted .
With Paine both editing and writing for every issue , the magazine soon became the most popular publication in North America .
In March 1775 , Paine ( writing under the pseudonym “ Justice and Humanity ” ) wrote and published an article against slavery , arguing that the subject relationship of the colonists to the British crown should have taught them enough moral and practical lessons to renounce holding Africans as property .
According to Nelson , this essay brought Paine to the attention of Dr. Benjamin Rush , a prominent anti-slavery campaigner , who introduced him to other prominent colonial citizens .
In August of the same year , he also published a plea for women ’s rights , noting that “ even with changes in attitudes and laws , ” women often remained “ slaves of opinion which rules them with absolute sway and construes the slightest appearances into guilt ; surrounded on all sides by judges who are at once tyrants and their seducers . … ”
In Pennsylvania , the Quaker William Penn had offered not only religious freedom , but also the most nearly republican political culture of any of the colonies .
In 1682 , Penn declared in his Frame of Government for Pennsylvania , “ Any government is free to the people under it ( whatever be the frame ) where laws rule , and the people are a party to those laws . ”
But by the time Paine arrived , an upper class of merchants and landowners ( including Penn ’s descendants ) had consolidated so much power that open class resentment had grown among hired workers and tenant farmers .
In his biography of Paine , Nelson estimates that mechanics constituted nearly half the population of Philadelphia on Paine ’s arrival , and held 30 to 40 percent of its wealth .
By background and by conviction , Franklin and Paine had close ties with this working - class stratum of skilled artisans .
Yet Franklin fashioned a smooth social mask and was prosperous enough to find a fixed place among the Founding Fathers , whereas Paine has always been regarded as a much more prickly and plebeian outsider .
Paine joined with a band of Philadelphia radicals who not only pressed for national independence but also spearheaded a revision of the state constitution in 1776 .
In 1780 , An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery was passed in Pennsylvania , and carried Paine ’s signature as clerk of the General Assembly .
Though it was a legal milestone , nothing like the later resolute Abolitionist spirit of John Brown and Frederick Douglass is found in that document .
On one side of the scales of justice , this document weighed the fact that God chose to create people with diverse complexions , “ so all are the work of an Almighty Hand . ”
But the other side of the scales was weighed down with a large concession to the surrounding slave states , namely , a clause stating that the passage of the act “ shall not give any relief or shelter to any absconding Negro or Mulatto slave or servant . … ” Slavery , as a daily moral problem and as a daily material reality , had been exported by the British to their colonies , including the West Indies and southern Africa .
And yet that very geographical distance is one reason the British made decisive legal and political moves against slavery well before the American Civil War and Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation .
In England , after a long campaign in Parliament led by William Wilberforce ( and supported by some evangelical Christians and secular republicans ) , the British finally passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833 .
In the United States , the home ground was more deeply stained and entangled with slavery , so the struggle against it passed in time from Quaker persuasion to the more militant abolitionists .
Paine had argued with Aitken about his wages at the Pennsylvania Magazine , and by summer of 1775 he was determined to publish a new extended essay elsewhere .
In September he read the first draft aloud at Dr. Rush ’s house , and by December he had passed out copies to astronomer David Rittenhouse , Boston rebel Sam Adams and of course his benefactor Benjamin Franklin .
John and Samuel Adams , along with Franklin , had been among the very few people who argued in private for an independent nation , but Paine was the first to make these arguments in public print .
Paine ’s pamphlet of 96 pages , “ Common Sense , ” was published by Robert Bell on Jan. 9 , 1776 .
( In the second edition of “ Common Sense , ” Paine appended an open letter to the Quakers , suggesting that they should keep quiet if they wished to keep a consistent witness of political quietism , or else they should make their protest for peace directly to the king of England .
In Pennsylvania , the more prosperous Quakers , Presbyterians and Anglicans formed an odd de facto coalition opposed to the agitation for independence . )
Competing publishers and pirate editions soon made Paine ’s first serious work a best - seller .
By the end of January a German translation appeared in Pennsylvania , and a French translation appeared in Quebec by the end of April .
Other editions soon appeared in London , Edinburgh , Paris , Berlin , Rotterdam , Copenhagen , Warsaw , Dubrovnik and Moscow .
In his “ History of the American Revolution , ” George Trevelyan wrote , “ It would be difficult to name any human composition which has had an effect at once so instant , so extended and so lasting . … ”
Nelson wrote , “ In time , Thomas Paine ’s first book would sell at least 500,000 copies domestically at a time when the nation ’s population ( including slaves ) was a bare three million — the equivalent of thirty - five million copies today .
Over half the citizens of the turbulent North American colonies either read it , or had it read to them , and Paine ’s share of the proceeds ( which he donated to the American government , as he would do with all his copyrights ) , were used to buy the nascent Continental Army its mittens . ”
Washington found “ sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning ” in “ Common Sense , ” and noted that the pamphlet was “ working a wonderful change in the minds of many men . ”
“ Common Sense ” was , in the view of American historian Bernard Bailyn , “ the most brilliant pamphlet written during the American Revolution , and one of the most brilliant pamphlets ever written in the English language . ”
Paine opens the argument of “ Common Sense ” with a distinction between society and government : “ Society is produced by our wants , and government by our wickedness ; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections , the latter negatively by restraining our vices . ”
And the second paragraph begins with some of the most famous lines Paine ever wrote : “ Society is in every state a blessing , but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil ; in its worst state an intolerable one .
…
Government , like dress , is the badge of lost innocence ; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise .
For were the impulses of conscience clear , uniform , and irresistibly obeyed , man would need no other lawgiver . …
” This is memorable writing , but in his later works Paine unmistakably changes his tone and reasoning when he revisits the subject of the duties and limits of government .
Unfortunately , the famous early lines of Paine are framed and frozen as his essential creed even by some scholars sympathetic to the libertarian left and to democratic socialism .
Indeed , when political scientist Isaac Kramnick wrote an introduction to a bicentennial Pelican edition of “ Common Sense ” in 1976 ( later republished by Penguin Classics ) , Kramnick interpreted Paine in this manner : “ Government was not a positive agent laying the foundation for a just or a good society , let alone a welfare state .
Its only role was to provide a stable and secure setting for the operations of commercial society . ”
That is not just a minor misreading of Paine , but a major distortion of the whole trajectory of his thought , both early and late in his life .
The philosopher A.J. Ayer noted a tension between the arguments Paine made for natural rights , and the arguments he made in a more utilitarian manner ; but in neither case did Paine ever abandon a distinctly moral view of human relations .
Paine ’s moral sense smolders and flares up on almost every page , even when he is presenting economic facts and figures .
Paine ’s critique of government did change with time , and he did finally find a larger role for both government and taxation in providing basic social democracy .
But Kramnick simply portrays Paine as a lifelong exemplar of “ bourgeois radicalism , ” and this might be historically true if he meant to argue that many 18th century mechanics would join a rising middle class .
That argument would border upon my own in this article , since Paine was among the most class - conscious of the radical republicans .
Kramnick ’s only argument for class consciousness , however , would have to be an argument for a middle class rising right up to the ruling class .
For what would stop them ?
Not “ bourgeois radicalism , ” which Kramnick bluntly defines as “ the ideology of Tom Paine . ”
Here we come to the real reason Paine has never been a welcome figure in group portraits of the Founding Fathers .
In the person of Paine we do behold an ideologically contradictory persona , but also a rapidly evolving egalitarianism .
Kramnick acknowledged “ that Paine pushed bourgeois radicalism to its outermost limits . … ” Kramnick ’s bicentennial message , if not his class - conscious mission , becomes plain in his own words :
“ To emphasize the bourgeois Paine is not to discount the Paine who later would become a hero for the Chartists and early trade unionists .
It is simply to insist that his radicalism be seen as still within the bourgeois fold , a line of interpretation receiving little stress in recent discussions of his politics . ”
This is nothing less and nothing more than the molding of a bicentennial wax - work figure of laissez - faire ideology , the stamping of a “ special edition ” medallion from the Franklin Mint , and , in short , the conjuration of a prophet and precursor of Gerald Ford in the year 1976 .
Readers can be pointed to Kramnick ’s text to decide whether he does or does n’t discount the Paine who became an early hero for later labor radicals and even for frank socialists .
In studying the works of Paine , we find a man both daring and conflicted .
Paine often draws back from the brink of his own most advanced ideas .
Sometimes we find Paine surveying a social chasm wider than the Grand Canyon ; and , with all his good will and genius in the 18th century , he cannot draw up a single - span iron bridge to cross over to the other side .
Paine was certainly a troubled man in some periods of his life , and finally a quite lonely man as well .
If we attribute this only to personality and not also to class consciousness , then the anxiety of Paine teaches us no more useful lesson than the anxiety of various scholars seeking to keep him “ within the bourgeois fold . ”
“ Tyranny , for Paine , was taxation . ”
So Kramnick wrote , and for proof he offered a quote from Paine ’s “ Anti-Monarchical Essay ” ( 1792 ) : “ … in a word , whoever demands a king , demands an aristocracy , and thirty millions in taxes . ”
Yes , but it does not follow that whoever demands millions in taxes to provide grants to young workers , solidarity to the unemployed and aid for the elderly is thereby demanding the restoration of monarchy .
For these are precisely some of the economic proposals Paine also makes in “ The Rights of Man . ”
In that book Paine laid line after line of dynamite at the foundations of the fortress built up with so many medieval towers and turrets by Edmund Burke to defend hereditary peers , prejudice and property .
Here we will find Paine pushing the limits of 18th century social democracy , and we will find him making class - conscious and materialist arguments :
“ Why , then , does Mr. Burke talk of his house of peers , as the pillar of the landed interest ?
Were that pillar to sink into the earth , the same landed property would continue , and the same ploughing , sowing , and reaping would go on .
The aristocracy are not the farmers who work the land , and raise the produce , but are the consumers of the rent ; and when compared with the active world are the drones , a seraglio of males , who neither collect the honey nor form the hive , but exist for lazy enjoyment . ”
Paine was acquainted in England with William Blake , who already mentioned the “ dark Satanic mills ” of early industrialism in one of his poems .
Had Paine lived to observe British factories and working - class slums a century later , he would have given that scene a similar survey .
In Paine ’s time , Adam Smith was considered the Isaac Newton of economics , thus giving mercantile capitalism the blessings of the laws of nature .
Smith often stated that trade monopolies undermined free trade , without giving any clear enforcement plan beyond moral warnings to break up such monopolies .
Many self - styled disciples of Smith happily edit out the moral homilies , and then read him as if he was simply an 18th century Ayn Rand .
The same liberties can be taken with Paine for the sake of the same libertarian ideology .
Paine was certainly influenced by doctrines of the free market .
In Paine ’s time , the free market already had both mechanical and metaphysical properties , since the machinery of class domination had been set in perpetual motion by some hidden hand .
This was an early version of the belief that the free market was free as the birds and the bees , though also subject to a few natural disasters .
Capitalism , in the most optimistic view ( then and now ) , was naturalism .
Adam Smith did not , of course , have in mind Ayn Rand ’s Social Darwinism .
No , but as the real costs of the free market grew unmistakable , the naked Social Darwinist doctrine became necessary .
From the fountainhead of class struggle emerged not only the trade unions and the socialists , but also such “ libertarian ” class warriors as von Mises , Rand and Milton Friedman .
Where do we locate Thomas Paine in this picture ?
He studied economic documents , but he was not an economist .
He was not only a citizen of England , America and France , but also a citizen of “ the republic of letters . ”
In “ The Rights of Man , ” Paine even took the utopian view ( all too much under the spell of Smith ) that commerce tended to advance world peace : “ I have been an advocate for commerce , because I am a friend of its effects .
It is a pacific system , operating to unite mankind by rendering nations , as well as individuals , useful to each other .
…
If commerce were permitted to act to the universal extent it is capable of , it would extirpate the system of war , and produce a revolution in the uncivilized state of governments . ”
This was naive even in his own day , but we cannot blame him for not forecasting the fierce imperial rivalries and world wars of later centuries .
In England there were always links between political and religious dissenters , so a good number of British republicans , anti-slavery activists and working - class radicals attended the chapels and meetinghouses of the Methodists , Baptists , Quakers and other dissenting churches .
By the time Thomas Paine was born , the civil disobedience of the early Quakers was hardly necessary .
As E.P. Thompson wrote in “ The Making of the English Working Class , ” “ They had prospered too much : had lost some of their most energetic spirits in successive emigrations to America : their hostility to State and authority had diminished . … ” A sterner spirit of dissent existed among the Baptists at that time , and found expression in John Bunyan ’s “ Pilgrim ’s Progress . ”
“ And it is above all in Bunyan , ” wrote Thompson , “ that we find the slumbering Radicalism which was preserved through the 18th century and which breaks out again and again in the 19th .
Pilgrim ’s Progress is , with Rights of Man , one of the two foundation texts of the English working - class movement : Bunyan and Paine , with [ William ] Cobbett and [ Robert ]
Owen , contributed most to the stock of ideas and attitudes which make up the raw material of the movement from 1790 - 1850 . ”
Eighteenth century artisan work was often highly skilled , and this stratum of the English working class was both numerous and literate .
( Nineteenth century industrial production , by contrast , began with the immiseration and consequent illiteracy of many workers drawn from the traditional artisan class .
The poorest rural and urban workers had , of course , always had to struggle for both wages and literacy . )
Artisan labor and public association created relative independence from the ruling ideas of the ruling class .
So did the printing presses , which published much of the news the ruling class saw fit to print , but also published an ever increasing number of republican and radical journals .
Coffee , chocolate and tobacco , all part of the “ free trade ” of empire ( widely extracted from slave labor ) , also kept the customers coming to the pubs , clubs and coffeehouses that multiplied in London , Paris and Philadelphia .
Radicals , republicans and revolutionaries found much common ground in these material circumstances and public places .
“ That filthy little atheist , ” as Thomas Paine was called by Theodore Roosevelt ( a man we might with more justice call that filthy little imperialist ) , has few monuments dedicated to his memory , and has sometimes had few readers beyond those students who are required to read his great revolutionary pamphlet “ Common Sense . ”
This pamphlet was the firebrand Paine wielded to spread the flame of independence throughout the British colonies in America , with such success that John Adams claimed that “ without the pen of Paine the sword of Washington would have been wielded in vain . ”
Adams was honest enough to acknowledge the persuasive talents of Paine , but lost no time publishing his own pamphlet in 1776 opposing the more “ democratical ” politics of Paine , Jefferson and others .
Many who had first hailed Paine as an archangel of light would later claim that he had become a son of Lucifer .
The odor of sulfur always stuck to Paine after he wrote and published “ The Age of Reason , ” and yet all his infidelities to orthodox religion do not make him an outright infidel .
Paine began his public life by disavowing the divinity of kings ; he proceeded to disavow the divinity of Jesus Christ ; and during his last years he even disavowed the divinity of George Washington , which made most of his few remaining friends and comrades decide that the old iconoclast had finally gone too far .
Those ideas may not disturb the peace of many people today , at least not if taken one by one , or even all together .
But in Paine ’s time , such ideas carried great risks , and usually remained restricted to small circles of friends and readers .
Paine deliberately stepped outside of those inner circles .
He repeatedly made the decision to become Citizen Paine , a person in public life .
If we assume Paine became a republican and a revolutionary all at once , we may as well assume that no larval stage precedes a butterfly and that no geological rift precedes an earthquake .
The habit of public life has to be cultivated to create citizens and to preserve democracy .
If that much seems too plain for words , we forget that the plain language of people like Paine was one of the great advances toward personal liberty and social solidarity .
Paine added greatly to our common store of common sense .
The men and women who first invented ( or , in the 18th century , reinvented ) the republican tradition were flawed , all too human and brave .
Their courage and their ideals will have died with them if we allow the big corporate political parties to undermine both democracy and the republic in our own time .
Paine advanced the causes of universal suffrage , equality for women , abolition of slavery , separation of church and state , public education , and progressive taxation .
He made the first proposal for a guaranteed minimum income .
He advised a system of public funding to give starting grants to young workers , and to aid the poor , the unemployed and the elderly .
He believed that only well - informed and active citizens could defend democracy , and he roused the hostility of John Adams , Alexander Hamilton and others who were already a rising oligarchy of the wealthiest landowners and merchants .
Paine was an advocate of republican world revolution , and ( if we consider his time and culture ) he was a genuine social democrat .
There are historians who claim he showed little originality of thought , only originality in his plain prose and telling turns of phrase .
But the proof of his powerful mind was shown in his ability to survey and summarize a vast treasury of Enlightenment thinking ; and his deliberate choice to address a wide audience of working people seemed original enough to the ruling classes of his time .
Most of Paine ’s practical proposals of the social democratic kind appear in “ The Rights of Man ” ( particularly part two ) , and in one of his last works , a long pamphlet titled “ Agrarian Justice . ”
As historian Eric Foner noted in “ Tom Paine and Revolutionary America , ” “ More than in any other essay , Paine seemed torn in Agrarian Justice between his customary desire to unite all classes in what he perceived as the common good , and his sympathy for the plight of the European poor . ”
Though there are utopian elements in these works , he took care to study and publish many relevant economic figures , so his criticism of existing conditions and his budget for reforms was not drawn from the clear blue sky .
If we expect him to be as comprehensive as a modern economist ( or indeed as a modern socialist ) , then we can easily prove how clever we are without ever acknowledging both the practical and prophetic dimensions of his thought .
Even so , the subject of public health is sketchy to a vanishing point in the works of Paine .
Medicine was still emerging as an empirical field of knowledge , doctors were still shaking off a reputation for quackery , and the particular field of public medicine barely existed beyond the usual charity wards and hospitals .
So Paine may have slighted this subject in real modesty .
But he may have trusted his readers to fill in the gaps as well .
This is suggested in one of the best studies of Paine ’s work , a book by the British philosopher A.J. Ayer , titled simply “ Thomas Paine . ”
Ayer drew a comparison between the social democratic proposals of Paine and the reforms introduced by the British Labour Party in the wake of World War II :
“ This brings me to the end of Paine ’s blueprint for what I have felt justified in calling his Welfare State .
Its main difference from the package introduced in 1945 is the absence of a scheme of National Health Service .
I suggest that the reason for this is that Paine ’s principal aim was to abolish poverty .
He may , therefore , have assumed that once this was achieved , there would be no need to make special provision for health .
His measures would ensure that those who needed medical attention would be able to pay for it . ”
We may get a better idea of Paine ’s clarity and courage if we study how he anticipated public policies that would only be put into real practice under 20th century European social democrats , and in this country under Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal .
But even if we limit our interest to the timeline of his own life , he stands out among revolutionaries who not only dared to think but also dared to act .
The historical gap between Enlightenment in theory and Enlightenment in practice is clear enough in a celebrated essay which Immanuel Kant wrote in 1784 , “ An Answer to the Question : What is Enlightenment ? ”
Kant took care to drop a curtsey to the Prussian monarch when he claimed “ this is the century of enlightenment , the century of Frederick . ”
Kant did not even propose a constitutional monarchy .
Nor did he dare mention the American Revolution .
He did make a plea for “ the freedom to use reason publicly in all matters ” :
“ Enlightenment is man ’s emergence from his self - imposed immaturity .
Immaturity is the inability to use one ’s understanding without guidance from another .
This immaturity is self - imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding , but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another .
Sapere Aude !
[ Dare to know ! ]
‘ Have courage to use your own understanding !’— that is the motto of enlightenment . ”
All well and good .
But precisely the failure to act in common meant that much of the European public remained subject to the will of hereditary rulers .
The advice of Kant remained in the realm of German idealism , and of slow diffusion through the educated public of Europe .
To be on the same page only in ideals could lead to political quietism , and even to an open divorce between theory and practice .
The republicans of the 18th century were not above using the blunt instruments of worldly power , or the sharp silencer of the guillotine .
But Paine can be remembered and honored as an early civil libertarian among the early republicans .
Behind the polemical heat of the attacks Paine turned upon dogmatic religions , we will find a sentiment much cooler and much closer in spirit to these words of Gotthold Lessing : “ Let each man say what he deems truth , and let truth itself be commended unto God ! ”
If that seems to be an empty piety , consider all that is implied in those words — including the strong suggestion that no single mortal mind or religious doctrine could encompass the whole truth .
The search for truth requires pluralism in public life .
For many republicans this meant daring to create a public sphere of conflicting voices , and therefore of conflicting claims to truth .
The early republicans took great personal risks to speak their minds , and Paine in particular became a guiding spirit for later American radicals such as Walt Whitman , Robert Ingersoll , Emma Goldman and Eugene Debs .
Abraham Lincoln ’s law partner , William Herndon , claimed that Lincoln had written an essay defending the deism of Paine in 1835 .
Herndon also claimed that the manuscript was burned by Lincoln ’s friend , Samuel Hill , to protect Lincoln ’s political career .
Thomas Edison admired Paine as a fellow inventor and free thinker , and stated , “ I have always regarded Paine as one of the greatest of all Americans .
Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic . … ”
Big round anniversary numbers often roll the dead back to life , and the 200th anniversary of Paine ’s death has brought him a new round of public honors , a revival of interest among scholars , and a recent discussion of his life and work on PBS ’ “ Bill Moyers Journal . ”
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , the writings of Paine generated a kind of solar energy among republicans throughout the Americas and throughout Europe .
Yet his reputation also suffered a lunar fortune , waxing whenever people searched the past for present inspiration , and waning whenever people accepted the propaganda about the godless and bloodthirsty Jacobin .
Even in his own country and lifetime , Paine ’s fame gave way to infamy and finally to mere forgetting .
The works of Paine did not simply fall out of fashion once he had been laid in his grave .
No , he was elbowed out of the inner circles of government even while he was living .
If we reduce the story of his life to a psychological study , any fool could find evidence of a difficult character .
But the real difficulty many of his contemporaries had with this man was not simply personal but political .
And the real difficulty so many liberals and conservatives have with Paine today is the plain fact that he was both a radical republican and a social democrat .
We cannot claim Paine as a modern democratic socialist , but he remains a prickly hedgehog if we place him in the company of modern Republicans and Democrats .
If Paine is to be taken seriously today , he will still be a pain the neck of career politicians .
While Paine was still living , his worst enemies either did not bother to read “ The Age of Reason ” or they deliberately chose defamation above the evidence of his own words .
Why atheism should be considered defamatory is a fair question , but it was not simply a philosophical question in the 18th century .
Even bare - knuckle politics could be a gentleman ’s sport , but the charge of atheism always took off the gloves and brought brass knuckles into the boxing ring .
In that respect little has changed during the whole history of the United States of America ( a phrase Paine invented , and which was promptly adopted as the name of the new republic ) .
Paine was never tarred and feathered for his religious and political beliefs , but in England his effigy was hanged and burned by angry royalist mobs , and in the United States a coach in which he was riding was pelted with stones by angry Christians .
Paine had the misfortune to return to the United States during an evangelical revival now known as the Second Great Awakening .
The 18th century democrats and republicans did not create something from nothing , and they did not create gold from lead .
Paine ( among others ) did show real originality in casting the available older materials into the crucible of current events , and drawing out silver seven times refined .
How is it possible that the political philosopher Thomas Paine emerged from his working - class English artisan background ?
How did he dare put republican ideals to the test of common action ?
Asking that question goes a long way toward answering it , because artisan material production also helped to create a public sphere beyond the Court of St. James ’s , the House of Lords and debates in Parliament .
Likewise , when British men and women broke away from the Church of England , they often paid real penalties in the long struggle for religious civil liberties .
They were slandered , beaten , jailed and sometimes put to death .
The artisan - class politics and the religious idealism in the background of Paine can be studied almost as distinct cultural chemicals , but the real chemistry is all in the mix .
This spirit of religious and political dissent was already the milk and honey of the Promised Land for the young Tom Paine , and a true foretaste of earthly freedom .
For Paine , the horizon of faith was a mirage unless he could plant his feet on the common ground of free citizens .
His moral and intellectual compass was never oriented toward an inward paradise , but toward the worldly creation of liberty .
All men and women might be born free , but liberty would never be guaranteed only by claiming natural rights .
That claim had to be advanced precisely through political struggle .
Paine chose a journey far beyond his island country and far beyond any orthodox faith .
Paine both drew upon and created the common sense of his time .
The very title of Paine ’s most infamous book was later adopted as a general term for various kinds of rationalism and empiricism , usually bearing the stamp of Europe and the 18th century .
Paine placed in the public square ( and in plain language ) all of the most pointed opinions on “ revealed religion ” which skeptics , scientists and philosophers had already addressed to much smaller circles .
Indeed , many of these opinions had become the common sense of prominent Founding Fathers , including Washington , Jefferson and Franklin .
Paine believed that whatever we deem truth deserves a public hearing , not simply the audience of an inner circle .
He sinned against prudence and discretion , or at least many of his old friends and comrades soon decided that was so .
Testing the public limits of tolerance , Paine also became one of the practical civil libertarians of both Europe and the early American republic .
In Britain there are conservatives who still grow irate at the mention of his name .
In their own way , they understand .
Whereas in the United States there are liberals who barely know his name at all , beyond a high school civics class or a passage in a college text .
They do not understand , and many of them have not even forgotten because they never learned in the first place .
The lesson for liberals is that conservatives sometimes remember what makes radicals truly radical , long after liberals have forgotten .
Conservatives still quote chapter and verse from Edmund Burke ’s “ Reflections on the Revolution in France . ”
Liberals , and indeed radicals , might quote in turn and as often from “ The Rights of Man , ” the book Thomas Paine wrote in response to Burke .
Paine and Burke carried on an argument about politics and liberty that began long before them , and has continued long after .
But Burke is always an honored guest among serious conservatives , whereas Paine is little more than a ghost in the memory of many liberals .
Beyond the circles of scholars and historians , Paine deserves a much wider place in public memory and in public conversation .
Paine had helped raise the tide of revolution , but by the end of his life he had become stranded by his own advancing ideas .
And , yes , to a degree by his own sheer cussedness .
As Paine grew elderly and embittered , he turned more often to brandy .
His best thoughts no longer gained currency — on the contrary , he seemed to gain increasing infamy .
Paine did not tailor his convictions to the more uniform fashions of the most prosperous leaders of the republic .
At least he did not break his heart wondering how to win friends and influence people in our modern manner .
His moods of indignation alternated with spells of stoicism .
He had lived long enough to discover that every revolution is also a wheel of fortune .
Even his most bitter words have a natural taste to this day , like fresh salt or strong vinegar .
The author of “ Common Sense ” rarely lost his own , though he lost his temper often enough to pen and publish some lines he would have done better to strike .
Paine lived in an age in which journalists were still emerging as public figures , and indeed in which public journals were still emerging as literary products .
In that age , many writers who were alert to current events and to public action became journalists not by habit or by profession , but by writing quite literally “ for the day . ”
Or , in French , “ pour le jour . ”
“ For the day ” also implies for the general public , and thereby journalism gained the name .
If we compare Paine ’s prose style with the rhetorical roulades of some of his contemporary French revolutionaries , we find an equally strong spirit but a more sober delivery .
He must have known when he was writing a great line , just as Verdi must have known when he had spun out a great tune , but all his best work belongs in the tradition of plain English political prose .
There is the same effort to think clearly and therefore to write clearly as we find in Orwell .
All of Paine ’s books open room by room like a house made with honest craft and solid materials .
If we regard those founding republicans as figures in a fairy tale , then we might as well bury the whole republic and build a marble monument inscribed with these words : Once Upon A Time .
Today , in the United States , the highest ideal of many members of the ruling class is to create a private paradise of wealth , and they have no qualms if that goal can be achieved by buying career politicians in Congress .
These people know the market value of “ our two party - system , ” but they have never known the value of democracy .
Plainly , it serves the interests of a small but immensely wealthy minority if we , the people , leave politics to politicians except on election days .
Plainly , it serves the interests of the great majority of working people if we treat politicians as public servants in our common household .
Not as kings , not as a new aristocracy , not as the winners in a cruel game of social Darwinism , but simply as public servants .
Building a bronze and marble monument to Paine will never revive the republic , but his words still carry an electric current of freedom .
His intellectual and political energy is always available for rediscovery .
In 1805 John Adams was 71 years old , and Paine was living his last years in a somewhat outcast retirement .
Neither man had lost all his old powers of invective and satire , a word Adams spelled as “ satyr ” in a letter he wrote a friend in the same year :
“ I am willing you should call this the Age of Frivolity as you do , and would not object if you had named it the Age of Folly , Vice , Frenzy , Brutality , Daemons , Buonaparte , Tom Paine or the Age of the Burning Brand from the Bottomless Pit , or anything but the Age of Reason .
I know not whether any man in the world has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs in the last thirty years than Tom Paine .
There can be no severer satyr on the age .
For such a mongrel between a pig and a puppy , begotten by a wild boar on a bitch wolf , never before in any age of the world was suffered by the poltroonery of mankind , to run through such a career of mischief .
Call it then the Age of Paine . ”
In a recent edition of the Wall Street Journal , Mary Anastasia O'Grady laments an apparent shift left in the Obama administration 's Latin America policy .
Clearly , O'Grady has n't been keeping up to date with current events .
If she had been , she would have heard about negotiations underway between the U.S. and Colombia to establish at least seven U.S. military bases in Colombia .
Last I heard , folks on the left tend to oppose increased militarization ; it 's tough to see seven new military bases as a move to the left .
Why is the Obama administration pushing for these bases , despite having previously criticized Colombia 's human rights record ?
The Administration 's goals for the military facilities are " filling the gaps left by the eventual cutting of [ military ] aid in Plan Colombia , " according to sources in Washington and Bogotá .
The proposed bases , replacements for the soon - to - closed U.S. base in Manta , Ecuador , would serve to expand the U.S. military 's counter - narcotic operations in the region , deepen involvement in Colombia 's counterinsurgency war , and combat " other international crimes , " according to Colombia 's Foreign Minister .
Despite these hints at the intention of the bases , many serious questions remain .
In fact , even the Colombian Congress has yet to receive detailed information from the Uribe administration , despite repeated official requests .
Nonetheless , on Tuesday Uribe began a South America tour to convince his regional counterparts of the plan , despite not having briefed his own Congress .
Such secrecy is worrisome .
Fellowship of Reconciliation 's John Lindsay Poland , who has spent years studying U.S. military bases around the world , writes , " the locations of the bases under negotiation raise further questions .
None of them are on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , where aircraft from the Manta base patrolled for drug traffic – supposedly with great success , reflecting how traffic has increased in the Pacific .
Three of the bases are clustered near each other on the Caribbean coast , not far from existing U.S. military sites in Aruba and Curacao – and closer to Venezuela than to the Pacific Ocean .
Why are U.S. negotiators apparently forgoing Pacific sites , if counternarcotics is still part of the U.S. military mission ?
What missions ' beyond Colombia 's borders ' are U.S. planners contemplating ? "
Even if we had answers to these questions , however , there exist plenty more reasons to be wary of the bases .

In cooperating with the Colombian army , the U.S. would be demonstrating support for an institution with an atrocious human rights record .
More than 1,000 civilians have been murdered by the Colombian army in recent years , in a criminal attempt to portray them as guerrillas in order to raise the number of guerrillas killed in combat .
Proposing these seven bases unmasks Obama 's previous statements calling for the improvement of Colombian 's human rights record as merely lip service .
Colombian forces are n't the only ones to worry about : U.S. military forces will be not be bound by Colombian law and will potentially get away with all kinds crimes .
US negotiators have made it known that " even if they wo n't interfere in the exercise of command by Colombian officers on the bases , they will ensure the autonomy of U.S. military forces when operations go beyond Colombia 's borders . "
And there is precedent that validates these concerns .
In 2007 two U.S. soldiers carrying out a Plan Colombia mission in the small town of Melgar raped a 12 - year - old girl , and have yet to be punished .
When confronted by the girl 's mother , the soldiers were quoted as saying , " Yeah , we raped her , so what ?
We are in Colombia , the law does n't affect us . "
An all too accurate depiction of the US military 's mentality in Colombia .
These bases would lack oversight in the financial arena as well .
While Plan Colombia funding has been open for Congressional debate , funding for US military activities has not .
Congress would therefore exercise little to no control over the funding – and therefore the actions – of the bases in Colombia .
The many unanswered questions and ominous possibilities that come with seven new US bases have raised alarms among Colombia 's neighbors , fueling serious regional tensions .
Venezuela has frozen diplomatic relations , and Ecuador has threatened " increased military tensions " over their concerns about the increased U.S. presence in the region .
Brazil 's President Lula said last week he was " not happy " at even one base being handed over for U.S. operations .
Many Colombians are opposed as well , backed up by the fact that such an agreement would bypass Article 173 of the Colombian Constitution , which prohibits the presence of foreign troops except in transit , and then only after legislative approval .
Multiple protests have been held in downtown Bogota , and a national day of action is being planned for August 7 – the national holiday celebrating the Colombian armed forces – as opposition to these military bases grows .
The bases agreement has not yet been signed ; there is still time to convince Colombian and U.S. leaders to scrap the idea .
The Fellowship of Reconciliation has compiled a bilingual ( English and Spanish ) resource page for those opposing the bases : www.forcolombia.org/bases, and asks that you call the White House Comment Line ( 202-456-1111 ) today to say NO to military bases in Colombia .
MEXICO CITY — U.S. refineries bought millions of dollars worth of oil siphoned from Mexican government pipelines and smuggled across the border — in some cases by drug cartels expanding their reach .
At least one U.S. oil executive has pleaded guilty to a conspiracy that involved what prosecutors said was about $ 2 million in stolen Mexican oil , U.S. Justice Department officials confirmed to The Associated Press .
On Tuesday , the U.S. Homeland Security department is scheduled to hand over $ 2.4 million to Mexico 's tax administration , the first batch of money seized during a joint investigation into smuggled oil that authorities expect to lead to more arrests and seizures .
" The United States is working with the Mexican government on the theft of oil , " said Nancy Herrera , spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's office in Houston .
" It 's an ongoing investigation , with one indictment so far . "
In that case , Donald Schroeder , president of Houston - based Trammo Petroleum , is scheduled to be sentenced in December after pleading guilty in May .
Trammo's small firm profited about $ 150,000 in the scheme , in which various U.S. companies hauled stolen Mexican petroleum products across the border in trucks and barges , according to court records .
Schroeder 's attorneys said in an e-mail that neither they nor their client would respond to AP 's requests for comment .
In Mexico , federal police commissioner Rodrigo Esparza said the Zetas , a fierce drug gang aligned with the Gulf cartel , used false import documents to smuggle tanker loads of oil to unnamed U.S. refineries .
Earlier this year , the Mexican government froze 149 bank accounts after tracking more than $ 46 million in transfers related to the Zeta theft .
The losses continue at a record rate , according to Mexico 's state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos , or Pemex .
In a surprising public acknowledgment , Mexican President Felipe Calderon said last week that drug cartels have extended their operations into the theft of oil , Mexico 's leading source of foreign income which finances about 40 percent of the national budget .
" These are Mexican resources , and we do not have to sit back or turn a blind eye , " Calderon said .
" This is our national heritage and we must defend it . "
Catching up from a column last week ( Toronto Star version , homepage version ) , the Canadian Patent Appeal Board recently denied an appeal by Amazon.com over a " one- click " ordering system patent with strong language that challenged the notion that business method patents are patentable under Canadian law .
Business method patents took off in the U.S. in 1998 , when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( one notch below the U.S. Supreme Court ) ruled that patents could be awarded for business methods in a case called State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Corp .
In the aftermath of the State Street Bank decision , companies rushed to file patent claims for a wide range of business practices .
Amazon.com became the most visible business method patentee with its one - click patent for a service that allows repeat visitors to move directly to the virtual checkout with one click ( completing payment and shipping information in the process ) .
The Canadian experience with the Amazon.com one - click business method patent has been much different .
The Canadian Patent Office rejected the application in 2004 based on obviousness and non-statutory subject matter .
Amazon.com appealed to the Canadian Patent Appeal Board .
At first blush , the CPAB could have relied on the Manual of Patent Office Practice to support Amazon.com ’s claim for a business method patent .
The 2005 Manual provides that " [ business ] methods are not automatically excluded from patentability , since there is no authority in the Patent Act or Rules or in the jurisprudence to sanction or preclude patentability . "
Yet the panel delivered very strong language rejecting the mere possibility of business method patents under Canadian law .
The panel noted that " since patenting business methods would involve a radical departure from the traditional patent regime , and since the patentability of such methods is a highly contentious matter , clear and unequivocal legislation is required for business methods to be patentable . "
In applying that analysis to the Amazon.com one - click patent , the panel concluded that " concepts or rules for the more efficient conduct of online ordering , are methods of doing business .
Even if these concepts or rules are novel , ingenious and useful , they are still unpatentable because they are business methods . "
The CPAB decision is not necessarily the end of the road for the one - click patent since Amazon.com has the option of appealing to the Federal Court .
However , the decision provides a strong signal that the business method patents face a rough ride under current Canadian law .

As a new mother herself , Brenda Lohman admits to being shocked by the results of a new study she co-authored .
It found that among nearly 1,000 low - income families in three major cities , one in four children between the ages of 11 and 16 reported having sex , with their first sexual intercourse experience occurring at the average age of 12.77 .
" So if 12 years was the average age here , that meant that some kids were starting at 10 or younger , " said Lohman , an Iowa State University associate professor of human development and family studies ( HDFS ) .
" A handful of kids reported having sex as early as 8 or 9 .
We know from our follow - up interviews that one boy who reported having sexual intercourse for the first time at age nine had fathered four children by the time he was 18 . "
" Those people who say that kids do n't have sex at that young of age should think again , " she said .
" Definitely the age is the most shocking thing about this study . "
Tina Jordahl , a former Iowa State HDFS and public policy graduate student who is now a market research specialist with Hospice of Central Iowa , collaborated with Lohman on the study .
It analyzes data from the " Welfare , Children and Families : A Three - City Study " -- a six - year longitudinal investigation of low - income families living in Boston , Chicago and San Antonio .
Their paper , titled " A biological analysis of risk and protective factors associated with early sexual intercourse of young adolescents , " was posted online in the Children and Youth Services Review and will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal .
Interview data for the study was first collected in 1999 on youth between the ages of 10 and 14 , and again in 2001 .
Lohman says she also has data collected in 2006 from the same subjects , who were between 16 and 20 by that time .
Boys having sex earlier , more often than girls
In the study , boys reported their first sexual intercourse at younger ages ( averaging 12.48 ) than girls ( 13.16 ) .
Boys also had nearly 10 percent higher frequency of intercourse than girls and were also more likely to experience sexual debut ( 20 percent to 14 percent ) between the two years when the first two waves of data were collected .
Recent national research has found that 13 percent of girls and 15 percent of boys have had sex by the time they 're 16 .
Lohman says that means the rate of sex among her low - income sample is only slightly higher among the girls , but almost double among the boys
" The ages [ of sexual debut ] are a bit younger than the national samples , but not alarmingly so , " she said .
African Americans also had 12 percent more early sexual intercourse than whites ( 29 to 17 percent respectively ) , although racial differences did not change the age of their first intercourse .
The authors report that periods of instability in family structure and welfare use serve as risk factors for early sexual activity .
They found that additional maternal education -- beyond a high school level -- was found to inhibit some of that activity .
" That can be for multiple reasons , " Lohman said .
" It can be that mothers have better paying jobs and more stable home environment and they 're less likely to be in stressful circumstances .
It could also be that mothers then have greater cognitive capacities to sort of sit down and discuss the pros and cons of waiting to have sex until you 're older . "
For that reason , the researchers propose allotting public funding to increase maternal education as a way to reduce early sexual promiscuity among their children .
Juvenile deliquency increases early sexual activity
The study also found the youths ' involvement in delinquent acts drastically increases the chances of early sexual activity .
Because of the gender differences in sexual debut , the authors also urge more gender - specific prevention programs that are implemented at earlier ages , especially among high risk populations .
" It may be that boys and girls , starting at younger ages , should have these programs that are designed separately by gender before they 're moved back together over time , " Lohman said .
" And yes , they must start much , much younger than they do now .
You have to start before those young kids -- 10 or even younger -- start becoming sexually active . "
She says the current political climate in Washington may be right for those types of programs to be developed .
" The Bush administration concentrated on abstinence education programs for all families across the spectrum of income , and Obama is definitely focusing on sexual education and prevention programs , " said Lohman .
" He 's put a lot more money back into those programs that were stripped away during the Bush administration .
And given his focus in other areas , he is concentrating on high - risk , low - income disadvantaged families as well . "
Lohman is currently working on research to determine the relationship between obesity and teen sexuality .
She hopes to publish results from that study within the year .

Shoppers watch in horror as woman sets herself on fire in Miami mall
Shoppers looked on in horror yesterday as a woman set herself on fire at a Miami mall and then walked around engulfed in flame .
The 43 - year - old , whose name was not released , doused herself with a flammable liquid at the Mall of the Americas .
Shocked onlookers rushed towards her using nearby fire extinguishers to put out the flames .
Woman on fire : Onlookers use fire extinguishers to put out the flames after a 43 - year - old sets herself a blaze in the Mall of the Americas in Miami
The woman was on fire for about two - and - a - half minutes and suffered third - degree burns over 75 percent of her body , said a Fire Rescue spokesman .
She was was found conscious in a parking lot and was air - lifted to a hospital soon afterwards .
Two men and a woman who tried to help her suffered minor injuries .
Authorities do not know why the woman set herself on fire .
Witnesses said she was in a clothing store called Savage Boutique when it happened .
Blaze drama :
The incident occurred inside the Mall of the Americas in Miami
Jose Morales , 24 , said at a nearby kiosk when he heard screams and thought someone had fallen .
When he turned around , he saw the blaze and realized someone was within it .
‘ This woman is just walking like this , super slow , completely on fire , ’ he said .
‘ You could n't see nothing but fire . '
Morales said witnesses used two fire extinguishers on the woman , who was on fire about two - and - a - half minutes .
All of her clothes except her underwear disappeared into ashes .
After the fire was out , Morales said , the woman walked out of the mall and into the parking lot .
The two men injured helping her were treated at the scene while the woman who helped was taken to a hospital .
The mall remained closed as of late afternoon .

After nearly ten years , Answer Fella finally gets a kitty question !
Thank you so , so , so , so much !
Cats purr for the same reason that Mrs. Fella sighs : because they are cats .
And just like Mrs. Fella 's sighs , a cat 's purring changes and can signify a vast range of emotions .
Carolyn McDaniel , a veterinarian at the Cornell Feline Health Center , affirms that " cats purr when they 're happy and content , " but adds that purring may also signify a cat is " anxious , fearful , or in pain .
Then there are very , very ill cats that purr — what does this mean ?
What is the cat trying to communicate ? "
Perhaps the cat is praying ?
" Some people think the frequency of sound the purr makes helps release endorphins from the cat — the cat is trying to make itself feel better , trying to comfort itself . "
Stop , please , or AF may start to weep .
What about the physical mechanism ?
" Veterinarians still do n't have a complete understanding of how purring is generated .
The current idea is that a cat 's purr originates in the larynx and is generated by oscillation of airway structures that result in turbulent airflow during respiration .
We can do an MRI on a cat , treat its cancer with chemotherapy , control its asthma with inhalant therapy , but we can't explain its purring mechanism . "
And still some people claim there is no God .

Police , councils and the intelligence services made more than 500,000 requests to access private emails and telephone records in the UK last year , according to an annual surveillance report .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The figures , compiled by the Interception of Communications Commissioner , Paul Kennedy , found that about 1,500 surveillance requests were made every day in Britain .
That is the annual equivalent to one in every 78 people being targeted .
It included 1,500 approved applications from local councils .
Each request allows public bodies to access data which includes telephone records , email and text message traffic but not the actual content of conversations or messages .
" It does n't allow you to see the content of the message or conversation .
It 's about the who , where and when -- the time element essentially in directed surveillance , " a Home Office spokesman said .
Although slightly down on last year , the total is up more than 40 percent on two years ago .
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne seized on the figures , saying they " beggared belief , " warning that the UK appeared to have " sleepwalked into a surveillance state . "
" Many of these operations carried out by the police and security services are necessary , but the sheer numbers are daunting , " he said .
" It can not be a justified response to the problems we face in this country that the state is spying on half a million people a year , " Huhne said .
" The government forgets that George Orwell 's 1984 was a warning and not a blueprint , " he said .
The Liberal Democrats say only a magistrate should be able to approve a request for surveillance , under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) .

The act was introduced in 2000 , to take account of technological change .
It was extended in 2003 by the home secretary at the time , David Blunkett , to tackle serious crimes including terrorism .
In his report , Kennedy also found 595 errors in interception requests last year , including mistakes made by the domestic and foreign intelligence agencies , MI5 and MI6 .
The vast majority of requests to snoop on people 's records were made by the police and security services .
But the report found that some were granted to council officials investigating trivial offences like dog fouling , fuelling concern that the act is being misused .
While HP and EDS UK staff face cuts to pay and benefits , their US counterparts could have their pay halved .
Computer Weekly has received e-mails from EDS workers in the US which describe how HP plans to cut EDS salaries by up to 50 % over the next year .
One e-mail claimed that HP was cutting some employees ' pay by 25 % this year and another 25 % next year .
The cuts are a result of HP aligning EDS and HP salaries in the US , Canada and Puerto Rico .
But anothere - mail questioned the logic .
" What is the rationale for the employee to stay or perform this year ?
Is [ an employee ] going to give 100 % this year for the company so he can get a 25 % pay cut next year too ?
This is where HP say , 'oh , but you have a job ' .
" What is this going to do to employee morale at the particular accounts ?
Could this backfire and have solid employees either leave or take an ' I do n't [ care ] ' attitude ?
If this happens , it could backfire so much that HP will not be performing up to the obligations of their account and could , in the long run , lose the account . "
A further e-mail said the cuts are piling up for loyal staff .
" My husband , who is not an executive , has involuntarily received a 21 % cut in pay this year , and from September another permanent 16.4 % . "
HP said in a statement that the cuts are part of the integration of EDS into HP to ensure that employees at both EDS and HP , holding the same roles , receive comparable compensation based on market rates .
" While pay will not be impacted for the majority of employees as a result of this process , some employees will receive pay reductions while others will benefit from salary increases .
We understand that these changes personally impact our employees and we are working closely with them during this transition .
" EDS is an integral part of HP 's long - term strategy to provide more services and solutions to our clients .
These actions were taken in the US , Canada and Puerto Rico only , " it said .
Was Sacha Baron Cohen 's character , Brüno , in his latest movie , specifically a gay “ Austrian ” reporter so he could trick Congressman Ron Paul into an Austrian economics interview ?
If you have seen Brüno , you have seen that he deceptively tricked the Congressman from Texas into an interview and then started to undress in front of him .
According to Dr. Paul , he was invited to the interview without knowing that comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was posing as Brüno and thought that it would be about Austrian economics .
Apparently , the whole production group was very sneaky about the situation .
Wonder if Sacha ( as Brüno ) was nervous at all while making moves on one of the bravest and honest men of our time .
How does Sacha Baron Cohen get distinguished political figures to interview with him ?
Well for this case , maybe he became a gay “ Austrian ” reporter , Brüno , to interview Ron Paul on the subject of Austrian economics .
Austrian economics has always been a clear subject of interest for Dr. Paul , and any chance to spread that message is probably what the doctor hoped to do .
Though Sacha Baron Cohen may be a very funny man , you wonder why his character Brüno would want to target the Congressman and try and make him look like a fool .
Ron Paul now has the ears of millions around the world and several bills in Congress that threatens the Federal Reserve with transparency of policy and would secure freedom of speech for Americans .
The establishment is probably shaking in their boots as his message is ringing true to the masses .
Ron Paul should take this as a compliment .
Research his H.R. 1207 , H.R. 3394 , H.R. 3395 and HR 3396 bills and call your congressmen and women to support them .

In the 1960s , a University of Wisconsin graduate student named Thomas Crocker came up with a novel solution for environmental problems : cap emissions of pollutants and then let firms trade permits that allow them to pollute within those limits .
Now legislation using cap - and - trade to limit greenhouse gases is working its way through Congress and could become the law of the land .
But Mr. Crocker and other pioneers of the concept are doubtful about its chances of success .
They are n't abandoning efforts to curb emissions .

Nate Silver takes data from our public option polling to perform one of his regression analyses , finds that the two most relevant factors are support for Obama and poverty levels , and concludes :
We can systematize these results by means of a regression analysis that accounts for the Obama vote share and the poverty level in each district .
( Technically , we 'll be using a logistic regession , treating each of the voters included in one of these surveys as a separate data point . )
This analysis finds that support for the public option nationwide is about 55 percent , against 36 percent opposed , similar results to what I believe to be the most reliable polls on the subject .
What 's more interesting , though , is where we project the public option in individual districts .
We find that : --
The public option is estimated to have plurality support in 291 of the 435 Congressional Districts nationwide , or almost exactly two - thirds .
--
The public option is estimated to have plurality support in 235 of 257 Democratic - held districts .
--
The public option is estimated to have plurality support in 34 of 52 Blue Dog - held districts , and has overall popularity of 51 percent in these districts versus 39 percent opposed .
Nate estimates that in the Arkansas 4th Congressional District , home of Blue Dog Mike Ross -- new opponent of the public option ( after supporting it earlier this year ) , that support for the public option would be 49 - 41 .
I 'll see about polling the district the next few weeks to see if the analysis holds up .
Below is the map Nate created , with public option - supporting districts in Blue , opposing ones in Red .

One of the thing I admire most about Jane Espenson ’s blog is that she talks very directly about the words on the page , giving names to techniques I use but never really think about .
The two - percenter , for example .
So one of my goals for 2007 is to get a little more granular in my advice - giving , and talk less about Screenwriting and more about screenwriting — in particular , scene writing .
Spend a few years as a screenwriter , and writing a scene becomes an almost unconscious process .
It ’s like driving a car .
Most of us do n’t think about the ignition and the pedals and the turn signals — but we used to , back when we were learning .
It used to flummox the hell out of us .
Every intersection was unbelievably stressful , with worries of stalling the car and / or killing everyone on board .
It ’s the same with writing a scene .
The first few are brutal and clumsy .
But once you ’ve written ( and rewritten ) say , 500 scenes , the individual steps sort of vanish .
But they ’re still there , under the surface .
It ’s just that your instinct is making a lot of the decisions your conscious brain used to handle .
So here ’s my attempt to introspect and describe what I ’m doing that I ’m not even aware I ’m doing .
Here ’s How to Write a Scene .
1. Ask :
What needs to happen in this scene ?
Many screenwriting books will tell you to focus on what the characters want .
This is wrong .
The characters are not responsible for the story .
You are .
If characters were allowed to control their scenes , most characters would chose to avoid conflict , and movies would be crushingly boring .
The question is not , “ What could happen ? ” or “ What should happen ? ”
It is only , “ What needs to happen ? ”
If you wrote an outline , this is the time to look at it .
If you did n’t , just come up one or two sentences that explain what absolutely must happen in the scene .
2. Ask :
What ’s the worst that would happen if this scene were omitted ?
Imagine the projectionist screwed up and accidentally lopped off this scene .
Would the movie still make sense ?
If the answer is “ yes , ” then you do n’t really need the scene , and should n’t bother writing it .
But it ’s so dramatic !
you say .
But it ’s so funny !
Tough .
Put that drama or that comedy into scenes that are crucial to the movie .
One thing you learn after a few produced movies is that anything that can be cut will be cut , so put your best material into moments that will absolutely be there when it ’s done .
3 . Ask : Who needs to be in the scene ?
Scripts are often clogged with characters who have no business being there .
But because words are small , it ’s easy to overlook that “ Haversmith ” has n’t said or done anything for five pages .
And sadly , sometimes that ’s not realized until after filming .
4 . Ask :
Where could the scene take place ?
The most obvious setting for a scene is generally the least interesting , so do n’t be too quick to set your scene in the police bullpen , a living room , or a parking garage .
Always consider what the characters could be doing , even if it ’s not directly related to the focus of the scene .
A father - and - son bonding moment at a slaughter house will play differently than the same dialogue at a lawn bowling tournament .
5 . Ask :
What ’s the most surprising thing that could happen in the scene ?
Give yourself permission to step away from your outline and consider some wild possibilities .
What if a car smashed through the wall ?
What if your hero choked and died ?
What if a young boy vomited up a finger ?
Most of your scenes wo n’t have one of these out - of - nowhere aspects .
But your movie needs to have a few moments that are completely unexpected , so always ask yourself , could this be one of them ?
6 . Ask :
Is this a long scene or a short scene ?
There ’s nothing so dispiriting as writing a great three - page mega - scene and realizing that you could have accomplished just as much in two - eighths of a page .
So ask yourself up front :
How much screen time am I willing to give to this scene ?
7. Brainstorm three different ways it could begin .
The classic advice is to come into a scene as late as you possibly can .
Of course , to do that , you really need to know how the previous scene ended .
There ’s often a natural momentum that suggests what first image or line of dialogue would be perfect to open the scene .
But do n’t stop at the first option .
Find a couple , then …
8 . Play it on the screen in your head .
At least 50 % of screenwriting is simply sitting there with your eyes closed , watching the unwritten scene loop in your head .
The first couple of times through , it ’s really rough : a blocking rehearsal .
But eventually , you start to hear the characters talk to each other , and the vague motions become distinct actions .
Do n’t worry if you ca n’t always get the scene to play through to the end — you ’re more likely to find the exit in the writing than in the imagining .
Do n’t rush this step .
Let the scene percolate .
Mumble the dialogue .
Immerse yourself as fully into the moment as you can .
9 . Write a scribble version .
A “ scribble version ” is essentially a cheat sheet so you ’ll remember the great scene you just saw in your head .
Do n’t write sentences ; do n’t write full dialogue .
It should n’t take more than five minutes .
Just get the bare minimum down so that you wo n’t forget the scene in the next hour as you ’re writing it .
I generally hand - write a scribble version in tiny print — sometimes literally on the back of an envelope — but you can also type .
This is what a scribble version consists of for me :
DUNCAN waiting edge of seat
ITO
I was one of the doctors who worked on your wife
accident
injuries severe , trauma team , sorry , could n’t save her
( sits , reflex )
nature of injuries , concern fetus would n’t survive in utero .
paramedic able deliver caesarian boy healthy
( nodding not hearing )
nurse can take you to see him , know a lot to handle
what
a lot to handle
take me to see him ?
yes
see who ?
your son .
paramedic was able to
( grabs clipboard )
I know this may seem
My wife was n’t pregnant
Your wife did n’t tell you …
My wife has never been pregnant .
been trying three years .
fertility clinic last week
I examined the baby myself .
nearly at term .
I do n’t know whose baby , not hers .
It ’s kind of a mess , and really would n’t make sense to anyone but me — and only shortly after I wrote it .
But that does n’t matter .
The scribble version is only there so you do n’t get lost or confused while writing the full version of the scene .
Yes , it ’s finally time to …
10 . Write the full scene .
If you typed up the scribble version , do n’t just try to fatten it out .
Start clean .
The scribble version is deliberately crappy , and rewritten crap is still crap .
The scribble version is your outline for the scene .
Yes , allow yourself the chance to detour from your scribble version if a truly better idea comes along .
But if you ’ve really spent the time to play it through in your head ( # 8 ) , it ’s probably on the right track already .
Depending on the nature of the scene , getting the dialogue right may be most of the work .
Regardless , focus on choosing the best words to describe the characters , the action and tone , so your readers will see the same scene in their heads .
11 . Repeat 200 times .

Granted , it is never pleasant to have readers complain about one ’s book , especially when the book is approximately three days old and one is still caught up in the heady pride of publication .
In addition , if one is a veteran writer ( which I am ) , one knows what to expect : generosity from some , slingshots from others .
But my book just received an irritable review that stuck in my craw .
The reviewer , Amazon pen-name “ Jubilee ” wrote that :
[ In Gordon ’s book ] sometimes more credence is given to the Koran and non-canonical religious books [ than ] the Bible itself .
That may be laudable from a secular standpoint , but not mine .
I prefer a Christian world view .
And I filter everything through that .
My point is that I cannot give a positive review in terms of a Christian book .
Because it is not .
Why did this bother me ?
Sour grapes , you might say , and maybe so , but I think the real problem is the clash between interfaith and what I call single faith politics .
My position is that Islam , Judaism , and Christianity represent different pathways to the divine and that all three faiths embody important traditions and beliefs about God , worship , and how we should lead our lives .
Those who espouse single faith politics hold that only one religious tradition is valid , and that the others are incorrect , and sometimes , even , evil .
Sound familiar ?
Think James Dobson , Pat Robertson , and Ann Coulter vs. Rabbi Arthur Waskow ’s interfaith movement , The Tent of Abraham or the Unitarian commitment to valuing all religious traditions .
It is clear that Woman has become a lightning rod for the single faith / interfaith conflict embedded in current American politics and religious life .
My book explores the origins of the three monotheistic religions , Judaism , Christianity , and Islam through an examination of the biblical story of Abraham , Sarah ( his first wife ) , and Hagar ( his second wife ) .
Abraham ’s complicated relationship with these two women is a foundational myth not only in the Middle East , but also in the west .
Whether or not we are believers , we are still awash in its wake as it helps explain many of the battles between Islam , Judaism , and Christianity .
I set the first scene in Nasireya , the Iraqi city that was the location of early battles in the recent war , but which is also known as Ur , the traditional birth place of Abraham and Sarah , the founding patriarch and matriarch in Judaism and Christianity .
Later in the book , I explore Hagar ’s discovery of the Zam Zam , the holiest well in Islamic tradition , and the founding of Mecca .
I spent years researching this story , including careful study of the Koran , as well as Jewish and Christian commentary .
I admit I felt a small flush of virtuous achievement once I had finished .
But , as we know , pride goeth before a fall and so I suppose I should not have been surprised to hear that someone does not like precisely what I worked on the hardest : my contribution to interfaith understanding .
However , that is not really what concerns me .
What strikes me as far more worrisome is the idea that a serious conversation about the Koran could hurt the biblical tradition .
How can a deeper understanding of Islam hurt Christians ?
In addition , should n’t Jews and Christians take the time to understand each other ’s traditions and beliefs ?
What bothers me the most , though , is that one of the principle points in the book , the role of women in the traditional stories of all three religions , runs the risk of being overshadowed by this battle between interfaith and single faith partisans .
This is unfortunate as “ The Woman Question ” has been problematic for centuries : what roles should women play in the religious life of their communities ?
Should women get ordained ?
Should they be allowed to read the Torah on the bimah ?
The story of Hagar and Sarah has much to teach us about the strong presence of women in our traditions .
Hagar is the one character in the Bible who has the courage and creativity to give God a name .
In Islam , she is regarded as a founding matriarch , the great - great - great . . . grandmother of Mohammed .
In all three traditions , Sarah is the supreme strategist , assertive and in charge of the campsite .
In Judaism and Christianity , she is the matriarch , the mother of the chosen son .
But if one studies God ’s words , it becomes clear that God has marked both women as matriarchs .
Indeed , Genesis pushes the idea of a double blessing .
Isaac , the son of Sarah is blessed , God says , but so also is Ishmael , the son of Hagar .
To dismiss this double blessing is to dismiss a central principle of the Bible , the law of love , not hate ; of peace , not war .
To slam the door against other religious traditions is to shut the door in the face of the stranger .
Is n’t it our duty to reach out to those we do not know and treat these individuals as we would like to be treated ourselves ?
I suppose I should be grateful to my critical reviewer .
In the past I have avoided the soapbox and have depended on writing scholarly reviews and well researched books to make my points .
But indignation has spurred me to declare the ethical basis of my book , a declaration I might never have thought to make if it had not been attacked as being not “ Christian ” enough .
If The Woman Who Named God is not a “ Christian ” book then what is Christianity ?
Are n’t love and understanding of those who are different from us Christian values ?
And , what about me and “ Jubilee ” ?
Maybe we need to meet and try to come to an understanding : red meets blue , Jew meets Christian , reader meets writer .
Author meets critic .
And critic meets author .
“ I ’d like to make a comment on the president having a beer with Henry Louis Gates and Sgt. Crowley .
I do n’t think that was a very good idea .
What does that tell our children ?
And especially , he ’s the president and then they ’re out in public drinking beer . ”
“ With all that has been said about Obama , seems most have overlooked the fact he is constantly entertaining and serving champagne , wine and in Thursday ’s paper , beer .
He seems to think alcohol fixes everything . ”
“ You know , I ’ve always heard that it ’s against the law to drink alcoholic beverages on federal property .
And I believe the White House is federal property .
So is n’t Obama breaking the law ?
And are these guys going to drive their own cars home after they ’ve been drinking ?
Something ’s wrong here . ”
“ It ’s a sad day when the president of the United States will promote alcoholic drinking .
It ’s not an example to children or adults . ”
“ Boy , is the president setting a good example for the United States of America – having a beer party in the White House .
Shame .
Shame . ”
“ In today ’s TimesDaily paper , on Friday , on Page 3A , what ’s wrong with the picture ?
Obama drinking beer ?
In today ’s society , alcohol destroys several homes .
Has he not gotten nothing better to do ?
No wonder our world is in such a sad shape . ”

The evidence from Portugal since 2001 is that decriminalisation of drug use and possession has benefits and no harmful side - effects
Illustration by Peter Schrank
IN 2001 newspapers around the world carried graphic reports of addicts injecting heroin in the grimy streets of a Lisbon slum .
The place was dubbed Europe 's “ most shameful neighbourhood ” and its “ worst drugs ghetto ” .
The Times helpfully managed to find a young British backpacker sprawled comatose on a corner .
This lurid coverage was prompted by a government decision to decriminalise the personal use and possession of all drugs , including heroin and cocaine .
The police were told not to arrest anyone found taking any kind of drug .
This “ ultraliberal legislation ” , said the foreign media , had set alarm bells ringing across Europe .
The Portuguese were said to be fearful that holiday resorts would become dumping - grounds for drug tourists .
Some conservative politicians denounced the decriminalisation as “ pure lunacy ” .
Plane - loads of foreign students would head for the Algarve to smoke marijuana , predicted Paulo Portas , leader of the People 's Party .
Portugal , he said , was offering “ sun , beaches and any drug you like . ”
Yet after all the furore , the drug law was largely forgotten by the international and Portuguese press — until earlier this year , when the Cato Institute , a libertarian American think - tank , published a study of the new policy by a lawyer , Glenn Greenwald . *
In contrast to the dire consequences that critics predicted , he concluded that “ none of the nightmare scenarios ” initially painted , “ from rampant increases in drug usage among the young to the transformation of Lisbon into a haven for ‘ drug tourists ' , has occurred . ”
Mr Greenwald claims that the data show that “ decriminalisation has had no adverse effect on drug usage rates in Portugal ” , which “ in numerous categories are now among the lowest in the European Union ” .
This came after some rises in the 1990s , before decriminalisation .
The figures reveal little evidence of drug tourism : 95 % of those cited for drug misdemeanours since 2001 have been Portuguese .
The level of drug trafficking , measured by numbers convicted , has also declined .
And the incidence of other drug - related problems , including sexually transmitted diseases and deaths from drug overdoses , has “ decreased dramatically ” .
There are widespread misconceptions about the Portuguese approach .
“ It is important not to confuse decriminalisation with depenalisation or legalisation , ” comments Brendan Hughes of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction , which is , coincidentally , based in Lisbon .
“ Drug use remains illegal in Portugal , and anyone in possession will be stopped by the police , have the drugs confiscated and be sent before a commission . ”
Nor is it uncommon in Europe to make drug use an administrative offence rather than a criminal one ( putting it in the same category as not wearing a seat belt , say ) .
What is unique , according to Mr Hughes , is that offenders in Portugal are sent to specialist “ dissuasion commissions ” run by the government , rather than into the judicial system .
“ In Portugal , ” he says , “ the health aspect [ of the government 's response to drugs ] has gone mainstream . ”
The aim of the dissuasion commissions , which are made up of panels of two or three psychiatrists , social workers and legal advisers , is to encourage addicts to undergo treatment and to stop recreational users falling into addiction .
They have the power to impose community work and even fines , but punishment is not their main aim .
The police turn some 7,500 people a year over to the commissions .
But nobody carrying anything considered to be less than a ten - day personal supply of drugs can be arrested , sentenced to jail or given a criminal record .
Officials believe that , by lifting fears of prosecution , the policy has encouraged addicts to seek treatment .
This bears out their view that criminal sanctions are not the best answer .
“ Before decriminalisation , addicts were afraid to seek treatment because they feared they would be denounced to the police and arrested , ” says Manuel Cardoso , deputy director of the Institute for Drugs and Drug Addiction , Portugal 's main drugs - prevention and drugs - policy agency .
“ Now they know they will be treated as patients with a problem and not stigmatised as criminals . ”
The number of addicts registered in drug- substitution programmes has risen from 6,000 in 1999 to over 24,000 in 2008 , reflecting a big rise in treatment ( but not in drug use ) .
Between 2001 and 2007 the number of Portuguese who say they have taken heroin at least once in their lives increased from just 1 % to 1.1 % .
For most other drugs , the figures have fallen : Portugal has one of Europe 's lowest lifetime usage rates for cannabis .
And most notably , heroin and other drug abuse has decreased among vulnerable younger age - groups , according to Mr Cardoso .
The share of heroin users who inject the drug has also fallen , from 45 % before decriminalisation to 17 % now , he says , because the new law has facilitated treatment and harm - reduction programmes .
Drug addicts now account for only 20 % of Portugal 's HIV cases , down from 56 % before .
“ We no longer have to work under the paradox that exists in many countries of providing support and medical care to people the law considers criminals . ”
“ Proving a causal link between Portugal 's decriminalisation measures and any changes in drug-use patterns is virtually impossible in scientific terms , ” concludes Mr Hughes .
“ But anyone looking at the statistics can see that drug consumption in 2001 was relatively low in European terms , and that it remains so .
The apocalypse has n't happened . ”

What IS that thing ?
Futureman explains the Drumitar By Jefferson Graham , USA TODAY DEER VALLEY , Utah 
Most fans who attend Béla Fleck and the Flecktones concerts walk away wondering about that strange instrument being played by the guy in the pirate hat .
Futureman plays the Drumitar , as we behold it with wonder .
Janice Pierce , for USA TODAY
It 's called a " Drumitar , " an electronic drum set - up in the shape of a beat - up guitar .
It has a bunch of colorful buttons that the musician who calls himself " Futureman , " taps at while Fleck plucks at his banjo and Jeff Coffin blows his sax .
His brother Victor Lemonte Wooten holds down the rhythm on bass .
Futureman was born Roy Wooten , but fans and friends call him Futch ( pronounced footch ) .
He invented his unusual instrument in his garage in 1985 : " It was an experiment to see if I could play the drums on a guitar .
That 's all it was . "
When rhythmic sounds started coming out clearly , he tried it out with a dance band in Virginia .
" It was scary , " says Futureman , interviewed backstage before a recent concert here .
" I saw that I could really make the dance floor move with it . "
When Victor joined forces with Fleck to help put together his unique jazz fusion group , Fleck was seeking a drummer , and Wooten recommended his brother .
" I played Béla the Drumitar over the phone and told him what I was trying to do , " he recalls .
" I was n't sure it would really work on a record , but he said , ' Bring it on and we 'll see if it 's a novelty or not . '
We 've flown with it ever since . "
The Drumitar samples different drum sounds ; it 's plugged into a bank of Roland synthesizers .
While hitting the machine , Futureman also often plays a traditional drum set during shows .
" It 's sleight - of - hand , " he says .
" I look like a crazy one - handed drummer , but I 'm using both hands , just like any other drummer . "
Futureman sells copies of his solo album , Evolution de la Musique , at his evolutiondamour.com .
The album features collaboration between drums , tables , Irish uilleann pipes , and such natural sound producers as frogs and water .
The Flecktones will take a touring hiatus in 2005 , and Futureman plans to spend his time working to invent another off - beat instrument , one he calls a " Fiano . "
It 's a drum in the shape of a piano — apropos , he says , when you consider the history of the instrument .
" A piano is a percussive instrument , " he says .
" It 's got nothing but hammers in there . "

The Pirate Bay team has continued developing its video streaming site - which will open up to the public within 5 years .
On The Video Bay users can share video clips without having to worry about getting them taken offline due to copyright violations , true Pirate Bay - style .
More than two years have passed since The Pirate Bay team first announced that they were working on a video streaming site .
However , as with most of their projects it can take a while before the public can catch a glimpse of what they are working on .
The Video Bay – as the project is named – opened up to the public with a very early test version a few weeks ago .
Initially , users were able to browse though the videos but this has been disabled now .
What is left is an announcement that the site will be launched somewhere in the future .
“ This site will be an experimental playground and as such subjected to both live and drunk ( en)coding , so please do n’t bug us too much if the site ai n’t working properly , ” it currently reads on the site ’s main page .
The Video Bay Launches in Test Mode
How long it will take before the site will be opened up to the public is unknown .
Pirate Bay ’s TiAMO told TorrentFreak that there is still a lot of work to do behind the scenes .
The encoder is not finished yet and the design is also a work in progress .
Pirate Bay Spokesman Peter Sunde agreed that it might take a while before the site goes live and told us that “ it will be done when it ’s done , in the future , in like a year or five . ”
The Video Bay aims to implement some of the latest technologies including HTML 5 features such as the video and audio tags as well as the embedding of ogg / theora video and audio formats .
However , it will not use p2p technology to stream the videos .
In time the site has the potential to become a major player in the video streaming area , similar to what BayIMG is for image hosting .
A no -nonsense video sharing site where users can share whatever they want – uncensored .
Hollywood will be delighted .
Update :
Two preview clips are now available at the main page .
Those who want to try out need a web browser that supports the HTML 5 tags such as the latest Firefox Beta or Safari 4 .
When she was first found — seen through the cracked opening of a Trinidad motel room door — she was lying on the floor naked , bleeding and bound at the hands and feet with telephone cords .
She had been sexually assaulted with a coat hanger .
Inside the room , police discovered a hair dryer in the “ on ” position with a tripped circuit breaker .
She told police that her assailant held her down in a filled bathtub , then tried to electrocute her , according to a report .
In Trinidad — a town of about 9,000 people in southern Colorado that sees no more than a couple dozen serious assaults a year — the attack last month is shocking enough .
But that the victim was a transgender woman who traveled to the town ’s famed sex - change clinic strikes at the heart of something many Trinidad residents pride themselves on : the community ’s unblinking tolerance for and acceptance of the transgender community .
“ I can count on one hand the number of times I ’ve seen somebody even catcalled , ” said Marci Bowers , the internationally renowned doctor who runs the clinic and performs about 150 gender - related surgeries a year .
“ It just does n’t happen here .
And that ’s not to say that we ’re not a bunch of rednecks and truck drivers and oil - field workers .
But there ’s just a respect and a tolerance for this population that ’s unique . ”
Bowers was quick to point out that , although the police have not arrested anyone in the case , the suspect they are investigating is from out of state .
The attack underscores the danger that stalks transgender individuals , Bowers said .
Last year , 289 transgender people nationwide reported to local advocacy groups that they were the victims of bias - related violence , according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs .
In April , a Greeley jury found a man guilty of committing a hate crime in the killing of 18 - year - old Angie Zapata , the first such conviction in the country .
But in Trinidad , those undergoing gender transition have been able to find a refuge .
Las Animas County District Attorney Frank Ruybalid said he can recall only one other attack on a transgender person — an attempted assault about eight years ago — during his years as a prosecutor in Trinidad .
Some patients have traveled to Trinidad for gender - change surgery and decided to stay .
“ My impression is most people leave them alone , ” Ruybalid said .
“ If they have hostility to transgender patients , they do n’t show it .
. . .
I think a lot of people , when they meet a transgender patient , are surprised at how normal they are . ”
According to the police report about the assault at the motel , the victim , 25 , arrived in Trinidad on a bus , with no money , no place to stay and no appointment at Bowers ’ practice .
Bowers said the victim hoped the clinic could help her in her transition .
Bowers ’ staff , having been told by a crisis worker in Seattle that the victim was coming , tried to accommodate her and worked with a local nonprofit group to get her a motel room .
The assault happened , according to reports , after the victim met a man in the motel lobby and the man followed her back to her room and forced his way in .
When details of the attack hit local newspapers , Trinidad residents shuddered at the violence , said Diana Velarde , the owner of the Hot Spot at the Savoy restaurant .
But the assault did n’t dominate conversation in her cafe .
Trinidad Mayor Joseph Reorda also said the assault generated no more interest in town than other crimes .
Bowers said people expressed sadness to her about the attack .
It was as if the victim was just like any other person in the community — which , in Trinidad , she was .
“ I have sympathy , ” Ruybalid , the district attorney said , “ for anybody who is a victim of a serious crime . ”

THEORY OF GAMES AND ECONOMIC MISBEHAVIOR
" I refuse to accept however , the stupidity of the Stock Exchange boys , as an explanation of the trend of stocks , " wrote John von Neumann to Stanislaw Ulam , on December 9 , 1939 .
" Those boys are stupid alright , but there must be an explanation of what happens , which makes no use of this fact . "
1
This question led von Neumann ( in collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern ) to his monumental Theory of Games and Economic Behavior , demonstrating how a reliable economy can be constructed out of unreliable parts .
After threats of cancellation by Princeton University Press over the " mammoth " manuscript 's escalating length , the book was finally published in September of 1944 .
" We accepted the manuscript without subsidy or any other stipulation in the fall of 1941 , at which time the manuscript was believed to be virtually complete , " complained Datus C. Smith in 1943 .
" At that time it had a manufacturing cost of $ 1,275 ... however , in the course of finishing [ the last ] chapter they uncovered a rich vein of new material , and the manuscript was not actually completed for something like eighteen months ... and almost quadrupled in cost . "
2 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior placed the foundations of economics , evolution , and intelligence on common mathematical ground .
" Unifications of fields which were formerly divided and far apart , " counseled von Neumann and Morgenstern in their introduction , " are rare and happen only after each field has been thoroughly explored . "
3
The von Neumann and Morgenstern approach ( extended by von Neumann 's Probabilistic Logics and the Synthesis of Reliable Organisms From Unreliable Components ) assumes that human unreliability and irrationality will , in the aggregate , be filtered out .
In the real world , however , irrational behavior ( including the " stupidity of the stock exchange boys " ) is not completely filtered out .
A new generation of behavioral economists — and new modes of economic misbehavior — are reminding us of that .
Von Neumann and Morgenstern developed their New Testament from first principles and largely ignored prior art .
Among the Old Testament prophets whose work preceded them were André - Marie Ampère ( 1775 - 1836 ) and Georges - Louis Leclerc comte de Buffon ( 1707 - 1788 ) .
Buffon was a celebrated naturalist whose evolutionary theories preceded both Charles and Erasmus Darwin , advancing ideas that were risky at the time .
" Buffon managed , albeit in a somewhat scattered fashion , " wrote Loren Eiseley , " at least to mention every significant ingredient which was to be incorporated into Darwin 's great synthesis of 1859 . "
4 Buffon 's son and Ampère 's father both died under the guillotine in postrevolutionary France .
Buffon 's Essai d'arithmétique morale , published in 1777 , launched the fields of behavioral economics and evolutionary game theory by posing a simple question : why will someone purchase a lottery ticket when they are more likely to die in the next 24 hours than win ?
Buffon also introduced what , thanks to Stanislaw Ulam , we call the Monte Carlo method .
First improvised as a way to numerically evaluate a physical system by invoking a statistical model , Monte Carlo approximations — given ever more powerful computers — are steadily becoming more faithful to the underlying nature of reality than the analytical methods they replaced .
André -Marie Ampère ( who coined the term Cybernétique in reference to control theory ) published his Considérations sur la théorie mathématique du jeu ( On the mathematical theory of games ) at the age of twenty - seven in 1802 .
Ampère began his study by crediting Buffon ( " an author in whom even errors bear the imprint of genius " ) as the forefather of mathematical game theory , citing his Essai d'Arithmétique Morale .
Ampère favored probability over strategy and saw games of chance as " certain ruin " to those who played indefinitely or indiscriminately against multiple opponents , " who must then be considered as a single opponent whose fortune is infinite . "
5
He observed that a zero-sum game ( where one player 's loss equals the other players ' gain ) will always favor the wealthier player , who has the advantage of being able to remain longer in the game .
Von Neumann 's initial contribution to the theory of games , extending the work of Émile Borel , was published in 1928 .
Where Ampère saw chance as holding the upper hand , von Neumann showed how losses at the hand of fate could be held to a minimum through his " minimax " theorem on the existence of good strategies , proving for a wide class of games that a determinable strategy exists that minimizes the expected loss to a player when the opponent tries to maximize that loss by playing as well as possible .
Much of von Neumann and Morgenstern 's 625 - page treatise is devoted to showing how seemingly intractable situations can be rendered solvable through the assumption of coalitions among the players , and how non -zero - sum games can be reduced to zero - sum games by including a fictitious , impartial player ( sometimes called Nature ) in the game .
Game theory was applied to fields ranging from nuclear deterrence to evolutionary biology .
" The initial reaction of the economists to this work was one of great reserve , but the military scientists were quick to sense its possibilities in their field , " wrote J. D. Williams in The Compleat Strategyst , a RAND Corporation best - seller that made game theory accessible through examples drawn from everyday life .
6
The economists gradually followed .
When John Nash was awarded a Nobel Prize for the Nash equilibrium in 1994 , he became the seventh Nobel laureate in economics whose work had been derived from von Neumann 's results .
Von Neumann " darted briefly into our domain , " commented mathematical economist Paul Samuelson , looking back after fifty years , " and it has never been the same since . "
7
In 1945 the Review of Economic Studies published von Neumann 's " Model of General Economic Equilibrium , " a nine - page paper read to a Princeton mathematics seminar in 1932 and first published ( in German ) in 1937 .
Von Neumann elucidated the behavior of an economy where " goods are produced not only from ' natural factors of production , ' but ... from each other . "
In this autocatalytic economy , equilibrium and expansion coexist at the saddle - point between convex sets .
" The connection with topology may be very surprising at first , " von Neumann noted , " but the author thinks that it is natural in problems of this kind . "
8
Some of the assumptions of von Neumann 's " expanding economic model " — that " natural factors of production , including labour , can be expanded in unlimited quantities " and that " all income in excess of necessities of life will be reinvested " — appeared unrealistic at the time , less so now that Moore 's Law is driving economic growth .
Other assumptions , such as an invariant financial clock cycle , are conservative under the conditions now in play .
The problem , as recent events have demonstrated , is that the surface of a bubble is also a convex set .
Von Neumann 's collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern was followed by a similar collaboration with Stanislaw Ulam , aimed at developing a unified theory of self - reproduction among living and non-living ( or yet - to - be- living ) things .
Von Neumann 's death at age 54 ( and the choice of a collaborator not as disciplined as Oskar Morgenstern ) left a fragmentary , incomplete manuscript that was compiled posthumously and published as Theory of Self - Reproducing Automata , edited by Arthur W. Burks .
9 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior and Theory of Self - Reproducing Automata were launched on a collision course .
The five kilobytes of random - access electrostatic memory that spawned von Neumann 's original digital universe at a cost of roughly one hundred thousand 1947 dollars , costs one - hundredth of one cent today — and cycles a thousand times as fast .
An increasingly permeable barrier separates living from non-living codes .
Over billions of years , biological species learned to survive in a noisy , analog environment by passing themselves , once a generation , through a digital , error - correcting phase , the same way repeater stations are used to convey intelligible messages over submarine cables where noise is being introduced .
A world that was digital once a generation is now all - digital , all the time .
" An organism ( any reason to be afraid of this term yet ? ) is a universal automaton which produces other automata like it in space which is inert or only ' randomly activated ' around it , " explained Ulam , reporting on a conversation with von Neumann that took place on a bench in Central Park in early November 1952 .
The two mathematicians had probably retreated to that park bench to discuss the top secret Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb test conducted on November 1 at Eniwetok Atoll in the South Pacific , yielding 10.4 megatons — almost one thousand Hiroshimas — and a fireball three miles across .
The explosion , based on an insight of Ulam's that had been fleshed out with calculations organized by von Neumann , removed the entire island of Elugelab from the map .
That part of the conversation went unrecorded , but when the subject turned to creation and evolution in a digital universe , Ulam preserved some sketchy notes .
" This ' universality ' is probably necessary to organize or resist organization by other automata ? "
Ulam asked .
He ( and von Neumann ) realized that any real evolution in a digital universe " would have to involve an enormous amount of probabilistic superstructure to the outlined theory .
I think it should probably be omitted unless it involves the crux of the generation and evolution problem — which it might ? "
The unbounded ( and increasingly probabilistic ) digital universe that Ulam and von Neumann imagined as a mathematical abstraction now exists , growing by billions of transistors per second and with more secondary storage than anyone can count .
We are surrounded by codes ( some Turing - universal ) that make copies of themselves , and by physical machines that spawn virtual machines that in turn spawn demand for more physical machines .
Some digital sequences code for spreadsheets , some code for music , some code for operating systems , some code for sprawling , metazoan search engines , some code for proteins , some code for the gears used in numerically - controlled gear - cutting machines , and , increasingly , some code for DNA belonging to individuals who serve as custodians and creators of more code .
" It is easier to write a new code than to understand an old one , " von Neumann warned .
Evolution in the Ulam - von Neumann universe now drives evolution ( and economics ) in our universe , rather than the other way around .
The current misbehavior of our economy , however much it reflects misbehavior by human individuals and institutions , is more a reflection of the behavior of self - reproducing machines and self - replicating codes .
We measure our economy in money , not in things .
In the age of self - reproducing automata , we can suffer a declining economy , and pandemic unemployment , while still producing as much stuff as people are able to consume .
We are facing the first economic downturn to include free cell phones , more automobiles than we have room for ( in many locations you can now rent a car for less than it costs to park one ) and computers that cost less than a month 's health insurance yet run at billions of cycles per second for years .
Why the growing imbalance between the cost of people and the cost of machines ?
What prices are going up the fastest ?
Health care — the cost of maintaining human beings .
What prices are going down the fastest ?
The cost of information and machines .
What , really , is health - care reform ?
Human beings are being cared for by a dysfunctional , antiquated system , and we hope that this can be reformed by adopting efficiencies from the domain of machines .
Where will this lead ?
Are we using computers to sequence , store , and more faithfully replicate our own genetic code , or are computers optimizing our genetic code ( and health ) so that we can do a better job of replicating them ?
Replication of information is generally a public good ( however strongly pockets of resistance may disagree ) .
When financial instruments become self - replicating , trouble often ensues .
The derivatives now haunting us were produced , not from natural factors of production or other goods , but from other financial instruments .
There are numerous precedents for this .
As early as the twelfth century it was realized that money , like information but unlike material objects , can be made to exist in more than one place at a single time .
An early embodiment of this principle , preceding the Bank of England by more than five hundred years , were Exchequer tallies — notched wooden sticks issued as receipts for money deposited with the Exchequer for the use of the king .
" As a financial instrument and evidence it was at once adaptable , light in weight and small in size , easy to understand and practically incapable of fraud , " wrote Hilary Jenkinson in 1911 .
" By the middle of the twelfth century , there was a well - organized and well - understood system of tally cutting at the Exchequer ... and the conventions remained unaltered and in continuous use from that time down to the nineteenth century . "
10 A precise description was given by Alfred Smee , resident surgeon to the Bank of England and the son of the accountant general ( as well as the inventor of electroplating , electrical facsimile transmission , an artificial muscle , and other prescient ideas ) .
" Curiously enough , I have ascertained that no gentleman in the Bank of England recollects the mode of reading them , " Smee reported in 1850 .
" The tally - sticks were made of hazel , willow , or alder wood , differing in length according to the sum required to be expressed upon them .
They were roughly squared , and one end was pointed ; and on two sides of that extremity , the proper notches , showing the sum for which the tally was a receipt , were cut across the wood . "
11
On the other two sides of the tally were written , in ink and in duplicate , the name of the party paying the money , the account for which it was paid , and the date of payment .
The tally was then split in two , with each half retaining the notched information as well as one copy of the inscription .
" One piece was then given to the party who had paid the money , for which it was a sufficient discharge , " Smee continues , " and the other was preserved in the Exchequer .
Rude and simple as was this very ancient method of keeping accounts , it appears to have been completely effectual in preventing both fraud and forgery for a space of seven hundred years .
No two sticks could be found so exactly similar , as to admit of being identically matched with each other , when split in the coarse manner of cutting tallies ; and certainly no alteration of the particulars expressed by the notches and inscription could remain undiscovered when the two parts were again brought together .
And , as if it had been further to prove the superiority of these instruments over writing , two attempts at forgery were reported to have been made on the Exchequer , soon after the disuse of the ancient wooden tallies in 1834 . "
12 Exchequer tallies were ordered replaced in 1782 by an " indented cheque receipt , " but the Act of Parliament ( 23 Geo. 3 , c. 82 ) thereby abolishing " several useless , expensive and unnecessary offices " was to take effect only on the death of the incumbent who , being " vigorous , " continued to cut tallies until 1826 .
" After the further statute of 4 and 5 William IV the destruction of the official collection of old tallies was ordered , " noted Hilary Jenkinson .
" The imprudent zeal with which this order was carried out caused the fire which destroyed the Houses of Parliament in 1834 . "
13
The notches were of various sizes and shapes corresponding to the tallied amount : a 1.5 - inch notch for £ 1000 , a 1 - inch notch for £ 100 , a half - inch notch for £ 20 , with smaller notches indicating pounds , shillings , and pence , down to a halfpenny , indicated by a pierced dot .
The code was similar to bar - coding , or the notches still used to identify the emulsion speed of photographic film in the dark .
And the self - authentication achieved by distributing the information across two halves of a unique piece of wood is analogous to the way large numbers , split into two prime factors , are used to authenticate digital financial instruments today .
Money was being duplicated : the King gathered real gold and silver into the treasury through the Exchequer , yet the tally given in return allowed the holder to enter into trade , manufacturing , or other ventures , producing real wealth with nothing more than a wooden stick .
Until the Restoration tallies did not bear interest , but in 1660 , on the accession of Charles II , interest - bearing tallies were introduced .
They were accompanied by written orders of loan which , being made assignable by endorsement , became the first negotiable interest - bearing securities in the English - speaking world .
Under pressure of spiraling government expenditures the order of loan was soon joined by an instrument called an order of the Exchequer , drawn not against actual holdings but against future revenue and sold at a discount to the private goldsmith bankers whose hard currency was needed to prop things up .
In January 1672 , unable to meet its obligations , Charles II declared a stop on the Exchequer .
At the expense of the private bankers , this first experiment with derivative financial instruments came to an end .
Today 's Exchequer , distributed across the global banking network , splits digital tallies by the millions in milliseconds : above human scale in magnitude and beyond human scale in time .
High - speed trading programs not only have access to unlimited funding ; by dividing time into ever - smaller increments they also , effectively , have access to unlimited time , and , in the words of Ampère , " must then be considered as a single opponent whose fortune is infinite . "
Can this be stopped ?
Financial systems exhibit the Gödelian incompleteness characteristic of all sufficiently powerful formal systems : within the given system it is possible to construct statements ( or financial instruments ) whose value appears to be sound , but can not be proved within the system itself .
No financial system can ever be completely secure and closed .
There is no limit to the level of concepts ( including fraudulent ones ) that an economy is able to comprehend .
The system depends on trust .
" A Banke is a certain number of sufficient men of Credit and Estates joyned together in a stock , as it were for keeping several mens Cash in one Treasury , and letting out imaginary money at interest ... and making payment thereof by Assignation , passing each mans Accompte from one to another , yet paying little money , " wrote Francis Cradocke in 1660 , in An Expedient For taking away all Impositions , and raising a Revenue without Taxes , By Erecting Bankes for the Encouragement of Trade .
14 Establishing a bank requires secure information storage to keep accounts , a license from the government ( or an entity beyond government ) , a small amount of capital , and a large amount of trust .
" A Banker , " explained Sir William Petty , co-founder of the Royal Society and author of Political Arithmetick , in 1682 , " is honest only upon the Penalty of losing a beneficial Trade , founded upon a good Opinion of the World , which is called Credit . "
Credit , by definition , cannot easily be restored ; its nature is to shift somewhere else .
We should be less concerned with loss of money and more concerned with loss of trust .
If we have to start over with more trust and less money , is this really so bad ?
" Is not a Country the Poorer for having less Money ? " asked William Petty .
" Not always , " he answered , " For as the most thriving Men keep little or no Money by them , but turn and wind it into various Commodities to their great Profit , so may the whole Nation also . "
15 Charles II had the right idea .
He trusted ( and endowed ) the small group of oddballs who were forming the Royal Society , and put a stop on the Exchequer .
If he had rescued the bankers , and ignored William Petty 's band of Natural Philosophers , where would we be now ?

You can always count on grandma to keep the house tidy .
Have you heard ?
iPods in Europe are about to get a lot more quiet .
Regulators have released a new set of standards governing how loud portable music players can go , and that means the default max volume is going take a big dip from where it currently sits .
The EU's New MP3 Player Policy
The European Commission 's new policy will require iPods and other MP3 players to have a default maximum volume of 80 decibels .
That 's considered a " very loud " level by most sound rankings ; anything above that mark can be potentially dangerous .
Presently , most MP3 players go as loud as 115 to 125 decibels .
For some fun comparisons , we turn to the U.S. National Institute On Deafness And Other Communications Disorders ( apparently , every shorter agency name was already taken ) .
According to the , er , USNIODAOCD :
• 80 decibels is equivalent to the level of noise you 'd hear on a busy city street ;
• 90 decibels is lawnmower - like loudness ;
• 110 is as ear - shattering as a loud rock concert ;
• 120 to 130 matches the level of an airliner taking off -- or , in less technical terms , " GET USED TO PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVING TO SHOUT AT YOU ! "
Some Volume Limit Limitations
Now , the new European MP3 volume policy wo n't make it impossible to pump up the jam ( even if you do make dated references to subpar dance tunes ) -- it 'll just make it more difficult .
With the new restrictions , MP3 player - makers will only have to preset their devices ' default max volumes .
They will , however , have the option of allowing users to disable that default and venture into deafening territory , albeit with some sort of warning about the eardrum - puncturing delights that may occur .
So what would this warning actually entail ?
Per the EU statement :
" A dequate warnings for consumers on the risks involved , and on ways to avoid them , including the situation when the original set of earphones is replaced with another type and this causes higher unsafe sound levels .
The mandate is not prescriptive in terms of how this is done .
Industry solutions could include , for example , labels or digital information on the screen . "
( I 'm pretty sure they meant " adequate , " not " a dequate . "
Because , I 'll be honest , I have no idea what " a dequate warning " would be . )
Sounding Off
Personally , I think it 's great that users will still be able to ignore the advice and subject themselves to harmful decibel exposure .
It 's perfectly permissible for someone to ruin his own lungs with heavy smoking , after all , or to ruin his own liver with heavy drinking .
Why draw a distinction with eardrums ?
Seriously , though , the new visual warnings should be a good step toward ensuring people are at least aware of the dangers of rockin ' out earbud - style .
Unless , of course , they 've already had their eyesight damaged by an exploding iPod .
Then they 're just totally screwed .

Cern has spent about 40 m Swiss Francs ( £ 24 m ) on repairs to the LHC
Engineers hope an early warning system being installed at the Large Hadron Collider could prevent incidents of the kind which shut the machine last year .
The helium leak last September , which resulted from a " faulty splice " between magnets , has delayed the start of science operations by more than a year .
Officials aim to re-start the collider , known as the LHC , in mid-November .
The vast physics lab is built inside a 27 km - long circular tunnel straddling the French - Swiss border near Geneva .
The LHC will send two beams of particles crashing into each other at close to the speed of light .
Scientists hope to see new particles in the debris of these collisions , revealing fundamental new insights into the nature of the cosmos and how it came into being .
It will allow us to constantly monitor the status of the interconnections
Gianluigi Arduini , Cern
BBC Radio 4 Material World :
One year on from the LHC 's switch - on This LHC " ring " is split into eight distinct parts , or sectors .
Six of these are now at or close to their operating temperature of 1.9 kelvin ( - 271C ; - 456 F ) .
Engineers are powering up magnets in three sectors to prepare for the injection of proton beams into the ring .
A low - intensity beam could be injected into the LHC in the second half of October , officials told the BBC .
This beam test would involve only parts of the collider , rather than the whole " ring " .
If all goes to plan , the first beam collisions could occur before the end of the year .
Machine repairs
The collider has been shut down since 19 September 2008 , when a magnet problem called a " quench " caused a tonne of liquid helium to leak into the LHC tunnel .
An investigation carried out for the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) , confirmed the cause of the accident was an electrical fault in one of the splices , or " interconnects " , linking two of the 1,200 " superconducting " magnets that accelerate particles around the LHC .
Superconductivity is the property , exhibited by some materials at very low temperatures , to channel electrical current with zero resistance and very little power loss .
A quench occurs when part of a magnet heats up , causing its superconducting properties to be lost .
Engineers have been making major upgrades to the system designed to protect hardware against these events .
Guide to the LHC and how it works
They have had to install hundreds of new detectors around the machine .
Among other things , the upgraded quench protection system is expected to improve monitoring of the interconnects between magnets .
Gianluigi Arduini , deputy head of hardware commissioning for the LHC , told BBC News : " It will allow us to constantly monitor the status of the interconnections .
If there is any deterioration detected by the system , the powering of the magnets will be automatically stopped , preventing any damage . "
James Gillies , Cern 's director of communications , said this would prevent the kind of damage which occurred in 2008 .
He told BBC News : " Last year , we did n't see this thing coming . "
With the improved warning system , he added : " We would be looking at downtime of a matter of weeks , rather than a year ... we 're in a much better place than we were 12 months ago . "
Mr Arduini said the upgraded system was currently undergoing testing in one of the LHC 's sectors .
Cern has spent about 40 m Swiss Francs ( £ 24 m ) on repairs to the LHC , including upgrades to the quench protection system .
Lower energies
When the collider finally re-starts at the end of this year , it is expected to do so at about half its intended energy .
The LHC was designed to run at energies of seven trillion electron volts .
But the machine will clash together protons at energies of just 3.5 trillion electron volts in its first few months of operation .
Two issues stand in the way of Cern achieving its goal of seven trillion electron volts in the immediate future .
Firstly , engineers have discovered the collider has hundreds to thousands of faulty electrical splices between magnets .
" This limits the amount of current you can safely put in , " said Mr Gillies .
Officials have decided to put off repairing all the faulty splices .
Instead , when the collider re-starts in November , engineers have been told not to exceed a maximum " safe " limit of five trillion electron volts .
Secondly , tests uncovered concerns about a number of the magnets themselves .
All LHC magnets undergo a " training " process , in which engineers crank up the electrical current until the magnets quench .
After a few iterations , a stable configuration is reached where the magnet can reliably operate at the current it was designed for .
The magnets had been trained to their operating current before being lowered into the LHC tunnel .
But once connected underground , some of them were found to have " lost " their training .
" We could n't get up to the current necessary for operating at seven [ trillion electron volts ] at the first try , " said Mr Gillies .
When the collider re-starts in November , engineers will hope to get the LHC up to five trillion electron volts before the machine goes into its planned downtime again in November 2010 .
They will then subsequently attempt to re-train magnets and possibly replace a proportion of the splices to ready the LHC for a push towards seven trillion electron volts .

Die Bundesregierung hält sich erst nicht an Europarecht , reicht dann ein veraltetes Dokument bei der EU ein und tauscht dann still und heimlich das veraltete Dokument gegen ein aktuelleres aus , ohne dies zu kennzeichnen und die Frist entsprechend zu verlängern .
Laut der EU - Richtlinie 98/34/ EG
muss jedes EU - Mitglied Gesetze , die sich mit „ Diensten der Informationsgesellschaft “ befassen , den anderen EU - Mitgliedsstaaten vorlegen .
Diese können dann Einspruch einlegen und die EU - Kommission kann dann zum Beispiel feststellen , dass diese Regelung zur Harmonisierung des Binnenmarktes EU - weit getroffen werden sollte .
Oder eben , dass eine andere oder keine Regelung getroffen werden sollte .
Prof. Thomas Hoeren hat dies ausführlicher beschrieben .
Das „ Zugangserschwerungsgesetz “ ist nun ein entsprechendes Gesetz .
Das hätte also im Laufe des Gesetzgebungsverfahrens und vor der Verabschiedung durch den Bundestag der EU vorgelegt werden müssen .
Dies geschah nicht .
Dies geschah erst am 7 .
Juli 2009 , da war das Gesetz längst verabschiedet .
Es wurde da aber nicht die damals aktuelle Version , die bereits vom Bundestag verabschiedet war und wenige Tage später dem Bundesrat vorgelegt wurde , eingereicht .
Nein , es war der alte Gesetzesentwurf , der nochmal komplett umgeschrieben wurde !
Die wissen also mal wieder nicht was sie tun .
Offensichtlich hat man dies nun heute auch gemerkt und schnell eine neue Version hinterhergeschoben .
In der Zwischenzeit ist in deutscher Sprache nur noch die neue Version online , die anderen Sprachen enthalten noch die alte Version …
Hier zum Vergleich die Word -Dokumente :
Und jetzt stellt sich noch die Frage , warum die alte Version das Datum 8.7 . hat , aber laut EU die Meldung am 7.7. verschickt wurde .
Vermutlich haben sie da auch schon mal ein Dokument ausgtauscht …
Streng genommen müsste die Frist aufgrund des getauschten Dokuments nun also bis November laufen .
Und alles neu übersetzt werden .
Auf jeden Fall ist anzunehmen , dass das Wirtschaftsministerium das Gesetz erst dann Bundespräsident Horst Köhler schickt , wenn die EU - Frist abgelaufen ist .
Also nicht vor dem 7 .
Oktober .
Das ist auch der Grund , warum es noch nicht schon jetzt in Kraft treten kann .
Was die Bundesregierung hier vorlegt ist einfach nur unglaublicher Pfusch .
Requests by police and other officials for information on people 's phone calls and emails ran at an average of 1,381 a day last year , according to a report released today by the interception of communications commissioner , Sir Paul Kennedy .
A total of 504,073 surveillance requests to telephone and internet companies were made in 2008 , the equivalent of one in 78 adults being targeted .
The figure was slightly lower than in 2007 , but higher than in 2006 , when Kennedy issued his first report covering 253,557 requests registered in the 38 weeks after he took up his position in mid-April of that year .
The 2008 figure shows a rise estimated at about 45 % , if the 2006 figure is projected at a constant rate over a full year .
The report [ PDF ] shows that most of the requests came from police , but it also covers requests from the intelligence services and local authorities .
These requests are separate from those on data interception , which involves tapping into the content of people 's communications ; rather , acqusition requests seek to find out who communicated with whom , and when and where this happened .
The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said the figures " beggared belief " and showed that Britain had sleepwalked into a surveillance state .
" Many of these operations carried out by the police and security services are necessary , but the sheer numbers are daunting , " he said .
" It can not be a justified response to the problems we face in this country that the state is spying on half a million people a year .
" We have sleepwalked into a surveillance state , but without adequate safeguards .
Having the home secretary in charge of authorisation is like asking the fox to guard the hen house .
" The government forgets that George Orwell 's [ novel ] 1984 was a warning and not a blueprint .
We are still a long way from living under the Stasi but it beggars belief that it is necessary to spy on one in every 78 adults . "
When it came to getting access to the content of communications , Sir Paul described interception as " an invaluable weapon " but said it was becoming increasingly technical and difficult due to the greater sophistication of terrorists and criminals .
The report reveals that two complaints of improper interception were upheld , only the second and third time such complaints have succeeded .
It gives no details of the cases except to say that the intercepted data was destroyed and compensation was paid in one case but not the other .
Local authorities and government agencies won the right to ask for communications data – the " who " ,
" when " and " where " , as the report puts it – under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , but there was outrage over revelations last year after some councils confirmed in a Press Association survey that they had used the power to spy on people accused of allowing their dogs to foul pavements , or of leaving bins out too early for collection .
The government has launched a review .
A Home Office spokesman said : " Of course it 's vital that we strike the right balance between individual privacy and collective security and that is why the Home Office is clear these powers should only be used when they are proportionate . "
• This article was amended on 12 August 2009 .
The original said the data - acquisition statistics referred to phone and email " tapping " .
It said surveillance requests were 60 % higher than in 2006 .
This has been corrected .
A reference to a 2008 Press Association survey has also been inserted to make clear where the information on some uses of surveillance tools originated .
Look for young carrots with their greens still attached - you can get a good sense of whether the bunch is fresh or not .
On the bean front , I cooked the alubias from scratch , but you can use well - drained canned white beans if you want to throw this together on a whim .
I bought a single bunch of bushy - topped carrots the other day .
At first glance it was a good looking cluster - bright orange in color , vibrant greens still attached .
But it was on second glance that I noticed the tiny carrots nestled beside their larger brothers and sisters .
Some of the smallest carrots were no thicker than a knitting needle , not much longer than my pinky finger .
I snacked on those after a quick rinse .
The bigger guys I put to work in this dill - flecked white bean skillet salad .
Nothing too complicated - warm , coin - shaped slices of golden , pan - fried carrots , white alubia beans and chopped dill tossed with a tangy - sweet lemon shallot dressing .
It tastes good the day you make it , even better the day after .
And although it 's certainly not as pretty , in my opinion , it might have tasted best on day three as the shallots infused the beans and the lemon mellowed .
Carrot , Dill & White Bean Salad Recipe
I like to buy young carrots at the farmers ' market - slice them slightly thicker than a banana chip for this salad .
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon fine grain salt
1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots more olive oil ( or ghee ) for cooking
2 cups sliced carrots , cut 1/4 - inch thick on deep bias
3 cups cooked white beans
scant 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
2 tablespoons brown sugar ( or honey )
1/3 cup sliced almonds , toasted
Combine the olive oil , lemon juice , salt and shallots in a small bowl .
Stir and set aside .
In your largest skillet over medium high heat , toss the carrots with a splash of olive oil or a spoonful of ghee ( I love ghee with carrots ) .
Let them cook in a single layer - they 'll give off a bit of water at first .
Keep cooking , tossing gently every three or four minutes until the carrots are deeply browned .
All told , about twelve minutes .
Add the beans and dill to the skillet and cook for another five minutes , or until the beans as well heated through .
If you are using beans that were n't canned you can allow them to brown a bit as well ( just cook a bit longer , and stir less frequently ) - they can handle this in a way that most canned beans can't .
If you need to add a bit more olive oil to the pan - do so .
Place the contents of the skillet in a large mixing bowl , sprinkle with the brown sugar and pour the 3/4 of the lemon - olive oil mixture over the top .
Toss gently .
Let sit for ten minutes .
Toss gently once again , taste and adjust with more salt or sugar or lemon juice if needed to balance the flavors .
Serve warm or at room temperature and finish by sprinkling with the almonds just before serving .
Serves 6 - 8 as a side .
The Actual Debate Over Health - Care Reform
A bit later today , I 'll be putting up an interview with Nancy - Ann DeParle , director of the White House 's Office of Health Reform .
But there 's a particular argument that I want to focus on .
" When you step back , " she told me , " there is broad agreement about 85 percent of what we 're talking about . "
You hear this a lot from the White House .
In fact , you hear it often enough that it 's tempting to think it untrue .
But it 's very true .
And in this moment of violent town halls and ferocious controversy , it 's worth remembering .
Here are the things that , broadly speaking , legislators agree about : insurance market reforms , including community rating , guaranteed issue , an end to rescission , an end to discrimination based on preexisting conditions , and an individual mandate .
Subsidies for low - income Americans .
Delivery system reforms .
Health insurance exchanges .
An expansion of coverage to about 95 percent of legal residents .
Prevention and wellness policies .
Retaining and strengthening the employer - based insurance market .
Creating some kind of incentive for employers to offer , and keep offering , health benefits .
Expanding Medicaid to about 133 percent of poverty .
Here are the things that legislators disagree about , but are discussing , and will probably figure out : whether subsidies should reach 300 percent of poverty or 400 percent .
Whether there should be an employer mandate or something milder .
Whether medium - size employers should be eligible to enroll in the health insurance exchanges .
Whether health reform should cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years or $ 1.4 trillion over 10 years .
Whether it should be paid for through new taxes on the wealthy or a change to existing tax subsidies in the health - care system .
Here are the things legislators do n't agree about : whether we should have a public option that is open only to the minority of Americans on the exchanges or a co-op option .
How to handle abortion .
How to handle geographic disparities in insurance costs .
Here are the things that are n't under consideration but are alive in the public debate : socialized medicine .
Euthanasia .
Government - driven rationing .
Death panels .
Illegal immigrants .
The town halls might be reminiscent of the ferocious argument over Clinton 's health - care reform bill , but the underlying reality is that the actual argument is much narrower .
Clinton 's bill , after all , reorganized the whole health - care system .
It ended employer - based insurance .
It changed the arrangement of every privately insured American .
It imposed managed care on Americans ( which they got anyway ) and managed competition on insurers ( which they escaped ) .
The bills under consideration now do none of that .
The Democrats conceded so much up - front that the actual range of debate is strikingly slim .
The public option attracts most of the attention , but the reality of the policy , even in the liberal House bill , is that it 's limited to the insurance exchanges and is n't expected to serve more than 12 million people by 2019 .
In part , that 's why the debate has had to move toward fear - mongering and lies :
There just are n't that many scary elements in the bills , because the legislation is oriented toward preserving the existing system and avoiding points of controversy .
You can make an argument that the policy is worse because of its modesty .
A more ambitious approach could save more money and do more to fix the system .
But that 's the way it is .
Insofar as there are real debates remaining , they are not about the policy .
They are about whether people trust the Obama administration , and the government more generally , to do anything at all .
They are about whether Republicans want some sort of bill , or whether they see more political upside in handing the president his " waterloo " on health - care reform .
They are about whether people will fall to fear and retrench to the relative predictability of the status quo when faced with the chaos and polarization present in our political system .
But beneath all that is a health - care bill that is not necessarily finished , and that is not necessarily agreed - upon , but is a lot closer to done than most people think .

This short guide will teach you how to trademark a name for your business so you can participate in the Amazon brand registry .
Most people who start an online business unknowingly neglect trademark issues when naming their business and products .
Finding an open domain name is simple , but just because the domain that you want is not registered yet does n’t necessarily mean that you can do business using that name .
For example , just because the domain name MicrosoftHardware.com is available for registration does n’t mean that you can legally sell computer hardware under that business name .
Do n’t fall into the trap of not doing your homework ahead of time and make sure that your business and domain name do not conflict with any other established businesses .
If you accidentally choose a business or product name that is too similar to a competitor , they can accuse of you of violating their trademark and force you to change your business name .
Needless to say , this can be a major pain .
Especially if you have an online business , your website domain may already be entrenched within the search engines and any domain name change could be catastrophic to your business .
Disclaimer : I ’m not an expert on trademark law nor do I pretend to be in this guide .
The information in this guide is derived from my own research and should not be taken as absolute fact .

What Is A Trademark ?
A trademark is a word , phrase , or symbol that is used to market a product , business or service .
Whoever owns a trademark for a particular product has special legal rights under both federal and state law which give them the power to prevent other businesses from using the same name .
Just the mere act of using a specific product name in public to market goods or services is enough to make it a trademark .
But keep in mind that this name must be used to actually sell a product in order for it to qualify as a trademark .
Since the web is all encompassing and reaches people everywhere in the world , you have to especially be careful about infringing on other people ’s property .
Not only do you have to consider the names of businesses on the web , but you also have to consider brick and mortar stores all across the nation as well .
For example , just because I own MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , there could be a store with the same name ( unlikely I know ) somewhere across the country that has been doing business for decades .
If they could prove that they had trademark rights to MyWifeQuitHerJob before me , then they could take me to court and technically force me to relinquish my domain .
Choosing A Strong Business Name
In general , distinctive business names have the most trademark strength .
For example , even if Microsoft , Intel , Oracle were n’t behemoth companies , they would still have very strong trademarks because of their uniqueness .
On the contrary , a business under the name of Quality Linens would have a very hard time enforcing their trademark .
Because the business and product name you choose determines its trademark power , you should always choose a descriptive name that clearly distinguishes your product from the competition .
In fact , I would suggest split testing your business name using a service like PickFu
By getting external feedback from real people , you can make sure to choose the right business name that is both descriptive and memorable .
If you are having problems making the distinction between a good and bad name , think of products like Kleenex or Xerox as opposed to names like Tasty Chinese Food or Cheap Cars .
It ’s also important to keep in mind that trademarks can grow stronger over time as a company or product name becomes accepted into society .
For example , just because your name happens to be Calvin Klein does n’t mean that you can create your own clothing line ( or market any product for that matter ) under the same name .
Because Calvin Klein clothing has become popular worldwide , people naturally associate Calvin Klein with designer clothing .
Any company with the same name would confuse customers .
Without getting into the vagaries of trademark law , trademark infringement pretty much only occurs when the use of a trademark by two different businesses is likely to cause confusion .
This is vague I know , but that ’s why we have so many lawyers in this world .
Basically , the safest route is to make sure that your potential business or product name does n’t conflict with anyone else .
How To Play It Safe
Technically speaking , the mere act of registering your domain name makes that name function as a trademark already as long as you conduct business using that URL .
To make your trademark more enforceable however , you may want to register your domain name with the US Patent and Trademark Office .
When choosing a web domain , make sure you do web searches of all possible permutations of your business and product name .
Keep in mind that even though you might be selling completely different products as another company of the same name , you could technically be accused of trademark infringement .
Therefore , it ’s best to stay away if you find any matches at all , though you might be able to risk it if the business sells completely different products .
No matter how small your business is though , you should always take the time to search the federal trademark database for your business name .
This is crucial because if you register a domain that is already in the federal database , you could be accused of “ willful infringement ” .
For all intents and purposes , you would basically be immediately found guilty of trademark infringement even if you had no idea the database even existed .
Thankfully , the Patent and Trademark office is all computerized and searchable on the web .
To check to see if your business or product name infringes on any known trademarks , simply go to www.uspto.gov/ebc/index_tm.html and follow the directions on the website .
Establish A Strong Trademark
If you do n’t find any overlapping domain names and trademarks after searching the web and the PTO website , it is probably safe to go ahead and use it .
Remember , once you ’ve registered your domain name and begin selling products using this name , it technically counts as a trademark and you immediately possess all of the trademark rights associated with that name .
Pick a strong , distinctive name and you should not run into any major issues preventing others from using your brand .
Remember , it ’s important to play things safe .
Trust me , you do not want to have to change your business name ever .
Changing something as important as your brand name could spell the end of your small business .
Registering Your Own Trademark
In the long run , you will probably want to register your own trademark so other businesses can not use your business name .
In addition , Amazon now requires a trademark in order to register your brand on their platform .
To register your own trademark in the quickest and easiest way possible , I recommend using a service called CorpNet.com because they are super accessible .
For example , you can get a free 20 minute consult right off the bat where you can ask questions WITHOUT GETTING CHARGED .
As a result , I use them to file trademarks and answer both my legal and tax questions .

LEBANON , Pa. 
They got up before dawn in large numbers with angry signs and American flag T - shirts , and many were seething with frustration at issues that went far beyond overhauling health care .
More than 1,000 people showed up here Tuesday morning in this largely Republican town in central Pennsylvania for a town - hall - style meeting with Senator Arlen Specter , though the auditorium could seat only 250 .
Like many of the dozens of such meetings held by members of Congress over the last few weeks , this one was punctuated with rowdy moments , and interviews with many of those who showed up made it clear just how much underlying dissent motivated them .
Many said the Obama administration ’s plans for a new health care system were just another example of a federal government that had again gone too far , just as it had , they said , with the economic stimulus , the auto industry bailout and the cap - and - trade program .
“ This is about the dismantling of this country , ” Katy Abram , 35 , said forcefully to Mr. Specter , drawing one of the most prolonged rounds of applause .
“ We do n’t want this country to turn into Russia . ”
Tastable cookbook
Want to taste a dish before you make it ?
Then the TEASER digital cookbook concept is for you .
Designed by Scott Shim of Ohio State University and Xi Calvin Chen of Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , it sports a touchscreen and an edible print system with 18 " flavour " cartridges to recreate the taste of the dishes in the book .
There 's even the option to tweak the taste of a dish if you do n't like the printed sample , letting you tweak the recipe before you begin cooking .

Instant Braille
Non-Braille books are made accessible to the blind with the Haptic Reader , designed by researchers at Handong Global University and Keimyung University , both in South Korea .
When placed on a page , the reader scans typed letters and converts them to their Braille equivalent on the device 's upper surface .
The text can also be converted to speech .

Contact shades
Sunglasses and contact sports do n't make happy bedfellows .
Jin-young Yoon , Jun-kyo Lee and Young - ho Lee of the Korea Design Membership , South Korea , have an answer – contact lenses that act as sunglasses .
The lenses are available in four different shades for different weather conditions and activities .

Multiview map
People are beginning to throw away unwieldy city maps in favour of the GPS systems and maps built into some smart phones .
But the information - rich Panamap from Urban Mapping , a San Francisco - based firm , could reverse the trend .
It uses new print technology to display three complementary maps on one sheet .
Tilt the map and you 'll see either a street map , the public transport routes , or the town 's main districts .

Folding plug
The British three - pin plug is a lot more bulky than two - pin equivalents .
So Min-kyu Choi at the Royal College of Art in London , UK , has designed a folding version that saves space .
The folded plug is just 10 millimetres thick for maximum portability .

Personal cycle lane
Cycle lanes are a good way of keeping bikes away from cars and minimising accidents , but they are n't available on every road .
Evan Gant at the Industrial Designers Society of America ( IDSA ) and Alex Tee of Altitude Inc in Somerville , Massachusetts , have designed a portable cycle " Light Lane " that straps to the back of a bike .
A laser projects an image of a cycle lane onto the road directly behind the cyclist to remind approaching cars to leave room .

Grating bucket
Traditional graters must be used with a plate or board to stop the grated food from spreading and making a mess .
Henrik Holbæk and Claus Jensen of Tools Design in Denmark simply added a solid bottom to a grater to create a tool that holds the food without spillage .

Bloomsbury Will Rejacket Justine Larbalestier 's " Liar "
In a stunning turnabout , the publisher Bloomsbury will put new covers on both the hardcover and softcover versions of Justine Larbalestier 's novel " Liar , " after massive internet outcry over the fact that they were trying to sell a novel about a black girl with a picture of a white girl on the front
Here was the original , ridiculous cover :
And here 's the new cover : Instead of apologizing , of course , Bloomsbury issued the following communique to Publisher 's Weekly " We regret that our original creative direction for Liar -- which was intended to symbolically reflect the narrator 's complex psychological makeup -- has been interpreted by some as a calculated decision to mask the character 's ethnicity .
In response to this concern , and in support of the author 's vision for the novel , Bloomsbury has decided to re-jacket the hardcover edition with a new look in time for its publication in October .
It is our hope that the important discussions about race and its representation in teen literature continue .
As the publisher of Liar , we also hope that nothing further distracts from the quality of the author 's nuanced and accomplished story , and that a new cover will allow this novel 's many advocates to celebrate its U.S. publication without reservation .
" I fear for Justine Larbalestier .
You ever see a bitter , violent adult get caught publicly abusing their child ?
They will admit they were wrong and fall on their knees in public , but then you turn to look at their kid , and you see that the kid is now even more afraid for their lives .
And you realize : these " adults " may do the right thing when people are watching , but then later , when it is just the two of them , the humiliations and anguish of the parent will be released tenfold on the poor , defenseless youth .
We got the news about Bloomsbury 's turnabout from publicist Russ Marshalek , who had this analysis of Bloomsbury 's decision over at " Creative Loafing " : " Basically , Bloomsbury got called out , and they 're undertaking a massive expenditure to set it right .
Ideally , this will open a dialogue that extends beyond just the realm of publishing to a place very real where race still plays a giant factor : the book shelf .
" For now , we commend Bloomsbury 's wise and sensitive decision , no matter how expedient .
But now let 's see if Bloomsbury can't start publishing some more black writers , too .
Maybe get some black editors ?
Hell , maybe even some black cover artists ?

A massive alien spaceship breaks down at Earth in District 9 , leaving its occupants stranded ( Image : Sony Pictures )
In films like War of the Worlds and Independence Day , aliens dominate us with their superior technology – or at least try to .
But a new movie called District 9 turns the tables by asking , what if humans had the upper hand and aliens found themselves at our mercy ?
The movie paints a disturbing picture of the scenario , suggesting we would be just as prone to abusing our galactic neighbours , given the opportunity .
In the film , fear and intolerance lead humans to isolate 1 million shipwrecked aliens in a squalid camp , where the aliens subsist on cat food and are treated horribly by human authorities .
With “ no aliens ” signs posted in human neighbourhoods bordering the camp , District 9 evokes memories of apartheid – and indeed the film is set in South Africa .
Advertisement
The science begins promisingly enough .
Credit must go to the film ’s creators for making the aliens look truly weird – they resemble bipedal grasshoppers – rather than like humans with pointy ears or bumpy foreheads , as the Star Trek franchise has tended to do .
It seems unlikely that aliens would resemble us that closely .
And there are a few other nice touches , science - wise .
In one scene , aliens work with a special fluid that forms itself into funky shapes , and the filmmakers must have been inspired by the visual antics of real - life ferrofluids , nano - scale magnetic particles suspended in a liquid that create dynamic sculptures in the presence of a magnetic field .
DNA mixing
Also , one character straps into a mechanical exoskeleton to fight bad guys – a type of device that was a central feature in the film Iron Man .
The design in District 9 is over the top in terms of its abilities , but is nonetheless inspired by real technology .
And when an alien tractor beam is employed to lift a heavy object , nearby clods of dirt are levitated along with it .
Anti-gravity tractor beams do n’t exist as far as we know , but if they did , it seems logical that other stuff near the target object might be accidentally affected – a detail that adds realism to the scene .
But the science of District 9 takes a nosedive when alien and human DNA intermingle , which makes a human suddenly grow a claw in place of a hand .
It ’s hard to imagine alien biochemistry being so compatible with ours by chance , and absurd to think it would lead to overnight changes in someone ’s gross anatomy .
( Human - animal hybrid cells have been created in real life , but the results are not as dramatic . )
One - liners
At about this point , the creativity and imagination in the first part of the film give way to a pretty standard action flick , with lots of gun battles and explosions , but little to whet viewers ’ appetite for science .
“ The real focus , as it has been from the beginning , is weapons , ” says a fictional expert interviewed in the film .
He ’s referring to the motives of the human authorities in their dealings with the aliens , but it is an apt description for the latter half of the film .
Humour also declines in the film ’s second half .
Earlier on , there are some memorable one - liners , like “ Do n’t point your f**ing tentacles at me ! ”
The disturbing backdrop of cruelty makes it hard to laugh much , though – even at these lighter moments .
If you ’re looking to get your geek on , you may find the film worth seeing just for the early parts , which are thought provoking .
But after that , be prepared to slip out early or turn on the part of your brain that is happy just watching things go boom .

Aug. 25 , 2009  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney slammed the Obama Administration for its decision to appoint a prosecutor to review and investigate whether CIA interrogators violated U.S. torture statues , saying the move calls into question its ability to protect the nation .
" President Obama 's decision to allow the Justice Department to investigate and possibly prosecute CIA personnel , and his decision to remove authority for interrogation from the CIA to the White House , serves as a reminder , if any were needed , of why so many Americans have doubts about this administration 's ability to be responsible for our nation 's security , " the former vice president said in a statement Monday .
Cheney said the intelligence gained from interrogations of terror suspects " saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks . "
" The people involved deserve our gratitude .
They do not deserve to be the targets of political investigations or prosecutions , " he said .
The CIA released the documents Monday that former Vice President Dick Cheney requested earlier this year in an attempt to prove his assertion that using enhanced interrogation techniques on terror detainees saved U.S. lives .
The documents back up the Bush administration 's claims that intelligence gleaned from captured terror suspects had thwarted terrorist attacks , but the visible portions of the heavily redacted reports do not indicate whether such information was obtained as a result of controversial interrogation techniques , such as waterboarding .
Cheney 's initial request in the spring that the documents be declassified was rejected by the CIA .
Lawmakers derided his claims that the harsh interrogation techniques were necessary .
Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said in a May 27 speech that " those classified documents say nothing about numbers of lives saved , nor do the documents connect acquisition of valuable intelligence to the use of abusive techniques . "
Cheney has been a fierce public critic of the Obama White House 's handling of national security policy .
In May , the former vice president squared off against Obama , giving a competing speech as the president defended his terrorism policies and decision to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay .
" The administration seems to pride itself on searching for some kind of middle ground in policies addressing terrorism , " Cheney said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , D.C. " But in the fight against terrorism , there is no middle ground , and half - measures keep you half exposed . "
" I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program , " Cheney added later in the speech .
" The interrogations were used on hardened terrorists after other efforts failed .
They were legal , essential , justified , successful , and the right thing to do . "
Justice Department Releases Memos
The Department of Justice compiled a list of documents released late Monday evening , related to a 2004 CIA Inspector General report on enhanced interrogation techniques that was released today .
The two documents that Cheney requested were part of that release , but were made public early by the CIA .
One of the CIA documents , entitled " Detainee Reporting Pivotal for the War Against al - Qaeda , " and dated June 3 , 2005 , says " detainee reporting has become a crucial pillar of U.S. counterterrorism efforts , aiding intelligence and law enforcement operations to capture additional terrorists , helping to thwart terrorist plots , and advancing our analysis of the al - Qaeda target . "
The report is heavily redacted and , at times , it is unclear which detainees are being discussed .
The report does not describe any intelligence gained as result of enhanced interrogation techniques .
The report does state that intelligence from detainees has resulted in the thwarting of terror plans .

Detainee reporting has helped thwart a number of al - Qaeda plots to attack targets in the West and elsewhere .
Not only have detainees reported on potential targets and techniques that al - Qaeda operational planners have considered but arrests also have disrupted attack plans in progress , " the report said .
It describes how interrogations of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed yielded information about al - Qaeda 's attempts to obtain anthrax and crash commercial airplanes into London 's Heathrow Airport .
It says that other detainees , when confronted with information learned from Mohammed , revealed more about the plots and members of al - Qaeda .
One of the documents on Mohammed titled " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed : Preeminent Source on al - Qaeda , " noted that he was the most valuable source of information on the terror network .
The report notes that the planner of 9/11 was forced to rethink second - wave attacks he envisioned after 9/11 because of increased security efforts in the United States .
" KSM stated that he had planned a second wave of hijacking attacks even before September 2001 but shifted his aim from the United States to the United Kingdom because of the United States post - 11 September security posture and the British government 's strong support for Washington 's global war on terror , " the report noted .
The CIA report states that Mohammed " dramatically expanded our universe of knowledge on al - Qaeda plots … [ and ] leads that assisted directly in the capture of other terrorists including Jemaah Islamiyah leader Hambali . "
The report on detainee information says that information learned from interrogations of al - Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah revealed plots against " targets abroad and in the United States – including the White House and other U.S. symbols . "
Zubaydah was the first senior member of the group to be captured in March of 2002 .
The report describes gaining " invaluable insights " into " al - Qaeda 's current organization , the personalities of its key members , and al - Qaeda 's decision - making process .
His reporting has contributed to our understanding of the enemy , how al - Qaeda members interact with each other , how they are organized , and what their personal networks are like . "
Al - Qaeda 's Hierarchy , Financing
The report describes how intelligence from detainees revealed al - Qaeda 's inner workings , including its hierarchy and financing .
" Detainees have been particularly useful in sorting out the large volumes of documents and computer data seized in raids , " one section said .
It later describes how one tip from an interrogation was able to pry open other sources to reveal more information .

One of Aesop 's fables describing a thirsty crow which was able to drink from a half - full pitcher after raising the water level by adding pebbles may have had a basis in real life .
Scientists have found that rooks – a member of the crow family – were able to figure out how to raise the water level in a laboratory container by dropping stones inside to retrieve a tasty worm floating on the surface .
Four different rooks , called Cook , Fry , Connelly and Monroe , quickly discovered that they could raise the water level in a transparent container by adding stones , just like the mythical crow in the fable , which illustrates the virtue of ingenuity and how necessity is the mother of invention .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The only other animal shown to be able to perform the same task is the orang - utan , which was able to grasp a floating peanut by spitting water into a tube .
Scientists believe the demonstration shows that , in many respects , rooks and crows have comparable intelligence to primates when it comes to the use of tools .
" We have performed a large number of studies on both corvids [ members of the crow family ] and apes , and have found that the crow 's performance is on a par or often superior to apes .
However , it is not particularly useful to say that one species is more or less intelligent than another because often the playing fields are n't even , " said Nathan Emery of Queen Mary , University of London , who carried out the work with Christopher Bird at Cambridge .
" This [ study ] suggests that they can not only think through complex problems requiring the use of tools , but imagine the consequences of their actions without trial - and - error learning , and create novel solutions to these problems that have never been encountered before , " Dr Emery said .
" This has only ever been shown in the great apes and humans and is more surprising because the birds have brains the size of walnuts and these birds do not use tools in the wild . "
The latest research , published in the journal Current Biology , follows earlier studies of the same group of hand - reared rooks showing that they were able to fashion a simple tool out of wire to help them retrieve food from an empty container .
Other scientists have discovered that wild crows living in the French territory of New Caledonia can make similar tools to retrieve grubs from tree holes .
" We believe that intelligence in rooks and other crows evolved primarily to solve social problems , as almost all crow species live in large social groups , but they also mainly form pair bonds , like human marriages , and some of their cognitive abilities appear to have evolved to help them predict what others are going to do next – so - called mind reading , " Dr Emery said .
" This may have developed into understanding about the psychological properties of unseen forces that are important in using and making tools . "

House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. has backed off his plan to investigate wrongdoing by the liberal activist group ACORN , saying “ powers that be ” put the kibosh on the idea .
Mr. Conyers , Michigan Democrat , earlier bucked his party leaders by calling for hearings on accusations the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now ( ACORN ) has committed crimes ranging from voter fraud to a mob-style “ protection ” racket .
“ The powers that be decided against it , ” Mr. Conyers told The Washington Times .
The chairman declined to elaborate , shrugging off questions about who told him how to run his committee and give the Democrat - allied group a pass .
Pittsburgh lawyer Heather Heidelbaugh , whose testimony about ACORN at a March 19 hearing on voting issues prompted Mr. Conyers to call for a probe , said she was perplexed by Mr. Conyers ’ explanation for his change of heart .
“ If the chair of the Judiciary Committee cannot hold a hearing if he want to [ then ] who are the powers that he is beholden to ? ” she said .
“ Is it the leadership , is it the White House , is it contributors ?
Who is ‘ the power ? ’ ”
Capitol Hill Democrats had bristled at proposed hearings because it threatened to rekindle criticism of the financial ties and close cooperation between President Obama ’s campaign and ACORN and its sister organizations Citizens Services Inc. and Project Vote .
The groups came under fire during the campaign after probes into possible voter fraud in a series of presidential battleground states , including Ohio , Pennsylvania , Michigan , New Mexico and Nevada .
ACORN and its affiliates are currently the target of at least 14 lawsuits related to voter fraud in the 2008 election and a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO )
Act complaint filed by former ACORN members .
The group ’s leaders have consistently denied any wrongdoing and previously said they welcomed a congressional probe .
The group did not immediately respond Thursday to questions about Mr. Conyers being convinced to drop those plans .

From Raw Story :
An online campaign against Fox News editorialist Glenn Beck is working .
Web site ColorofChange.org , reacting to a long line of racial comments about President Barack Obama , has managed thus far to knock loose from Beck ’s fold Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble , Progressive , S.C. Johnson , GEICO , Men ’s Wearhouse and , just Wednesday morning , Sargento .
** UPDATE : On Thursday , ConAgra , Roche , Sanofi - Aventis and RadioShack all backed out of sponsoring Glenn Beck ’s programs , according to a media advisory .
On a recent rainy summer afternoon , a familiar figure sat in the second row of a musty Manhattan courtroom , his head tilted expectantly as he listened to the judge .
It was the latest hearing in the matter of Dan Rather vs. CBS Corp. , and the plaintiff , as usual , was monitoring it in person .
“ Their strategy is to string it out , wear me out , suck the will from me , and make it so painful on the pocketbook that I want to give up , ” Rather said of the network where he worked for nearly half a century .
“ Well , I have a lot of flaws and vulnerabilities , but I do n’t think anybody who knows me would say that there ’s any give - up in me . ”
Nearly two years after suing CBS for how it handled the aftermath of its controversial report about George W. Bush ’s service in the Texas Air National Guard , the veteran anchor is still avidly engaged in the fight .
In legal terms , the case is about breach of contract and fraud .
But to Rather , 77 , the battle serves a much grander and more valiant end -- a counterpunch against corporate bullying of the press , “ the red beating heart of democracy . ”
The suit ’s outcome could ultimately determine his journalistic legacy : that of a champion of the truth , no matter the cost , or of a diminished newsman who let an egregious error slip by .
Advertisement
The personal stakes were underscored last month when the iconic CBS anchor Walter Cronkite died , prompting a torrent of gushing accolades .
Colleagues said it pains
Rather that he will be remembered in more complicated terms .
“ I think it was hard for him to sit there listening to the eulogies for Walter Cronkite as the most trusted man in America , knowing he would never have that , ” said a former CBS employee who left the network in the fallout over the Bush story .
Rather is financing his lawsuit alone , at significant expense .
But perhaps more dear has been the personal price .
After working for 44 years at CBS , 24 of those as the face of the network , he is now persona non grata .
At Cronkite ’s funeral last month , prominent CBS figures filled the front pews of St. Bartholomew ’s Church in Midtown Manhattan .
Rather sat apart , about 10 rows back .
Advertisement
He refers to his former CBS colleagues as “ our adversaries . ” CBS is pushing back at him in increasingly vituperative language .
The network made available several executives who spoke acidly about the anchor whose work they once touted .
“ I just think it ’s sad that Dan ca n’t do what the rest of the people involved in this have done , which is stood up and been accountable for their role in what was a huge embarrassment in the history of the news division , ” said Andrew Heyward , the former president of CBS News .
“ It ’s hard to watch , ” said Jeff Fager , executive producer of “ 60 Minutes . ”
“ It ’s like he is in some paranoid nightmare where everybody is out to get him .
We ’re all witnessing the poor guy thrashing around , tormented .
“ I ca n’t for the life of me understand why he ’s doing this , how he could turn such a storied career into this train wreck , ” he added .
Advertisement
For Rather , the personal attacks are simply confirmation that he ’s on the right track .
“ When you report something important for people to know that somebody , somewhere in power does n’t want them to know , you ’re going to pay a price for it , ” he said in a 90 - minute interview at his modest Times Square office where he now works for HDNet , a small cable channel .
“ People will try to discredit you . ”
Bush documents
It all began with a piece Rather narrated for the now - defunct show “ 60 Minutes II , ” two months before the 2004 presidential election .
In it , he reported that Bush got preferential treatment during his Vietnam War-era service in the Texas Air National Guard .
He cited new documents CBS had obtained , purportedly written by Bush ’s commanding officer at the time .
Advertisement
Immediately after the broadcast , the authenticity of the documents came under attack , largely by conservative bloggers scrutinizing the typeface of the memos .
After initially defending the story , the network -- then Rather , reluctantly -- acknowledged that they could not determine their validity .
The fallout was severe .
An outside panel commissioned by CBS concluded that the news division failed to do enough to establish the documents ’ veracity .
The segment ’s producer , Mary Mapes , was fired , three executives were forced to resign , and Rather stepped down as anchor a year short of his 25th anniversary in the chair .
After working the next season as a correspondent for “ 60 Minutes , ” he left CBS altogether , pushed out by CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves , Rather said .
In his $ 70 - million lawsuit , filed in September 2007 , Rather claims that CBS prevented him from defending the story to appease the Bush administration and protect the business interests of Viacom , then its parent company .
He said he was forced to apologize for the piece and ordered to stop reporting on it .
Instead of doing an independent investigation , the outside panel that CBS appointed worked with the network to produce a report to mollify its critics , he contends .
Rather claims that after being bounced from the anchor desk and assigned to “ 60 Minutes , ” he was essentially warehoused .
His reputation marred , he said he then could not find commensurate work when he left CBS .
Advertisement
“ The code was , we go into things together , we stick together while we ’re doing it , and we come out the other end together , ” Rather said .
“ I counted on that .
And they did n’t meet their part of the bargain . ”
CBS maintains that Rather was never sidelined , arguing that the network did everything possible to preserve his journalistic standing .
The announcement that he was stepping down as anchor , executives noted , was timed to come out before the panel released its report in an effort to divorce the two events .
“ One of the sad ironies is that there was a tremendous amount of thought on our part in preserving Dan ’s legacy , ” said Heyward , denying that he forced Rather to apologize .
“ So here ’s a guy who stood up to Richard Nixon and interviewed Saddam Hussein in a roomful of Iraqi thugs . . . and now he ’s asking us to believe that a news executive coerced him into saying something that he did n’t believe ? ” he asked .
Advertisement
Fager said Rather had one of the largest staffs at “ 60 Minutes , ” but much of his work was not well - conceived .
“ I hate to say it in public , but many of stories were not even close to the standards we expect at ’ 60 Minutes , ’ ” Fager said .
Gary Meyerhoff , one of Rather ’s attorneys , said that Fager “ is simply continuing the same character assassination tactic that CBS has been following since this began . ”
In the end , CBS executives said Rather was not forced out , but offered an emeritus position similar to the one that Cronkite held .
( Rather ’s attorneys said he could not comment on that aspect because of the ongoing litigation . )
Prolonged case
Advertisement
Rather ’s lawsuit is a gamble .
If he had hoped to distance himself from the controversy over the Bush story , he has not .
He ’s now inextricably linked to it .
But in one respect , the anchor has already won .
The case has dragged on much longer than CBS anticipated , attorneys for the network admit .
A state Supreme Court judge threw out part of the suit but is allowing Rather to pursue several of his claims , including breach of contract and fraud .
CBS is hoping a state appellate division will dismiss the matter , but if it does n’t , a trial could begin by the end of the year .
In the meantime , Rather ’s attorneys continue to get new discovery , including 50,000 pages of documents produced by the outside panel .
The material that has emerged so far shows that CBS executives worked frantically to defuse critics on the political right after the Bush story was challenged .
News executives vetted potential panel appointees with Viacom ’s Washington lobbyists , drawing up a list that included conservatives such as Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh and Roger Ailes , according to internal documents .
E-mail included in court filings shows that one Viacom lobbyist , Carol Melton , urged Heyward and CBS communications chief Gil Schwartz to officially retract the story in order to satisfy then - House Majority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo . ) .
Advertisement
“ Plainly the ‘ retraction ’ point per se seems to be a final shoe that some would like to see drop -- and have no doubt that Blunt is acting as the mouthpiece on this for the Administration , ” she wrote on Jan. 10 , 2005 .
Both men rejected such a move as unnecessary .
Heyward responded to Melton that the bulk of the story was not in serious dispute , though he added that “ I would never say this publicly . ”
“ You ca n’t be CBS News and say , you know that story we told you about the other day , 40 % of that was accurate , ” Heyward said in a recent interview .
The suit has also forced Rather to dredge up details that he ’d probably prefer to keep private , including a round of meetings he had in spring 2006 with CNN / U.S. President Jon Klein , ABC News President David Westin and NBC News President Steve Capus , all of whom politely declined his services .
A slew of other networks , including A&E ; , History , HBO , Discovery and National Geographic , also turned Rather down .
Advertisement
The anchor recently extended his deal with HDNet , where he has a weekly news show , and hopes to work there “ as long as I can go . ”
He ’s planning a reporting trip to Afghanistan in the coming months .
Rather said he does n’t fret about his legacy .
“ My record is my record , ” he said , ticking off the tent - pole events of the last half - century that he has covered : the assassination of President Kennedy , Watergate , the Gulf War , the Iraq war , Tiananmen Square , the Sept. 11 attacks .
But will this particular story forever overshadow all of that ?
The usually loquacious newsman leaned back in his chair , silent for a moment .
“ I have no idea , ” he said quietly .
“ Ever is a long time . ”

Mattresses strewn across the street , a child crying , a woman shouting in despair – it was not a pretty scene in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in East Jerusalem last Sunday , where two Palestinian families were evicted from the homes they had lived in for the last 50 years .
Already a bitter pill to swallow , the sight of religious Jews immediately moving in to the properties can't have made things any easier for them .
However , things are not always what they seem and the eviction of the Hanoun and Ghawi families are an apt example of how an appetite for a certain type of story can create that story regardless of the facts .
As an organisation that follows media coverage of the Middle East closely , we gathered from Sunday and Monday 's reporting , such as on the BBC , in the Guardian and in the Times that the two Palestinian families were evicted because Israeli courts had found that the land belonged to Jews , not to the Palestinians living there .
Cut to religiously clad Jews busting in to the newly vacated houses and the whole thing is just obvious : Israel mercilessly turfs Arabs on to the street to plant more settlers in east Jerusalem .
It turns out that this is simply not the case .
In fact , there is nothing simple about this case at all .
There is a long legal history pertaining to the dispute between 28 Arab families and Jewish organisations over the ownership of the land in question .
However , one crucial point was omitted from all reporting from the British sources named above ( bar a small amendment to the BBC article made yesterday following a communication from us ) : the two Arab families evicted on Sunday were evicted for failing to pay rent in violation of the terms of their tenancy agreements .
The Arab families who have kept to the terms of their tenancy agreement have not been evicted .
It is true that the non-payment of rent is tied up with the dispute over who owns the land , but it is still intensely relevant to the story .
It 's all very well for the Guardian 's Middle East editor , Ian Black , to describe the evictions as " the ugly face of ethnic cleansing " or for Cif contributor Matt Kennard to claim that they represent " a process of racial purification " .
But without informing readers that the only people being evicted are the ones who refused to pay rent to the landlords they recognised decades ago , they paint a distorted picture .
As a story that has been widely reported and stirs deep emotions , it is vital that crucial facts are not erased from the narrative .
There can be no doubt that there are clearly issues of inequality in Jerusalem which need to be addressed but that is no excuse for British journalists and commentators to misrepresent this particular story .
Liberal Israeli daily Ha'aretz saw fit to mention the non-payment of rent element in its reporting , as did the Jerusalem Post .
This information was public .
Furthermore , Ir Amim , the Israeli organisation supporting the position of the evicted families , is straight about the fact that the families are being evicted for not paying rent ; a representative stated : " The legal issues surrounding the Sheikh Jarrah evictions are quite complex .
In short , the Israeli courts have accepted the settlers ' claim of ownership over the property , but recognised the Palestinian residents to be protected tenants .
Some of the 28 families continued to pay the rent , but some did not accept the court 's ruling and therefore did not pay the rent .
Against those , the court issued eviction orders . "
So why the collective exclusion of this key fact from British reporting ?
Big Brother to bow out next year
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Channel 4's final series of reality TV show Big Brother will be broadcast next year , it has been announced .
The station , home of the programme since it began in 2000 , will honour its deal to screen series 11 next summer .
Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo said the show " had reached a natural end point on Channel 4 and it's time to move on " .
Big Brother has suffered from falling ratings in recent years , with the current run the least watched .
The latest series has picked up about two million viewers per show , compared with an audience high of eight million in 2002 .
Speaking at the broadcaster 's new schedule launch , Channel 4 head Julian Bellamy said : " Big Brother has been our most influential and popular programme over the last decade . "
But he added that " inevitably we 're both excited and ever - so - slightly terrified by the prospect of getting by without it " .
Mr Bellamy said the loss of Big Brother would leave a " huge hole " in the station 's schedules , but would prompt " the most fundamental creative overhaul " in Channel 4 history .
INSIDER'S VIEW Torin Douglas , Media correspondent Big Brother 's ratings may have fallen from their peak - and it no longer fills page after page in the tabloids .
But it still attracts more viewers than most Channel 4 programmes - night after night - and that brings in a lot of advertising .
Dropping the show is a risk - it makes a good profit for Channel 4 and there 's no guarantee that the programmes that will replace it will be as successful .
So will Big Brother move to another channel ?
Some rivals will be doing their sums and opening talks with the show 's producer Endemol .
But it 's expensive to produce - some estimates put it at £ 20 m a year .
That rules out most digital channels but it could still make financial sense for Sky or Five .
He stressed that Channel 4 was not seeking a like - for - like replacement for the reality programme , but admitted that fans of the show would be " disappointed " by its demise .
The broadcaster said it had already started to allocate funds which would have been spent on Big Brother into new drama .
The show also spawned Celebrity Big Brother , with one more series of the spin - off to be screened at the beginning of 2010 .
Big Brother may not disappear from British TV screens , with the prospect of producers Endemol securing a deal with another broadcaster .
The show 's makers said in a statement they are " enormously proud " of their partnership with Channel 4 .
" We have every intention of celebrating the show 's historic run on Channel 4 with great final series of both Celebrity Big Brother and the summer series in 2010 , " it continued .
" As for 2011 , stay tuned .
Big Brother will get back to you " The programme thrust contestants including Jade Goody , " Nasty " Nick Bateman and Kate Lawler into the spotlight .
It has also courted controversy , including in 2007 when Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty won Celebrity Big Brother following a series of rows with Goody , who was accused of bullying and racism .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Top marks C4 - I 'll be able to start watching you again Adam , Norwich Meanwhile , the winner of this year 's Big Brother will not receive the original prize money of £ 100,000 , the programme 's makers have announced .
The housemates were told the news after some of them attempted to stage a break - out from the compound on Tuesday .
The contestants broke out through a fire exit in the garden after being instructed by Big Brother to do something " entertaining " .
The winner of the 10th - and penultimate - series of the show is due to be announced next week .

STEPHANOPOULOS : A lot of good news out there this week , but the bad news is , the consumers are still real scared .
Even though their income went up , the spending went way down .
What more can the administration do , if anything , to encourage the spending to go back up ?
GEITHNER : George , you are right that there are signs the recession is easing .
And if you think about where we were at the end of last year -- we had an economy in freefall , a financial system on the verge of collapse .
And the actions that this administration has taken have been very effective in helping stabilize conditions , help repair the financial system , bring down the costs of credit ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : We've ( inaudible ) a bottom ?
GEITHNER : But I think we have a ways to go .
I want to emphasize the basic realities .
Unemployment is still very high in this country .
We need to make Americans more confident about their future ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
How do you do that , though ?
GEITHNER : And I think --
I think you need to do it through just by making sure people understand we are going to do what 's necessary to bring growth back on track .
We 're going to stick with this until Americans are more confident in their future , businesses have access to credit , families are going to be able to put their kids through college .
That 's going to be the ultimate test of our ( inaudible ) .
And the policies the administration put in place working with the Congress were designed to provide very substantial support to make sure we get through this .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You mentioned the big problem of unemployment , and we 're still nowhere near the kind of growth that it would take to create jobs .
More than 2.5 percent growth to start to create jobs .
I know the administration has thought that 's not going to come until next year , but some private economists now say it could happen in the second or third quarter of this year .
They look at these numbers and see that .
Do you have any reason to believe they 're right ?
GEITHNER : Well , I think you 're right to say that the broad consensus of private forecasters is you 're going to see positive growth in the second half of this year , and expect that to continue .
STEPHANOPOULOS : A growth at the 2.5 percent level ?
GEITHNER : Not clear yet , but you need growth before you get people -- businesses to start creating jobs again , and that 's what we 're going to be very focused on doing .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So should Americans expect that more jobs are going to start getting created this year , or not ?
GEITHNER : I think you 're going to see -- what you 're going to see first is growth turn positive .
And then you 're going to see the pace of job losses slow materially for the -- they have already slowed significantly , as you said .
They 're going to slow materially further .
But again , most private forecasters -- and let 's use their judgment -- suggest you 're going to see unemployment start to come down maybe beginning in the second half of next year .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And what about the flip side ?
What are the chances that we 're actually going to see a second dip later this year ?
GEITHNER : I think that 's something we 're very focused on .
Again , we need recovery to be built on private demand , private spending , businesses taking a chance again in the American economy , putting investments to work , starting to rebuild their employment base .
That 's the ultimate test for recovery .
And the very important thing for us is to make sure we 're sticking with this until we 're very confident we have a strong , private sector - led recovery in place .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And what are you looking at that would give you some cause of concern that we could slip back ?
GEITHNER : Well , I do n't think you can make that -- see that risk now .
Again , and the stimulus program and what we 've done in the financial sector are designed to have a sustained impact , again , because the damage we had done to our economy was so great , it was just going to take a long , sustained effort .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And that means unemployment , as you said , pretty high , at least through the rest of this year .
At the same time we 're seeing reports said up to 1.5 million people could be losing their unemployment benefits by the end of this year .
Does that mean that the administration is going to have to look at extending unemployment benefits again ?
GEITHNER : I think that 's something the administration and Congress are going to look very carefully at as we get closer to the end of this year .
And that 's going to be one important thing to look at .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
We already know that a million - and - a - half people are going to lose their benefits , do n't we ?
GEITHNER : Yes .
Again , I think the most important thing we need to make sure people understand is working with the Congress , we 're going to make sure we do enough to bring this economy back .
But , you know , our job is not just to repair the damage done to this economy , bring growth back , we need to make sure that we 're making the kind of investments that are going to build a more productive economy , gains of growth more broadly shared .
And that 's why it 's so important , as we focus on recovery , we 're making investments in health care reform , in education , in infrastructure , fixing our financial system , the kind of things we 're working on right now .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I did want to get to that .
And as we pull out of the recession , the other big worry going forward is deficits .
You heard that from the Chinese this week .
Our next guest , Alan Greenspan , has warned this as well .
And Senator Charles Grassley , the Republican ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee has cited CBO estimates , Congressional Budget Office estimates , that your budget will add $ 9 trillion to the national debt over the next decade .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
CHARLES GRASSLEY ( R-IA ) , RANKING MEMBER , FINANCE COMMITTEE :
Our debt , as a percentage of the economy , will grow in excess of 80 percent , a level also that has not been seen since this country was in World War II .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That is a very , very high level .
And I know you believe that passing health care is essential to getting the deficit under control , but independent analysts also say that even with that , you 're going to have to find new government revenues .
The former deputy treasury secretary , Roger Altman , said : " It is no longer a matter of whether tax revenues must increase , but how . "
Is he right ?
GEITHNER : George it is absolutely right and very important for everyone to understand that we will not get this economy back on track , recovery will be not strong and sustained , unless we are -- can convince the American people that we 're going to have the will to bring these deficits down once recovery is firmly established .
Remember , we inherited a $ 1.3 trillion deficit .
The cumulative consequences of policies this country pursued over the last eight years left us with $ 6 trillion more debt than we would have had by making a bunch of commitments to cut taxes and add to spending .
Without paying for those , we are not going to be able to afford to do that .
And it is very important people understand .
Our first priority now , though , is to get this economy back on track , make sure this financial system is repaired .
Without that , we 're not going to get our deficits under control .
And the necessary path to fiscal responsibility , the necessary path to getting this country living within our means again is not just health care reform , to bring down those costs , but we 're going to do a range of other things .
And that 's going to be a very difficult challenge to this country .
We can do this , it just requires the will to act .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Including new revenues ?
GEITHNER : Well , we 're going to have to look at -- we 're going to have to do what is necessary .
Remember the critical thing is people understand that when we have recovery established , led by the private sector , and we have to bring these down , deficits down very dramatically .
We have to bring them down to a level where the amount we 're borrowing from the world is stable at a reasonable level .
And that 's going to require some very hard choices .
And we 're going to have to try to do that in a way that does not add to the -- unfairly to the burdens that the average American already faces .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that 's the dilemma ...
GEITHNER : That is the dilemma .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... is n't it ?
Because even when you look at health care reform again , I know you believe it 's going to bend the cost curve over time , but the Congressional Budget Office says at best the health care reform plans out there are going to be deficit - neutral over the next 10 years .
So to bring the deficits down there 's not enough money in the discretionary budget .
We all know that .
That means more revenues .
The president has said that taxes wo n't go up for any Americans earning under $ 250,000 .
But it does n't appear he 's going to be able to keep that promise if you 're going to bring the deficits down .
GEITHNER : George , again , we can't make these judgments yet about exactly what it 's going to take and how we 're going to get there .
But the very important thing , and no one is going to care about this more than the president of the United States , is for people to understand that we do not have a choice as a country .
That if we want an economy that 's going to grow in the future , people have to understand we have to bring those deficits down .
And it 's going to be difficult , hard for us to do .
And the path to that is through health care reform .
But that 's necessary but not sufficient .
We 're going to do some other things as well .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So revenues are on the table as well ?
GEITHNER : Again , we 're not at the point yet where we 're going to make a judgment about what it 's going to take .
But the important thing ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you 're not ruling it out .
You can't rule it out .
GEITHNER : Well , I think that what the country needs to do is understand we 're going to have to do what it takes .
We 're going to do what 's necessary .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you about health care .
The negotiations seemed to stall out in the Senate .
They 're going to try to come back by September 15th .
The House committees have all passed the bill .
One of the things that Senator Grassley , we just saw , is asking about is that he says he wants some assurances , some guarantees , really , that whatever deal , if they strike a deal -- bipartisan deal in the Senate Finance Committee , it 's going to hold all the way through the process : the Senate floor , the House floor , the Conference Committee .
Can the administration give him that assurance ?
GEITHNER : I think that 's what every legislator wants .
They want that to degree of confidence .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
They 're not going to get it , though ?
GEITHNER :
You know , we want to have an outcome that meets these core principles that the president laid out , which is we want to make sure that we 're doing something that 's going to reduce the growth in costs over the long term , expand access , improve the quality of care , do that in a fiscally responsible way that does not increase unduly the burden on average Americans today .
That 's the basic test .
And we 're going to try to make sure that we achieve that with the broadest consensus as possible .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You want a broad consensus , but Senator Grassley , his colleague Senator Enzi are saying they need those assurances .
They can't get them ?
GEITHNER : Well , you can't , you know -- we want to make sure we get this done , and we 're going to -- as the president said , we 're going to look at anything reasonable consistent with those principles that 's going to get this done .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Why not do it ( ph ) through consensus ?
The president said he wants a bipartisan bill , if possible , but do you believe it is possible if necessary to get meaningful health care reform with Democrats only ?
GEITHNER : George , I think that , again , this is a big , consequential reform for the country .
And as many people observed , ideally you want to do this with as broad a base of consensus as possible .
But people on the Hill are going to have to make that choice , do they want to help shape this and be part of it , or do they want this country , the United States of America , to go another several decades without doing what every other serious country has done , which is to give their citizens access to basic quality care .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But if the Republicans can't come to an agreement with the Democrats , are the Democrats and the White House willing to go it alone ?
GEITHNER : George , again , we 're going to try to get this done on the best possible terms consistent with those principles .
Ca n't tell you what it 's going to take , but you see what the president is trying to do .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you about the TARP .
The TARP inspector general , Neil Barofsky , has criticized your department for not being transparent .
He 's also said that the taxpayers can be on the hook for up to $ 23 trillion in liabilities .
I know you dispute that figure , but what can you tell us about where the TARP stands right now , and how much of the $ 700 billion that has been appropriated taxpayers can expect to get back ?
GEITHNER : Let me just emphasize what 's important to Mr. Barofsky and the other oversight panels and to the president and to the secretary of the treasury , is we want to make sure we have the highest level of transparency on these programs , and we are doing everything we need to make sure that they are delivering the benefits they need with as little risk of fraud as possible .
And he has made a number of reforms we 've adopted , a very helpful role in shaping these programs , and we are committed to do everything necessary to achieve that .
Now , the program itself -- we 're in a much better position than I thought we were going to be , frankly , if you just look back four months ago , three months ago or six months ago .
The financial system today is more stable .
The cost of credit -- credit is more available .
Cost of credit is down significantly .
Broad concern about the collapse of the financial system has receded dramatically , and that is very , very , very important to the prospects of ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
We 're not going to see a collapse , are we ?
GEITHNER : No , not at all .
That 's not going to happen .
It 's absolutely preventable , and again , there 's much more confidence today than we 've seen the last I think even in a year , in the basic stability of the U.S. financial system , and that is a very , very important accomplishment .
And we have done that -- when I was here four months ago , we had roughly $ 40 billion of authority left in the TARP .
Today we have roughly $ 130 billion , in partly because we have been very successful in having private capital come back into this financial system .
And we 've had more than $ 70 billion ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Paid back .
GEITHNER : ... come back into the government .
And that money goes directly to reduce our debt .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
How much more are you expecting to be paid back ?
GEITHNER : Can't tell , but substantial additional sums will come back .
And we are getting -- we 've already earned about $ 6 billion for the taxpayer on those investments , and you know , this program is delivering very important improvements in availability of credit , which is the ultimate test .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So it 's going in the right direction , it 's going up .
Can you say now with certainty that you 're not going to have to come back to the Congress for more money ?
GEITHNER : We do not plan to ask for more money , and I think it 's quite unlikely that we do .
But the important thing , George , as you just said , is that people need to understand that we will do what is necessary to make sure that viable businesses , families that have been very conservative ( ph ) and prudent have access to credit at reasonable terms .
That 's the basic purpose of these programs , and we 're going to do what 's necessary to achieve that .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The issue of executive compensation for those banks , a lot of them are trying to get out from under the TARP restriction because they want to get out from the compensation restrictions .
The House passed a bill on Friday to give shareholders more rights to vote on executive compensation , also the SEC more power .
The Republicans in the House were very critical .
Take a look .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
( UNKNOWN ) :
This bill continues the Democrat majority 's tendency to go to the default solution for every problem -- create a government bureaucracy to make decisions better left to private citizens .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Is the government getting too involved ?
GEITHNER : Absolutely not .
And I think that really , everybody understands that we cannot have our financial system go back to the practices that brought this economy to the brink of collapse .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you think that 's happening ?
GEITHNER : No , I do n't think we 're at that point yet , but it is going to take fundamental reform of our financial system .
Compensation reforms are an important part of that , but we need to go beyond that .
And that 's why the president has moved so early in this administration to propose very far - reaching reforms to provide much stronger protection for consumers and deliver a more stable financial system and give us better tools to manage future crises .
And the broader fundamental reforms to protect consumers , create a more stable system are absolutely important , one of the president 's top legislative priorities this year .
And I think , ultimately , you 're going to find very broad - based support for those reforms .
STEPHANOPOULOS : OK , Mr. Secretary , thanks very much for your time today .
GEITHNER : Good to see you .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Now , for another perspective on the economy , let 's bring in former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan .
When he joined us last September , his view could not have been more sobering .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GREENSPAN : This is a once - in - a - half - century , probably once - in - a - century type of event .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Is it the worst you 've ever seen in your career ?
GREENSPAN : Oh , by far .
There 's no question that this is in the process of outstripping anything I 've seen .
And it still is not resolved and it still has a way to go .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : And Alan Greenspan joins us again now .
Welcome back .
GREENSPAN : ( OFF - MIKE )
STEPHANOPOULOS : So , last September , a once - in - a - century event , the worst you 'd ever seen .
Is it over ?
GREENSPAN : Not quite , but we 're getting very close .
The -- as the Treasury secretary just mentioned , there 's been a very significant improvement in the financial system .
And it 's been the financial system where the problems have been ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And collapse is n't going to happen ?
GREENSPAN : Collapse , I think , is now off the table .
We were teetering for awhile , but I do think that the TARP program , for example , was very helpful in shoring up the capitals , that stock of banks and the like .
And not an insignificant event is the $ 3.5 trillion increase in the stock market value of American corporations .
Because there are capital gains and they flow out throughout the system , and you could see their impact in the credit markets and in the equity markets .
STEPHANOPOULOS : How about the broader economy ?
Have we hit a bottom , and are we going to see a bounce ?
GREENSPAN : Well , I 'm pretty sure we 've already seen the bottom .
In fact , if you look at the weekly production figures for various different industries , it 's clear that we 've turned , perhaps in the middle of last month , the middle of July .
And indeed you 're seeing a major increase in assemblies in auto and trucks before the clunker issue even arose .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Has it helped ?
GREENSPAN : Well , obviously , it 's helped .
It 's an interesting issue .
I mean , I have qualms about the concept , but there is no doubt that that very extraordinary response is a very important indicator that the state of confidence in the economy is beginning to pick up .
If we had been -- the clunker program had been put in place six months ago , it would have probably been a dud .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Well , that 's interesting because , you know , you also saw , about five months ago , the administration also putting out a credit for first - time homebuyers .
Has that made a difference ?
GREENSPAN : I think it has , but the problems in homebuilding and home sales and mainly home prices is much broader than that .
In fact , the way I would define it is that , unless home prices stabilize within , say , maybe , 5 percent down from here , we 're going to run into some ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the Case - Shiller has shown that they probably have stabilized some .
GREENSPAN : Well , they have stabilized temporarily .
And the problem with the data on home prices is they 're very difficult to measure in their regional data .
It is possible .
I do n't think it 's going to happen , but I do think it is possible that we could get a second wave down .
But the important issue is , if we do n't -- and I think the probability is that we wo n't , that we are close to stabilization .
Under those conditions , you will begin to get a very significant change in the underlying confidence in the consumer area .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And then you might see that in the consumer area ; you might see that in the stock markets .
So that is the -- is the trigger , possibly -- you say it 's unlikely -- that that could be the trigger to a second dip ?
GREENSPAN : If you get another dip and a renewed decline in prices , we 're going to run into an acceleration of a number of homes that are mortgaged and are underwater ; that is that the value of the properties are less than the debt .
If that happens -- and , clearly , looking at the structure of where debt and values , it would , if , for example , home prices fell by 10 percent or more , that would create a major acceleration in foreclosures .
And I think it could be a factor ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
On the other side , what 's your best estimate right now of when we 're going to see that kind of economic growth that can create jobs , above 2.5 percent , 3 percent , 3.5 percent ?
GREENSPAN : Well , first of all , let me just say this , that the unemployment rate is going to continue to rise , but more slowly than it 's been .
We 'll continue to have job loss , but that 's slowing as well .
It strikes me that we may very well have 2.5 percent in the current quarter , and the reason is that there 's been such an extraordinarily high level of inventory liquidation that the production levels are well under consumption .
And as that slows down -- as it has to , I mean , you can't go below zero on inventories -- production moves up , and that could be quite significant .
So I would n't put out of the question that ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you 're fairly optimistic right now .
GREENSPAN : I 'm short - term optimistic , but with many caveats .
The home price issue will be a critical one , and then , as you heard me quoted on earlier , the deficits ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's what I want to press you on , because you watched Secretary Geithner there .
He says the administration takes it seriously , they 're going to do what it takes .
Two questions on that .
Do you believe that this health care reform that is now being debated is part of the solution to deficits ?
And number two , must new revenues be on the table ?
GREENSPAN : I would say yes to both .
That there is no question that the core of the problem on the long - term deficit is Medicare specifically , and health care more generally , in the sense that it affects revenues .
This is an issue which , remember , existed at the beginning of the year .
In fact , Medicare at that point was only half - funded .
And you can't get around the fact that when you have this big shift in the baby boomers retiring that things fundamentally change .
And my view is that we have to attack both the original shortfall and make sure we fund whatever new initiatives that occur in the health care area .
It 's not adequate to be strictly revenue - neutral , because there 's a lot more to be done to get ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So the plans on the table do n't go far enough , in your view ?
GREENSPAN : That 's my view , and in fact , I think that -- I thought the secretary 's remarks were , frankly , quite well balanced , and I think that is the strategy of the administration .
But what he did n't spell out , which he can't actually , at this particular stage , is that very significant additional actions are going to be required to make certain that the deficit does not ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That means control of Medicare , control of Medicaid , control of Social Security , but also we 're going to have to see some kind of broad - based revenues .
Roger Altman , who I quoted , the former secretary -- the former deputy treasury secretary , says that the real answer in the long term has to be that we move towards the value - added tax or sales tax .
GREENSPAN : I do n't like a value - added tax , but I agree with Roger .
I think that there is a fairly significant probability that the least worst solution to the problem will end up to be a value - added tax , because it 's the only thing that raises revenue in significant quantities without significantly impacting on the economy .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You said you were cautiously optimistic just a couple of minutes ago .
One of your predecessors at the Fed , William Chesney Martin , 1951 to 1970 , said the Fed chairman 's job is to take away the punch bowl just when the party is getting started .
He of course was referring to raising interest rates to combat inflation .
Are we anywhere close to that point , where that 's going to have to be considered ?
GREENSPAN : No , but remember that there 's an awful lot of liquidity , latent liquidity in the system , and at some point , that is going to have to be sopped up .
And what that means is higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve .
Now , that 's not immediate , but it's out there in the intermediate future , because as this economy picks up -- assuming that it does -- and as I said , there is an outside possibility it may be a little faster than we expect -- then the Federal Reserve is going to have to rein in credit and raise rates .
They know how to do it very well ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS : The Fed chairman says we have a couple of years .
Is that about right ?
GREENSPAN : I hope they have a couple of years .
I do n't think they do .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Mr. Chairman , thanks very much for your time today .
GREENSPAN : My pleasure .

British cross-country racer Luke Smith left locals red-faced when he won a road race during a trip to Africa – on his Whyte 19 mountain bike .

When Luke lined up at the start of the 75 km Broadhurst Road Race in Gaborone , Botswana on his hardtail with knobbly tyres he was sneered at by some of the regulars .
But he soon broke away with the main bunch and then dropped them all in a sprint finish .
Here ’s what the Whyte - sponsored racer had to say :
“ Due to the fact that I did n’t really know what riding would be on offer in Africa , I only travelled over here with my Whyte 19 .
During my stay I have trained a fair amount on local roads ( so as not to get lost in the bush ! ) .
However , when the opportunity came up to compete in a road race here in Gaborone I was a bit sceptical about the potential .
My chances of hanging in for the 75 km distance were also made worse by the fact that I only had my off - road tyres !
“ Do n’t get me wrong , the Whyte 19 is a very responsive frame , but when guys started pulling up on full - carbon road bikes with Zipp 808 deep - section carbon wheels , I anticipated it would be a matter of kilometres before I got dropped !
“ The race started off a fairly decent pace with everyone keen to establish a good spot near the front of the peloton .
I managed to work my way up front without too much difficulty , much to the surprise of many competitors as I rode past , my big knobbly tyres buzzing as the pace was wound up .
“ There were a couple of guys whom some friends of mine had told me to watch – one of them is apparently a pro roadie in South Africa .
It was no surprise that it was these guys who made most of the attacks .
What was surprising was the fact that I was able to go with them !
Each time , however , we were pulled back by the main group .
“ As the race neared the finish some of the riders made a last - ditch effort at getting away but it was destined to come down to a sprint finish .
I managed to constantly hold second wheel behind the lead rider with the pro road rider sat closely on my wheel .
As we hit the finishing straight I launched my attack and as I glanced back I realised I had quickly gapped the riders .
I even had enough time to make the most of the win and celebrate in style .

“ The crowd and other riders were shocked that a mountain bike had won a road race , especially as I was on knobbly tyres .
When they later asked what was the secret , I replied Whyte – Great British mountain bikes , they ca n’t be beaten !
To be honest though , I had really surprised myself . ”
War in Iraq Was One of " Aggression With Intent to Deceive "
by Ben Cohen
A must watch from The Real News where evidence is examined that proves Tony Blair and George Bush rushed to a premeditated war with Iraq by deceiving the public :
Part 2 here .
After having four surgeries in 13 months , Kathy Roaleen spends a big chunk of her day dealing with her frequent medical bills .
If only she could get her insurance companies to handle them promptly .
" I'm constantly dealing with them , " the Rockford woman said of her battles with insurers , which have resulted in many denied claims .
On Monday , Roaleen spoke of her experiences as a handful of state House Democrats promoted a 12 - bill package that would penalize home , auto and health insurance companies who delay and deny legitimate insurance claims .
The legislation would :
• Strengthen consumer protections , punishing companies who unnecessarily delay or deny rightful claims with fines up to $ 1 million .
• Hold accountable corporate leaders who encourage wrongful denial of claims , making the misconduct a felony punishable by prison and hefty fines .
• Create a whistle - blower protection plan to shield employees who report an insurance company is engaging in wrongful denial .
• Require companies to repair a consumer 's credit that has been harmed by wrongful denial .
Rep .
Mike Huckleberry , D - Greenville , said the legislation would not only protect consumers but also protect whistle - blowers .
Huckleberry said seven of 10 people filing bankruptcy for medical reasons have health insurance that should have covered their medical costs .
" I find that appalling .
You pay your insurance , and you think you and your family are protected and safe and , when something tragic like a crash happens , ( companies ) look for a reason for denial , " he said .
But industry leaders said there 's already regulation in place to adequately protect consumers , and additional rules would be cumbersome and unnecessary .
" The majority of insurance companies and their employees in Michigan are doing a good job at handling claims quickly , efficiently and fairly , " said Lori Conarton , communication director for the Insurance Institute Michigan , which represents a large portion of the state 's insurance companies , " We think ( legislators ) should be focusing on jobs and the economy , " she said .
Conarton also said there is concern about the message this proposed legislation sends insurance companies .
" We would love to find ways to bring insurance companies and have their headquarters here .
Efforts like this do not bring insurance companies and their jobs to Michigan . "
At a press conference in Grand Rapids on Monday , Huckleberry , representatives Mary Valentine , D - Norton Shores , and Robert Dean , D - Grand Rapids , vowed to pass the legislation they said would give " teeth " to current laws and would put the state in line with the rest of the country .
It was one of five such press conferences staged across the state .
Michigan is one of four states -- including Louisiana , Massachusetts and Nebraska -- that does n't have such protections .
" We 're fighting to end that travesty , " Valentine said .
Legislators set up a Web site , housedems.com / wrongful-denial , for those wanting to share their experience .

Phil Giraldi , a former CIA counter - terrorism officer , is one of the few in the U.S. " mainstream " media ( of a sort ) , who has bothered to cover --- and cover responsibly --- Sibel Edmonds ' story in the past .
Today over at The American Conservative --- that 's right , The American Conservative --- Giraldi notes this week 's release of Edmonds ' remarkable deposition video and transcript , appropriately under the headline " Sibel Edmonds Speaks , But No One is Listening " ...
Those who are interested in issues like widespread corruption of our elected officials by foreigners have no doubt followed the ex-FBI translator turned whistle blower Sibel Edmonds saga for the past few years .
Sibel has finally testified in court under oath about some of the things that she learned while working for the bureau .
The testimony was in a court in Ohio about two weeks ago .
A full transcription and a useful summary appear at https://bradblog.com/?p=7374 .
In short , she names a number of Congressmen including former Speaker Dennis Hastert who took money from Turkish lobbyists .
She also identifies senior State Department and Pentagon officials who apparently did the same , including our friends Marc Grossman , Paul Wolfowitz , and Doug Feith .
Interestingly , she claims that Grossman blew the cover of Valerie Plame 's company Brewster Jennings back in 2001 , causing CIA to shut it down , so Robert Novak was not guilty of exposing the CIA cover mechanism .
In another interview given a few weeks ago , Edmonds claims that CIA was working closely with al - Qaeda in the Balkans and continued to do so until 9/11 .
The other interview Giraldi refers to there is the one I did with Edmonds a month or so back while guest hosting the Mike Malloy Show .
That one made mainstream news headlines around the world ... except for in the U.S. , of course , where it does n't matter in the slightest ... after Edmonds expert Luke Ryland covered what he described as the " bombshell " within it .
( Links to the audio and the transcript of that interview at that last link . )
Giraldi , at The American Conservative --- did I mention his quick article was at The American Conservative ? --- goes on to note that " Edmonds is a credible witness who is ignored by the mainstream media and congress because her tales , if true , would be devastating to both political parties and to the Israel and Turkish lobbies , " and then asks : " Now that she has testified under oath and in considerable detail making very specific accusations is n't it time for someone in the administration to review the FBI files and stand up to say whether her accounts are true or not ? "
Well , one would think that , no ?
Silly , one .
Scott Horton of AntiWar.com however , who has covered the Edmonds deposition earlier this week ) , interviews Giraldi about the Edmonds deposition today .
That 26 minute interview can be heard online here .
( They also speak a bit about Holder 's recently announced torture investigation , and Giraldi , an actual conservative , as opposed to a fake one , as well as a former CIA analyst , believes the announced investigation does not go far enough . )
I hope to help encourage more coverage / investigation of the Edmonds story in the coming days , with some pieces in which I 'll try to help the poor poor resource - less mainstream media out by putting the matter , and the deposition , into a few more accessible bite - size chunks for them .
The way you might cut up a piece of steak for a child , I guess .
Also , I 've doing my best on the radio over the last couple of days to further help get the word out .
( You can too , by Digging and Redditting and emailing etc. please ! )
Here are a couple of those recent appearances .
One on the Malloy Show on Tuesday , and another one yesterday , in studio on KPFK , our local Pacifica station here in Los Angeles , on Roseanne Barr 's program ( though she was off this week ) .
Both radio interviews follow below , and the latter includes a bit of new news at the end which I have n't yet had time cover here on the blog , but hope to soon ...

CORRECTION : I originally referred to Scott Horton as being with Harpers and AntiWar.com .
They are , in fact , two different Scott Hortons !
My apologies to both for the error .
Also , we had identified Philip Giraldi as a former CIA analyst .
In fact , we are informed , he was more of an ' agent ' , then an analyst .
We 've corrected the text above to reflect that point .
According to a recent report , extremely sensitive government data has appeared on peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing networks .
The information is reported to include the precise locations of American nuclear silos and FBI surveillance photos .
News of the leak came at the recent House Government Oversight & Government Reform Committee hearing on the issue of P2P software sharing .
An oversight , indeed : researchers from Tiversa Inc. , a company responsible for poring over peer - to - peer networks in order to find sensitive data leaks , reported that employees had discovered Social Security information and the personal details for every U.S. Army master sergeant .
Precise Locations of Weapons Grade Nuclear Fuel
That 's not all : the medical records of about 24,000 patients from a Texas hospital are also floating around out there .
Of course , the most concerning of all the leaked information may be this : a " detailed list of [ a ] civilian nuclear complex , including precise locations of weapons grade nuclear fuel . "
( Source : tgdaily.com )
According to Tiversa Inc. chief executive Robert Boback , it 's extremely concerning .
" Every nuclear facility , every agency , " he said .
" This is information that is not even subject to government Freedom of Information Act [ request ] , however , you can access it on peer - to - peer , in plain text . "
Gov't Promises to Push Back
The government 's answer to this leak is not yet official , but Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns , a Democrat from New York , has announced he will push to have P2P software banned from all U.S. government offices , with presumably stiff penalties .
Towns also believes the time has come to better educate Americans on the threat posed by P2P information sharing .
" The file - sharing software industry has shown it is unwilling or unable to ensure user safety .
It 's time to put a referee on the field , " Towns quipped .

You 're now chatting with a random stranger .
Say hi !
A word of advice : " asl " is boring .
Please find something more interesting
to talk about !
You : [ Welcome to Element , a text adventure . ]
Stranger : oh cool
You :
You are sitting at your study desk ; there is a fire blazing in the
fire place .
You :
The only exit is a door to your east , leading to the stair room .
You :
The walls are covered with bookshelves .
Stranger : o shit i bet theres a blood thirsty killer down the stairs
Stranger : k so i go east
You :
You are still sitting down .
Stranger : ok ok then i guess i stand up and go east ... but ill take the
chair with me

You get up from your comfortable seat with a great sigh .
You know
that there is work to be done .
You :
The seat is attached to the floor ; it wo n't budge .
You :
You go east , arriving in the stair room .
You :
There are exits to the east and west , and a long wooden spiral
staircase leading down .
Stranger : i go down
You :
The staircase creaks loudly , and you balance yourself on the banister
to avoid falling .
You really must fix these stairs someday , you think to
yourself .
You :
You arrive safely at the bottom , in the [ House Entrance ] .
You :
There are many shoes arranged neatly along the Main Door to your
north .
You :
There is a wooden staircase leading up .
Stranger : duh
You : Your butler looks at you expectantly .
Stranger : um why ?
You : [ Do you mean to ask him ?
If so , you need to address him . ]

Stranger : ok
Stranger : so talk to butler
You : [ What do you want to say to the butler ? ]
Stranger : say what are ya looking at ?
You :
The butler responds " Only admiring your coat , sir " .
Stranger : go north
You :
The door is closed .
Stranger : * sigh * open door
You :
The butler rushes to your assistance .
" Sir !
Surely you do not wish to
leave on a cold night such as this ! "
Stranger : tell butler yes i do
You :
The butler says " I 'm afraid that is not an option , sir .
I must attend
to you . " .
You :
He blocks the door with his body and coughs .
Stranger : say you can come along if ye want
You : " Thank you , sir , but it is simply out of the question .
I am required
to keep you safe inside . "
Stranger : say so what am i supposed to do to kiil the boredom ?
You : " You have your study upstairs !
You have thousands of books on any
subject you could conceive of . "
Stranger : go up the stairs
Stranger : tell me the exits
You : [ I assume you meant : Go up the stairs . ]
You :
You ascend the creaky staircase slowly , careful not to lose your
balance .
You :
You are in the stair room ; your study is to the west , and your
bedroom is to the east .
Stranger : Go east
You :
You go into your bedroom .
You :
The entire surface of the floor is a large , springy mattress .
You :
There are many closets along the north wall ; the south wall holds a
large computer monitor and three buttons .
Stranger : Open closet
You :
You open a closet .
Your clothes are neatly arranged inside , smelling
freshly laundered .
Stranger : Start computer
You : [ Please rephrase that command . ]
Stranger : umm
Stranger : Push button
You :
Which button do you want to push :
The red button , the green button ,
or the blue button ?
Stranger : Push the red button
You :
The screen turns on to show the Mandelbrot set ; it is quite
beautiful , and animated in fascinating ways .
Stranger : examine set
You : [ I assume you mean : examine the Mandelbrot set ]
Stranger : yeah
You :
It is breathtakingly beautiful , and , as always , you see patterns in
it that you have not noticed before .
You :
You will never tire of this fractal , you are sure .
Stranger : push green
You :
You push the green button ; the computer screen shows a picture of the
butler guarding the door , taken through one of your hidden cameras .
Stranger : ...
Stranger : push blue
You :
You push the blue button .
A voice sounds throughout the house : " Push
blue button twice more to confirm " .
You see , on the screen , that your
butler has left the door .
You :
You hear the stairs creaking .
Stranger : go west two times
Stranger : fast
You :
You go west and see your butler just coming out of the staircase .
You : He stops you .
Stranger : damn
You : " Sir !
You must be more careful ! "
You :
The butler walks east into your bedroom , where you hear clicking
sounds and loud beeps coming from the computer .
You :
He then leaves the bedroom and returns downstairs .
You :
The staircase creaks loudly .
Stranger : go east
Stranger : push blue
You :
You return to your bedroom .
Stranger : push blue twice more times
You :
You push the blue button .
The computer does not respond .
You :
You push the blue button .
The computer does not respond .
You :
You push the blue button .
The computer does not respond .
Stranger : ok go west twice
Stranger : and search for items
You :
You return to your study .
You :
You see many books around you ; on your desk is an ashtray .
Stranger : take ashtray
You :
You pick up the ashtray , empty it onto the floor ( the butler will
clean it up , surely ) , and add it to your inventory .
Stranger : go down the stairs until i see the butler
You : [ First going east to the stair room . ]
You :
The staircase creaks loudly .
You :
The butler is standing in front of the door .
He coughs gently .
Stranger : hit butler in the head with ashtray
You :
The ashtray shatters to pieces on his head .
You :
He presses a button on his belt and cleaning robots come inside and
remove the glass from the floor .
Stranger : isnt he knocked down ?
Stranger : nevermind
Stranger : say you MUST let me go out
You : " I 'm very sorry , sir .
It is in my contract : I must not allow you to
leave . "
Stranger : say what do you mean in your contract ... am I a prisoner
Stranger : ?
You : " That is an ugly word , sir .
You are being guarded for safety . "
Stranger : say protected from what ?
Stranger : [ wow this is getting interesting ]
You : " Assassination , sir , as you are well aware . "
Stranger : hmm
Stranger : say it seems like i have no other option
Stranger : kick butler in the balls , open door and run north
You : " Pardon me , sir ? "
Stranger : that would work in real life
You : " Sir ! "
You :
The butler is well trained for combat situations , and much faster
than you .
You :
He deflects your attack with ease , picks you up , and carries you
upstairs to your bedroom .
You : [ Bedroom ]
You :
The computer screen shows the butler guarding the door .
Stranger : push blue button
Stranger : then push blue button twice to confirm
You : Nothing happens .
You :
You realize the butler must have done something to the computer .
Stranger : search for windows
You :
There are no windows in your house ; the butler had them boarded up
for safety .
Stranger : hmmm
Stranger : [ can you give me a hint :( ? ]
You : Hint : Check your inventory
Stranger : ok check inventory
You :
You are carrying your pipe ( lit ) , a book of matches , and a handgun .
Stranger : examine handgun
Stranger : is it loaded ?
You :
It is a derringer , made to be easily concealed .
You managed to
acquire it without your butler 's knowledge .
You :
It is loaded .
Stranger : go west and down the stairs
You :
You go to your the stair room and climb downwards .
You :
The stairs creak loudly .
You :
The butler stands in front of the door , guarding it .
Stranger : point handgun at butler
Stranger : say let me go
You :
The butler looks at you straight in eye , and says " I cannot " .
Stranger : ( if he dows something shoot him )
Stranger : ( does * )
You :
He looks terrified , but is attempting to hide it .
Stranger : say i'm sorry
Stranger : shoot butler
You :
The butler screams and begins to bleed .
You :
He attempts to talk , but fails .
Stranger : open door
Stranger : say " farewell " and go north
You :
You can see that the butler is mortally wounded .
You :
The cleaning robots can see it too , apparently ; they come in , remove
his corpse , and scrub the floor quickly .
You :
You open the door ; instead of the cold wind that you were expecting ,
you see a brightly lit corridor .
Stranger : examine corridor
You :
It streches ahead for as long as you can see .
You :
It is completely spotless ; you can not see a speck of dust anywhere .
Stranger : keep going north
You :
You continue north .
You :
You feel your heart beating quickly ; you know that this is unsafe .
You : You continue walking .
You :
You hear loud whirring noises .
You :
You walk ahead regardless .
You :
You see the door close , far behind you .
Stranger : look north
You :
There is a large glowing spot on the floor a few meters away .
You :
It turns from red to green to blue , and back again .
Stranger : touch spot
You : [ Do you mean when it is red , when it is green , or when it is blue ? ]
Stranger : touch it when it is blue
You :
The corridor begins to shake .
Far ahead , to the north , you see a
shape that resembles the butler running toward you .
You :
It is riding on a cleaning robot .
Stranger : shoot the robot
You :
You shoot the robot , which grinds to halt .
You :
The butler jumps off and resumes running .
Stranger : shoot butler
You :
You shoot the butler just before he reaches you .
As he dies , he falls
onto the glowing spot ( while it is green ) .
You :
His body instantly disappears .
Stranger : check handgun to see how many bullets i have left
You :
You have 1 bullet left .
Stranger : touch the spot when it 's green
You :
You find yourself back inside the entrance room .
You :
You see the butler 's corpse on the floor ; it is soon cleared away by
the cleaning robot .
You :
You have a sense of deja vu .
Stranger : open the door , and go north until i reach the spot again
You :
You open the door and run north .
You :
The door soon closes behind you .
Stranger : touch spot when it 's red
You :
You touch the spot and suddenly become dizzy .
You :
The world becomes blurry around you , and you feel an intense pain in
your temple .
You : You faint .
You :
As you regain consciousness , you see bright colors all around you ;
you realize that you are falling down , but do not see any bottom .
Stranger : examine surroundings
You :
They are strangely familiar , and exceedingly beautiful .
You :
You try to hold on to them , but your hands pass right through the
colors .
You :
The falling soon becomes tiring .
You :
You have been falling for several minutes now .
Stranger : hmm i'm sure im not actually falling , its an illusion
Stranger : pass trough the walls of colour
You :
You feel the sensation of free fall .
You :
You are not able to maneuver while you are falling !
Stranger : look down
You : Blackness .
You :
You realize that , somehow , you are in the Mandelbrot set .
You :
You look around with a new - found appreciation .
You have always
enjoyed fractals .
You : You begin to relax .
Stranger : damn i must be on LSD
Stranger : continue
You :
You puff your pipe contentedly .
You :
You are still falling .
Stranger : wait for a few more minutes
Stranger : still falling ?
You :
You relax , and examine the self - similar patterns .
You :
You continue smoking your pipe .
Stranger : ok so im trapped in an endless loop .....
You :
You run out of tobacco in your pipe .
You :
As you clear it out with your finger , you notice a small object
inside .
Stranger : examine the small object
You :
It appears to be a camera of some sort .
Stranger : use camera ?
You :
You press the single button on top of the camera .
You :
There is a bright flash .
You : A picture comes out of it .
You :
But this picture is not of the fractal , but of your bedroom !
You :
You see yourself on the screen .
Stranger : hmm
Stranger : ...
Stranger : i'm stuck
Stranger : take another picture ?
You :
There is a bright flash .
You : Another picture comes out of the camera .
Paradoxically , the picture
is of the camera itself .
Stranger : i knew it was all an illusion !
Stranger : take a picture of my face so the bright flash will make me blind
for a second and maybe i'll wake up in my room
Stranger : ...
You : You phtograph your face .
You :
There is a bright flash , and you hear a picture coming out of the
camera .
You :
For a moment you are blind , but gradually your vision resolves .
You :
You are unfortunately still in the fractal .
You :
The picture that came out of the camera was of the corridor .
Stranger : ok can i recive a hint ?
You : Hint :
Try examining some of the items in your inventory .
Stranger : check inventory
You :
You are carrying : Your pipe ( empty ) , a book of matches , a tiny
camera , a picture of your bedroom , a picture of your camera , and a picture
of the corridor .
Stranger : examine the picture of my camera
You :
It is glowing .
Stranger : in RGB again ?
You :
It is glowing in the colors of the picture .
Stranger : touch it
You :
You touch the picture , and feel yourself disappearing ...
But you
immediately reappear at the same place .
Stranger : oh i get it
Stranger : touch the picture of the corridor
You :
You touch the picture , and feel yourself disappearing ...
You :
You reappear in the corridor .
You :
You see a broken cleaning robot .
Stranger : examine it
You :
It is the robot that you previously shot .
It has dirty boot marks on
it ; apparently the butler was outside shortly before stepping on it .
Stranger : go north but ignore the spot
You :
You continue north .
You :
The corridor goes on , and on , and on , for kilometers ...
You :
You find yourself becoming tired .
You :
You stop to rest for a while .
Stranger : keep going maybe i'll find somethng
You : You continue .
You :
The place is no longer so spotless ; in fact , it is filthy .
You :
There are large spiders crawling on the ceiling .
You :
You stop to admire the fractal nature of their legs .
Stranger : look north
You :
To your north , the spider - webs become thicker and thicker , and the
spiders more plentiful .
You : Farther on , the webs become so thick that you cannot see through
them .
Stranger : go north
Stranger : light a match
Stranger : and throw it on the webs
You :
You stop at the thick webs .
You :
You throw the match at the webs .
You :
They catch fire instantly ; they soon shrivel , as do the spiders
unfortunate enough to have been on them .
You : Beyond the webs , you see sunlight .
Stranger : yay
Stranger : north
You :
You walk outside , and take your first breath of fresh air for over 20
years .
You :
It is calming ...
You :
You look around you .
You :
The area is covered with grass , and you see tall trees .
Stranger : look at the building at my south
You :
It is large and colorful .
You :
There is a statue on its roof .
Stranger : so now i can go in any way ?
You :
You are surrounded by a thick forest ; you probably could not make
your way through the trees if you tried .
Stranger : hmm
Stranger : climb a tree and examine my suroundings
You :
The trees are completely smooth , and you are quite weak .
You :
You do not manage to climb .
Stranger : take a picture of the forest to see if it 's real
You :
You press the button in your camera .
You :
The flash is not nearly so bright in the sunlight .
You : A picture emerges ...
In it , you see your study .
Stranger : examine the picture
You :
Its glow is very faint in the sunlight .
Stranger : touch it
You :
You disappear for a moment , and then reappear in your study .
Stranger : oh wait i have to go
Stranger : sorry
Stranger : bye
It is only a matter of time before the unsolvable becomes solved .
Many scientist of ancient time thought the earth was flat with a huge water fall at the end , thus discouraged explorers from traveling the sea .
Philosophers of the early time could not explain what why a person got sick let alone what the cause of it was .
Thay only know of basic home remedies that could aliviate the symptoms and did n’t know why the remedy worked .
Today , those problems are of the past and man have solved so many dificult scientific and philosophical concepts that plagued ancient scientists .
With the solutions to old problems have brought on more dificult problems in the modern world and some day our children will solve the problems that we face today .
AIDS
If you asked Americans in the 1980s when scientists would find a cure for AIDS , most would certainly thought medicine would have figured AIDS out by now .
Though we know more about AIDS than ever , more and more red ribbons appear every year , and a cure for AIDS is nowhere in sight .
Globally , 33.2 million people are living with HIV , the retrovirus that leads to AIDS , 2.5 million of whom are children .
Currently , 68 % of those living with HIV reside in Sub-Saharan Africa .
Aside from the staggering toll in human lives , it is estimated that AIDS costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually .
Although treatments in recent years , most notably the anti-retrovirus “ cocktail ” have slowed the progression of HIV and AIDS , and significantly improved the lives of those living with the disease , scientists have been unable to develop a vaccine or cure .
Due to the cost of these drug cocktails , which are not available to many without health insurance or living below the poverty line , many health officials believe that an AIDS vaccine is the only hope of stopping the global pandemic .
Recently , bone marrow transplants have given some hope to AIDS researchers , as at least one patient was reported to have undetectable levels of HIV in his blood after he received the bone marrow of a donor suspected to be resistant to HIV .
The Theory of Everything
In the final years of his life , Albert Einstein was said to have become profoundly interested in discovery the “ Holy Grail ” of physics , the Theory of Everything ( TOE ) .
Fifty years after Einstein ’s death , physicists still racking their brains to learn if a universal TOE exists .
Ideally , a true TOE would link together all known physical phenomena .
The difficulty in tying together a TOE is that two cornerstones of physics , Einstein ’s theory of general relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics are extremely difficult to combine .
For decades , scientists have sought a theory that would reconcile four basic forces : gravity , electromagnetic force , strong nuclear energy , and weak nuclear energy .
However , with recent advances in cosmology , any TOE would most likely have to account for dark matter , dark energy , and inflationary force .
It seems the closer scientists get to understanding the universe , the father away a TOE slips .
The current mainstream TOE is the “ superstring theory , ” which posits that all matter , at its most basic level , is comprised of vibrating strands .
Recently , scientists have begun to consider that additional dimensions might assist in deriving a TOE , as multiple dimensions allow physicists to answer questions that have dogged them for decades , such as why gravity is so much weaker than other forces .
Theorizing that gravity could be leaking in to our dimension from another solves some basic problems with Einstein ’s general theory of relativity .
More than simply balancing out equations on a chalkboard , a true TOE would give scientists and unshakeable foundation upon which to heap their understanding of our universe .
Dark Matter
As it turns out , the vast majority of the universe is invisible .
This seemingly - unbelievable fact is attributable to “ dark matter , ” which accounts for approximately 75 percent of the mass in the universe .
Dark matter is hypothetical matter that scientists can neither observe nor measure , but can infer its existence due to its gravitational interactions with known matter .
This dark matter , which contains no atoms and exerts no electromagnetic energy on other matter , is known to exist because of the effects it has on the rotational speeds of galaxies , the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters , and the temperature distribution of hot gas in and between galaxies .
It is certainly alarming to suddenly discover that the universe contains large amounts of invisible matter , but this is exactly what happened when astronomers , measuring the amount of hot gas in and between galaxies , learned that clusters of galaxies contained five times more material than was expected from visible galaxies and hot gas .
This led scientists to declare that some other , invisible , “ dark ” matter made up the remainder of the material .
Now that scientists have discovered dark matter , the questions of what dark matter is , how much of it there is , and what effect it has on the universe remain to be answered .
A Better Theory of Gravity
Every school child in the world learns about gravity through the story of Sir Isaac Newton sitting under the apple tree , so one would think that the question of gravity has been long - answered by scientists .
After all , Einstein came up with his general theory of relativity way back in 1915 .
However , what many children do n’t learn in school is that the theory of gravity gives rise to almost as many questions as it solves .
For example , the theory of relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics are virtually incompatible .
Additionally , it is the theory of gravity that gives rise to the mystery of dark matter ; matter which is unobservable in the universe but inferred because of its gravitational effects on other mass .
Moreover , there is no explanation for why gravity , as a force , is so much weaker than other forces , such as electromagnetic energy .
These discrepancies make it difficult , if not impossible , for scientists to create a theory unifying all the physical laws of the universe .
When it comes to physics , there ’s no question that gravity , as we understand it , is the monkey wrench thrown into the works .
The “ WOW ! ” Signal
On August 15 , 1977 , while working on the “ big ear ” project for the Search for Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) , Dr. Jerry Ehman detected an unusually strong narrowband radio signal .
The signal , which last for 72 seconds , appeared to be non-terrestrial and originating from outside our solar system .
The signal was so striking and so similar to what scientists believed an extra- terrestrial signal would look like , that Dr. Ehman wrote the word “ WOW ! ” next to the signal on a computer printout .
Thirty years after the WOW signal , SETI has been unable to find a recurrence of the signal , though they were able to determine that the signal seemed to have originated from the Sagittarius constellation .
The question “ Are we alone in the universe ? ” is one of the most profound in our existence .
The WOW signal might possibly have given us reason to believe we are not .
Cold Fusion
The supposed discovery of cold fusion , quite literally , the creation of energy from water , in 1989 led many to speculate that the energy problems of the world had been solved and that , in the future , energy would be inexpensive and easily obtained .
However , when the claims of cold fusion , purportedly achieved Martin Fleischman and Stanley Pons , could not be replicated , many physicists declared cold fusion impossible .
Following the debunking of Fleischman and Pons ’ claims , those who continued to work on cold fusion became pariahs in the field of physics .
For decades , there was virtually no communication between those working in cold fusion and the established scientific community .
However , the global energy crisis has renewed the interest in cold fusion as an endless source of renewable energy .
In 2002 , the U.S. Navy published a report in support of cold fusion .
A 2007 symposium at MIT did not focus on whether cold fusion was real , but whether or not it could be made commercially viable .
In recent years , significant progress towards “ table - top ” energy has been made .
Without question , with the earth ’s natural resources in decline and global warming an increasing concern , the time has never been better for the resurgence of cold fusion .
Why Do We Dream ?
For thousands of years , dreams have been the muse of artists , scientists , and philosophers alike .
After so much time , it ’s surprising that scientists have yet to discover exactly why we dream .
However , as we learn more about the role sleep plays in the health and well - being of humans , the function of dreams may become increasingly clear .
Though a single , unified theory of the purpose of dreams has yet to emerge , some theories of dreams are more popular than others .
For example , the Psychoanalytic theory of dreams posits that dreams are the brains way of manifesting our unconscious feelings and desires .
The Activation - Synthesis theory holds that dreams are merely the brains way of attempting to interpret internal stimuli , emanating from the limbic system , while we sleep .
Other scientists believe that dreams are the brains attempt to interpret external stimuli or resolve problems encountered during our waking hours .
Should science ever be able to unlock the secret of how we dream and why , we may one day be able to better interpret our dreams or use dreams to further our mental and physical well - being .
Why We Age
Human beings are born with an incredible arsenal of processes which allow the body to fight off disease , repair itself , and regenerate cells .
So how is that , over a long period of time , the human body becomes so broken that it eventually ceases to live ?
Gerontologists , those who study the process of aging , have two disparate theories : the first is that the human body is pre-programmed to begin breaking down at a certain point in time .
The second theory posits that aging is the result of environmental damage heaped upon the body over an extended period of time .
Recent developments in the field of biochemistry lead scientists to believe that , one day , the human life span can be extended significantly and the quality of life during old age improved dramatically .
Consciousness
It is one of the biggest mysteries in life : how an influx of electrical impulses sent to a three - pound mass of grey tissue inside the skull gives rise to awareness , emotions , and sensations .
In other words , what gives rise to consciousness ?
While water , air , and the function of our physical bodies give rise to life , it can be said that consciousness is life itself .
To tackle this question , scientists have broken the mystery of consciousness into “ the easy problem , ” which seeks to distinguish our awareness from the mere unconscious functioning of our body .
“ The hard question , ” on the other hand , is what gives rise to a subjective experience .
More simply stated , what puts the “ I ” in “ I ? ” Many scientists believe that consciousness is simply the result of chemicals and electric impulses in the brain .
After all , once the brain stops functioning , consciousness , as we know it , ceases to exist .
Others believe that consciousness reflects something more than just the mere workings of the brain , that consciousness is evidence of a soul .
The question of consciousness is as basic to our understanding of ourselves as the question of where we came from and why we are here .
Should scientists ever be able to crack the code of consciousness , we may one day be better able to understand our place in the universe .
The Creation and Fate of the Universe
Once highly controversial , the Big Bang theory of the creation of our universe has gained acceptance in recent decades .
The theory , which holds that all matter exploded from a singularity , a microscopic , infinitesimally dense , single point , seeks to explain how , in an instant , nothingness exploded into everything .
While the Big Bang is n’t accepted by all scientists , it has evolved over the years into the mainstream theory .
But the Big Bang theory still leaves many questions unanswered .
What banged ?
How did it bang ?
Why did it bang ?
And , leaving the realm of science and delving into philosophy and religion , did someone cause it to bang ?
Equally as important as the origins of our universe is the fate our universe will eventually suffer .
If , as scientists believe , the universe is constantly expanding , galaxies , stars , and solar systems will continue to race away from each other , leaving dark , empty spaces in between .
Or perhaps there will be a sort of second Big Bang , one in which our universe is destroyed , rather than created .
One thing is certain : the question of where we came from and where we are headed has been pondered by human beings since the beginning of time .
It has forever been , and will continue to be , the most important question our species can answer .
The landscape of the world is always changing .
Geological processes like tectonism , denudation and volcanism have shaped the face of Earth as we know it over the course of billions of years .
Unfortunately , much of the natural phenomena on the planet today is transforming for the worse due to human encroachment .
Whether the effects of global warming , deforestation , urbanization or heavy tourism are to blame , the fact of the matter is that these precious gems are rapidly deteriorating right before our eyes .
The snowfield of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is quickly thawing .
Signs point to global warming .
Farming , irrigation and development are draining the water necessary to sustain the Everglades in South Florida .
Restoration plans have done little , as this landscape now covers only half of its original territory .
Rising water temperatures , which cause coral bleaching , and increasing acidity levels are gradually killing the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia .
Scientists estimate that sometime between 2030 - 2050 , the last glacier in the Swiss Alps will have melted away .
The cypress forests throughout the Atchafalaya Basin in Louisiana have been decimated to manufacture mulch .
Every year , 25 square miles of these stunning wetlands are lost forever to the sea .
Rampant tourism in the Galapagos Islands is causing more disturbance than this fragile setting can long endure .
Due to increased temperatures , the ice shelf of South Georgia Island , a region rich in wildlife , is disintegrating .
Deforestation is the leading threat to the Monteverde Cloud Forest in Costa Rica .
The clouds this region is named after are beginning to dissipate as a result , which will eventually deprive this lush landscape of the moisture it needs to thrive .
Pollution and urbanization imperil Kathmandu Valley in Nepal .
The Mexican Michoacan Mountains are being defaced by illegal deforestation .
Global warming has already claimed over two - thirds of the glaciers within the pristine boundaries of Glacier National Park in Montana .
The Dead Sea in Israel is receding at an alarming rate ( approximately three feet every year ) because its primary water source , the Jordan River , is being sucked dry by the local populace .
Rising sea levels may spell doom for Australia ’s Fraser Island .
The rainforest habitat of the island of Borneo , a territory divided between Brunei , Indonesia and Malaysia , is endangered by farming and logging .
Since 1978 , the glaciers in Alaska ’s Kenai Fjords National Park have receded about a half - mile and continue to diminish further with each passing year .
Before you book a plane ticket , keep in mind that claims of eco-tourism can be deceiving and many of these delicate settings are best left untouched .
If your heart is set on visiting these spots while you still can , visit the International Ecotourism Society , Conservation International or the Nature Conservancy for tips on how you can experience these wonders without further contributing to their ruin .

After decades of overharvesting of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay and many fruitless efforts to replenish them , scientists have re-established a significant population of the shellfish along the Virginia shore .
Researchers from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at the College of William & Mary say that large experimental reefs created five years ago are now home to more than 180 million native oysters .
That is still a far cry from the late 1880s , when the bay held billions of the oysters , Crassostrea virginica , and watermen harvested about 25 million bushels annually .
But more larvae have been settling on the new reefs every year , the researchers said .
The results , they added , suggest there is a potential for further restoration in the bay by creating additional reefs where harvesting is prohibited .
“ What we need are thousands of acres of permanently restored sanctuary reefs to turn this situation we have with the oyster around , ” said David M. Schulte , a doctoral student at the institute and an author of a paper published in Science last week that describes the work .
The sanctuaries would aid the oyster harvest by helping to seed nearby areas , but the overall effort would benefit the bay in other ways , by helping to clean the water and providing more habitat for fish , crabs and other marine life .

I love Marvel comics .
I especially love what they are trying to do movie - wise , developing a number of properties in parallel with the understanding that they ’ll merge and cross over .
Now , it seems , DC has its answer to this approach .
And what is that ?
According to the trades , they will be ramping up their development of filmic properties , all under the supervision of three top DC writers –Geoff Johns , Grant Morrison and Mary Wolfman .
Together , this dream team will help usher along a long list of new properties .
Here ’s the list of what we know to be well into the development phase :
The Losers
Jonah Hex
The Green Lantern
And some more projects that are just gearing up :
Teen Titans — Akiva Goldsman attached to write
The Flash — Charles Roven attached to produce with Dan Mazeau writing the script
Adam Strange — being produced by Leo DiCaprio ’s “ Appian Way ”
Aquaman —
Also being produced by Appian
Bizarro Superman — David Howard and Robert Gordon attached to write
Untitled Constantine Sequel
Untitled “ Green Arrow ” origin story
Super Max — prison - set “ Green Arrow ” movie
Shazam — Pete Segal attached to direct
Wonder Woman
Superman —
Always one in development
Batman —
No new movement , but Nolan ’s hit , The Dark Knight , will most certainly get a sequel
It does not , however , appear that DC has any current plans to do any crossover films or even attempt to set these movies in the same “ universe ” — as Marvel is doing .
Still , there should be at least a few titles on that list that will get any comic - to - movie fan salivating a little bit .
If I ’ve left something out , please feel free to correct me below .
Wolfenstein For Free ?
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 12th of August 2009 - 10:50 PM ]
In a stroke of what could be seen as marketing genius , or insane offerings by an over worked designer , the offer has been thrown out to get your copy of Wolfenstein paid for .
All offered by the game 's Lead Designer , Manveer Heir , over his Twitter account in the early hours of the morning on the 11th of August .
There are a few catches that go along with this , but he swears he will pay for your copy if all the requirements are met .
What would those requirements be ?
Well first be one of his followers on Twitter .
Second , Wolfenstein needs to out sell Madden 10 in the month of August , based on NPD numbers .
Third , keep a copy or some other form of proof that you bought Wolfenstein , receipt , paypal invoice , bank statement , etc .
If all of that occurs , then you will get all of your money back and get to keep the game .
Well as long as he is n't blowing smoke up everyone 's ass .
Copies for your records :
Now that you have seen it , you can decide if you want to believe it or not .
Or even if it would come to fruition at all .
Madden comes out everywhere at least four days before Wolfenstein makes it 's North America release , five before Australia , and seven before Europe .
So it will have a head start and then only about two weeks to catch up and beat the numbers for Madden .
Which is completely doable if the marketing strategy works how they plan it here .
You know , get loads of people to buy it off the shelves as quick as possible .
One other thing that makes me wonder about this , and if it will stay true to everyone who bought it before the end of the month or not is the number of people that would be getting cash back right now .
Well on the high side .
As of right now he is up to 688 followers .
Which would be around $ 41,273.12 ( USD ) to be paid back from his own pocket .
So either he is getting a great bonus if it sells well , it wo n't come from his pocket , or it'll change to the first " X " number of people will get refunded .
The number of followers are constantly rising as I type .
Revenge is not a new current in Mexico 's drug wars .
Journalists who investigate too deeply are often killed , making Mexico one of the most dangerous places to report from .
Prosecutors seeking justice often face the same fate .
But suspected members of the La Familia cartel in the state of Michoacán gave new meaning to the word over the weekend – even in hardened Mexico – after gunmen shot up police stations across the country , killing five officers and two soldiers by the time the revenge attacks were over on Saturday .
Mexican authorities say the series of assaults , among the most brazen since Mexican President Felipe Calderón launched an antidrug offensive in Mexico in December 2006 , were a direct response to the arrest of one of their alleged leaders early Saturday .
Mexico's ' Tet offensive ' ?
It was characterized as a Mexican version of the " Tet offensive " by one columnist – a turning point in a nation 's loss of faith that Mexico can come out from under the force of organized crime .
And that questioning is perhaps no greater than in Michoacán , Mr. Calderón 's home state , where his military effort began , and where a grenade was launched in a public plaza last year .
" This attack and [ the grenade incident ] are not just simply examples of gang violence .
They have a much more profound impact on the public psyche , " says Bruce Bagley , a Latin America drugs expert at the University of Miami .
" They erode confidence in Calderón 's strategy and the legitimacy of the state response . "
Brutal retaliation
Authorities told the Associated Press that the attacks were a retaliatory response to the arrest of Arnoldo Rueda Medina , believed to be a head of the La Familia cartel , on Saturday morning in Morelia , the capital of Michoacán .
Throughout that day , gunmen attacked federal police stations in seven cities across the state , as well as in Guanajuato and Guerrero states .
The following day a hotel in Michoacán , in the port city of Lazaro Cardenas , was shot into but no one was injured .
Two men have since been arrested in the attacks against government authorities , among the worst the nation has seen since Calderón sent 45,000 troops across the country to lessen the grip of organized crime that reaches into police forces , government institutions , and mountain villas across the country .
Some 11,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence since 2006 .
But even here , where beheadings and public death threats are a new norm , the weekend attacks seemed to raise the stakes .
Writing in the Milenio newspaper , columnist Ciro Gómez Leyva described the public mood : " In the war against the narcos , July 11 seems like a kind of Tet offensive , the synchronized , made - for - Hollywood offensive by the ... North Vietnamese Army that , despite being characterized as a military disaster , created the perception that the otherwise invincible US army would never win in Vietnam . "
Another blow to Calderón
The attacks over the weekend will do little to bolster Calderón 's national action party , which already fared poorly well in legislative elections last week .
" The [ drug gangs ] are demonstrating to the government that their security strategy has only limited impact , " says Mr. Bagley .
" They demonstrated that they have ongoing capacity to intimidate , coerce , and carry out violence against police despite the militarization . "
This message resounds in Michoacán , where the military has manned the streets the longest , and where La Familia has grown into one of the nation 's most powerful outfits .
" In Michoacán , they have become a force to be reckoned with , " says Bagley .

Eric Ruder looks at the lengths to which desperate Gazans -- starved and deprived by Israel 's punishing blockade -- are going in order to keep food and other necessities coming in .
ISRAEL LAUNCHED a pre-dawn wave of air strikes against a tunnel on August 10 that it said was being used by Palestinian militants to smuggle explosives into Gaza .
Israel claimed that its offensive was a reaction to the firing of rockets at the Eretz border crossing that connects Gaza and Israel .
The attack produced a ripple of headlines in newspapers around the world , but the event was notable precisely because though such strikes were once routine , they have been rare in the months since Israel carried out its December / January massacre that claimed the lives of some 1,400 Palestinians and severely damaged Gaza 's already fragile infrastructure .
However , the real story , generally ignored by mainstream reports that failed to penetrate beyond Israel 's own assertions about its motives , is the ongoing siege of Gaza , the tunnel economy that the people of Gaza now must depend on , and the daily and deadly toll of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by Israel 's siege .
In the two years since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip , Israel has imposed a suffocating blockade of a dizzying array of goods essential to subsistence .
In the month of January 2007 , more than 14,000 truckloads of goods entered Gaza , but in June 2007 , that number fell to about 5,000 .
Since then , the monthly number of truckloads entering Gaza has hovered just above 2,000 , which is less than a quarter of what Gaza needs to function normally .
A Palestinian worker is lowered into a tunnel between Gaza and Egypt. ( BTselem )
" I lived through the 1967 war , but I 've never seen days like this before , " said Souad Abrado , whose home was destroyed by Israeli bulldozers this past winter .
She and her husband now sleep on foam mattresses under a tarp next to the rubble that was once their home because they are unable to find an apartment .
The choking shortage of food , fuel , construction and medical supplies has spawned a network of hundreds of tunnels connecting the Rafah refugee camp in southern Gaza with the Egyptian border town of Rafah .
Even before Israel 's December / January offensive , some 90 percent of goods entering Gaza were smuggled through the tunnels , which are controlled by businessmen who pay the Hamas government a one - time digging fee of about $ 2,500 for each tunnel they build .
The cost of constructing and maintaining Gaza 's economy of tunnels is substantial , both in terms of money and lives .
The tunnels vary dramatically in size , cost between $ 25,000 and $ 100,000 to build , and take several weeks to complete the digging and rudimentary buttressing to keep the tunnel from collapsing on itself .
What you can do Check out the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel to find out how you can get involved in the growing movement for boycott , divestment and sanctions against Israel .
Check out Viva Palestina - US to find out about upcoming convoys to defy Israel 's siege .
Some are no more than a yard across and barely tall enough for a grown man to crawl through .
Others are wide and tall enough to walk through upright and to even accommodate the passage of livestock such as cows and goats or large automobile parts .
Most have an electric winch or some other means to raise and lower goods down the tunnel shaft , which varies in depth from 50 to 80 feet .
Some even have a winch at either end of the tunnel , which may run 1,500 to 2,500 feet underground , to pull the goods from Egypt into Gaza and the transport containers back from Gaza into Egypt .
The tunnels provide a lifeline connecting Gaza to the outside world , but they are also deadly and dangerous for the more than 5,000 Palestinians who toil underground or operate the machinery that keep the goods flowing .
In one week spanning late July and early August , 12 Palestinians died in tunnel accidents .
In one particularly gruesome episode , seven tunnel workers died when a spark ignited gasoline that had leaked from a pipe used to move the fuel through the tunnel .
It took days for five of the charred bodies to be excavated from the rubble , and two other men who suffered moderate burns had to be hospitalized .
In all , more than 150 Palestinians have been killed in tunnel accidents since the June 2007 tightening of the siege .
But in a land characterized by the collapse of industry , soaring unemployment and desperate poverty , thousands of Palestinians choose the prospect of steady employment over the daily risk of being crushed , burned or bombed on the job .
THE UNPREDICTABILITY of life and death in the tunnels is more than matched by the arbitrariness of Israel 's policy that bars some goods on some days and other goods on other days .
The seemingly random decisions by Israeli officials about what gets through and when has confounded aid agencies , businesses and transport companies .
" We 've asked them , ' Please , supply us with lists , so we know upfront , ' " says William Corcoran , president of American Near East Refugee Aid ( ANERA ) .
ANERA had been allowed to deliver medical supplies and food aid with few obstacles for most of the last eight years it has operated in Gaza - - until last November .
" [ Now , it 's ] a very cumbersome system , more complicated than it 's ever been before , " explained Corcoran .
ANERA and several other aid groups , including Save the Children , World Vision , and Mercy Corps , have repeatedly requested that Israeli officials clarify their policy but to little effect .
In March , during the closing days of the administration of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , the Israeli cabinet announced that it would allow the " unfettered " transport of food into Gaza .
But according to Sari Bashi , the executive director of Gisha , the Legal Center for the Freedom of Movement , based in Tel Aviv , this official policy is intentionally frustrated by a maze of bureaucratic obstacles that reimpose the fetters that Israel supposedly lifted .
" Even if they say all food is allowed , Israel has created an extremely onerous bureaucratic process that has made it nearly impossible to get many basic foodstuffs into Gaza , " said Bashi .
According to a May 13 report in the Christian Science Monitor :
The process includes complicated manifests of food being sent in by various aid organizations , which can be rejected at any point in the process and not always for clear reasons .
Trucks are checked , unloaded , and reloaded several times over the course of days , raising shipping costs .
In recent months , all of the following items have been rejected at one point , and later allowed in only after it became an embarrassing international issue : pasta ; lentils ; strawberry jam ; chocolate ; and halvah , a Middle Eastern sweet made of sesame .
A shipment of " reinforced nutritional bars " were turned back because low - level military officials misunderstood the manifest and thought they were steel bars , which -- like other building materials -- are not allowed into Gaza .
Even tin cans are not allowed because they could be melted down for other purposes , making it difficult for farmers in Gaza to turn vegetables into canned food that will last longer .
As a consequence , trucks full of food and aid sit , sometimes for weeks , while their cargo spoils .
In June , Egyptian authorities burned a shipment of peanuts , agricultural pesticides and medicines that had expired before Israel allowed the goods into Gaza .
Such policies have left some 80 percent of Gaza 's 1.5 million residents dependent on aid agencies for food and medicine .
" I used to buy two cartons of eggs a week , but after the war the price of one carton jumped and I stopped buying it , " said Amal Sharif , a resident of the Shati refugee camp and a mother of 10 .
" There are many things that we stopped buying completely : meat , fish , chicken .
Even the price of fruit is higher . "
Sharif has also resorted to making just two meals a day instead of three : " We eat breakfast at 11 a.m. and lunch at 5 or 6 p.m. , so no one needs to eat dinner after that . "
THE CENTRALITY of the tunnels to Gaza 's near - dead economy undermines Israel 's chief justification for maintaining its right to use air strikes along the Rafah border at will .
Israel asserts that the tunnels are used for weapons smuggling , without acknowledging that without the tunnels , Gaza would face mass starvation .
In truth , Israel recognizes that the tunnels must remain open -- precisely to keep Israeli officials from having to face international criticisms that it was literally starving the people of Gaza to death .
Thus Israel - - along with Egypt 's collaboration -- engages in a complicated dance around the tunnels , turning a blind eye at times while bombing the tunnels at other times , in order to carry out the slow but steady ( rather than fast and obvious ) strangulation of Palestinian life in Gaza .
And while Israel uses the world 's most sophisticated jet fighters and ordnance to deny food and aid to the people of Gaza and arms to Hamas , the U.S. supplies Israel with jet fighters and explosives -- all while the international community looks on .
In this context , it is understandable why the Hamas government does use some tunnels to import arms .
How else can it defend itself from Israel , which -- thanks to help from U.S. taxpayers -- possesses one of the world 's 10 most powerful militaries ?
Certainly Hamas would end its weapons smuggling -- in exchange for an agreement from the U.S. to end its massive military supplies to Israel .
Despite all the rhetoric about how Israel must bravely confront " Palestinian terrorists , " Israel has killed far more civilians through its military offensives and siege than Palestinian rocket attacks or bombings .
The truth is that the civilian toll has been five to 10 times higher on the Palestinian side for every year since 2000 .
And that only counts the number of Palestinian civilians directly killed in Israeli military strikes .
Since June 2007 alone , at least 344 Palestinians who required life - saving medical treatment that Gaza 's compromised health care system could n't provide them have died because of the Israeli siege .
Palestinians seeking health care outside Gaza are regularly denied travel permits by Israel - - or are granted permits but then still denied passage .
It 's impossible to know how many lives were unnecessarily shortened by Israel 's callous disregard for such patients .
ISRAEL ALSO bars the importation of construction materials , such as cement and steel , under the Orwellian policy of restricting the flow of so - called " dual- use equipment " -- that is , goods essential to the functioning of Gaza 's civilian infrastructure that may also have a military application .
Cement and steel , for example , could be used to build bunkers and other structures to defend military targets and are not allowed to be imported , even though they are desperately needed to rebuild more than 14,000 homes , 68 government buildings , and 31 offices of nongovernmental organizations damaged or destroyed by Israel earlier this year , according to the UN Development Program .
It should be mentioned that the U.S. used this same logic in imposing deadly sanctions against Iraq for the 12 years between its 1991 and 2003 invasions .
These sanctions killed 1 million Iraqis , half of them children under 5 , according to the United Nations .
In addition to the doublespeak of barring dual - use supplies , Israel also uses the capricious designation of " luxury items " to bar all manner of goods on any given day .
The reason ?
According to Israeli Defense Ministry spokesperson Maj. Guy Inbar , " gourmet items " are turned away because they wo n't be consumed by average Palestinians , but " by the rich and corrupt leaders of Hamas . "
But rhetorical concern for the plight of Gaza 's poverty - stricken residents does not conceal the fact that Israel , not Hamas , is responsible for the crushing siege that has plunged so many Palestinians into desperate poverty -- and created the shortages of everyday items that make for lucrative opportunities for wealthy Palestinians who own and operate the tunnels .
A bag of smuggled cement , for example , costs 10 times what a bag of cement used to .
That explains why the huge price tag associated with building a tunnel is embarked upon -- by employing cheap Palestinian labor to take advantage of the artificial shortages created by Israel 's blockade , the initial investment can be made back in a hurry .
BY MEANS of both military and economic attacks , Israel has sought to devastate Gaza 's entire economy and civilian infrastructure in order to force either total surrender on the Palestinian people or the slow but relentless strangulation of all social life .
But the people of Gaza still refuse to capitulate .
Some have begun rebuilding their houses with bricks made of mud and clay , building materials that were abandoned 50 years ago in favor of steel , brick and concrete .
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank , drawing on the example of the Black South African struggle against apartheid , have launched a boycott , divestment and sanctions movement against Israel .
And activists from around the world have responded -- building divestment campaigns as well as convoys of aid and people designed to defy the Israeli siege ( as well as challenge Egypt 's shameful collaboration in the project ) .
But the pressure in Gaza is mounting every day .
In January 2008 , two - thirds of the border wall between Gaza and Egypt was toppled by Palestinian resistance fighters .
In what can only be described as the world 's largest prison break , hundreds of thousands of Palestinians -- perhaps as many as 800,000 - - flooded into northern Egypt to stock up on supplies .
For days the border remained open , and Egyptian authorities only succeeded in sealing it after deploying riot police armed with electric batons , water cannons and live ammunition , along with hastily constructed barbed wire and chain - link fences to hold back the sea of people .
Could there be a replay of these events in the future ?
Some observers believe that discussions about how to pursue such a move are already beginning in Gaza .
In addition to the internal pressures driving Palestinian leaders toward this strategy , there are also some signs that the world beyond Gaza may look on such a development sympathetically .
In his June 4 speech in Cairo , Barack Obama acknowledged that Gaza was in the throes of a " humanitarian crisis , " and just a month later the G8 -- the group of eight of the world 's most - powerful countries -- issued a statement calling on Israel to allow for a " sustained reopening " of Gaza 's border crossings in order to facilitate the regular flow of people , food and aid .
But talk is cheap -- and without more and sustained pressure from activists , students and workers around the world , Israel , the U.S. and Egypt will continue their criminal policy of collective punishment against the people of Gaza .
Do n't let them get away with it .
Dave Perry ’s Cloud - based Gaikai system is to get a closed beta in Europe this month .
“ Over 30,000 people have already signed up to help test and many came from Europe , they were really bummed that they would be left out of our launch plans , ” said Perry , speaking in a statement you can find after the break .
“ Gaikai is all about reaching a massive audience , so we are embracing Europe right away . ”
Europe first , America next .
“ After we choose the hardware configuration in Europe , our next phase will be our USA Nationwide Network Test , that will be using 8 Tier - 1 Data Centers , getting hammered by Closed Beta testers , ” Perry added .
“ During that process , will be identifying the other data centers we need to include to blanket the USA in a low latency array .
Phase 2 of that is Europe , in exactly the same test . ”
Gaikai is a service product that allows clients to let users play or test games remotely .
The concept ’s similar to OnLive , but it ’s not a subs - based thing .
Publishers will hire Gaikai to let you play a demo without installing it , for example .

Gaikai Beta to begin in Europe
We ’ve had an amazing response to the recent blog post .
If you missed the video , it ’s here : http://www.dperry.com/archives/news/dp_blog/gaikai_-_video/
I just want everyone to know that our team ( including the contractors ) have been working extremely hard to bring the service to market in the next few months .
Progress has been incredible and I want to thank the major corporations that have circled around us and offered their support .
We have all kinds of surprises in the pipe and look forward to sharing them .
The first one is that we ’ve decided that as all three founders are European , we would start our closed beta in Europe later this month !
( Over 30,000 people have already signed up to help test and many came from Europe , they were really bummed that they would be left out of our launch plans .
Gaikai is all about reaching a massive audience , so we are embracing Europe right away . )
Our closed beta has two goals .
# 1 is to bring our servers to their knees so we can choose the final configuration before we start ordering large quantities of them .
( We think we have it worked out , but you can be certain our staff will be swapping cards and testing different processors as each day goes by . )
Goal # 2 is to test older computers .
We ’ve had lots of emails from people describing their computers and 99 % of them have ample performance .
Remember you do n’t even need a 3D card to see a 3D game run on our service .
I know this is strangely counter to what people expect , but we actually want to get plenty of basic office - grade XP machines testing so we can make sure we can reach the widest audience possible .
Just in case you ’re looking for your next career move , we ’re hiring networking experts , publisher liaison ( technical producers ) , network administrators , business development , social virality programmers , SDK programmers etc. jobs@gaikai.com is the easy way to reach us .
We also want senior marketing & sales executives at the major publishers to reach out to us , to discuss our unique business model .
After we choose the hardware configuration in Europe , our next phase will be our USA Nationwide Network Test , that will be using 8 Tier - 1 Data Centers , getting hammered by Closed Beta testers .
During that process , will be identifying the other data centers we need to include to blanket the USA in a low latency array .
Phase 2 of that is Europe , in exactly the same test .
As we have no drivers , no hardware , no install , the testers will be able to click and start playing the game they are assigned , the moment they get our email .
So how can you help ?
Just sign up , and we will ping you when it ’s your turn !
– http://www.gaikai.com/beta/
We will be contacting people one at a time , based on their location and hardware spec .
At certain times of the day , we will be inviting people in streams ( every few seconds ) , to challenge the servers .
Do n’t worry it ’s all normal , and you will get some quality time to play !
Anyway , we really appreciate the help , these next few months are going to be very exciting for our company .

Reconciling methane variations on Mars
6 August 2009

Varying methane concentrations
The Martian atmosphere is composed mainly of CO ( 95 % ) , with nitrogen and argon forming the largest contributions to the remainder .
Methane ( CH ) was discovered to be among the other trace components as reported in 2004 from observations by both the PFS instrument on board Mars Express ( Formisano et al. ) and ground based telescopes ( Krasnopolsky et al . ) .
These observations also indicated that the distribution of methane was not uniform across the planet .
More extensive measurements of the methane concentrations have confirmed that the atmospheric methane is not uniformly distributed and revealed local enhancements that also varied with the seasons on Mars ( Mumma et al. 2009 ) .
This is unexpected , because the current understanding of photochemistry in the Martian atmosphere implies an atmospheric lifetime for methane of more than 300 Earth years , which is long enough for smoothing out any local enhancements by circulation resulting in a global uniform distribution .
Observations require shorter atmospheric lifetime
Lefèvre and Forget use a 3 - D global dynamical model of the Martian atmosphere that takes into account the currently known atmospheric ( photo - ) chemical and physical processes , to study the evolution of the atmospheric methane .
With this model the only variation in methane concentrations that they initially find is the known global variation caused by the condensation - sublimation cycle of CO 2 - when CO 2 is extracted from the atmosphere by condensation at the South Pole during southern winter other atmospheric components are effectively enhanced , including methane .
To try and reproduce the recently observed local enhancement and seasonal variation of methane levels , the authors introduce a local and temporary source of methane at the position of a reported maximum ( in Syrtis Major , around 10 °N , 50°E ) .
The source is defined to be active for 60 Martian days of the Martian year , during the late northern summer .
The total amount of methane that is emitted by the source is limited to match the amount removed from the atmosphere in one Martian year .
This depends directly on the atmospheric lifetime of methane .
In the consensus model the lifetime is defined by the photochemical reactions in the atmosphere and is over 300 years .
Under these conditions , the source was found to be not strong enough to produce any detectable local enhancement of methane ( Figure 1 ) .
The authors next ran a set of simulations with varying values for the atmospheric lifetime of methane , differing from the consensus .
The total amount of methane produced by the local source was kept equal to the loss in a Martian year determined by the selected lifetime .
A shorter lifetime means methane is destroyed faster and therefore requires a stronger source to compensate .
Three types of sources were compared : a continuous source and a periodic source that was active for either 60 or 120 Martian days of a Martian year .
The combination of a decrease in the atmospheric lifetime for methane by a factor of ~600 ( from >300 Earth years to about 200 Earth days ) , plus a periodic source 600 times stronger than the one in the consensus model is required to reproduce local enhancement at the reported level in the Syrtis Major region ( Figure 2 ) .
Short lifetime implies effective sink
The much shorter lifetime implies a very efficient methane destruction mechanism .
No currently known atmospheric process that removes methane from the atmosphere is efficient enough to act as a sink with the needed capacity , without leading to conflict with observed values of other atmospheric components .
An as yet unidentified process is required .
A possibility that the authors discuss is a mechanism in which methane is oxidized at the interface with the Martian soil .
Because in this process methane is only destroyed from a limited volume close to the surface the destruction rate , however , needs to be even higher .
The derived surface lifetime for methane would be on the order of just 1 hour .
If confirmed , this would make the Martian surface an extremely harsh environment for organics to survive .

Would you Adam and Eve it ?
Cash machines in east London are offering customers the option of using the local Cockney rhyming slang to get their hands on their sausage , so to speak .
Five automated teller machines ( ATMs ) in the East End are going Cockney for three months from Monday .
While cash machines with several language options are commonplace in some countries , the chance to use rhyming slang could leave those unfamiliar with the east London lingo in a right load of Barney Rubble .
Anyone opting for Cockney rhyming slang will be asked to enter their Huckleberry Finn ( PIN ) before chosing how much sausage and mash ( cash ) they want .
Those wanting to withdraw 10 pounds will have to ask for a speckled hen , while the machine may inform users that it is contacting their rattle and tank , rather than bank .

, we show a close - up of the tracks , as well as 6 previous HiRISE views acquired since June 2007 , shortly after Opportunity ’s drive .
The span encompasses over a full Mars year , from southern spring to the following summer .
Both the grayscale images at the top of each sequence and the color below show a progressive fading of the tracks over time .
The color also shows that the tracks are initially fairly red and become bluer .
This is because the weight of the rover pushed dark granules into the relatively bright , red Martian soil .
Since then , dark sand has blown out of Victoria and partially covered the tracks , darkening the surface .
AN OBLIQUE VIEW OF VICTORIA CRATER
Victoria Crater was explored by Opportunity rover for more than a Mars year ; HiRISE images have supported surface exploration and contributed to joint scientific studies .
HiRISE stereo data were used to measure slopes and help select safe paths for the intrepid rover .
The most interesting exposures of geologic strata are in the steep walls of the crater , difficult to image from the overhead perspective of orbiting spacecraft like MRO .
However , MRO can point to the sides , and did so in this case to get a better view of layers in the west - facing and sunlit slopes of the crater .
Especially prominent is a bright band near the top of the crater wall , interpreted by some MER scientists as having formed by diagenesis ( chemical and physical changes in sediments after deposition ) .
This bright band separates the bedrock from the impact ejecta deposits of Victoria Crater .
has been rotated so that we are looking east , with MRO pointed 22 degrees east of straight down , so it is comparable to a view from an airplane window .
Colors have been enhanced to show subtle differences .

Das am Wochenende in Berlin verabschiedete Programm der Grünen für die Bundestagswahl im September spricht sich gegen Web - Sperren und Massenüberwachung aus .
" Das Internet ist oft der letzte Hort der Freiheit in den Diktaturen unserer Zeit und das einzige Tor zur freien Kommunikation " , heißt es darin zur Netz - und IT - Politik .
Bisher habe das Motto der Diskussion über die digitale Technik " verbieten und regulieren " gelautet , bemängelte Malte Spitz aus dem Bundesvorstand der Grünen .
" Wir Grüne brechen hier aus – wir sind die Internetpartei . "
Dafür spreche schon , dass man erstmals in Deutschland ein eigenes Kapitel in einem politischen Fahrplan diesem Zukunftsfeld widme .
Die Grünen lehnen die " Filterung des Datenverkehrs sowie massenhafte und unbegründete Speicherorgien wie die Vorratsdatenspeicherung strikt ab " .
Aktuelle Vorschläge zur Einführung von Filterlisten gegen Kinderpornographie und den damit befürchteten " Aufbau einer umfassenden Sperrinfrastruktur " bezeichnen sie als " rechtsstaatlich und technisch unverantwortlich " .
Die Grünen wollen eine intensivere Verfolgung von Straftaten im Cyberspace .
Dazu müssten Behörden technisch besser ausgestattet und mit Fachkräften ergänzt werden .
Bei Straftaten wie der Verbreitung von Kinderpornografie oder nationalsozialistischer Propaganda im Netz sollten die Ermittler international besser kooperieren .
Kinderpornos müssten gelöscht werden , " sobald sie bekannt sind " .
Zur Stärkung des Datenschutzes wollen die Grünen Speicherfristen auf ein Minimum verkürzen .
Ferner fordern sie ein Recht auf " umfangreiche Datenauskunft " im Internet , damit jederzeit geklärt werden könne , " welche Daten wo gespeichert sind " .
Weiter will sich die Partei für gerechte Zugangschancen für alle Menschen stark machen .
Sie fordert eine lückenlose Breitbandversorgung und ein System öffentlicher WLAN - Zugänge .
Das Ziel der " Minimierung der Strahlenbelastung " wollen sie dabei aber nicht aus den Augen verlieren .
Schadstofffreiheit , Recyclingfähigkeit und niedriger Stromverbrauch müssten als Qualitätsmerkmale moderner Elektronik gefördert werden .
meinen die Grünen .
Umwelt - und Gesundheitsschäden bei der Produktion von Handys und PCs oder neue Kohlekraftwerke für Rechenzentren dürfe es genauso wenig geben wie Elektroschrott , der auf Müllkippen in Entwicklungsländern lande .
Offene Formate , Lizenzen wie Creative Commons und Freie Software müssten stärker in Bildungseinrichtungen und in der öffentlichen Verwaltung berücksichtigt werden , weil sie kostengünstiger , energiesparender und grundsätzlich sicherer seien .
" Lasst uns unseren Kindern Linux beibringen , anstatt sie von Microsoft - Produkten abhängig zu machen " , forderte Spitz .
Forschungsergebnisse , die mit öffentlichen Geldern erzielt wurden , sollten der Öffentlichkeit auch frei zugänglich sein .
Gleiches gelte für öffentliches Wissen , das in Behörden und Archiven schlummert .
Auch beim Urheberrecht sehen die Grünen Reformbedarf .
Derzeit kriminalisiere die Medienindustrie eine unlizenzierte Nutzung geschützter Werke als " Raub " und " Piraterie " .
" Massenhafte Verfolgung " und die " Bestrafung von digitalen Privatkopien " will die Partei nicht dulden .
Pauschale Vergütungsmodelle wie eine Kulturflatrate stellten viel mehr die Zukunft für einen fairen Interessenausgleich im digitalen Raum dar .

How Much Do Protests Matter ?
A Freakonomics Quorum
Iran ’s citizens take to the streets en masse after a disputed election .
Gay men in Salt Lake City hold a kissing protest .
Members of the Westboro Baptist Church voice their anti-just - about - everything views to military funerals and elsewhere .
Beyond the media attention they inevitably garner , what do protests actually accomplish ?
We rounded up a few people who have thought a lot about this topic — Chester Crocker , Bernardine Dohrn , Donna Lieberman , Juan E. Méndez , David S. Meyer , and Howard Zinn — and asked them how much protest matters in this day and age , and why .
Here are their answers .
Howard Zinn is professor emeritus in the political science department at Boston University , and author of the book A People ’s History of the United States .
“ Testing is always a gamble , but one worth taking , because if you do n’t take the risk , you will be stuck with the status quo and I suppose we all agree : the status quo is extremely undesirable . ”
Do protests work ?
Sometimes yes , sometimes no .
Sometimes very soon , sometimes there is a long - term effect .
Sometimes you can see a direct connection between the protest and the result , and sometimes it ’s difficult to trace .
What this means is that you must not desist from protesting because you do n’t see an immediate result .
What immediately looks like a failure may turn out to be a success .
Testing is always a gamble , but one worth taking , because if you do n’t take the risk , you will be stuck with the status quo and I suppose we all agree : the status quo is extremely undesirable .
Some examples :
There was protest when the founding fathers concluded their work in drafting the Constitution in Philadelphia because there was no Bill of Rights .
With the protests threatening the successful ratification ( the vote was close in major states : New York , Massachusetts , Virginia ) the Founders agreed they would add it , and they did in 1791 .
The anti-slavery movement had to keep protesting for decades , from the 1830 ’s to the early 1860 ’s , until it had an effect on Lincoln and the Congress , first with the Emancipation Proclamation , then with the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments to the Constitution .
The nation - wide strikes in the 1880 ’s resulted in winning the eight - hour work day in many places .
The demands of the Populist movement resulted in regulatory legislation in various states and resulted in national reforms years later in the New Deal measures to help farmers .
The sit - down strikes of 1936 to 1937 led to recognition of the C.I.O. unions and contracts and better wages and conditions .
The wave of protests in the early 1930 ’s — by the Unemployed Councils blocking evictions ; by the Tenants of organizations winning rent control in the Bronx , for instance , but also other places — led to the New Deal measures that helped the poor .
The various protests against racial segregation , taking various forms , are well known — the Montgomery bus boycott , the sit-ins , the various demonstrations in the South — and all led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and various Supreme Court decisions that effectively ended legal racial segregation in the South .
The protests against the Vietnam War certainly helped Lyndon Johnson come to his conclusion in early 1968 that he would not run for president again , that he would begin negotiating with the North Vietnamese , and that he would not send more troops to Vietnam as General Westmoreland had requested .
The protests of G.I. ’s during the Vietnam War — desertions , fragging , public disclosure of massacres — helped build public opinion against the war ; and if you study the Pentagon Papers you will see how often the officials in Washington worried about public opinion , and why Nixon promised an end to the war , though it took years .
After the Vietnam - Watergate era , the protests of disabled people certainly led to the Disabled Persons Rights Act .
The feminist movement of the 1960 ’s and 1970s undoubtedly led to affirmative action for women , moving more women into better positions in the economy .
There is much more historical evidence , but I am running out of space and time .

Previously , he served as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs and chaired the board of the United States Institute of Peace .
“ Saying that they matter is not the same thing as saying their results are always or principally positive . ”
History demonstrates the relevance and impact of protest actions .
For some societies , protest events punctuate their histories like milestones .
The short answer is , they matter .
The more interesting questions are why and in what circumstances .
But saying that they matter is not the same thing as saying their results are always or principally positive .
Why do they matter ?
Protests have the potential to have impact on the varied audiences toward which they are directed .
They can become part of a mass mobilization campaign , literally altering a society ’s inner balance and subverting the coherence and esprit of the authorities .
They can place a vulnerable regime on the defensive in the eyes of citizens and at the same time weaken its bases of external support .
In a word , protest when conducted skillfully , can undercut a government ’s inner sense of rectitude and its perceived legitimacy .
Protests of this nature have shaped events in India , the Philippines , South Africa , Ukraine , Serbia , Lebanon , Bolivia , Russia , and other places over the last 100 years .
Not all protests have such sweeping goals .
Protests can be targeted tactically in order to achieve a specific shift in policy , to create pressure for remedies or reforms , and to achieve such goals as prisoner releases , the recognition of the rights of aggrieved groups , or the winding down of a war .
When do protests work ?
To generalize , protests are most likely to be effective in one of three circumstances : a ) in political - social systems that already recognize civil rights and political liberties ( including freedom of the press ) and those that profess adherence to such norms ; b ) by contrast , in autocratic systems that have become too brittle to adapt and whose security services may have become divided , demoralized , or unreliable agents of repression ; and c ) in weak , newly democratic systems where official legitimacy exists in the formal sense but lacks the deep social roots necessary to stand up to “ street power ” demagoguery .
Protests are also more likely to work when a ) led by skillful political activists and organizers who understand how to manipulate public opinion and b ) targeted at concrete rather than abstract ideological goals .
The odds of using protest to stop the building of a dam are obviously better than mounting protests to achieve extra-constitutional regime change .
And the prospects are not static : information technology and social networking are literally changing the protest landscape as these words are written .
Are protests a good thing ?
The short answer — and it is not a cop -out — is that it depends .
Street power can get out of hand and subvert the democratic process .
Under some conditions , protests can weaken a tottering autocrat and create a vacuum that is exploited by extremists , fascists , or other lowlifes .
But protests can also achieve miracles large and small , moving a nation to greater things .

She was a former leader of the anti-Vietnam War organization the Weather Underground .
“ So we have to act as we can , and then doubt whether we are fully right and effective , and then act again . ”
Imagine our world without the differing protests of Henry David Thoreau and Harriet Tubman , Wounded Knee and Tien an Mien , Soweto and Stonewall .
Where would we be without the persistence of Ida B. Wells ‘s anti-lynching campaign and the quiet radical nurturing of Ella Baker who taught the reciprocity of community organizing ?
Do n’t forget the transformative work of those who risked their lives and the safety of their families to serve as an invisible station on the underground railroad or the flamboyant truth - telling of Vietnam vets against the war who threw their medals back at the warmakers four decades ago and still continue to repair the harm .
Let ’s recall those in wheelchairs blanketing the steps of the Capitol building for dignity and access for the disabled , and the still - clandestine leakers who exposed the torture memos and the illegal actions they legitimized .
The secret is that protest encompasses acts that are individual and collective , literary and rousing , pathetic and transcendent — and we do n’t know until later whether it made a difference .
So acting against injustice or pointing toward solidarity has an existential quality ; it must be done to object to a mighty wrong — to not be part of the problem .
Looking backward , it seems obvious that sitting down to strike at Flint , and sitting in at Greensboro lunch counters , and standing up to enter school in Little Rock were obvious sparks to larger social movements .
At the time , no one could know .
Surely speaking up when our upbringing encourages being polite can be the most courageous form of dissent .
How many men or boys interrupt the hateful locker room banter about women and girls and queers ?
When do white people reject the invisible privileges that insulate us from the pain of structural inequality ?
Why is it so popular to admire dissidents in other countries but succumb to the social pressure to go along with homelessness , mass incarceration , and Katrina displacement at home ?
And yet it is hardly obvious how to object and also be heard .
Clearly comedy and humor open doors where earnest entreaty fails .
And the art of Frida Kahlo , Diego Rivera , Audre Lourde , and Tony Kushner opens eyes and encourages the ethical longings of others .
I do n’t think we know what it takes for a walkout or teach - in or musical performance to simultaneously expose tyranny , enlighten , give heart , educate , recruit allies , and forge connections .
So we have to act as we can , and then doubt whether we are fully right and effective , and then act again .
Without our protesting ancestors , we ’d still be burning witches at the stake .

“ When activists make progress , it ’s always less than what they want . ”
Protests can matter a great deal , but not by themselves , and often not in ways activists intend .
When King George learned that colonists had dressed as Indians to throw discounted tea into the Boston Harbor , one of many acts of resistance , he saw his empire unraveling and responded harshly .
Repression spurred further protests — and ultimately , America .
Latter - day tea partiers have yet to take similar risks or demonstrate comparable commitment .
A protest is a signal about who you are , what you want , and what else you might do .
A former White House adviser can write an op - ed against a planned war and create a stir ; less prominent citizens need to do something more dramatic to win attention for their views , demonstrating at the Capitol or trespassing at a military base .
What you do reflects who you are and what you want .
Poor people may march on Washington , but rich people usually have other ways of getting their messages across .
When people protest , they tell authorities that they ’re unhappy about something , and implicitly threaten to do more than protest : vote , contribute money , lobby , set up a picket , blockade a clinic , or try to blow up a building .
Opponents and allies in government make judgments about how strong and widely held demonstrators ’ grievances are .
Demonstrators can force leaders to explain , again and again , what they ’re doing and why .
Sometimes , in crafting responses , governments change their policies .
The Reagan administration , for example , offered new arms control proposals to the Soviet Union in the wake of massive antinuclear demonstrations .
Gorbachev seized upon them , and history unfolded .
Demonstrators can stiffen the spine of would - be allies in government , suggesting there might be advantages in pressing for new positions on climate change , abortion , or gay marriage .
No savvy politician will admit to changing direction in response to demonstrations in the street , but of course , it happens all the time .
When activists make progress , it ’s always less than what they want .
The antiwar movement in the Vietnam era ultimately ended the draft , but the war dragged on .
Immigrant rights and anti-immigration demonstrators stopped their opponents in 2005 , battling to a stalemate that frustrated everyone .
People do n’t generally take to the streets looking for smaller reforms , but often it ’s only by asking for more that they get anything .
Demonstrators also signal to other citizens who might share their views that they are not alone , that things could be otherwise , and that they might be able to do something about it .
The large national event that receives coverage in The New York Times reflects hundreds of smaller , less - visible actions and meetings in church basements and living rooms around the country , as people develop the temerity to think they can change the world .
Sometimes they can .

“ In highly complex societies , powerful special interests have such access to , and even control of , levers of power that against them street protest looks — and most often is — quite futile . ”
It is easy to think that the technological advances in communications and information have made street demonstrations useless as a means to influence policy or obtain change .
In highly complex societies , powerful special interests have such access to , and even control of , levers of power that against them street protest looks — and most often is — quite futile .
Celebrities embracing certain causes often seem more effective in pushing them than anonymous protesters joining to support their common interests .
But what would you do if you were an Iranian whose vote was outrageously stolen by Ahmadinejad ‘s and Khamenei ‘s massive fraud ?
A letter to the editor , lobbying a legislator , or an interview on prime time television are not available if you are a Zimbabwean fed up with Mugabe .
Even at the international decision - making level , one suspects that the “ international community ” would quietly turn to more urgent matters if we thought that Darfurians were accepting their fate and acquiescing on Al Bashir ‘s designs for them .
For the billions of powerless in today ’s world , protest is the only way to have their voices heard .
That is why international human rights law places a very high premium on freedom of speech , association , and assembly , all of them broadly understood .
Vibrant , live democracies are those where all citizens believe they have a stake in the outcomes and consequently feel compelled to voice their opinions through the vehicles available to them .
It is no wonder that the politics of protest are livelier in countries that are emerging from tyranny .
What does protest achieve ?
The agenda of protesters must be such that can be achieved through genuine debate in a democratic society .
At the same time , rarely if ever is that agenda adopted in full the way protesters envision it ; and rightly so , because policy is formulated through the interaction of many opinions and not as a result of pressure .
Often , protest is a way of preventing some policy option that is considered unfair , and frequently the option is at least modified in view of the protest .
So demonstrations may never completely succeed in achieving the goals of the demonstrators ; they succeed in allowing them to participate in the process of policy formulation and decision - making , and participation is the democratic ideal .
Undoubtedly , protest must abide by rules of peaceful coexistence and reasonable regulation .
Farmers in Argentina had every right to protest against export taxes ( whether the taxes were fair or unfair in the overall context is another matter ) ; but they had no right to block highways and impede the access of food products to the markets .
Protests should indeed grow in frequency and intensity as necessary , even to the point of bringing down a repressive or unrepresentative government ; but they must stop short of forcing a duly elected leader from office .
Just as there is a threshold of “ legitimacy of exercise ” that should be demanded of elected leaders , so also demonstrators must exercise their freedoms of speech and assembly within the constraints of legitimacy of both means and ends .
Ultimately , protest works if it intelligently combines speech with action and a genuine attempt to persuade rather than simply antagonize .
Under such premises , protest will continue to be a viable , indispensable ingredient of democracy for generations to come .

“ The test of our democracy is the protection we offer not to the protests we like , but how we treat those we find offensive . ”
Recession ?
What recession ?
This is a depression .
No it 's not the great depression , but this is no ordinary recession as measured by housing , jobs , the stock market , the CPI , auto sales , and now federal tax revenues .
Inquiring minds note Federal Tax Revenues Plummet Most Since 1932 .
The recession is starving the government of tax revenue , just as the president and Congress are piling a major expansion of health care and other programs on the nation 's plate and struggling to find money to pay the tab .
The numbers could hardly be more stark :
Tax receipts are on pace to drop 18 percent this year , the biggest single - year decline since the Great Depression , while the federal deficit balloons to a record $ 1.8 trillion .
Other figures in an Associated Press analysis underscore the recession 's impact : Individual income tax receipts are down 22 percent from a year ago .
Corporate income taxes are down 57 percent .
Social Security tax receipts could drop for only the second time since 1940 , and Medicare taxes are on pace to drop for only the third time ever .
The last time the government 's revenues were this bleak , the year was 1932 in the midst of the Depression .
In May the government 's best estimate was that Social Security would start to pay out more money than it receives in taxes in 2016 , and that the fund would be depleted in 2037 unless changes are enacted .
Some experts think the sour economy has made those numbers outdated .
" You could easily move that number up three or four years , then you 're talking about 2013 , and that 's not very far off , " said Kent Smetters , associate professor of insurance and risk management at the University of Pennsylvania .
The government 's projections included best and worst - case scenarios .
Under the worst , Social Security would start to pay out more money than it received in taxes in 2013 , and the fund would be depleted in 2029 .
The fund 's trustees are still confident the solvency dates are within the range of the worst - case scenario , said Jason Fichtner , the Social Security Administration 's acting deputy commissioner .
" We 're not outside our boundaries yet , " Fichtner said .
" As the recovery comes , we 'll see how that plays out . "
President Barack Obama has said he wants to tackle Social Security next year , after he clears an already crowded agenda that includes overhauling health care , addressing climate change and imposing new regulations on financial companies .
Social Security Fund ?
What Fund ?
Reason For Revenue Plunge
In short , the bottom may be in , but lock up those party hats because most will not see it in terms of jobs , wages , home prices , and the stock market .
From many angles , the most likely scenario is a " Recoveryless Recovery " .
Downward Spiral In Jobs Continues
Alabama 's debt - ridden Jefferson County laid off about two - thirds of its 3,600 employees on Monday because of plummeting revenues , a move that will sharply curtail services in areas ranging from roads to courthouses .
Jefferson County has been forced to make drastic cuts because of a lawsuit questioning the legality of a county occupational tax , which raised $ 78 million annually and was vital to the county 's operation .
Although the revenue is still being collected , it is being held in escrow under orders from an Alabama Supreme Court justice pending a decision on the tax case .
Some members of the state Legislature hope to pass a new tax bill this month to raise revenue for Jefferson County .
" Recoveryless Recovery "
US drone attack may have killed bin Laden ’s son
Osama bin Laden ’s son Saad may have been killed by a U.S. drone attack in Pakistan earlier this year , the National Public Radio reported on its website .
Saad , believed to be in his late 20s , lived in Iran for several years and had gone to Pakistan .
The broadcaster quoted a senior U.S. counter - terrorism official as saying American spy agencies were “ 80 to 85 percent ” certain that the al Qaeda boss ’s son was dead .
According to details , Saad was not important enough to be targeted himself but was “ in the wrong place at the wrong time ” .
It ’s not immediately known whether he was with his father during the attack .
Meanwhile , a Pakistani intelligence officer has dismissed the report , saying it was “ rubbish . ”
“ There is no proof of Saad bin Laden ’s death , ” CBS News quoted the official as saying .
“ Let ’s not forget , such claims have been made before . ”

The conversations I have had recently with senior civil servants , advisers and Labour ministers have often had a plaintive tone .
Why , these people want to know , are n't the electorate more grateful for what 's been done for them ?
Where 's the political reward for all the money spent on schools and hospitals and economic regeneration ?
Why does n't the country appreciate the fall in crime figures ?
How could voters be flirting with the cost - cutting Conservatives , when Labour 's statistics show that spending money produces measurable and improved results ?
These sound like the right questions , but they are n't .
What the questioners really mean is not " Where did we go wrong ? " but " What 's wrong with all of you ? "
And what 's wrong with us is that we 're not the automatons New Labour thought we were .
We 're not remote and dispassionate observers of our society , making cool calculations about its success or failure on the basis of government - generated numbers .
We 're complicated , vulnerable , emotional creatures , and we live with the consequences of official decision - making every day of our lives .
What matters to us are n't the figures we 're fed , or the targets that get hit , but what the experience feels like to us .
Yet that part of the process has been almost completely neglected in official eyes .
Take the NHS .
As Labour keeps reiterating , spending on health has trebled in 10 years .
True , waiting lists have been cut , hospitals rebuilt , medical staff who might have gone elsewhere retained .
But those things are only a part of what we value about a health service .
At its essence , what we most want is care and concern , and those qualities are no longer a priority for the NHS .
Filling in forms , keeping records and manipulating targets have become the explicit focus of staff concerns , and often patients are left brutally aware that their own wellbeing is the last thing on anyone 's mind .
In the past few months no one I know who has been in hospital has left without feeling distressed by the levels of incompetence and indifference among the staff .
An elderly stroke victim was left weeping by the steadfast refusal of the night agency staff to bring him a bedpan or turn him at nights .
The wife of a cancer patient says that , if she had not been by her husband 's side over the past year , there would have been many occasions when he would have died , because drips had run out , or medicines had been forgotten , or the wrong ones prescribed .
An 80 - year - old with a hip replacement was discharged on a Friday night into the care of her blind and demented husband , because the hospital staff did n't think it their business to arrange or notify anyone of her need for aftercare .
These people do n't emerge from the system thinking how brilliant and well resourced it is .
They come out grateful for having survived it , and conscious of how anxious and threatened they felt within it .
They care less about gleaming new buildings than about the human relationships that take place within them – and those have been made less warm , less good and less likely to flourish precisely because of the reforms that Labour has pursued .
Our disillusionment with education has the same roots .
The chief business of schools is no longer to produce educated people , but education statistics .
For the first few years of Labour , the vast majority of the population could be impressed by those .
But as more children went into the system , and more school - leavers emerged from it , the faster it became apparent to parents , students , employers and universities that there was a disastrous mismatch between the claims made by the figures and the reality of bored stressed and puzzlingly under - educated teenagers emerging from it .
Every part of the state has been obliged to participate in this culture , and has had its priorities skewed by it .
This week Jan Berry , the senior policewoman the government appointed to look at how bureaucracy had affected the police , talked despairingly of how the police had become slaves to statistics .
She said that producing and recording the official figures had now " become more important than investigation and resolving crime - related problems " .
Many of us already know that .
We know it because we 've experienced the police 's lack of interest in a crime that 's unlikely to be solved , or that wo n't count towards their targets .
It 's why we do n't believe the crime figures .
Bike thefts , assaults on teenagers , handbag snatchings or muggings outside street - crime priority areas are all too frequently ignored .
This year we discovered that one of the principal reasons a cab - driving serial rapist in London was left free to attack women for so long was that sexual assaults , unlike car crime , did n't feature on the Home Office priority lists .
Berry is pleading for a change in the embedded culture , and for a return to problem - solving as a priority .
Doing so , though , would involve a reversal and recantation of every assumption that this Labour government has made about how to run the state .
It thought it was being modern and innovative by treating the country as if it were a business , where all outcomes could be measured by putting money in and getting targets out .
It made the false assumption that building a school or a sports complex was automatically an investment , just as it would be if the government were in the business of mechanising chicken factories or building car plants .
It thought it could close police stations or post offices in the name of cost - cutting , with as little effect as if it were Coffee Republic shutting down some unprofitable shops .
It did n't stop to remember that the business of all public services is dealing with the needs of people , and that those are never just mechanical , but social and emotional too .
Governments cannot afford to take a business 's narrow and mechanistic view of people 's requirements , because it 's not just a collection of service providers .
A government 's wider duty is to frame and structure the society in which we live .
Rebuilding society was one of Labour 's explicit aims , in contrast to Mrs Thatcher 's infamous reference to there being no such thing .
Yet our encounters with the state are profoundly important in shaping our culture , and every time we run up against the wooden indifference , public lies or robotic responses of officialdom we shrink into ourselves , and the bonds between all of us are weakened a little more .
Labour thought that what we prized above all else was economic efficiency .
Clumsily , it tried to give it to us and , even when the evidence showed it was n't delivering , it went on attempting to give us statistics instead .
But the priorities were wrong .
What we all prize in our encounters with others is a sense of our value .
We are social animals , alarmed by the uncertain world in which we live , with a profound need to be recognised , respected and responded to .
We want public services to respond to us as people , and to give us the sense that we matter .
It is the deepest human need , and yet this government has been oblivious to it .
When it wonders why we 're not grateful to it , the answer 's really simple .
It 's the experience , stupid .

Quotations
The reason death sticks so closely to life is n't biological necessity — it 's envy .
Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it , a jealous , possessive love that grabs at what it can .
But life leaps over oblivion lightly , losing only a thing or two of no importance , and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud .
Evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out .
The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart .
I know what you want .
You want a story that wo n't surprise you .
That will confirm what you already know .
That wo n't make you see higher or further or differently .
You want a flat story .
An immobile story .
You want dry , yeastless factuality .
Animals in the wild lead lives of compulsion and necessity within an unforgiving social hierarchy in an environment where the supply of fear is high and the supply of food is low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites forever endured .
If you take two steps toward God , God runs toward you show all 10 items )
Only death consistently excites your emotions , whether contemplating it when life is safe and stale , or fleeing it when life is threatened and precious .
It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw , but agnostics .
Doubt is useful for a while …
[ S ] urely we are … permitted doubt .
But we must move on .
To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation
We commonly say in the trade that the most dangerous animal in a zoo is Man .
In a general way we mean how our species ' excessive predatoriness has made the entire planet our prey .
More specifically , we have in mind the people who feed fishhooks to the otters , razors to the bears , apples with small nails in them to the elephants and hardware variations on the theme : ballpoint pens , paper clips , safety pins , rubber bands , combs , coffee spoons , horseshoes , pieces of broken glass , rings , brooches and other jewellery ( and not just cheap plastic bangles : gold wedding bands , too ) , drinking straws , plastic cutlery , ping - pong balls , tennis balls and so on .
The obituary of zoo animals that have died from being fed foreign bodies would include gorillas , bison , storks , rheas , ostriches , seals , sea lions , big cats , bears , camels , elephants , monkeys , and most every variety of deer , ruminant and songbird .
Among zookeepers , Goliath 's death is famous ; he was a bull elephant seal , great big venerable beast to two tons , star of his European zoo , loved by all visitors .

Tomorrow , August 6th , marks 64 years since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima , Japan by the United States at the end of World War II .
Targeted for military reasons and for its terrain ( flat for easier assessment of the aftermath ) , Hiroshima was home to approximately 250,000 people at the time of the bombing .
The U.S. B - 29 Superfortress bomber " Enola Gay " took off from Tinian Island very early on the morning of August 6th , carrying a single 4,000 kg ( 8,900 lb ) uranium bomb codenamed " Little Boy " .
At 8:15 am , Little Boy was dropped from 9,400 m ( 31,000 ft ) above the city , freefalling for 57 seconds while a complicated series of fuse triggers looked for a target height of 600 m ( 2,000 ft ) above the ground .
At the moment of detonation , a small explosive initiated a super - critical mass in 64 kg ( 141 lbs ) of uranium .
Of that 64 kg , only .7 kg ( 1.5 lbs ) underwent fission , and of that mass , only 600 milligrams was converted into energy - an explosive energy that seared everything within a few miles , flattened the city below with a massive shockwave , set off a raging firestorm and bathed every living thing in deadly radiation .
Nearly 70,000 people are believed to have been killed immediately , with possibly another 70,000 survivors dying of injuries and radiation exposure by 1950 .
Today , Hiroshima houses a Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum near ground zero , promoting a hope to end the existence of all nuclear weapons .

So what 's the big deal ?
Well take a look at the picture to the right ...
Do you notice anything " wrong " ?
If you said the coffee should be pouring all over the counter you 're right !
The Clever is a neat little device that steeps the coffee until you place the whole dripper on a cup .
The cup triggers a valve to open allowing the coffee to pour into the cup .
In theory it should have many of the benefits of french press coffee with a much cleaner cup !
Does that make sense ?
Ok I 'll explain
The coffee steeps like a french press ( coffee sits in hot water ) , and then is drained through a fine paper filter which will get all the silt and stuff !
In Practice : Yesterday we ( Yesterday we ( Jim Saborio and I ) brewed up some Kenya Kiambu Ndumberi Peaberry with the clever .
1) We pre-wet the filter in the clever
2 ) We ground 20g of coffee at a very course setting ... near french press and added it to the filter
3 ) We poured 12 oz of hot water over the grounds
4 ) We covered the filter with a plate ( this step helps quite a bit ) to keep in heat and stuff
5 ) We let it sit for 2 minute then fold coffee
6 ) we let coffee sit for another minute and a half ( 3:30 minutes of steeping total )
7 ) we put the dripper on a mug and let the coffee drain out ( to stop flow you can just take the dripper back off !
neato )
In the cup
I got a ton of lemon tones ( expected ) and tomato tones ( not expected ) and not too many other bright tones ( I was looking forward to the strawberry and other berry tones it's " supposed to have " )
The brightness seems muted and the coffee does n't have a ton of body
For some reason the citric acid is coming through strongly , but the phosphoric acids which are notorious in Kenyans are n't coming through at all ...
If anyone knows the answer to this riddle let me know !
UPDATE : THIS is a great way to make coffee .
All in all a fun toy , but I do n't understand the hype yet ... perhaps in time I will get all the parameters right !
UPDATE : THIS is a great way to make coffee .

This week I finally got my hands on the Clever Coffee Dripper .
Sweet Maria 's has been going gaga over this thing .
Nick Cho ( of Murky Fame ) is also apparently using the brewer .
A Dallas police officer has been given a one - day suspension for violating agency policy in an accident that killed a 10 - year - old bicyclist .
While responding to a disturbance call without starting his lights and sirens , Sr. Cpl. Michael Vaughn sped around a short curve and struck Cole Berardi as he tried to cross the poorly lit road on Oct. 17 , 2008 .
The officers attempted to revive the boy but were unsuccessful .
Police spokesperson , Lt. Vernon
Hale , described the officers as " distraught " after Berardi died from his injuries .
" It was just a dark road , not well lit , " said Lt. Vernon Hale , a Dallas police spokesman , after the accident .
" This sounds like a combination of factors " that caused the accident .
According to a decision reached in a disciplinary hearing Thursday night , Police Chief David Kunkle said Vaughn will be suspended for one day for violating the policy on using lights and sirens .
Vaughn also faces additional discipline .
An officer driving a second car which was following Vaughn's , Michael Litz , received a one - day suspension for the same violation .
Cole 's family said the boy died doing what he loved most .
" He loved to be on his bike , loved it so much .
That 's part of what makes this so horrible , " said Eva Havens , Berardi 's aunt .
" We understand that it was ( his ) time to go , and we know that wherever he is , he 's safe and he 's happy . "
Vaughn , who has been with the Dallas Police Department since October 2003 , was placed on standard paid administrative leave during the course of the investigation into the crash .

A Veriï¬ed Compiler for an Impure Functional Language
We present a veriï¬ed compiler to an idealized assembly language from a small , untyped functional language with mutable references and exceptions .
The compiler is programmed in the Coq proof assistant and has a proof of total correctness with respect to big - step operational semantics for the source and target languages .
Compilation is staged and includes standard phases like translation to continuation - passing style and closure conversion , as well as a common subexpression elimination optimization .
In this work , our focus has been on discovering and using techniques that make our proofs easy to engineer and maintain .
While most programming language work with proof assistants uses very manual proof styles , all of our proofs are implemented as adaptive programs in Coqâ€™s tactic language , making it possible to reuse proofs unchanged as new language features are added .
In this paper , we focus especially on phases of compilation that rearrange the structure of syntax with nested variable binders .
That aspect has been a key challenge area in past compiler veriï¬cation projects , with much more effort expended in the statement and proof of binder - related lemmas than is found in standard pencil - and - paper proofs .
We show how to exploit the representation technique of parametric higher - order abstract syntax to avoid the need to prove any of the usual lemmas about binder manipulation , often leading to proofs that are actually shorter than their pencil - and - paper analogues .
Our strategy is based on a new approach to encoding operational semantics which delegates all concerns about substitution to the meta language , without using features incompatible with general - purpose type theories like Coqâ€™s logic .

Yesterday on three separate reports Fox News , its various anchors and reporters told viewers that Rep. Eric Massa , talking with progressives last week at Netroots Nation , had told them he 's " vote against the interests of his district " in order to support the single - payer option on health - care reform .
They were , of course , distorting .
Massa did at first say he'd vote against his constituents ' interests when what he clearly meant was that he'd vote against their popular opinion if that meant protecting their best interests .
And he quickly corrected himself to say that .
What the Fox crew was counting on was their ability to confuse viewers over the difference between voting for the popular wishes of one 's district and its actual wishes .
What Massa said -- quite clearly -- was that he would vote for the public option even if his constituents had the opposite opinion , precisely because it would be in their best interests .
This meme actually originated in the Washington Times , which characterized it the same as Fox : " Rep. Massa : I will vote against the interests of my district . "
But look at what Massa actually said :
MASSA : I will vote for the single payer bill .
PARTICIPANT : Even if it meant you were being voted out of office ?
MASSA : I will vote adamantly against the interests of my district if I actually think what I am doing is going to be helpful .
PARTICIPANT : You 'd vote against their interests , or their opinion ?
MASSA : I will vote against their opinion if I actually believe it will help them .
Digby posted about Massa 's position the other day :
North Korea ’s surprise “ special pardon ” of two American television journalists today may have reopened the channels of communication between the Obama administration and the secretive regime that for years has defied the world with its nuclear tests and political bombast .
After a whirlwind 24 - hour visit that capped months of quiet diplomatic negotiations , former President Bill Clinton left Pyongyang on a private jet with the reporters after his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , according to a spokesman for Clinton .
“ President Clinton has safely left North Korea with Laura Ling and Euna Lee , ” Matt McKenna said in a statement .
“ They are en route to Los Angeles , where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families . ”
Early today , television video showed the journalists , dressed in short - sleeved shirts , jeans and sneakers , shaking hands with Clinton as they climbed aboard the plane .

The two women were “ enormously relieved and seemingly in very good health , ” a senior administration official said in a briefing .
The North ’s Central Korean News Agency reported that Clinton “ expressed thanks [ for the pardon ] and delivered an oral message from Barack Obama on improving relations between the two countries . ”
It added that Clinton “ delivered a sincere request from the U.S. government for a pardon and return [ of the two journalists ] from a humanitarian aspect . ”
In Washington , reaction from conservatives was generally muted .
Democratic lawmakers heaped praise on the White House , even as administration officials said that Clinton made the trip as a private citizen .

Ling and Lee were on assignment for San Francisco - based Current TV in March when they were arrested by North Korean border guards .
They later were sentenced to 12 years in prison for illegally entering the repressive state .
Reached at her home in Los Angeles , Ling ’s sister Lisa Ling said the extended families of both reporters were together Tuesday and were keeping in close contact with U.S. State Department officials regarding Clinton ’s progress .
“ We are beside ourselves , ” Lisa Ling said of the release .
“ We are beyond thrilled and so excited that we will finally be able to hold them in our arms . ”
She called the long weeks since her sister ’s arrest in North Korea “ the most unpredictable challenging 4 1/2 months of our lives . ”

U.S. officials said Clinton ’s trip was a high - stakes move .
The North Koreans , eager to have their importance acknowledged , were pleased by the idea of a visit from the former leader of the free world .
The plan was to give them , with the visit , “ a gesture of respect -- but that ’s all .
No money , no flowery words , ” said a person familiar with the negotiations , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the diplomacy .
He said the administration also intends to continue trying to ratchet up pressure on North Korea in response to recent nuclear tests and missile launchings that the United States and allies consider illegal .
U.S. officials have tried to enlist other nations , especially in Asia , to close down North Korea ’s nuclear and missile trade , and to try to cut the nation off from international financing to support that trade .

Clinton ’s mission risked domestic criticism that the administration was rewarding one of the world ’s worst weapons proliferators , a country that has repeatedly broken promises to the United States and its allies .
Some congressional Republican aides said it was difficult to judge the mission until it was clear what promises , if any , Clinton had made to Kim , and what the administration might give the North Koreans to try to resume talks .
Reaction to Clinton ’s trip seemed to run along partisan lines .
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) applauded North Korea ’s gesture and praised President Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband , Bill Clinton , “ for their quiet but persistent diplomacy , which made this day a reality . ”
Advertisement
However , John R. Bolton , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Bush administration , condemned the “ significant propaganda victory for North Korea , whether or not he carried an official message from Obama .
“ Despite decades of bipartisan U.S. rhetoric about not negotiating with terrorists for the release of hostages , it seems that the Obama administration not only chose to negotiate , but to send a former president to do so , ” he wrote in a Washington Post column .
Other U.S. experts said the mission may not greatly improve the chances of North Korean cooperation on disarmament , but did n’t cost the administration much , either .
Charles L. Pritchard , a former U.S. negotiator with North Korea , said it made sense for the United States to try to use direct talks with the North Koreans to nudge them back to group talks .

“ It ’s always worth trying , until you receive irrefutable information that it ’s not going to work , ” said Pritchard , who is now president of the Washington - based Korea Economic Institute .
“ If the answer is ‘ no ’ from the North Koreans , then you do n’t proceed . ”
The American gesture is likely to please the Chinese , who are the administration ’s most important partner on the North Korea issue because they have more leverage than any other country with the regime in Pyongyang .
Chinese officials have repeatedly urged the administration to try to restart the talks .
Bill Clinton is the highest - profile U.S. official to visit North Korea in nearly a decade .
The former president ’s trip thrust him into intense publicity that temporarily overshadowed his wife .
The secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , who has been trying to raise her public profile after being sidelined for a month by a broken elbow , was in Africa on Tuesday beginning an 11 - day trip .

In South Korea , analysts said they hoped Bill Clinton ’s visit was a first diplomatic domino whose fall would lead to a break in the tensions that have risen on the Korean peninsula in recent months with Pyongyang ’s testing of missiles and a nuclear warhead .
“ Now , there ’s a green light for changing from a phase of confrontation to that of communication , ” said Yang Moo-jin , a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul .
Others said that in lieu of a high - ranking Obama administration official , Clinton was the perfect emissary for the task .
“ Clinton ’s perception or prestige in North Korea is remarkably higher than other names .
Clinton is the U.S. president that North Korea thinks made the biggest achievement in a history of U.S. - North Korea relations , ” said Paik Hak - soon , director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute on the outskirts of Seoul .
Advertisement
And while the details of the discussions between Clinton and Kim remained unclear , Paik said he thought that the talks would lead to more diplomatic breakthroughs .
“ If it was simply a matter of freeing two journalists , it would not have been successful , ” he said .
“ Both countries have agreed that this visit would be a place to discuss big changes in relations and to solve nuclear issues . ”
Lisa Ling said the families had no immediate plans for the two journalists .
“ My guess is that they are going to be pretty traumatized and culture shocked , ” she said .
“ We want to let them decompress and get re-acclimated to being home . ”
