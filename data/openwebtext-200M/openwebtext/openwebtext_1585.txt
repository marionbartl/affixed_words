Of all days for this thing to arrive ... it had to be today .
Yes folks , as you can see in our gallery below , the JooJoo is not only real , but we 've got one .
We 're not going to go into details right now , as we 've got our hands kind of full this week , but we suggest you hang tight until our review hits ( probably early next week ) so you can make the final decision if it 's going to be this thing or , you know , some other tablet .
Or maybe you just want to keep that $ 500 .
Hey , it 's your call , pal .
For now , check out our unboxing , and at least breathe a sigh of relief that if you did shell out for one of these , it 's likely going to hit your doorstep pretty darn soon .
Hey folks , we 've got a video encoding right now which runs through some of the UI of the device .
We hear you in comments , and would like to let you know that there 's no conspiracy here -- it 's a question of spending time with a device to review it properly .
Unless you know what our schedule is like , we 'd appreciate everyone chilling out on the episodes in comments .
We 're happy to shut them off on this post if you can't control yourselves .
Comments are off , video is after the break .
Thanks for being mature .
Just kidding .
In 1970 , Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York addressed a crowd of tens of thousands in Union Square on Earth Day , in an atmosphere The New York Times likened to a “ secular revival meeting . ”
This year , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will be in Times Square to announce measures to reduce New York ’s impact on the environment .
Using the same stage , Keep America Beautiful , an antilittering nonprofit organization , will introduce “ dream machines , ” recycling kiosks it is introducing with PepsiCo .
The machines are meant to increase the recycling rates for beverage containers , which is estimated at about 36 percent nationwide .
Of course , a fair portion of the more than 200 billion beverage containers produced in the United States each year are filled with PepsiCo products like Mountain Dew and Aquafina ; such bottle trash contributes to serious pollution on beaches , oceans and inland waterways .
Still , Matthew M. McKenna , president and chief executive of Keep America Beautiful , and a former PepsiCo senior vice president , said he jumped at the opportunity to have his former employer introduce its new kiosk at the event .

“ We are not being asked to encourage the purchase of Pepsi or the consumption of their products , ” he said .
“ We are asked to deal in the field with what happens when they get thrown out . ”
While the momentum for the first Earth Day came from the grass roots , many corporations say that it is often the business community that now leads the way in environmental innovation — and they want to get their customers interested .
In an era when the population is more divided on the importance of environmental issues than it was four decades ago , the April event offers a rare window , they say , when customers are game to learn about the environmentally friendly changes the companies have made .
A new quasiparticle has been discovered , according to a report published in Science on Thursday .
The new phenomenon , called a " plasmaron , " was found in a sample of doped graphene , where it appeared courtesy of the material 's unusual arrangement of electrons in its electron cloud .
Because the behavior of the quasiparticle is different from that of its individual components , researchers should be able to use this new knowledge to make better predictions of the atomic and molecular states present in graphene , and keep watch for the appearance of plasmarons in similar materials .
A quasiparticle is not a sort - of particle , as the name implies , but usually represents a combination of a bulk effect and a material .
For example , an electron is only a particle , but an electron that blocks the attraction between another electron and a proton could act as a quasiparticle .
A quasiparticle can also be purely effect , like plasmons , which are quantum packets of excitation in the electrons in a metal .
To find quasiparticles , researchers often have to be able to isolate a single particle behaving a particular way — not always an easy task .
When these particular researchers looked at graphene doped with potassium and its band structure ( the energies that electrons can occupy ) , they found one spot where holes left by electrons exhibited unusual behavior — their movement could n't be described by the normal set of rules .
They realized that the intersection of charge bands caused the holes to have greater binding energy than usual , and that these are actually able to exert plasmon effects on their environment .
The combination meant they had a new quasiparticle on their hands : the plasmaron .
The appearance of the quasiparticle seems like a highly specialized case , since it was found in a specific material prepared a special way .
Still , knowing its behavior and weird manipulation of energy will allow researchers to account for it more fully when modeling uses of graphene , as well as look for it to crop up in similar electron - hole situations .

KDE volunteers at SCALE8X KDE volunteers at SCALE8X
From February 20th to the 21st , Linux enthusiasts from the greater Los Angeles area converged at the Westin Hotel near Los Angeles Airport to celebrate Linux and Free Software at the annual Southern California Linux Expo ( SCALE8X ) .
KDE was there once again showing attendees the work of the KDE community .
The team was showing off Plasma Desktop and a prototype of the Plasma Netbook workspace .
There were four new volunteers who did a great job representing KDE for the first time - Jonathan Prien , Wayne Speir , Aaron Reichman , and Barrington Daltrey .
A special mention goes also to Gary Greene , who shipped out the KDE booth box for use at SCALE .
Aaron Johnson gave a talk " A Basic Introduction to KDE " , attended by about thirty people , that was well recieved .
All in all , the team had a great time and made a great start for a KDE community in Southern California .

Everyone who is gonna repost this on their website , at least credit Yonhap as the original source for the love of god .
Here 's my indirect translation of the relevant points from the two articles ( April 25th ) :
During the recent Blizzard HQ visit , Yonhap News sat down with Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime and COO Paul Sams for an interview .
During this interview , it was revealed that Blizzard will no longer be negotiating with KeSPA ( Korea E- Sports Association ) regarding the intellectual property rights of their games .
Morhaime said " We 've been negotiating with the association about intellectual property rights for the last three years , and we 've made no progress at all ... ... We 're going to stop negotiating with them and look for a new partner . "
He also mentioned " Blizzard obviously has the IP rights to the Starcraft series , but those rights are n't being respected , and we can't keep having these fruitless negotiations with the release of Starcraft II at hand . "
In a worst case scenario , all Korean Starcraft tournaments that run through KeSPA may be forced to stop .
+ Interviews
Yonhap :
What 's the scale of the your company and the projects you have going ?
Mike Morhaime :
We have over four thousand employees worldwide , with about 1,200 of them working in our Irvine HQ .
We have branches in Europe , China , Seoul , Taiwan , and Singapore .
We have projects including World of Warcraft , Starcraft II , Diablo III , and one unannounced MMORPG .
The other projects I cannot reveal .
Yonhap : How is progress on Diablo III ?
MM : It 's going well , satisfactory .
We added some new guys to the original diablo team , so we have a great team now .
It 's playable internally right now .
We can't predict when it will be released , but it wo n't be this year in any case .
Yonhap :
There are high expectations for Starcraft II
MM : Very high for us .
Not just the multiplayer , but the single player experience is the best we 've ever made .
The original did so incredibly well in Korea that it will be hard to surpass that , but we are going to break the original 's sales records worldwide .
Yonhap : What 's Blizzard 's vision for E - sports ?
MM : Our understanding of E - sports is as a community project that increases the enjoyment of the game for the players .
It 's going to be popular not only in Korea , but worldwide .
Of course it could be profitable as well , but we 're focusing on the community aspect of E - sports more than the financial aspects .
If we turn a profit , we plan to reinvest a large portion of it to development e-sports even further , in the form of sponsorships , prize money , etc .
Yonhap :
How are your negotiations involving intellectual property with KeSPA going ?
MM : We 've tried to talk to KeSPA for three years , but we can't get them to recognize our IP rights .
Of course we think our IP rights should be respected .
Starcraft II will be released soon , so we will have to look for a new partner .
Yonhap : Starcraft II received a 18 years + rating in South Korea ?
MM : I was surprised .
We designed it from the start as a game teenagers could enjoy .
We 've filed an objection , so I hope the rating is reconsidered .
Have you heard about the match - fixing scandal in Korea ?
MM : I was shocked and very disappointed .
I 've heard the police are investigating , and am interested in the results .
What kind of business model and future do you have envisioned for Battle .net ?
Paul Sams : Battle .net will be a hub for all of Blizzard 's games , and help develop the community and e-sports .
The specifics of our business and service model can change from game to game , and region to region .
Our basic policy is to make the games on a global basis , but thoroughly localize the services .
Yonhap :
What 's the secret to your global success ?
PS : The most important thing is to get a lot of feedback from the start .
There are different opinions to be heard everywhere in the world .
Listening to all these opinions and applying them lets you succeed in international market .
What kind of quality standards do you set for yourselves ?
PS : We do n't have any set standards of quality .
We try to get as many opinions as possible during development , and improve the games from there .
Internally , we constantly show the games to others and get feedback so we can fix and improve the game .
After we repeat that process countless times , we finally get something we can reveal .
Yonhap :
What 's your strategy for the mobile games market ?
PS : We think of mobile phones as a way to support our existing franchises .
I can't really say anything about our plans for games on smart phones .
Yonhap :
So what are your plans for games outside the PC ?
PS : Making good games is the first thing .
We have an open mind on all platforms , and we do n't make games with a particular platform in mind .
The best way to is to make the game , then decide what the best platform for it would be .
Yonhap :
Do you see an opportunity in the emerging social gaming market ?
PS : If you look at its recent popularity , social gaming can definitely be a part of a game .
But we do n't think they require a lot of skill to make , or are particularly competitive in the market .
They still have a long way to go .
Yonhap :
What do you think of the social responsibility of a game company ?
PS : World of Warcraft willingly introduced the world 's first fatigue system to prevent people getting too deeply involved .
Besides this , we 're protecting our users through a variety of methods , and we 'll continue that policy .
Soon , we are going to unveil a program for giving back to the community in Korea .
Yonhap :
What are your plans for investing in Korea ?
PS : We do n't have any acquisition or investment plans yet .
When you develop a game , there has to be a lot of communication and cooperation .
It 's very hard to do that with a foreign branch .
That 's why we have the entire development team at our HQ .
Yonhap :
What do you think is in the future for online gaming , and the gaming market as a whole ?
PS : Online games will continue to grow .
PC Games and social games will continue to grow as well .
But I do n't think the console game market is in any trouble .
It 's in a slight haze right now , but it will recover .

Illinois Passes Antibullying Bill
With a vote of 108 - 0 , the Illinois house of representatives Friday passed a bill requiring schools to adopt policies prohibiting bullying based on sexual orientation , gender identity , and several other characteristics , according to the LBGT rights group Equality Illinois .
The state senate passed the measure earlier this month , with only two votes against it , and it now goes to Gov.
Pat Quinn , who is expected to sign it into law .
The legislation also requires schools to offer students training in how to resist bullying and take other reasonable steps to stop harassment .
“ Students who are perceived to be lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgender are particularly vulnerable to bullying , ” said Equality Illinois CEO Bernard Cherkasov .
“ And the attempted suicide rate among LGBT students , which is as much as three times higher than the general average , presents alarming evidence for just how urgently we need this law .
This was a no - nonsense bill , and I am so glad that it sailed quickly through both chambers of the legislature . ”
Equality Illinois was one of the early supporters of the legislation .
Other groups that worked for it include the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance and Illinois State Board of Education .
Pineberries : Fruit looks like white strawberry but tastes like pineapple
A new kind of fruit that looks like a white strawberry but tastes like a pineapple is going on sale in the UK .
Called pineberry , the strange - looking - variety of the popular summer fruit originated in South America where it grew wild .
It had been near to extinction until seven years ago when the Dutch began growing it commercially .
Pineberries will be on sale for five weeks at selected Waitrose branches .
A 125g punnet will cost £ 2.99 until April 13 and then sell for £ 3.99 .
Nicki Baggott , Waitrose fruit buyer , said : ” Pineberries offer our customers the chance to add a new fruit into their diet and the berry ’s bright appearance can add an unusual decoration to sweet dishes . ”
Pineberries are slightly smaller than the common strawberries .
They are grown in glasshouses , turning from green to white and are ripe when the seeds turn dark red .

Because of the potential for variations in the different aspects of a web design project , creating a proposal or invoice for such a project can be trickier than that of another industry like accounting or legal services .
If your proposal is n’t created carefully , it can lead to misunderstandings and unhappy clients ( not to mention the grief it can cause you ) .
The same is true for invoices : if it ’s not clear what they ’re paying for , clients can delay making payments or dispute charges .
There are two main factors to keep in mind when preparing a proposal or invoice :
First , you ’re likely dealing with people who are not yet your clients ; and second , you ’re dealing with clients who you ( probably ) hope will bring you repeat business .
This article will offer a number of tips , based on those two principles , to help designers creative effective proposals and invoices .
Image source
Proposals
We ’ll start with proposals , since you ’ll have a need for them before you need an invoice .
There are probably as many web design proposal formats as there are web designers .
A lot of what you include in a proposal is a matter of personal choice .
But there are a few things that every proposal should include .
The Basics
A proposal should include basic information about your company ( contact info , mostly ) , information about who the prospective client is , and the fact that this is a proposal .
In many cases , you would include your logo and business name , along with your contact information , at the top of the page .
Then , below that , you ’d include your client ’s contact information .
Put the date somewhere near the top , too .
Finally , put the word “ Proposal ” or similar , preferably in bigger type and bold .
These things are just formalities , but they ’re still important and it ’s completely possible that some designers might forget to include one or more of these in their rush to get a proposal out the door to a new prospect .
The Project ’s Scope
Somewhere in your proposal you ’ll include information about the scope of the project .
Is this going to be a simple brochure site ?
An online store ?
Will it have a blog ?
An intranet or members - only area ?
Community features ?
There are tons of variables that go into the creation of a website , and it ’s important to describe at least the major ones here .
Make sure you understand what your prospective clients are looking for before you send a proposal to them ( this should be done in a discovery phase , with either a formal or informal client questionnaire ) .
This section should be clearly indicated , but can be formatted either as a series of bullet points or in paragraph form .
Which one works best will probably depend on the type of site and how many features it will have .
A bulleted list can give a more polished look and make it easier for the client to read — as long as there are n’t too many points .
Do n’t be afraid to use bold or underlined type to highlight particularly important sections .
Ideally , you want to include a problem statement at the beginning of this section ( or possibly as its own section if it ’s long enough ) , where you restate and rephrase what the client is looking for , to make sure you understand what they want , and to ensure they know that you understand their needs .
Make sure you make it clear to your prospective client that you understand what their needs are , what their company is all about , and that you can help them reach their goals .
This is also the section where you want to make it clear what are your capabilities .
The more specific you are about what you can and ca n’t do for a client , the less likely they are to make incorrect assumptions , and the more confident they ’ll be in your abilities .
By being honest up front , you build trust with your client , which makes them more likely to hire you , and , if the proposal is approved , they ’ll be more likely to listen to , and trust , your suggestions during the course of the project .
The Project Timeline
Generally , web design clients want to know how long it will take for their website to be up and running .
My advice : take a page from Scotty ’s book ( from the original Star Trek series ) .
Under - promise and over - deliver .
In other words , if you think something will take you two weeks , tell your clients it will take three .
Image source
There are two reasons for taking this approach .
First , every project will have its unexpected problems and challenges — maybe your client submitted artwork three days late , or maybe the domain they wanted was already taken and it took them a week to come up with an alternative , or maybe the hosting they purchased ahead of time does n’t support databases or PHP5 .
Whatever the reasons , giving yourself some buffer time means you are n’t scrambling to meet deadlines that are suddenly unrealistic or delivering the project a week late .
But there ’s an even more important reason to under - promise and over - deliver :
If everything lines up properly and you do n’t run into any problems , you will gain the reputation of being faster and more efficient than other designers .
In both cases , you end up with happier clients without pulling out all of your hair !
So , come up with a realistic timeline for the project , breaking it down into milestones if it ’s a particularly large or complicated site .
For example , you might promise initial mockups in two weeks , a functional site for testing in a month , and the final site in two months .
For a smaller site you might promise the mockups by the following week and the finished site a week after the mockups are approved .
In creating the written timeline , be sure to mention that some milestones may depend on the client ’s approval .
It ’s not unreasonable to set incremental deadlines that require the client to review certain aspects of the project .
In the documented timeline you want to inform them that any delays on their part will affect the overall timeline .
The Project Costs
Including project costs in your proposal in a well - outlined and well - explained manner can contribute to how happy your client is and how long it takes them to pay their bills .
You ’ll want to break down the costs based on phases or parts of the project .
How you do this depends on how you normally bill clients and how complex the particular project is .
For very simple websites , you might write “ Brochure site , 4 pages with contact form , $ 500 ” or similar .
For a more complex site , however , you ’ll need to break it down into separate items .
You might have a fee for the basic design , a fee for adding ecommerce capabilities , a fee for some original artwork , and maybe a fee for custom coding .
In either case , make sure you outline whether this is a flat fee or based on an hourly rate ( and how many hours that covers ) .
Outline potential additional charges , too .
These might cover things like domain name registrations , hosting setup and monthly charges , and ongoing maintenance fees .
Including these details in the proposal will help avoid any surprises from a client perspective .
Other Things to Include
There are other less important things you might want to include in a proposal , depending on your own normal business practices and your individual clients .
These include :
Image source
Make sure you ’re accessible .
Make sure you include multiple methods for the client to contact you by .
At a minimum , the client should have your email address and a phone number , but also consider including your cell number , and one or more IM usernames , if it will fit the circumstances .

A confidentiality clause .
You may want to include a confidentiality clause in the proposal , making it clear to your prospects that the information contained in your proposal should not be shown to others ( especially other designers ) .

Technical specifications .
Some designers like to specify exactly which browsers the site will work in , as well as any special or proprietary technologies the site will use .
This might also include specifying a particular CMS .

Original artwork creation .
Sometimes a web design client will want you to revamp their logo ( or create one from scratch ) or do some other original design work for them .
These things should probably be specified separately .

Payment terms .
If you have a payment plan worked out with your client , the proposal would be the best place to spell it out .
You might also mention things like penalties for not making a payment on time .

A short company or designer bio .
Giving your prospective client some idea of who you are and what you ’ve done in the past may make their decision a bit easier .
Putting that information on the first page of your proposal makes it easy for them to remember why they considered hiring you in the first place .

Including a header and / or footer with your contact information and page numbers makes it easier for prospects to keep your proposal organized and for them to contact you without having to flip back to the front .

Moodboards and / or wireframes .
For particularly promising projects , or for ones where you ’re pretty confident the client is going to hire you , including a couple of wireframes or moodboards ( with color schemes or other design elements ) can be a nice added touch .
Just do n’t put too much time into it or give too much away until you actually have the project .

Case studies .
Including case studies of similar sites or projects you ’ve completed can also give clients more faith in your abilities .
Include any relevant projects , but limit this to 2 - 4 strong and applicable examples , to avoid overwhelming your prospects .

Include a cover letter .
Give a very brief introduction and overview , in an email or cover letter , of what ’s included in the proposal , what your qualifications are , as well as your contact information .

Schedule a meeting .
When you email or otherwise send the proposal to your prospect , include in the proposal a request for a meeting to discuss any questions they might have about your proposal or the project itself .
Knowing there is a possible follow - up meeting might make it more likely that the client will review your proposal in a timely manner .
Do n’t Forget …
Here are some other things to keep in mind when preparing your proposal :
Spell check and proofread !
There ’s nothing worse than getting a proposal that ’s littered with typographical and grammatical errors .
Remember that your computer ’s spell check is n’t foolproof .
Do a manual proofread , too — preferably on a hard copy .

Remember that your computer ’s spell check is n’t foolproof .
Do a manual proofread , too — preferably on a hard copy .
Ask your client whether they prefer a printed or digital version of the proposal , and if digital , which file format they ’d prefer .
If it ’s a print proposal , use high quality paper and ensure that your printer is n’t running out of ink ; you want your proposal to look as professional as possible .
Use a customizable template to make the creation of future proposals easier and more streamlined .
Be neat and professional , but do n’t over - design your proposal ; its purpose is to get the information across , not to show off your design skills .
What ’s Next ?
So , you ’ve crafted the perfect proposal and sent it to your prospective client — now what ?
If you have n’t heard back from the client within a week or so after submitting the proposal ( and assuming you did n’t schedule a follow - up meeting when you sent the proposal ) , it ’s fine to follow up .
Whether you want to email or telephone is up to you , and may depend on the type of client you ’re dealing with .
But get in touch to make sure they received the proposal , and to see if they have any questions .
If they have n’t made a decision by this point , try to find out when they ’re likely to do so .
Then , plan to follow up again after that date if you have n’t still heard .

Now , assuming they decide to hire you , what are the next steps ?
You ’ll want to get a signed proposal or contract from the client , along with a deposit .
Whenever you ’re working with a new client , you ’ll always want to get a deposit of anywhere between 25 - 50 % before you start work ( which should have been specified in your initial proposal ) .
Once those are received , you ’ll want to schedule the milestones and deadlines that were outlined in the proposal ’s timeline .
Keep your client up to date on your progress , especially if it ’s a long - term project ( weekly or bi-weekly updates are often appropriate ) .
If you know you ’re going to miss a deadline , let your client know as soon as possible .
They ’ll appreciate the advance notice , especially if the next milestone requires some kind of action from them ( such as reviewing artwork or beta testing ) .
Keep on top of your clients to make sure they comply with any deadlines agreed upon in the proposal ( such as providing artwork , reviewing the site , or making scheduled payments ) .
When you send them files to review , include a note to remind them of their responsibility to provide feedback within the specified time that was outlined in the proposal .
This will help reinforce that you can only meet your deadlines if they meet theirs .
Constant communication with your client is key to making any project run smoothly .
Make sure your clients know they can come to you with any questions or concerns they may have regarding the project .
Do the same with them .
If you have questions about something they ’ve sent to you or some aspect of the project , ask them .
It ’s better to ask and get it right the first time than to spend hours or days doing something you ’ll have to change later .

Invoices
A clear and easy - to - understand invoice will contribute greatly to ensuring your clients pay their bills in a timely fashion .
Below are some guidelines that will help you create an effective invoice .
What the Invoice Should Include
Your invoices should include basic contact information for both you and your client , as well as the date the invoice was issued and the date it ’s due .
Always include a sequential or date - based invoice number , to help identify the invoice at a later date .
Image source
The invoice should outline exactly what the charges are , which would be broken down in the same way they were broken down on your proposal , to make it easier for your clients to verify the charges .
Include whether these are flat fees or based on hourly rates ( and how many hours ) .
Depending on your location , you may need to include some form of tax as a separate item .
Check your local laws to see if this applies to you .
Finally , include how you want to be paid — by check , bank transfer , or PayPal .
You might consider setting up a payment gateway on your website to make it easier for your clients to pay you .
Offering a discount for prompt payment can also be a good idea .
It ’s common for payment discounts of between one and five percent to be given for payments made within five to ten days .
You should also specify if there are any late payment fees or interest charged on payments not received by the due date .
Using an Invoice Service
There are numerous online services that offer invoicing ranging from full - featured bookkeeping to simple invoice - tracking services .
Some of the better solutions let you create proposals from within the app , and can manage your entire project .
These services can definitely make your life much easier when it comes to finances .
Another advantage to using an online invoicing app is that it can track payments , and sometimes even calculate your income taxes based on what payments you ’ve received , saving you time and hassle .
See the “ Further Resources ” below for an overview of some available invoicing apps .
In addition to these services , you may also use ready to use invoice pdf templates to easily send professional - looking invoices to clients automatically .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A white supremacist was jailed for 10 years Friday after he became the first person in Britain to be convicted of manufacturing a deadly chemical weapon , which he kept in a jar in his kitchen .
Ian Davison , 42 , belonged to the “ Aryan Strike Force ” ( ASF ) , a group that planned assaults on Muslims and Jews among others .
“ He was a leading member of the ASF which was a neo -Nazi organization dedicated to using violence , ” prosecutor Andrew Edis told Newcastle Crown Court .
“ The purpose of the violence was the creation of an international Aryan group who would establish white supremacy in white countries .
“ They were followers of the ideology of Adolf Hitler , who they revered , and whose work Mein Kampf was among many available on their website . ”
Davison , from County Durham in northern England , made the ricin at his home in 2006 or early 2007 , after researching how to make the killer chemical and then buying its easily - sourced ingredients , the Press Association news agency reported .
The poison -- enough to kill nine people -- was found when police raided the property last June and is now stored at Britain ’s Porton Down chemical weapons center .
Ricin can cause death from exposure to as little as a pinhead amount .
Most victims die between 36 hours and 72 hours after exposure and there is no known antidote .
The most famous case of ricin poisoning was in 1978 when dissident Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov was killed when an assasin in London jabbed him with an umbrella that injected a tiny ricin - filled pellet .
At an earlier hearing , Davison admitted producing a chemical weapon , preparing acts of terrorism , possessing material useful to commit acts of terrorism and possessing a prohibited weapon .
Edis said the ASF had about 350 members recruited via the Internet , though not all were active .
Others accused of being members will face trial later this year .
The court heard the ASF had not picked out particular targets , but had run a training camp and made promotional films .
Members had discussed posting cockroaches through letterboxes of restaurants and shops owned by Asians with the aim of encouraging infestations and getting them closed down .
Science fiction is fraught with mad scientists who discover strange chemicals that can empower the human body or even reanimate the dead .
Well , Harvard has come about as close to that scenario as anyone would want them to .
Prof. Hemant Thatte has developed a cocktail of 21 chemical compounds that he calls Somah , derived from the sanskrit for “ ambrosia of rejuvenation ” .
Using Somah , Thattle and his team have accomplished some amazing feats with pig hearts .
They can keep the organ viable for transplant up to 10 days after harvest – that ’s incredibly longer than the 4 hour limit seen in hospitals today .
Not only that , but using low temperatures and Somah , they were able to take a pig heart that was removed post mortem and get it to beat 24 hours later in the lab .
Watch that amazing video after the break .
We ’ve seen amazing chemical treatments that have the potential to transform the medical industry .
Mark Roth is working with hydrogen sulfide to put soldiers and other trauma victims into suspended animation on the way to hospitals .
The University of Bristol uses xenon gas and low temperatures to prevent brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation .
Now Somah could help preserve organs for more than a week outside the body .
As researchers continue to unlock the mysteries of your body ’s chemistry , they may find more ways of preserving and protecting it indefinitely .
This will make it much easier to repair or replace parts of your body as they fail , letting you live longer , and healthier .
Maybe indefinitely .
Thousands of patients waiting for an organ transplant die each year in the US alone .
Donated organs are limited in availability by distance and time .
After harvesting , a heart has just about 4 hours to reach its recipient , anything more than that and decomposition will render the heart nonviable .
If we could extend that window to 10 days , almost any organ could be made available to almost anyone , anywhere .
That will lead to many saved lives .
It will also lower costs as there would be no need for chartered jets and other speedy transports .
Somah may also save lives by extending the number of viable heart donors .
Now , most of these organs are harvested from patients who are brain dead , but with a beating heart ( effectively still alive as far as the body is concerned ) .
After death , cells begin to degrade quickly .
If a donor arrives to a hospital DOA , their organs may not be available to transplant to needy recipients .
Somah , however , has been shown to reverse some of this cell decay .
The chemical cocktail helps transform metabolic agents into preservative agents .
Thatte ’s team took a pig heart harvested post mortem and let it sit in Somah for 24 hours at lower temperatures .
The cell degradation was very low .
They then warmed the heart up , hooked it into an artificial circulatory system and got it to beat .
This clip is brief , but it shows the incredible achievement :
To better understand if and how Somah preserved a heart , Thatte and his group harvested two female pig hearts and placed them in two different containers .
One was filled with Somah , the other with Celsior from Genzyme – the standard chemical bath which preserves organs in hospitals today .
As described in the journal Circulation , the team took tissue samples every four hours from each heart .
They found that the Somah heart had a much lower rate of cell decay , including important cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells which are necessary for the heart to work in a new host .
Based on this research they concluded that hearts preserved in Somah should be viable for up to 10 days .
Celsior can store the organ for 4 hours .
That ’s an epic difference .
And one that investors are hoping to bank on .
A new startup , Hibergenica , is looking to commercialize Somah for use in humans .
The company is still in its very early stages .
Likewise , Somah still has a ways to go .
Transplants from pigs to other pigs ( using Somah ) will have to be performed before human clinical trials can begin .
We ’re talking years of research before the FDA would possibly approve Somah for use in the US .
Other companies are relatively closer to augmenting the time hearts stay fresh outside the body .
We ’ve already seen how TransMedics can keep a heart beating for 12 hours inside a machine , and they are moving forward with tens of millions in funding .
Somah , however , could potentially keep hearts viable for 20 times longer , and probably with fewer electrical and mechanical requirements .
It will be interesting to see how these technologies ramp up in comparison to stem cell projects aimed at creating entirely new organs from a patient ’s own cells .
Simpler forms of that concept ( for windpipes ) have had a series of successes recently with human patients .
No matter which of these technologies is the first to achieve widespread use , the future seems ready to provide us with the means to get a new heart when we need it .

BOSTON — Sonnet Ehlers looked into the eyes of the rape victim and saw nothing .
“ Her eyes looked like marbles , totally dead , ” said Ehlers , who was working as a medical researcher at Kimberley Hospital in the Northern Cape of South Africa when a 20 - year - old South African woman was being treated for rape injuries .
But Ehlers remembers clearly one sentence the young woman uttered : “ If only I had teeth down there . ”
South African
Ehlers made a promise to herself to " do something about this . ”
Forty years later , the result is the Rape - aXe , an anti-rape device with " teeth . "
Rape - aXe is a flexible polyurethane condom - like tube that fits into the woman 's body .
Rows of jagged plastic hooks line the inside of the tube — bent backward like teeth in a shark ’s mouth — and lodge in a perpetrator 's penis upon entry .
The perpetrator can withdraw from the woman , but the Rape - aXe remains clamped on .
Trying to pull it off will cause discomfort .
Though the device causes great distress , it does not draw blood , Ehlers says , which is crucial in areas where HIV / AIDS rates are high .
A man must seek medical attention to have the Rape - aXe removed .
Until then , he cannot urinate , essentially tagging him until he gets to a hospital , she explains .
Ehlers says she consulted an engineer , gynecologist and psychologist on the design .
Grace Faraja , 29 , has lived through the constant fear of being raped .
She lived most of her life in Kinshasa , the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , before being granted refugee status and moving to New Hampshire in 2008 .
She says that if she were back in Congo , she would wear the Rape - aXe .
“ What people need is this condom , ” Faraja says .
Especially when women are most vulnerable , at night and when traveling from one town to the next , she says .
“ When men hear about this , ” Faraja says , “ they will be scared .
They wo n’t know who has protected herself and who not . ”
But some critics are doubtful that the Rape - aXe will benefit women in conflict zones , where rape is used systematically as a weapon of war .

The criminal on too few wanted lists
“ Maybe that makes sense in the First World , ” says filmmaker Lisa F. Jackson , who interviewed rape victims and rapists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and produced " The Greatest Silence . "
Jackson estimates that more than 200,000 women and girls have been raped since the civil war began in 1998 .
“ But if a guy is raping you , and there ’s five other guys waiting to take their turn … do you think he ’s going to take that well ?
They ’re going to mutilate that woman .
It ’s just a provocation . ”
The Rape - aXe was devised to thwart would - be rapists .

The Rape - aXe is a latex sheath containing sharp barbs that latch onto the penis when a man tries to rape a woman .
The device can only be removed surgically .
Sonnet Ehlers devised the Rape aXe after working with rape victims in South Africa .
( Courtesy of Sonnet Ehlers )
But Ehlers , who created the device , says that the benefits outweigh the risks .
What is already a violent and often deadly incident cannot be made more violent , she says .
" I 'm trying to get these women a moment , that 's all . "
Women already have been arming themselves with homemade defenses — a razor blade hidden in a vaginal sponge or razor blades glued to the inside of a plastic cap that is worn in the vagina .
Some South African women have taken to wearing bicycle shorts so short and so tight that cannot be yanked off , Ehlers says .
In South Africa , which has been dubbed the rape capital of the world , women are begging for access to the device , Ehlers says .
A 2006 Interpol study found that a woman is raped every 17 seconds in South Africa .
A separate study found that of more than 20,000 reports of rape across South Africa , only 8 percent led to a conviction , according to a 2009 Amnesty International report .
With the Rape - aXe , “ at least the police have this man , ” Ehlers says .
“ But now he rapes , now at least the possibility of getting him sooner is there before he kills more women . ”
But the device remains unavailable to the public .
In fact , its “ teeth ” have yet to bite into a real penis , though it has been tested without the barbs attached .
One man from the U.K. has offered to be the first , though his motives are unclear .
Ehlers will not release the Rape - aXe until she is able to first distribute the devices to South African women .
She plans to distribute 30,000 at no cost , and hopefully before the World Cup games in June , she says .
They will cost less than $ 2 each thereafter .
" Women try to fight , to save themselves , but you ca n’t fight men , " Faraja says .
" You do n’t know when they ’re going to rape you , you ca n’t walk with a weapon .
It comes abruptly ...
It ’s done in darkness . "
This report comes from journalists in our Student Correspondent Corps , a GlobalPost project training the next generation of foreign correspondents while they study abroad .
Student Louise Ward ( Boston College ) contributed to this report .
On Feb. 15 , Thomas Bruso 's already unpredictable life took an abrupt detour .
It was the day he ceased being Thomas Bruso and became Epic Beard Man , Internet sensation .
That day , Bruso pulled on his custom - made " I am a motherfucker " T - shirt , snapped on his fanny pack , and met the pot-smoking buddy he calls Ugly Bob at the bus stop at Fruitvale and MacArthur in Oakland .
They boarded a San Francisco–bound AC Transit bus , planning to buy some weed in the city .
The two sixtysomethings sat near the front of the bus , where Bruso announced his plans to get his Stacy Adams shoes shined by a " brother " for his mom 's funeral in Michigan .
The driver would later tell police that Bruso had said that black people are good at shoe shining , but whatever the wording , it surely came out in Bruso 's loud and gruff Chicago tones , and got people to pay attention .
As Ugly Bob recalls it ( though he says he was n't wearing his hearing aid that day ) , an intoxicated black passenger named Michael Lovette said , " Why do n't you get your own ' brother ' to shine your shoes ? "
Bruso is not one to walk away from a challenge — just ask the North Beach cops who drove up to where he was yelling obscenities at cars on Columbus Avenue one day , and billy - clubbed and pepper - sprayed the 6 - foot - 1 , 225 - pound hulk until he cracked up and cried .
Or check out the video on YouTube , Bruso 's first taste of Internet infamy , of the police Tasing him after he thumbed his nose at them at an Oakland A's game last August .
Lovette could n't have known all that as Bruso walked to the back of the bus and sat opposite him .
The tension was enough for a young black woman named Iyanna Washington sitting beside Bruso to start recording the exchange .
" Let 's get back to business .
How much you charge me for a spit - shine ? "
Bruso asked .
Lovette , who is 50 but looks 20 years younger , with braids and wraparound sunglasses , replied in a low voice , " Why a brother gotta spit - shine your shoes ? "
" You offered ! " Bruso exclaimed , as though he were genuinely confused .
" I did n't offer you shit , " Lovette answered .
" What did you just say when you walked by me ? "
" I said , ' Why a fuckin ' ' brother ' gotta spit - shine your shoes ? ' "
" No , he do n't have to ! " Bruso yelled back .
" Why a white man ca n't spit - shine — "
" It could be a Chinaman — it do n't matter ! " Bruso shouted .
" I ain't prejudiced !
What ?
You think I 'm prejudiced ? "
Lovette pointed to the front of the bus , where Ugly Bob still sat .
" Look , dude , take yo' ass back up there and get the fuck out of my face right now , " he said .
Bruso stood up and started walking to the front of the bus , yelling over his shoulder at Lovette : " You ai n't scarin ' this white boy .
I 'm 67 years old .
You ai n't scarin ' me . "
A voice from behind the camera , which many think belongs to Washington , egged them on : " Say it again !
Say it again , Pinky !
Beat his white ass !
Whup his ass ! "
Lovette and Bruso continued to talk smack to each other .
Bruso grunted , " I 'm gonna slap the shit out of ya ! "
" What ? "
Lovette shrieked , striding to the front of the bus .
He lunged at Bruso in a sloppy attempt to hit him in the chest .
Bruso swatted off the punch , stood up , and loosed a whirlwind of blows with his meaty fists that sent Lovette to the floor , hands up to shield his bleeding nose .
Bruso grabbed Lovette 's collar and screamed , " I told you not to fuck with me ! " and then told the bus driver and Washington 's camera , " He hit me !
He fuckin' hit me ! " before leaving the bus .
Lovette lumbered back to his seat , dripping blood , promising to " kill that nigga . "
The next day , Washington uploaded " AC Transit Bus Fight I Am a Motherfucker " to YouTube .
The 3 minutes and 21 seconds of explosive footage got more than a million views in 24 hours .
Web junkies dubbed Bruso " Epic Beard Man , " and posted fan art re-creating him as a muscular cartoon character , a pimp in a Stacy Adams ad , or getting his shoes shined by Lovette .
Others created videos of the fight as Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter parodies ; another composed and uploaded an " I Am a Motherfucker " tribute song .
Hundreds of people posted response videos breaking down the fight .
Comedians used it as skit material , while high schoolers cracked up at the senior citizen 's unlikely fighting prowess .
Epic Beard Man was a phenomenon .
Of course , his new " fans " knew little about the man himself .
Instead , viewers saw what they wanted to see .
Some saw an elderly hero .
Some saw a racist .
And others — well , they saw dollar signs .
Bruso pulled his Chihuahua , Pinky , close to his face so she could lick him .
" Would I ever hurt you , my lovely - dovely ? " he cooed .
The marijuana smoke was so thick in his room at the Altenheim senior residential home in Oakland — one of the nicer places a Section 8 voucher and $ 11,000 a year in welfare will get you — that you could get high just by walking in .
A TV and radio played simultaneously .
A note taped on the wall under a Marilyn Monroe poster read , " Tom , I am a local producer from Nash Entertainment .
We had an interview scheduled with you for today .
Please call me .
I have some money for you . "
The phone rang , and Bruso asked me to answer it .
In the month since he became Epic Beard Man , he has become wary , and not just because of the kids who call to ask him how much he 'll charge to shine their shoes .
You can't have a gloves - off racial clash of the kind rarely seen by polite society and expect to avoid the fallout .
Dozens of black men posted videos on YouTube taking Bruso 's side , arguing that he was defending himself against a fool who read racism where there was none .
Yet white supremacists commenting on message boards saw an all - powerful white man triumphing over a scraggly thug .
The far - right Occidental Quarterly referred to Bruso as a " folk hero to hundreds of thousands of White Americans who are tired of being perpetual victims of violent hate crimes in their own land . "
Bay Area National Anarchists , which preaches white separatism , attempted to organize a rally to support him .
The Antlers keep being told that their new concept album , about a dying woman , is a life - changer .
But how much of an ordeal did they go through themselves
The Hanbury Ballroom in Brighton was built in 1892 as a mausoleum for the Sassoon family .
There 's something fitting , then , in the subject matter chosen by the band playing to the packed crowd , happily jostling at the bar .
The Antlers , from New York , are singing about a skeletal girl succumbing to terminal illness .
The subject is deeply personal to the band 's singer , Peter Silberman , even if it is not literal .
But he does n't mind that it seems to have become seized on by people claiming it as their own .
" The more it becomes theirs , the easier it is to continue on with and move forward , " he says .
" It 's not the kind of thing I 'd want to hold on to .
A lot of people have approached us with stories of their own experiences when this album has either reminded them of something , or helped them get through something .
Or maybe even made something harder to deal with .
The fact that they 're relating to it at all is something I 'm happy about . "
The songs the Antlers are performing in Brighton come from their debut album , Hospice .
To the sound of emotive rock , with windy echoes of Arcade Fire and Neutral Milk Hotel , Silberman sings the story of a boy who feels obliged to stay with his abusive girlfriend when she starts to die of bone cancer .
The songs run through the fallout : there 's an abortion ( Bear ) ; raging arguments ( Sylvia ) ; the resignation of death and defeat ( Two ) and the death itself ( Shiva ) , as the girl 's monitors beep for the last time .
It climaxes with the realisation that the passing is ultimately an act of catharsis .
" Some people can't be saved , " muses one of the last lines .
The epic tone of the music offsets the lyrics , enabling the album to be both deeply personal yet also vague enough to mean different things to different people .
It 's not really about cancer , though : the illness is a metaphor for bad love .
Yet its strength derives from the fact that it rings absolutely , heartbreakingly true as a document of the disease , with descriptions so vivid ( " those singing morphine alarms out of tune " ) that it 's easy to imagine people mourning to it .
And it 's been written by a 23 - year - old from an affluent background , who manages to engage with the subject without ever sounding self - pitying .
" Without going too specific , I think of it as the story of a relationship , being told through the metaphor of the hospital with two characters within it , " Silberman says .
" There 's the patient and the caregiver and at the same time , there 's all the people who have been shut out of the hospital .
It 's the disintegration of that dysfunctional relationship .
It 's rediscovering the importance of independence and standing up for yourself . "
But such a personal work surely creates room for confusion about what is fiction and what is fact .
" It 's one thing if people decide the record is about something , " he says .
" It 's another if they decide its something about my life .
That 's the only part I get uncomfortable about – if someone were to say matter - of - factly , ' So this record is about your dead girlfriend . '
It 's important to separate the person from what they 're making . "
Nevertheless ,
Hospice is like a first novel , in that – regardless of how true to his life it is – there is evidently a lot of Silberman in Hospice .
It 's even a novelistic album ( unsurprisingly , given that his mother is a writer ) , similar in some ways to Sylvia Plath 's The Bell Jar .
Where that was about a troubled young girl from Massachusetts struggling to fit into New York life , Hospice was written after Silberman moved left Skidmore College , near Saratoga Springs in upstate New York , to move to the city .
Compounding the apparent link , Hospice features a song called Sylvia with a chorus that runs : " Get your head out of the oven . "
But there is no link .
" I have n't actually read The Bell Jar , " Silberman says .
Oh .
However , there is some Plath in there : " I was interested in how she 's this antihero for so many young women who identify with her for better or for worse .
It seems to be this very common touchstone . "
The Sylvia that song refers to is actually Leonard Michaels 's novel Sylvia , a fictionalised version of his relationship with his wife .
Like Hospice , it told the story of a Manhattan couple descending into self - destructive violence and then suicide .
" The end of that book hit really hard , " Silberman told a US blog this year .
" The last page of it is what inspired the song Epilogue , this sort of being haunted while trying to sleep by this thing from the past . "
There was much romanticised speculation around the album on its release last year , based around the notion that – like a writer retreating to some fastness to purge his soul – Silberman had become an apartment - bound recluse while he made the record .
But , he says , that was n't exactly what happened .
" It was with the first announcement about the record and that 's just … fucked us ever since , " he sighs , just about managing not to roll his eyes .
So he left the house once or twice then ?
" It 's not that it 's not true , it 's more that it 's misconceived .
It 's that Bon Iver thing of going into the woods and making a record … going into a cabin and writing a book .
It 's not that .
The record is about an isolating relationship between two people and how the outside world becomes cut off from that and how they become cut off from people they know and people they care about .
That 's what this is about , that 's what the record is about .
Again , it 's not about me .
It 's not about me needing to withdraw or any self - imposed seclusion .
I understand the confusion but I feel like I 've repeated it and explained it so many times that it 's pointless .
It 's a backstory , but it 's not the right backstory . "
Backstory aside , Hospice is notable for being a complete conceptual work , like its most obvious predecessor , In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel , which tells a magical realist version of Anne Frank 's story .
Is there still space for people to make records as complete works ?
" That 's going to go down to the kind of albums that people choose to make .
The iTunes model [ of buying individual songs ] makes it easier for a record to become popular very quickly , but I do n't think it necessarily gives you that longevity .
I 'd prefer to make something that exists as a whole , even if it 's not necessarily a narrative piece .
I have a hard time going ' song , song , song , song ' and then seeing what makes sense together .
A lot of people just write songs and when they have 10 of them go , ' Well , this is an album now . '
I think it 's important to give thought about what belongs together . "
The trouble with touring the album relentlessly – and doing interviews like this one – is that the magic of such a personal record might be reduced every time the band have to talk about it .
After NMH 's final gig in support of In the Aeroplane … their leader , Jeff Mangum , more or less disappeared from public view .
He had , apparently , tired of people who felt his album had altered their lives and wanted him to explain it to them .
Has Silberman had enough of explaining ?
" No , " he says , surprisingly .
" The only thing that 's weird about it is that it feels like it 's a record I wrote when I was much younger , even though I was n't that much younger .
I started on it record when I was 21 , but it feels like a lot longer ago .
I feel like I 've moved forward from it , but it does n't mean I do n't care about it any more . "
It 's a good job , because he 's probably going to be talking about it for a long , long time .
Hospice is out now on French Kiss .
The Antlers play the Scala , London , on 19 May , then touring
When a jury member was asked why he agreed to acquit a 23 - year - old accused rapist , he argued that the victim had been wearing skinny jeans , and he doubted " those kind of jeans can be removed without any sort of collaboration . "
Let 's go over that again , shall we ?
Due to the fact that skinny jeans are apparently impossible to remove by just one person ( which is why every pair you buy comes with a personal assistant to help you get them on and off , right ? ) , the jury decided that the woman could n't have possibly have been raped , as skinny jeans are n't the type of thing that can be taken off by force .
Except , as Veronica Wensing of Australia 's National Association of Services Against Sexual Assault points out , " Any piece of clothing can be removed with force . "
Perhaps someday juries will remember that the clothes do n't fucking talk , women do : it 's not the skirt she " should n't have been wearing " or the low - cut top she was " asking for it " in or the skinny jeans " she could n't possibly have had ripped off of her " they need to pay attention to : it 's her mouth , which said " no , " which is saying , " listen , " which is speaking out as loud as it can over the noise made by stupid fucking people who find it easier to spin stories about inanimate objects than to listen to the stories told by actual human beings .

Steve Roose Power Hour LLC
www.PowerHourGame.com
www.facebook.com/powerhour
Initial response :
You ’ve got to be kidding me .
Upon further inspection , I discovered that through some oversight in the trademark office , Steve Roose of “ Power Hour , LLC ” had indeed been granted the trademark for the words “ Power Hour . ”
It went into effect on April 27th , 2010 .
( See the trademark here . )
Wait , what ?
How ?
A little background on Steve Roose
Steve runs a series of spammy websites where he sells a power hour DVD and power hour software .
The main one is PowerHourGame.com .
The power hours all feature a character called “ The Beer Man ” and are essentially just PowerPoint presentations that burp .
The graphics are terrible , and there is no music or sound other than belching every sixty seconds .
Anyone who has done any other video power hour will recognize immediately that this is a pathetic representation of our favorite drinking game .
A few years ago , Steve somehow managed to get his DVD into Spencer ’s Gifts , and has also listed it for sale on Amazon.com for poor saps to buy .
He claims he has sold a total of 20,000 copies — which is a complete tragedy .
Now that Steve has been granted this trademark , he ’s trying to bully all other power hour websites into shutting down with legal threats .
He threatened Power Hour HQ .
He also started harassing Ali Spagnola , the artist and musician behind Ali Spagnola ’s Power Hour Drinking Game .
He ’s trying to wipe out ALL the power hours off the Internet except his own !
Steve Roose is a sleazebag and a bully .
He did n’t invent the power hour .
The term was in wide use years before he started selling his terrible power hours .
Now he ’s trying to use an oversight by the trademark office to commandeer the term and force out any “ competitors . ”
We believe that Steve Roose is wrong and does n’t deserve to own OUR term .
And we ’re not going to stand by and let him ruin power hours for everyone else !
Why Steve ’s trademark is bogus
The term “ power hour ” has been around for years and years , and was already widely used long before Steve Roose began marketing his products .
He did n’t invent the term or the power hour game , he just created one variation of it .
Lots of other people have created power hour music mixes , DVDs and software .
Trademark law states that “ Registration of a mark that is merely descriptive should be refused . ”
Additionally , trademark law prohibits the registration of terms that have become genericized .
Millions of people already use the term “ power hour ” to refer to this game and have never even heard of Steve ’s power hours .
His claim to “ Power Hour ” as a brand name is bogus .
It ’s like if I suddenly trademarked the word “ Basketball ” and tried to sue anyone who sold basketball jerseys or Michael Jordan videos !
( I suspect Steve ’s application only managed to slip through because there are n’t many binge drinkers in the Trademark Dept . )
How do we fight it ?
Luckily for drinkers everywhere , Ali Spagnola has hired a lawyer and has launched a campaign to get Steve Roose ’s trademark rescinded !
Ali created her own original power hour , consisting of 60 original , one - minute songs about drinking .
She sells her power hour as a DVD online , and she also performs live power hour concerts and sells an audio CD .
Ali has put a lot of work and creative energy into her power hour , and she is fighting back .
Ali ’s lawyer has already begun the legal paperwork and accumulated large amounts of evidence for refusal of the trademark .
Ali has shelled out lots of her own money to pay for the legal expenses so far .
However , the estimated cost to file the lawsuit and rescue “ Power Hour ” back from Steve is a whopping $ 15,000 .
This is where you come in .
Ali is accepting donations to help pay for the costs , but she ca n’t do it without your support .
Even a few dollars will help , and if you donate more , she will send you things like signed copies of the DVD , or fly to your city and do a live power hour concert !
To find out more about Ali ’s legal struggle ( as well as some of the incentive to donate ) , you can read about it on her website .
Click this banner to help Ali save the Power Hour !
Donate if you can , and be sure to share this with all of your friends !
You could even throw a power hour party as a fund raiser . 🙂
Also , you can feel free to NOT BUY Steve Roose ’s products .
That will help too !
What else can we do ?
Well , first off , DON ’T buy any of Steve ’s power hours or products .
Not only are they all TERRIBLE , but why would you want to support this jerk ?
Secondly , you can use your free speech to help warn other consumers about how truly lame these products are .
Power Hour , LLC sells its power hours on several websites that allow public reviews and commenting .
Feel free to check out the products and post your thoughts on them !
Please keep your reviews civil and make them about the quality of the products ( not about this trademark issue ) !
If we work together , we can save “ Power Hour ” for binge drinkers everywhere !

Yesterday I talked about the energy efficiency tax credits for home improvements that homeowners can take advantage of through the end of 2010 .
They can use the tax credits upgrade their windows , heaters , insulation and other energy efficient products .
The Obama administration is now trying to get another program passed to give rebates to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes .
It is called the Homestar Program .
( No , it is n't related to THIS Homestar )
Here 's a video of the president explaining the bill :
Continues after Advertisement
WhiteHouse.gov :
Today , while touring a training facility at Savannah Technical College , the President outlined more details of a new “ HOMESTAR ” program that would help create jobs by encouraging American families to invest in energy saving home improvements .
Consistent with the President ’s call for a HOMESTAR program , the Senate Democratic leadership included a proposal of this kind as part of their Jobs Agenda released on February 4 , 2010 .
The President looks forward to continuing to work with Members of Congress , business , environmental and labor leaders to enact a HOMESTAR program into law .
So the president wants to get people back to work and increase the energy efficiency of their homes while he 's at it .
How will the new rebate program for energy efficient home improvements work ?
Energy Efficient Home Improvements Rebate
The bill has several goals , among them increasing energy savings , reducing dependence on foreign sources of energy and helping to easeAims of this bill include :
Get contruction workers / etc back to work to help ease 25 % unemployment .
Boost demand for energy efficient products .
Increase energy savings for families .
( According to the White House consumers in the program are expected to see savings of “ between $ 200 – $ 500 per year in energy costs ” )
Retrofit Program Details
Details Of What You 'll Get With The Homestar Program :
Rebates delivered directly to consumers : Like the Cash for Clunkers program , consumers would be eligible for direct HOMESTAR rebates at the point of sale for a variety of energy - saving investments in their homes .
Retailers are reimbursed by the government .

$ 1,000 – $ 1,500 Silver Star Rebates :
For simple upgrades consumers could be eligible for up to 50 % rebates of $ 1,000 – $ 1,500 .
Things included in this are insulation , duct sealing , water heaters , HVAC units , windows , roofing and doors .
R ebates are up to a maximum of $ 3,000 per home .

Support for financing :
The program would include support to State and local governments to provide financing options for consumers seeking to make efficiency investments in their homes .
When Will Homestar Program Become Law ?
On May 6th , 2010 the Homestar Program was passed by a vote of the House of Representatives .
Next up will be a vote in the Senate .
If that vote also passes it will most likely be signed into law by the President .
Remember , this program differs from the current home improvement tax credit that runs until 12/31/2010 .
This one is a 50 % rebate , instead of a 30 % tax credit .
You could possibly come out ahead if you wait , and use this rebate instead !
Are you working in construction – and do you think this bill would help improve your work outlook ?
Looking to improve your home 's energy efficiency ?
Will this bill give you the incentive you need to get those changes made ?
What do you think ?

New York Cheesecake
Adapted from Gourmet Magazine , a perfect example of why I miss it so
The changes I made to the original recipe were to one and three - fifths ( yes , exactly that ) the crumb crust because I like those that go up the walls ( you still might have a smidge more than you need but I figure it is less annoying than measuring the recipe in 7 tablespoon amounts ) , significantly reducing the zest ( because as far as I ’m concerned , the entire zest from two citrus fruits is an absurdly high amount ) , fudging ( unsuccessfully ) with the baking time and adding a completely optional cherry topping .
That is not from a can .
You are welcome .
Crumb crust
8 ounces ( 15 4 3/4 x 2 1/2 - inch sheets of graham cracker ; yes , I am crazy enough to both count and measure ) finely ground graham crackers or cookies such as chocolate or vanilla wafers
8 tablespoons ( 1 stick or 4 ounces or 113 grams ) unsalted butter , melted
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
Very tall cheesecake filling :
5 ( 8 - ounce ) packages cream cheese , softened ( Philadelphia is recommended for cheesecakes but if you ’ve had success with other brands , feel free to use them again )
1 3/4 cups sugar
3 tablespoons all - purpose flour
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
5 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Cherry topping
10 ounces sweet or sour cherries , pitted ( they ’re not in season here so I used frozen ; worked just fine )
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup sugar *
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup water
Make crumb crust :
Stir together crust ingredients and press onto bottom and up the sides , stopping one inch shy of the top rim ** , of a buttered 9 1/2 - inch ( or 24 cm ) springform pan .
You can fill it right away but I like to pop my into the freezer so it quickly sets while I prepare the filling .
Make very tall cheesecake filling : Preheat oven to 550 F degrees ***.
Beat together cream cheese , sugar , flour and zest with an electric mixer until smooth .
Add vanilla , then eggs and yolks , one at a time , beating on low speed until each ingredient is incorporated .
Scrape bowl down between additions ; I cannot stress this enough as if you do not , you ’ll end up with unmixed stripes of cream cheese .
I always find at least one , despite my best efforts .
Put springform pan with crust in a shallow baking pan ( to catch drips ) .
Pour filling into crust ( springform pan will be completely full ) and baking in baking pan in the middle of the oven for 12 minutes or until puffed .
Please watch your cake because some ovens will top - brown very quickly and if yours does too fast , turn the oven down as soon as you catch it .
Reduce the temperature to 200 degrees ( see Note below about my baking drama ) and continue baking until cake is mostly firm ( center will still be slightly wobbly when pan is gently shaken ) , about one hour more .
Run a knife around the top edge of the cake to loosen it and cool the cake completely in springform on a rack , then chill it , loosely covered , at least 6 hours .
Make cherry topping ( optional ) : Place all ingredients together in a medium saucepan .
Bring to a boil .
Once it is boiling , cook it for an additional one to two minutes then remove from heat .
Cool completely .
Remove side of pan and transfer cake to a plate .
If you had any wonky baking issues ( see my Note below ) , you might need to trim the cake flat .
I promise not to tell anyone what happened to those scraps , okay ?
Spread topping ( if using ) over chilled cheesecake .
The original recipe says to bring this to room temperature before serving , but I never have !
Do ahead : Cheesecake keeps , covered and chilled , 2 weeks .
Baking drama :
As some of the pictures might suggest , I really borked ( an actual word , thank you ) the baking of this cake .
First , I was convinced that 550 degrees would singe my cake so I did the first step at 400 , to see if you can get away with it .
Yes , I am guilty of not following a recipe from time to time too .
It turns out , 550 would have been just fine .
Then , although I turned my oven down to 200 , I did n’t check the thermometer inside my junky oven , and had I , I ’d have realized that what my oven calls 200 is more like 150 .
And an hour later , was almost completely raw .
Then I upped it to 300 , which my oven told me was actually 250 , where it still took another hour to bake and gained many cracks .
I blame the fact that the oven did n’t start hot enough , as many others have made this recipe crack - free .
What ’s the point of me sharing this ?
To give you a heads up that oven wonkiness may ensue .
What matters is that , in the end , you do not take the cake out before it is ready .
An accurate oven helps too .
I ’m going to get right on that .
* You might dial this up by up to another 1 / 4 cup if you ’re using sour cherries .
However , if you ’re using sour cherries I ’m going to assume it is because you like them , and the more tart taste they impart , thus you probably will enjoy this sauce just as much with only 1 /4 cup sugar .
Look at me , psychologizing !
** This is updated based on responses from commenters .
Thank you , intrepid home bakers !
*** Yes , this is correct , but updated to note 9/12/10 that please , if you are using a Teflon - coated pan , note it ’s temperature limit , often around 475 , and only start your baking temperature there .

A federal judge in Wisconsin declared Thursday that the US law authorizing a National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional .
US District Judge Barbara Crabb said the federal statute violates the First Amendment ’s prohibition on government endorsement of religion .
She issued a 66 - page decision and enjoined President Obama from issuing an executive order calling for the celebration of a National Day of Prayer .
The National Day of Prayer was first authorized by Congress in 1952 .
Since 1988 , the date has been set as the first Thursday in May .
The judge stayed her own injunction pending the resolution of any appeals .
“ I understand that many may disagree with [ my ] conclusion and some may even view it as critical of prayer or those who pray .
That is unfortunate , ” Judge Crabb wrote .
' The government may not endorse a religious message '
“ A determination that the government may not endorse a religious message is not a determination that the message itself is harmful , unimportant , or undeserving of dissemination , ” she said .
“ Rather it is part of the effort to carry out the Founders ’ plan of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society . ”
The action came as a result of a lawsuit filed by members of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , a Madison , Wisconsin group founded in 1976 .
The group is pledged to promote the concept of separation of church and state .
It also seeks to educate the public on matters of “ nontheism . ”
The Rev. Barry Lynn , executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , praised Judge Crabb ’s ruling .
“ This decision is a tremendous victory for religious liberty , ” he said .
“ Congress has no business telling Americans when or how to pray . ”
Lynn added : “ The Constitution forbids the government to meddle in religious matters .
Decisions about worship should be made by individuals without direction from elected officials .
That ’s what freedom is all about . ”
Navigating between US Supreme Court rulings
Judge Crabb said the case challenging the prayer statute arose at the intersection of competing lines of US Supreme Court jurisprudence .
On one side , the court has said that the government violates the First Amendment ’s establishment clause when it endorses a particular religious belief or practice , such as prayer .
On the other side , the court has also ruled that some public displays of religion are merely “ ceremonial deism , ” reflecting a general religious heritage , but not crossing the line to unconstitutional endorsement .
Crabb said in her view the key test between these two conflicting lines of decision is whether the government ’s conduct “ serves a significant secular purpose and is not a call for religious action on the part of citizens . ”
She said the law establishing a National Day of Prayer cannot meet that test .
“ It goes beyond mere acknowledgment of religion because its sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer , an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function in this context , ” the judge wrote .
“ In this instance , the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience , ” she wrote .
Judge Crabb said her ruling is not a “ judgment on the value of prayer or the millions of Americans who believe in its power . ”
She added : “ Recognizing the importance of prayer to many people does not mean the government may enact a statute in support of it , any more than the government may encourage citizens to fast during the month of Ramadan , attend a synagogue , purify themselves in a sweat lodge , or practice rune magic . ”
Updated with comment from Greylock ’s Reid Hoffman .
Mozilla chief executive John Lilly plans to leave the company and join venture firm Greylock Partners .
Mozilla , which is best - known for creating the Firefox web browser , said it ’s now beginning the search for a new CEO .
The news was first reported on AllThingsD , and has since been officially announced in a blog post by Mitchell Baker , chairman of the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation .
( The foundation owns the for - profit Mozilla Corp . )
Baker writes that when Lilly joined Mozilla five years ago , serving first as chief operating officer and then as CEO , he claimed he only wanted to stay for two years before going into the venture capital industry .
Baker adds :
Sometime this year John will step down from his role as CEO at Mozilla to join the venture firm Greylock Partners , returning to his original plan of investing .
John will remain on the Board of the Mozilla Corporation .
And he will also remain at Mozilla during the transition .
The timing of this announcement — just as we begin a formal search for a new CEO — is to make this process more open than is generally the case and is a reflection of the uniqueness of Mozilla as a public benefit organization dedicated to openness and participation in Internet life .
It ’s been a pleasure to work with John in building an organization that marries our public benefit mission with extraordinary reach and excellence in execution .
Mozilla is now on a path to reaching half a billion people ( 400 million so far ) around the world in more than 78 languages , Firefox on mobile is coming to life — and Mozilla ’s global community and organization is bringing individual empowerment to more people and more areas of Internet life than ever before .
Mozilla ’s importance in the last five years goes beyond Baker ’s litany of products and user numbers .
Company spokespeople like to argue that Firefox sparked the emergence of real competition in the browser market .
In fact , this news comes just after the public ’s first look at the next version of the browser , Firefox 4 , which looks rather similar to Google ’s new browser Chrome .
This move also marks Greylock ’s latest hire of a high - profile entrepreneur — it brought on Linked In founder Reid Hoffman back in November .
Update : Greylock just emailed the following statement from Hoffman :
When we announced three weeks ago that we had mistakenly included code in our software that collected samples of payload data from WiFi networks , we said we would ask a third party to review the software at issue , how it worked , and what data it gathered .
That report , by the security consulting firm
, is now complete and was sent to the interested data protection authorities today .
In short , it confirms that Google did indeed collect and store payload data from unencrypted WiFi networks , but not from networks that were encrypted .
You can read the report
.
We are continuing to work with the relevant authorities to respond to their questions and concerns .

Turning Planetary Theory Upside Down
The discovery of nine new transiting exoplanets is announced today at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting ( NAM2010 ) .
When these new results were combined with earlier observations of transiting exoplanets astronomers were surprised to find that six out of a larger sample of 27 were found to be orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of their host star — the exact reverse of what is seen in our own Solar System .
The new discoveries provide an unexpected and serious challenge to current theories of planet formation .
They also suggest that systems with exoplanets of the type known as hot Jupiters are unlikely to contain Earth - like planets .
“ This is a real bomb we are dropping into the field of exoplanets , ” says Amaury Triaud , a PhD student at the Geneva Observatory who , with Andrew Cameron and Didier Queloz , leads a major part of the observational campaign .
Planets are thought to form in the disc of gas and dust encircling a young star .
This proto-planetary disc rotates in the same direction as the star itself , and up to now it was expected that planets that form from the disc would all orbit in more or less the same plane , and that they would move along their orbits in the same direction as the star ’s rotation .
This is the case for the planets in the Solar System .
After the initial detection of the nine new exoplanets [ 1 ] with the Wide Angle Search for Planets ( WASP , [ 2 ] ) , the team of astronomers used the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6 - metre ESO telescope at the La Silla observatory in Chile , along with data from the Swiss Euler telescope , also at La Silla , and data from other telescopes to confirm the discoveries and characterise the transiting exoplanets [ 3 ] found in both the new and older surveys .
Surprisingly , when the team combined the new data with older observations they found that more than half of all the hot Jupiters [ 4 ] studied have orbits that are misaligned with the rotation axis of their parent stars .
They even found that six exoplanets in this extended study ( of which two are new discoveries ) have retrograde motion : they orbit their star in the “ wrong ” direction .
“ The new results really challenge the conventional wisdom that planets should always orbit in the same direction as their stars spin , ” says Andrew Cameron of the University of St Andrews , who presented the new results at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting ( NAM2010 ) in Glasgow this week .
In the 15 years since the first hot Jupiters were discovered , their origin has been a puzzle .
These are planets with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter , but that orbit very close to their suns .
The cores of giant planets are thought to form from a mix of rock and ice particles found only in the cold outer reaches of planetary systems .
Hot Jupiters must therefore form far from their star and subsequently migrate inwards to orbits much closer to the parent star .
Many astronomers believed this was due to gravitational interactions with the disc of dust from which they formed .
This scenario takes place over a few million years and results in an orbit aligned with the rotation axis of the parent star .
It would also allow Earth - like rocky planets to form subsequently , but unfortunately it cannot account for the new observations .
To account for the new retrograde exoplanets an alternative migration theory suggests that the proximity of hot Jupiters to their stars is not due to interactions with the dust disc at all , but to a slower evolution process involving a gravitational tug - of - war with more distant planetary or stellar companions over hundreds of millions of years .
After these disturbances have bounced a giant exoplanet into a tilted and elongated orbit it would suffer tidal friction , losing energy every time it swung close to the star .
It would eventually become parked in a near circular , but randomly tilted , orbit close to the star .
“ A dramatic side - effect of this process is that it would wipe out any other smaller Earth - like planet in these systems , ” says Didier Queloz of Geneva Observatory .
Two of the newly discovered retrograde planets have already been found to have more distant , massive companions that could potentially be the cause of the upset .
These new results will trigger an intensive search for additional bodies in other planetary systems .
This research was presented at the Royal Astronomical Society National Astronomy Meeting ( NAM2010 ) that is taking place this week in Glasgow , Scotland .
Nine publications submitted to international journals will be released on this occasion , four of them using data from ESO facilities .
On the same occasion , the WASP consortium was awarded the 2010 Royal Astronomical Society Group Achievement Award .
Notes
[ 1 ]
The current count of known exoplanets is 454 .
[ 2 ]
The nine newly found exoplanets were discovered by the Wide Angle Search for Planets ( WASP ) .
WASP comprises two robotic observatories , each consisting of eight wide - angle cameras that simultaneously monitor the sky continuously for planetary transit events .
A transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its parent star , temporarily blocking some of the light from it .
The eight wide - angle cameras allow millions of stars to be monitored simultaneously to detect these rare transit events .
The WASP cameras are operated by a consortium including Queen ’s University Belfast , the Universities of Keele , Leicester and St Andrews , the Open University , the Isaac Newton Group on La Palma and the Instituto Astrofisica Canarias .
[ 3 ]
To confirm the discovery and characterise a new transiting planet , it is necessary to do radial velocity follow - up to detect the wobble of the host star around its common centre of mass with the planet .
This is done with a worldwide network of telescopes equipped with sensitive spectrometers .
In the northern hemisphere , the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands and the SOPHIE instrument on the 1.93 - metre telescope at Haute - Provence in France lead the search .
In the south , the HARPS exoplanet hunter attached to the 3.6 - metre ESO telescope and the CORALIE spectrometer on the Euler Swiss telescope , both at La Silla , were used to confirm the new planets and measure the angle through which each planet 's orbit is tilted relative to its star 's equator .
The robotic Faulkes Telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory , located in Hawaii and Australia , provided the brightness measurements that determined the sizes of the planets .
Follow - up observations of WASP exoplanet candidates are obtained at the Swiss Euler Telescope at La Silla , Chile ( in collaboration with colleagues at Geneva Observatory ) , at the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma , and at the 1.93 - metre telescope of the Observatoire de Haute - Provence in France ( in collaboration with colleagues at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris and the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille ) .
The studies of the orbital tilt angles of the WASP planets were made with the HARPS instrument on the ESO 3.6 - metre telescope and with the CORALIE instrument on the Euler Swiss telescope , both at La Silla in the southern hemisphere , and at Tautenburg Observatory , McDonald Observatory and the Nordic Optical Telescope in the northern hemisphere .
[ 4 ]
Hot Jupiters are planets orbiting other stars that have masses similar to , or greater than , that of Jupiter , but that orbit their parent stars much more closely than any of the planets in our own Solar System .
Because they are both large and close they are easier to detect from their gravitational effect on their stars and also more likely to transit the disc of the star .
Most of the first exoplanets to be found were of this class .

Guardian survey reveals significant increase in the electorate , especially among young people , which could see 6 May turnout soar
The number of people registering to vote has increased markedly , adding a new generation of voters to the electorate and making the outcome of the election even more volatile , according to a survey of marginal constituencies conducted by the Guardian .
Figures collected from more than 20 of the most marginal areas following Tuesday 's deadline to register to vote indicate across - the - board increases in the electorate , compared with the last general election , suggesting that turnout could soar on 6 May .
In one area , the increase is as high as 17 % , and there are also indications of a dramatic surge in people requesting postal votes .
The volume of postal vote requests doubled in some areas compared with 2005 , putting electoral administration systems under pressure and raising new concerns about postal voting fraud and the extent to which parties are manipulating the system to boost their vote .
Candidates in three separate areas told the Guardian that postal votes were central to their campaign .
One said they had redoubled their efforts to sign people up for postal votes as the margins between the parties tightened and the prospect of a hung parliament and a second election this year grew ever more likely .
The Liberal Democrats could benefit disproportionately from the boost in numbers and postal votes .
The Electoral Commission has said that those expressing an interest in registering were disproportionately in the youngest age bracket of 18 - 24 – the same group that recent polls show backing the Lib Dems .
Previous trends show that people who use a postal vote send it quickly after they receive it meaning that millions of people will be voting in the next week when the party is still high in the polls on the back of the first TV debate .
The Guardian approached 25 local authorities to request figures on voter registration and postal votes after Tuesday 's deadline for applications .
Nearly every response revealed an increase in both figures compared with the 2005 election after being adjusted for boundary changes .
A spokesman for Wandsworth council , which covers three constituencies , including the marginal seat of Battersea , described a " terrific surge " in applications .
There had been predictions that interest in voting would fall following the expenses saga .
But today 's figures suggest that reforms to the registration system and possibly the tight nature of this election could be countering that effect .
In Sittingbourne and Sheppey the electorate increased by 17 % after adjustments for boundary changes and postal votes went from 6,429 in 2005 to 9,529 this week .
In Crawley , registrations have gone up by 1.2 % , but postal votes by 11 % to 12,076 .
Ceredigion , which had a very minor boundary change , saw an 11 % increase in registrations to 59,607 and postal votes more than double from 2,954 to 6,732 .
Registrations were all but unchanged in Edinburgh South since 2005 , but postal votes had increased by 60 % .
Brian Brown , head of electoral administration for Edinburgh South , said they had to extend deadlines to send postal votes out in order to cope with the surplus .
" We 've had a significant surge in late applications , " he said .
Barnet council , which covers three constituencies , including the marginal Finchley & Golders Green , reported 12 % more registrations and 63 % more postal votes .
Brighton council , which also covers three constituencies , had a 2 % increase in registrations compared with the last election and 40 % increase in postal votes .
Paul Holloway , head of electoral services Brighton and Hove city council , said : " We have seen a healthy surge in the numbers of residents making contact to ensure they are registered to vote ... we have averaged around 2,000 alterations to the register every month and the post we receive recently has tripled .
" Our campaigns have also targeted students and just yesterday a group
of university students came into the office with a whole box load of
registration forms . "
Some 500,000 registration forms were downloaded from the Electoral Commission website and 50,000 calls were made to a registration helpline .
A survey of visitors to the website found that 40 % were aged 18 - 24 .
Jenny Watson , the chair of the Electoral Commission , said that increases in registrations followed major reforms of the system which allowed people to register in the first 11 days of the campaign whereas previously , people could only register up until the election was called .
A new online system that allows people to download application forms has also made the system more user - friendly , she said .
Three candidates , whose constituencies were not covered in the survey , described how postal votes were central to their canvassing .
One Labour candidate said : " Normally at this point we would consolidate and go back to core voters .
But this time we are doing even more .
We 've got huge numbers of postal votes signed up – probably another 4,000 .
" If they are voting Labour we want to know : ' Can you get there ?
Are you on holiday ?
How can we help ? '
We 're going round the care homes because they are going to need a postal vote and we need them . "
It is not illegal to encourage supporters to register for a vote , but political activists are not allowed to touch or handle voters ' ballot papers .
There is a national code of conduct to which the parties have signed up to prevent fraud , but some areas are supplementing that with even tougher guidelines .
In Kettering this year , one in four registered voters have requested a postal vote .
David Cook , the chief executive of Kettering council and the acting returning officer , said : " Some years ago , highly publicised cases of fraud in other areas damaged confidence in postal voting .
All the local party candidates , their respective agents and I came together to agree a local code to help further assure voters that the postal voting system was both convenient and safe . "
Tribune has filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would allow it to keep its newspapers and broadcast stations while sharply reducing the debt that has threatened to sink the media company .
But two groups of lenders that say they are owed nearly $ 5 billion combined have signaled that they will try to block the plan .
In a court filing earlier Monday , one group described a purported global settlement that forms the backbone of the reorganization plan " dead on arrival . "
If the plan is approved , ownership of the Chicago - based company would go to a group of lenders that include JP Morgan Chase and Angelo , Gordon & Co .
Those lenders support the plan .
The Tribune owns the Los Angeles Times , Chicago Tribune and other newspapers and broadcast stations .
If properly handled , it is entirely safe to use metal in a microwave .
The traditional wisdom stems from the fact that when improperly handled , metal can arc and cause problems .
While it takes some care , and should certainly not just be attempted randomly , there is no reason why everyone should n’t be able to use metal in a microwave .
A microwave .
Microwave ovens work by using a device called a magnetron that sends out microwave radiation — electromagnetic waves — at a frequency of about 2.45 GHz , meaning they vibrate at almost two and a half billion times a second .
When these waves come into contact with metal , they excite its electrons , which then start moving rapidly , and bounce the microwaves bounce off them .
For this reason , we can say that metal reflects microwaves .
Metal in a microwave can overheat the magnetron .
Many other substances , most notably water and fats , do n’t reflect microwaves .
Instead , they absorb the energy , which in turn heats up whatever absorbed it , and that ’s how food gets cooked .
Certain types of metal can catch fire if heated in a microwave .
When one puts metal in a microwave , and that metal is long and pointed , it essentially acts as an antenna to the microwave energy bouncing off of it .
This can create arcs of energy , which can cause sparks that tend to scare people .
The sparks can also arc to the edge of the microwave if they ’re near enough , and may even cause an increase in temperature within the magnetron , reducing the life of the microwave .
Because of the danger to the life of the machine , and because of the fear such arcing causes in consumers , most manufacturers recommend that people not use metal in one .
These small arcs actually are almost never cause for alarm .
A microwave is closed while operating , and a small arc of this magnitude is little different from a static discharge when your finger touches a piece of metal if you ’ve been walking across carpet .
Only certain metal in a microwave , most notably thin metal stripping that is often used as decoration on some china or glass , is cause for alarm .
This metal can actually heat up enough to catch fire , or at least damage the item it ’s on .
In fact , one of the biggest dangers people have when putting metal in a microwave is that they choose some sort of metal that has plastic attached .
Many metal pots and pans have plastic handles made of phenolic , which may explode if placed in the microwave .
There are , however , pots and pans made specifically for use in the microwave that are made of metal .
These are usually labeled as Microwave Safe , and can be used for a wide range of cooking .
Although not for everyone , cooking with metal in a microwave can actually give results closer to traditional convection cooking than any other form of microwave cooking .
If the proper materials are used , and care is taken , cooking with metal can produce brown crusts , and perfectly evenly heated foods .
Robin Hanson proposed stores where banned products could be sold .

There are a number of excellent arguments for such a policy — an inherent right of individual liberty , the career incentive of bureaucrats to prohibit everything , legislators being just as biased as individuals .
But even so ( I replied ) , some poor , honest , not overwhelmingly educated mother of five children is going to go into these stores and buy a “ Dr. Snakeoil ’s Sulfuric Acid Drink ” for her arthritis and die , leaving her orphans to weep on national television .
I was just making a factual observation .
Why did some people think it was an argument in favor of regulation ?
On questions of simple fact ( for example , whether Earthly life arose by natural selection ) there ’s a legitimate expectation that the argument should be a one - sided battle ; the facts themselves are either one way or another , and the so - called “ balance of evidence ” should reflect this .
Indeed , under the Bayesian definition of evidence , “ strong evidence ” is just that sort of evidence which we only expect to find on one side of an argument .
But there is no reason for complex actions with many consequences to exhibit this onesidedness property .
Why do people seem to want their policy debates to be one - sided ?
Politics is the mind - killer .
Arguments are soldiers .
Once you know which side you ’re on , you must support all arguments of that side , and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side ; otherwise it ’s like stabbing your soldiers in the back .
If you abide within that pattern , policy debates will also appear one - sided to you — the costs and drawbacks of your favored policy are enemy soldiers , to be attacked by any means necessary .
One should also be aware of a related failure pattern : thinking that the course of Deep Wisdom is to compromise with perfect evenness between whichever two policy positions receive the most airtime .
A policy may legitimately have lopsided costs or benefits .
If policy questions were not tilted one way or the other , we would be unable to make decisions about them .
But there is also a human tendency to deny all costs of a favored policy , or deny all benefits of a disfavored policy ; and people will therefore tend to think policy tradeoffs are tilted much further than they actually are .
If you allow shops that sell otherwise banned products , some poor , honest , poorly educated mother of five kids is going to buy something that kills her .
This is a prediction about a factual consequence , and as a factual question it appears rather straightforward — a sane person should readily confess this to be true regardless of which stance they take on the policy issue .
You may also think that making things illegal just makes them more expensive , that regulators will abuse their power , or that her individual freedom trumps your desire to meddle with her life .
But , as a matter of simple fact , she ’s still going to die .
We live in an unfair universe .
Like all primates , humans have strong negative reactions to perceived unfairness ; thus we find this fact stressful .
There are two popular methods of dealing with the resulting cognitive dissonance .
First , one may change one ’s view of the facts — deny that the unfair events took place , or edit the history to make it appear fair .
2
Second , one may change one ’s morality — deny that the events are unfair .
Some libertarians might say that if you go into a “ banned products shop , ” passing clear warning labels that say Things In This Store May Kill
You , and buy something that kills you , then it ’s your own fault and you deserve it .
If that were a moral truth , there would be no downside to having shops that sell banned products .
It would n’t just be a net benefit , it would be a one - sided tradeoff with no drawbacks .
Others argue that regulators can be trained to choose rationally and in harmony with consumer interests ; if those were the facts of the matter then ( in their moral view ) there would be no downside to regulation .
Like it or not , there ’s a birth lottery for intelligence — though this is one of the cases where the universe ’s unfairness is so extreme that many people choose to deny the facts .
The experimental evidence for a purely genetic component of 0.6 –0.8 is overwhelming , but even if this were to be denied , you do n’t choose your parental upbringing or your early schools either .
I was raised to believe that denying reality is a moral wrong .
If I were to engage in wishful optimism about how Sulfuric Acid Drink was likely to benefit me , I would be doing something that I was warned against and raised to regard as unacceptable .
Some people are born into environments — we wo n’t discuss their genes , because that part is too unfair — where the local witch doctor tells them that it is right to have faith and wrong to be skeptical .
In all goodwill , they follow this advice and die .
Unlike you , they were n’t raised to believe that people are responsible for their individual choices to follow society ’s lead .
Do you really think you ’re so smart that you would have been a proper scientific skeptic even if you ’d been born in 500 CE ?
Yes , there is a birth lottery , no matter what you believe about genes .
Saying “ People who buy dangerous products deserve to get hurt ! ” is not tough - minded .
It is a way of refusing to live in an unfair universe .
Real tough - mindedness is saying , “ Yes , sulfuric acid is a horrible painful death , and no , that mother of five children did n’t deserve it , but we ’re going to keep the shops open anyway because we did this cost - benefit calculation . ”
Can you imagine a politician saying that ?
Neither can I . But insofar as economists have the power to influence policy , it might help if they could think it privately — maybe even say it in journal articles , suitably dressed up in polysyllabismic obfuscationalization so the media ca n’t quote it .
I do n’t think that when someone makes a stupid choice and dies , this is a cause for celebration .
I count it as a tragedy .
It is not always helping people , to save them from the consequences of their own actions ; but I draw a moral line at capital punishment .
If you ’re dead , you ca n’t learn from your mistakes .
Unfortunately the universe does n’t agree with me .
We ’ll see which one of us is still standing when this is over .
President Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4 , 1961 .
A scanned image of his birth certificate released during the 2008 presidential campaign says he was , and Hawaii ’s health director and its registrar of vital statistics have confirmed it .
Despite all that , a substantial number of Americans are not convinced .
In a recent New York Times / CBS News poll , 58 percent said Mr. Obama was born in the United States .
That leaves a significant minority who said they thought he was born in another country ( 20 percent ) or said they did not know ( 23 percent ) .
( Question No. 50 in the poll . )
The issue continues to hold sway in some parts of the country , fueled in some cases by the Internet or by television talk shows .
In follow - up interviews , some poll respondents were generally vague in explaining how they developed their doubts about Mr. Obama ’s birth .
The Constitution states that presidents must be natural born citizens , which respondents were informed of in the question posed to them .
Adding to the notion that those doubts still resonate , the Arizona House of Representatives on Monday approved an amendment that would require the president — or any candidate seeking the presidency — to produce an actual birth certificate to get on the ballot .
So far , it ’s a one - house bill .
Similar legislation promoted by fringe groups known as the “ birthers ” — who question the legitimacy of Mr. Obama ’s presidency — have been proposed in a few other states .
But many lawmakers and legal experts dismiss the need for such measures since federal candidates already have to meet citizenship requirements .
Last weekend , at a rally in South Carolina , Tom Tancredo , a former congressman from Colorado and a 2008 Republican presidential candidate , raised the issue anew , asking about Mr. Obama : “ If his wife says Kenya is his homeland , why do n’t we just send him back ? ” ( Mr. Obama ’s father was from Kenya . )
Indeed , the belief that the president was born in another country peaks among his detractors – those who disapprove of the job he ’s doing as president and have an unfavorable view of him .
That includes 32 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of those who describe themselves as very conservative , according to the poll .
Less educated Americans and senior citizens are also more likely to think so than younger or better educated respondents .
The poll did not include any follow - up questions on the issue , so The Times called back some of the respondents to find out why they do not believe the president was born in the United States , where they think he was born instead and where they get their information .
Several respondents said they thought he was born in Africa ( some specifically said Kenya ) , while others mentioned Iran , Malaysia , Indonesia ( where Mr. Obama spent time as a child with his mother ) , or said they did n’t know .
Sources of information included the Internet , TV , newspapers and friends .
But the respondents were generally vague , with some suggesting that part of the skepticism regarding the president ’s birthplace may have more to do with distrust of Mr. Obama himself than with any evidence they have seen on the issue .
“ I really have n’t talked to anyone about him , ” said Irene Santiago , 67 , a Republican of Modesto , Calif . ” I just have a gut - level feeling that he is not an honest man .
He is deceptive . ”
Tommy Barnett , 56 , an independent of Cullman , Ala. , said : “ Somebody told me he ’s not from here .
I said I never heard of Barack Obama , that ’s not American , then we find out he ’s Muslim .
What they got somebody like that running our country for ? ”
The Obama - is - a- Muslim rumor has dogged him since he was a candidate for the presidency ; Mr. Obama and his family are Christians .
Another poll respondent , Duane Rasmussen , a Republican from Reno , Nev. , questioned the validity of Mr. Obama ’s papers .
“ He has not produced a birth certificate from Hawaii , ” Mr. Rasmussen said .
“ There were some pseudo - tries , and all of them have problems as birth certificates .
They were not authentic .
I believe he is a socialist . ”
Harriet Tillman , 75 , an independent from Corpus Christi , Tex. , said : “ After listening to the various news stories that have come out , I think there is a serious question about where he was born .
I got it from TV primarily .
It was probably somebody on Fox . …
It ’s been a while , and I have n’t thought about it since .
I did feel before he was elected that he was really too young and too inexperienced to be elected , and I just do n’t think he handles things as well as he sometimes should . ”
Still others said that while they were n’t sure where he was born , it did n’t really matter to them .
“ I said that because I ’m not really informed well enough to know for sure , ” Tracy Schepker , 44 , a Democrat of Glenwood , Iowa , said .
“ I think I just heard rumors on TV that he was a Muslim or born somewhere else , but I do n’t necessarily believe it .
I do n’t know and it does n’t matter because he ’s doing everything to the best of his ability and making history . ”
Chris Garrett , 26 , of Waggaman , La. , said : “ I do n’t know for sure where he ’s from actually , but it does n’t really matter .
I think he ’s doing a good job .
He took over a job that was already messed up , and he ’s trying to fix it the best he can . ”
And one response went beyond Mr. Obama and underscored the broad dissatisfaction with the government that the poll found .
Paul Ivester , 67 , a Democrat of Joshua Tree , Calif. , said : “ I do n’t care where he was born .
I have n’t voted in a long time .
Both parties seem the same . ”
In July of last year , Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , expressed frustration with those who continued to express disbelief about Mr. Obama ’s citizenship .
Asked about the “ birthers ” at a briefing , Mr. Gibbs said : “ I almost hate to indulge in such an august setting as the White House — and I mean this in seriousness — the White House briefing room , discussing the made - up fictional nonsense of whether the president was born in this country .
If I had some DNA , it would n’t assuage those that do n’t believe he was born here .
But I have news for them and for all of us :
The president was born in Honolulu , Hawaii , the 50th state of the greatest country on the face of the earth .
He ’s a citizen . ”
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted April 5 - 12 with 1,580 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .

An 8 - year - old boy who is a Dutch citizen is the sole survivor of a deadly plane crash in Libya , airline officials said Wednesday .
Afriqiyah Airways confirmed on its website late Wednesday that the other 92 passengers and 11 crew members were killed when the plane crashed while trying to land at the Tripoli International Airport .
The child , identified as Ruben van Assouw , suffered multiple fractures in his lower limbs and underwent an operation at Al Khadra Hospital in Tripoli , a doctor at the hospital said .
The boy has seen a Dutch Embassy representative and is sedated and asleep , she said .
i Report : Share images from the scene
The Dutch Foreign Ministry , which had a representative at the hospital waiting to identify the boy , declined to confirm the child 's name .
The Afriqiyah Airways plane originated in Johannesburg , South Africa .
Of those killed , 58 passengers were Dutch , six South African , two Libyan , two Austrian , one German , one French , one Zimbabwean and two British .
Another 19 passengers ' nationalities could not immediately be identified .
The 11 crew members were all Libyan .
The plane , an Airbus A330 - 200 , was at the end of its nearly nine - hour flight when it crashed at 6 a.m .
" We express our sincere regret and sadness on behalf of the airline .
As well , we would like to express our condolences to the relatives and friends of those who had passengers on Flight 8U771 destined for Tripoli late last night , due to arrive around 6 o'clock this morning , " said Nicky Knapp , a representative of the Airports Company South Africa .
She was speaking on behalf of Afriqiyah Airways .
Jerzy Buzek , president of the European Parliament , said the child 's survival , " given this tragic event , is truly a miracle . "
At the crash site , workers with surgical masks combed through the smoldering wreckage , which spilled over a large area .
A wheel lay atop a pile of bags .
Two green airline seats sat upright and intact amid burned parts of the aircraft .
Officials recovered the plane 's flight data recorder , which investigators use to piece together a flight 's last minutes .
The Tripoli - based Afriqiyah ( Arabic for " African " ) operates flights to four continents .
The planes in the fleet carry the logo 9.9.99 : the date when the African Union was formed .
The plane that crashed was one of three Airbus 330- 200s that the airline owns .

Ayman Najafi is " angry " at the verdict A British man accused of breaking Dubai 's decency laws by kissing a woman in public has had his final appeal against conviction rejected .
Ayman Najafi , 24 , from Palmers Green , north London , will now have to serve a month in prison .
Charlotte Adams , 26 , from Essex , has served a month 's jail term after the kiss in a restaurant .
The couple insisted it was a peck on the cheek , but a woman complained that they were kissing on the mouth .
Najafi , who remains in Dubai , told the BBC he was " very angry and very sad that the verdict has come to this " .
He had been " optimistic that a solution could be reached " and said he was " disappointed that the courts had not called on any of his witnesses " .
Najafi now has 24 hours in which to turn himself in to the authorities .
He will serve a month in prison before being deported at the end of that sentence .
AT THE SCENE By Ben Thompson , Middle East business correspondent Dubai might look very liberal and very lenient with its five - star hotels and expensive shopping malls - but beneath the glitzy exterior , the UAE is a muslim country governed by strict islamic laws .
And that is where many expats fall foul .
Knowing what is and is not allowed here remains a grey area .
Behaviour tolerated one day might be punished the next .
It is not hard to find photos in glossy magazines of celebrity holidaymakers kissing on Dubai 's beaches .
But as Ayman Najafi and Charlotte Adams found out , it is an offence that could lead to a month in prison .
But this case has also thrown Dubai 's legal system into the spotlight .
The original complaint was made by a local Emirati woman .
She never appeared in court and lawyers were never able to contact her .
The defence also claimed she had not seen the incident herself and instead had based her testimony on the evidence of her young child .
Yet in many ways , this case is about much more than a kiss .
With 80 % of Dubai 's population made up of expatriates , there is a fear that the influx of foreigners could erode local customs and culture .
A minority in their own country , Emiratis are pushing to maintain their traditional values .
Enforcing laws like this is one way of doing that .
The initial complaint against them was made by a 38 - year - old woman who said she was offended by their behaviour at the Jumeirah Beach Residence , where she was dining with her daughter .
During the initial trial , the pair 's defence lawyers said the woman had not seen the kiss herself , but had been told by her two - year - old child that the girl had seen them kissing .
They had also been fined 1,000 dirhams , which is about £ 200 , for drinking alcohol .
Earlier this month , tourist Ms Adams , who is now back in Essex , accused the Gulf state of " hypocrisy " over its strict decency laws .
She called for the laws to be changed to match the culture in Dubai .
The Foreign Office advises Britons going to Dubai , which is part of the United Arab Emirates , to be wary of breaching local customs .
A statement on its travel advice website reads : " Britons can find themselves facing charges relating to cultural differences , such as using bad language , rude gestures or public displays of affection . "
Najafi had been working for marketing firm Hay Group in Dubai for about 18 months .

The British Chiropractic Association dropped its libel action against the science writer Simon Singh today , filing a notice of discontinuation in the high court .
The case had become a cause celebre , with scientists , celebrities and freedom of speech campaigners lining up to condemn the British libel laws and argue that Singh had a right to express his opinion in print .
The sudden end to the case will strengthen the campaign for reform of the libel laws , which Jack Straw , the justice secretary , is considering .
It is also a specific pledge in the Liberal Democrat manifesto .
Singh was sued by the BCA for a piece he wrote in the Guardian 's comment pages , criticising the association for defending chiropractors who use treatments for which there is little evidence on children with conditions such as colic and asthma .
Singh and his supporters were dismayed by an early verdict by Mr Justice Eady on the meaning of the words used in the article .
The judge ruled that Singh was stating facts , which he would have to prove in his defence , rather than voicing opinion and that he had implied the members of the BCA knowingly promoted what Singh called " bogus treatments " .
Singh argued that was not what he meant and went to the court of appeal .
Two weeks ago , he won the point .
In their ruling on the case , Lord Justice Judge , Lord Justice Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley : " It is now nearly two years since the publication of the offending article .
It seems unlikely that anyone would dare repeat the opinions expressed by Dr Singh for fear of a writ .
" Accordingly this litigation has almost certainly had a chilling effect on public debate which might otherwise have assisted potential patients to make informed choices about the possible use of chiropractic . "
Robert Dougans of Bryan Cave LLP , who represented Singh , confirmed that the BCA 's case was at an end .
" All that now remains to be settled is how much of Simon 's legal costs he can recover from the BCA , and how much he will have to bear himself , " he said .
" However well this process goes , Simon is likely to be out of pocket by about £ 20,000 .
This – and two years of lost earnings , which he can never recover , is the price he has paid for writing an article criticising the BCA for making claims the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled can no longer be made .
In the game of libel , even winning is costly and stressful .
" To have won this case for Simon is the proudest moment of my career , but if we had the libel laws we ought to have I would never have met Simon at all .
Until we have a proper public interest defence scientists and writers are going to have to carry on making the unenviable choice of either shying away from hard - hitting debate , or paying through the nose for the privilege of defending it . "
Ely Place Chambers , the chamber of William McCormick QC , one of two barristers who represented Dr Singh , said that the BCA had ended its " ill - fated " claim .
" Dr Singh 's predicament as the sole defendant in an action brought in respect of a comment piece in the Guardian newspaper ( to which the BCA never directed any complaint ) was seen as a rallying point for those concerned about the abuse of UK libel laws in connection with scientific debate . "
Hey there Wilderness ;
I received a very disturbing email from a Wild season ticket holder , and would like to get your input :
I 'm getting invoiced for $ 95 / seat for Club Sides even though the * PUBLISHED * rate for renewal is $ 85 / seat simply because I 'm a new Club STH as of this year .
Not amused at all when http://myseats.wild.com ->
Pricing / Arena Diagram clearly shows the rate should be $ 85 / seat .
The insulting part is they even calculate out the savings of being a STH , which of course is complete false advertising in my case .
I paid for the playoffs option to hold my seat only because I can get that money back in the highly likely chance that we 're out of it , but I 'm not renewing at $ 95 / seat just based on principle .
If they want to screw me for $ 10 / seat over what they 're charging 99 % of the rest of club , I 'm happy to vote with my wallet and watch more games from the comfort of my couch .
Oh , and here 's the proof that this person 's tickets are listed at $ 85 / seat , even though they were invoiced at $ 95 / seat .
For a franchise that sorely needs the support of the fanbase , especially during a rebuilding process , this is a major black eye .
Why are they ( seemingly ) randomly changing prices on an individual basis ?
I 've sent requests for comment to the Wild and have yet to hear from them , but I am certainly open to discussing this issue with them .
EDIT :
Here 's the response from Billy Rob
Nathan : Hi .
Thanks for your inquiry and hopefully this clears up an concerns .
Wild season ticket information was mailed and e-mailed to season ticket holders over this past weekend .
Currently the Wild do NOT offer a contract for season tickets holders .
We traditionally send mailed material and an invoice to our season ticket base .
In past years , the Wild have offered a contract to club seat holders only , but that has not been the case over the past two NHL seasons ( 2008 - 2009 , 2009 - 2010 ) .
Glad you are a Wild fan !
Best , Bill Robertson Vice President of Communications & Broadcasting Minnesota Sports & Entertainment

Here 's my 24 Hour Comic Addicted to Ghosts .
Big thanks to everyone else on our 24 Hour Comic Crew :
Nick Elmer , Milton Tan , Greg Truono and Angelina Meehan .
Connor Delaney even stopped by and drew a few comics with us through the power of the internet .
Every one of those people is fantastic to work with and they do excellent things , so check out their websites .
But first , read my comic :
About 42,000 gallons of oil a day were leaking into the Gulf Wednesday from the blown - out well where a rig called the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank last week .
Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead .
Follow key developments since the explosion .

We just had a chance to go hands ... er , rear - on with Honda 's latest R&D experiment , the U3 - X Personal Mobility Device , and we 've got the say -- it was a moving experience .
If you 'll recall , the tiny , uni - wheeled unit is built on the same balancing principles which the company 's ASIMO uses , and utilizes the world 's first omni-directional driving wheel system .
What does all that mean ?
Well , it means that when you sit down on the thing , it moves in whatever direction you lean in , however slightly .
The experience is kind of amazing , as it requires very little effort on the rider , and though you feel like you could easily go flying off of the U3 - X , you always retain a solid center of balance .
As opposed to something like the company 's Walking Assist devices ( which you can see us taking for a spin right here ) , this is a totally effortless experience .
It just goes where you want it to -- almost by suggestion .
There 's no telling if Honda will ever bring something like this to market -- they 're notorious for crazy projects that never see the light of day on store shelves -- but it's an amazing look into the potential future of transportation .
If you thought the Segway was a little big for your taste , this could be the answer to your prayers .
As far as we 're concerned , now that we 've taken a ride on the U3 - X , walking just feels like a chore .
See for yourself what it looks and feels like in the video after the break !
Militants planned to kill President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , police said
Indonesian security forces say they have uncovered a militant plot to assassinate the president and kill foreigners in a Mumbai - style attack .
They say the plan was to strike during an Independence Day ceremony on 17 August , and declare an Islamic state .
The militants also planned to take over hotels and kill foreigners , they said .
The announcement came a day after three suspected militants were detained in the latest in a series of anti-terror raids .
Police said the men were linked to a militant training camp discovered in Aceh in February .
Dozens of suspected Islamists have been detained since then and a number killed .
' Assassination targets '
The announcement , by National Police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri , came at a briefing on raids by carried out by the authorities since the discovery of the Aceh training camp .
" They planned to attack and murder state officials at the 17 August celebrations , " he said .
" There , they saw all of the state officials as assassination targets , including the state guests attending the ceremony . "
They believed that this would help them create a state ruled by Shariah law , he added .
" Their plan was also to launch attacks in Jakarta against foreigners - especially Americans - and attack and control hotels within certain communities , imitating what happened in Mumbai , " he said .
The Mumbai attacks in 2008 left 174 people dead , nine of them gunmen .
The militants attacked two luxury hotels , a train station and a Jewish centre .
The discovery of the Aceh camp raised fears that terror networks re-emerging in Indonesia .
Security analysts say the events show that there is still support for extremism in Indonesia despite the efforts of police to clamp down .
Today , it 's an astonishing , even eerie , scene : the icon of modern American conservatism , whose rise to political prominence was galvanized by the cultural rebellion of the 1960s , fighting off an attack - at - gunpoint by the quintessential modern American rebel .
But when " The Dark , Dark Hours " episode of General Electric Theater aired live from Hollywood on December 12 , 1954 , Ronald Reagan and James Dean were just two actors yet to find the roles that would define them .
No one has seen this episode in the decades since ; the kinescope has been locked away , until now .
My friend Wayne Federman , a writer for NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , unearthed the broadcast , condensing it from its original 23 minutes ( without commercials ) into the six - minute version you see below .
( Federman is planning a retrospective of Reagan 's television career for next year 's Reagan centennial . )
Here , Reagan is a physician , forced to defend his home and family from Dean , a teenage lawbreaker seeking medical treatment for an injured friend .
A decade before Reagan 's political career took off , with a nationally televised speech supporting Barry Goldwater 's presidential campaign , and months before Dean started filming Rebel Without a Cause and Giant , both of these Midwesterners seem to be rehearsing future roles -- Reagan as the happy warrior who could , in a moment , turn fierce ( " I am paying for this microphone , Mr. Green ! " ) and Dean as teenage angst writ large ( " You 're tearing me apart ! " ) .

During his White House press conference Wednesday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , President Obama addressed the issue of civilian deaths caused by US operations in Afghanistan .
" I take no pleasure in hearing a report that a civilian has been killed , " said Obama .
" That ’s not why I ran for president , that ’s not why I ’m Commander in Chief . "
Ad Policy
" Let me be very clear about what I told President Karazi :
When there is a civilian casualty , that is not just a political problem for me .
I am ultimately accountable , just as Gen. McChrystal is accountable , for somebody who is not on the battlefield who got killed , " said Obama .
That statement is quite remarkable for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that it is not true .
How are President Obama or Gen. McChrystal accountable ?
Afghans have little , if any , recourse for civilian deaths .
They cannot press their case in international courts because the US does n’t recognize an International Criminal Court with jurisdiction over US forces , Afghan courts have not and will not be given jurisdiction and Attorney General Eric Holder has made clear that the Justice Department will not permit cases against US military officials brought by foreign victims to proceed in US courts .
So , what does it mean to be accountable for civilian deaths ?
Public apology ?
Press conferences ?
A handful of courts martial ?
Obama praised US forces for their restraint in Afghanistan , saying , " Because of Gen McChrystal ’s direction , often times they ’re holding fire , they ’re hesitating , they ’re being cautious about how they operate even though it would be safer for them to go ahead and take these locations out . "
But how does that square with recent , heinous instances of civilian killings in Afghanistan ?
In February , for example , US special forces shot and killed five people , including three women who collectively had 16 children .
The US military tried to cover it up and blame it on the Taliban , saying coalition forces “ found the bodies of three women who had been tied up , gagged and killed . ”
The New York Times reported that military officials had " suggested that the women had all been stabbed to death or had died by other means before the raid , implying that their own relatives may have killed them . "
Later , General McChrystal ’s command admitted US - led forces had done the killing , saying it was an accident .
This was hard to square with reports that soldiers may have dug bullets out of the dead bodies to try to cover it up .
The head of the Joint Special Operations Command , Vice Admiral William McRaven , eventually apologized to the family of the dead Afghans and offered them two sheep as a condolence gift .
Was this accountability ?
Or , what about the incident last May when US warplanes bombed civilian houses in Farah province killing more than 100 people ?
The dead , according to the Red Cross , included an " Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed " in the air strike .
US Military sources floated the story to NBC and other outlets that Taliban fighters used grenades to kill three families to “ stage ” a massacre and then blame it on the US .
" War is tough and difficult and mistakes are gonna be made , " President Obama said today .
Part of the problem , though , is that when " mistakes " happen and civilians are killed , attempts are made to cover them up or to blame them on the Taliban .

Apparently Arnie ’s efforts to stop global warming have been successful .
Schwarzenegger has emerged as a national leader on global warming , the one whose name most frequently comes up in foreign capitals when international cooperation on reducing carbon emissions is discussed .
Al Gore might have a Nobel Prize , but Schwarzenegger heads a state that , if it were a country , would rank among the 10 biggest economies in the world .
Given the Bush administration ’s unwillingness to seriously address the problem , Schwarzenegger ’s initiatives to mandate hard emissions targets and set up carbon - trading schemes with other states and Canadian provinces make him this country ’s most forward - thinking governor , and its greenest Republican .

Babbage -
The language of the future by Tony Karp
This article originally appeared in Datamation , September 1981 .
Long before Java , long before Perl , and long before C++ , Ada was the favorite of the hypemeisters and headline writers , who predicted it would revolutionize the process of software development , eventually replacing outmoded languages like COBOL , FORTRAN , and even Pascal .
Guess what happened ?
Not much .
Things went on pretty much as before .
Banks continued to use COBOL , NASA continued to use FORTRAN , and the common folk continued to use nasty languages like BASIC and C .
Ada , like many a behemoth , collapsed under its own weight and , although it still has its proponents , it did n't revolutionize much of anything .
It 's just something to think about while you 're reading today 's headlines .
" I 've seen the future , and you 're not going to like it . "
> Vincent van Gui
Babbage - the Language of the Future
There are few things in this business that are more fun than designing a new computer language , and the very latest is Ada - the Department of Defense 's new supertoy .
Ada as you know , has been designed to replace outmoded and obsolete languages such as COBOL and FORTRAN .
The problem is that this cycle takes 20 to 30 years and does n't start until we 're really convinced present languages are no good .
We can short - circuit this process by starting on Ada 's replacement right now .
Then , by the time we decide Ada is obsolete , its replacement will be ready .
The new generation of language designers has taken to naming its brainchildren after real people rather than resorting to the usual acronyms .
Pascal is named after the first person to build a calculating machine and Ada is named after the first computer programmer .
As our namesake , we chose Charles Babbage , who died in poverty while trying to finish building the first computer .
The new language is thus named after the first systems designer to go over budget and behind schedule .
It 's a good sign if your language is sponsored by the government .
COBOL had government backing , and Ada is being funded by the Department of Defense .
After much negotiation , the Department of Sanitation has agreed to sponsor Babbage .
Babbage is based on language elements that were discovered after the design of Ada was completed .
C. A. R. Hoare , in his 1980 ACM Turing Award lecture , told of two ways of constructing a software design : " One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies . "
The designers of Babbage have chosen a third alternative - a language that has only obvious deficiencies .
Babbage programs are so unreliable that maintenance can begin before system integration is completed .
This guarantees a steady increase in the programming job marketplace .
No subsets of Ada are allowed .
Babbage is just the opposite .
None of Babbage is defined except its extensibility - each user must define his own version .
To end the debate of large languages versus small , Babbage allows each user to make the language any size he wants .
Babbage is the ideal language for the " me " generation .
Like Pascal , Ada uses " strong typing " to avoid errors caused by mixing data types .
The designers of Babbage advocate " good typing " to avoid errors caused by misspelling the words in your program .
Later versions of Babbage will also support " touch typing , " which will fill a long - felt need .
A hotly contested issue among language designers is the method for passing parameters to subfunctions .
Some advocate " call by name , " others prefer " call by value . "
Babbage uses a new method - " call by telephone . "
This is especially effective for long - distance parameter passing .
Ada stresses the concept of software portability .
Babbage encourages hardware portability .
After all , what good is a computer if you can't take it with you ?
The examples that follow will give you some idea of what Babbage looks like .
Structured languages banned GOTOs and multi-way conditional branches by replacing them with the simpler IF - THEN - ELSE structure .
Babbage has a number of new conditional statements that act like termites in the structure of your program : WHAT IF - Used in simulation languages .
Branches before evaluating test conditions .
OR ELSE - Conditional threat , as in : " Add these two numbers OR ELSE ! " WHY NOT ?
Executes the code that follows in a devil - may - care fashion .
WHO ELSE ? - Used for polling during I /O operations .
ELSEWHERE -
This is where your program really is when you think it 's here .
GOING GOING GONE - For writing unstructured programs .
Takes a random branch to another part of your program .
Does the work of 10 GOTOs .
For years , programming languages have used " FOR , " " DO UNTIL , " " DO WHILE , " etc. to mean " LOOP . "
Continuing with this trend , Babbage offers the following loop statements : DON'T DO WHILE NOT - This loop is not executed if the test condition is not false ( or if it 's Friday afternoon ) .
DIDN'T DO -
The loop executes once and hides all traces .
CAN'T DO - The loop is pooped .
WON'T DO - The CPU halts because it does n't like the code inside the loop .
Execution can be resumed by typing " May I " at the console .
MIGHT DO - Depends on how the CPU is feeling .
Executed if the CPU is " up , " not executed if the CPU is " down " or if its feelings have been hurt .
DO UNTO OTHERS - Used to write the main loop for timesharing systems so that they will antagonize the users in a uniform manner .
DO - WAH - Used to write timing loops for computer - generated music ( Rag Timing ) .
For years , programming languages have used " FOR , " " DO UNTIL , " " DO WHILE , " etc. to mean " LOOP . "
Continuing with this trend , Babbage offers the following loop statements :
Every self - respecting language has a CASE statement to implement multi-way branching .
ALGOL offers an indexed case statement and Pascal has a labeled case statement .
Not much of a choice .
Babbage offers a variety of interesting case statements :
The JUST -IN - CASE Statement - For handling afterthoughts and fudge factors .
Allows you to multiply by zero to correct for accidentally dividing by zero .
The WORST CASE Statement - Takes the path that will do the most damage .
The BRIEF CASE Statement - To encourage portable software .
The OPEN - AND - SHUT CASE Statement -
No proof of correctness is necessary with this one .
The IN - ANY - CASE Statement -
This one always works .
The HOPELESS CASE Statement - This one never works .
The BASKET CASE Statement - A really hopeless case .
The Babbage Language Design Group is continuously evaluating new features that will keep its users from reaching any level of effectiveness .
For instance , Babbage 's designers are now considering the ALMOST EQUALS sign , used for comparing two floating - point numbers .
This new feature " takes the worry out of being close . "
No language , no matter how bad , can stand on its own .
We need a really state - of - the - art operating system to support Babbage .
After trying several commercial systems , we decided to write a " virtual " operating system .
Everyone else has a virtual memory operating system so we decided to try something a little different .
Our new operating system is called the Virtual Time Operating System ( VTOS ) .
While virtual memory systems make the computer 's memory the virtual resource , VTOS does the same thing with CPU processing time .
The result is that the computer can run an unlimited number of jobs , all at the same time .
Like the virtual memory system , which actually keeps part of memory on disk , VTOS has to play tricks to achieve its goals .
Although all of your jobs seem to be running right now , some of them are actually running next week .
As you can see , Babbage is still in its infancy .
The Babbage Language Design Group is seeking suggestions for this powerful new language and as the sole member of this group ( all applications for membership will be accepted ) , I call on the computing community for help in making this dream a reality .

Ars Technica has been invited to Blizzard 's campus before , but the early birth of my son scuttled our last trip .
But for the second invitation , nothing could keep us away .
You 've already read the coverage of StarCraft 2 from the meeting , but we were also given a tour of the Blizzard campus in Irivine , California .
If you 're ever put in the position to see where some of the best - loved PC games in the world are made , you take it .
To put it mildly : we were n't disappointed .
The Blizzard campus is a magical place , completely covered with the culture of the company and the art of its games .
From statues , to murals , to jokes , this is where you dreamed video games are made when you were young .
The campus houses offices , a theater , a museum , a library , a gym , and of course , the games are everywhere .
Let 's take a look at what we saw .
These are the original oil paintings that were later used as an element in the first World of Warcraft boxes .
A map of the first iteration of Azeroth , including flight paths and ports for both Horde and Alliance .
This is not an actual picture of the server room for World of Warcraft .
We were allowed to peek in through a window , but no images .
We could not enter the room .
Even our guide had only been in twice .
What we saw were weather maps making sure things were stable at the data centers around the world .
Data and charts flashing on the large screens hanging on the wall .
Rows of computers in the middle of the room being tended to by very serious looking people .
Millions of players , around the world , all watched and tended to from that room .
It was quite the sight .
This is simply an artist 's interpretation .
Blizzard employs ridiculously talented artists , and their non-Blizzard related work is displayed outside of the cafeteria , including this take on Bebop and Rocksteady from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
The day before the September 11 attacks , the Bush administration agreed on a plan to oust the Taliban regime in Afghanistan by force if it refused to hand over Osama bin Laden , according to a report by a bipartisan commission of inquiry .
The report pointed out that agreement on the plan , which involved a steady escalation of pressure over three years , had been repeatedly put off by the Clinton and Bush administrations , despite the repeated failure of attempts to use diplomatic and economic pressure .
The revelation emerged at the beginning of the commission 's hearings this week on the country 's failure to prevent the attacks , in which the top officials from both administrations came under scrutiny .
The hearings followed two days of uproar in Washington over allegations from a former White House counter - terrorism tsar , Richard Clarke , that the Bush administration 's ideological obsession with Iraq had hindered the momentum of the struggle with al - Qaida in the months before the attack .
Mr Clarke claimed that the plan to increase the pressure on the Taliban was inherited from the Clinton administration .
However , in testimony to the commission , the secretary of state , Colin Powell , said the September 10 meeting of top White House officials , to agree the strategy towards the Taliban , demonstrated a new determination to deal with al - Qaida .
The report drawn up by the commission 's staff said : " From the spring of 1997 to September 2001 , the US government tried to persuade the Taliban to expel Bin Laden to a country where he could face justice .
The efforts employed inducements , warnings and sanctions .
All these efforts failed . "
At a meeting of the Bush administration 's top national security officials on September 10 , a three - phase strategy was agreed .
The Taliban would be presented with a final ultimatum to hand over Bin Laden .
Failing that , covert military aid would be channelled to anti-Taliban groups .
If both those options failed , " the deputies agreed that the United States would seek to overthrow the Taliban regime through more direct action . "
However , the three - step process would have taken up to three years , and did not represent an immediate attack plan .
The next day , hijacked planes destroyed the World Trade Centre and hit the Pentagon , triggering the launch of an anti-Taliban offensive in October and the Taliban 's fall a month later .
Yesterday , it was the turn of Clinton administration veterans to face questioning on why they had failed to take more aggressive action against al - Qaida in the wake of the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Africa and the 2000 attack on the American destroyer USS Cole .
The former officials defended their record but also revealed splits in the Clinton administration on how to respond to the attacks .
Madeleine Albright , the former secretary of state , directed blame at the Clinton - era defence department under William Cohen for not agreeing to use special forces to hunt down al - Qaida in the Afghan mountains .
" I 'm personally not satisfied we were able to get the right answers out of the Pentagon , " she said .
Mrs Albright said she had repeatedly pressed for alternative military measures other than the cruise missile strikes on suspected al - Qaida bases that were tried after the embassy bombings .
She said the Pentagon told her that special forces units would either be too small to protect themselves or too large to be covert .
Testifying later , Mr Cohen said that more than 13,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan had failed to find Bin Laden , so questioned what success a small special forces unit might have had .
The commission heard that after the African embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania , the Clinton administration presented an ultimatum to the Taliban warning it would bear the consequences if there were another al - Qaida attack .
The commission members , drawn from the ranks of retired officials and politicians from both parties , repeatedly asked why that threat was not delivered after the 2000 attack on the USS Cole .
Mrs Albright said that by the time the Clinton administration left office in January 2001 there was still no " definitive proof " of al - Qaida involvement in the suicide attack off the Yemeni coast .
John Lehman , a navy secretary in the Reagan administration and one of the commissioners , alleged that the CIA was already convinced of al - Qaida 's responsibility by December , but Mrs Albright said that finding was not passed on to the political leadership .
Asked the same question , Mr Powell said that before the September 11 attacks , there was no consensus in the Bush administration on how far to go against al - Qaida and the Taliban .
" We did not take into account during that period the kind of actions we were prepared to follow after 9/11 , " he told the inquiry .
" It was not clear how to get at al - Qaida in a way to destroy al - Qaida , and we were not prepared , before 9/11 , to take down the Taliban . "
Mr Powell vigorously rejected the claim , made by Mr Clarke in a White House memoir published on Monday , that the Bush administration had failed to take the terrorist threat seriously ,
" President Bush and his entire national security team understood that terrorism had to be among our highest priorities , and it was , " he said .
Mr Powell said holding more meetings on the issue would not have accelerated efforts to arm a US hi-tech surveillance drone , the Predator , with missiles so that it could track and , if necessary , attack Bin Laden in Afghanistan - one of the measures urged by Mr Clarke .
The armed Predator was only ready by autumn 2001 .
Mr Powell and his deputy , Richard Armitage , also objected to suggestions that the US should have acted earlier to arm the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance .
They said the Northern Alliance was in no position to pose a serious military threat to Kabul , and was implicated in drug dealing and human rights abuses .
Only after September 11 2001 , they argued , when US special forces soldiers were sent to collaborate with the Northern Alliance , was it feasible to increase direct military aid .
The main players , past and present
Madeleine Albright , secretary of state 1997 - 2001
Under pressure yesterday for having been too soft on the Saudis and the Taliban .
She blamed William Cohen and the Pentagon for failing to send special forces after al - Qaida .
Colin Powell , secretary of state since 2001
On the defensive over the Bush administration 's failure to act faster against al - Qaida .
He denied that having more meetings on the subject would have been more effective .
The Bush White House and the Pentagon are likely to face intense criticism
William Cohen , defence secretary 1997 - 2001
Dropped in hot water by caution on the use of ground troops .
He personified the conservatism of the American defence establishment before September 11
Donald Rumsfeld , defence secretary since 2001
Was more concerned with reorganising armed services and with Star Wars anti-ballistic missile programme than terrorism before September 11 .
He is alleged to have favoured bombing Iraq in the immediate aftermath because it had more promising targets than Afghanistan
MOUNT DORA — A doctor who considers the national health - care overhaul to be bad medicine for the country posted a sign on his office door telling patients who voted for President Barack Obama to seek care " elsewhere . "
" I 'm not turning anybody away — that would be unethical , " Dr. Jack Cassell , 56 , a Mount Dora urologist and a registered Republican opposed to the health plan , told the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday .
" But if they read the sign and turn the other way , so be it . "
The sign reads : " If you voted for Obama … seek urologic care elsewhere .
Changes to your healthcare begin right now , not in four years . "

Remember when Andrew Breitbart swore no racist slurs were hurled at the Congressional Black Caucus the day of the health care vote ?
He sneered at the possibility that any teabagger had behaved in a racist or inappropriate fashion just before he promised to donate $ 100,000 to the United Negro College Fund if he was proven wrong .
Seems to me the video up above is pretty clear and convincing evidence of spitting , racism and hate , and it seems Breitbart thinks so , too .
Now that he can't deny it happened , he 's choosing to blame John Lewis et al for walking through the group of angry teabaggers .
In truly despicable fashion , Breitbart let Hannity 's audience know how outraged he was at the unfairness of it all :
BREITBART : The very act of the Black Congressional Caucus , walking through the tea party people while holding all those videos was an act of provocation .
They need this desperately and one last thing .
The language that Nancy Pelosi is using about the civil rights movement , comparing the unpopular health care bill to the civil rights movement ties into this …
They ’re all on the talking points , basically telling black people that the white people are trying to take your health care from you .
This is a racial , racist , racially divisive strategy that they ’re playing that ’s very dangerous in the United States .
The noise machine is cranked up to full volume and steaming right ahead .
In classic blame - the - victim style , Breitbart suggests that John Lewis and Emanuel Cleaver should have walked around the murmuring mob of nasty white folks rather than through them , because obviously the mere presence of black Congressmen was so inflammatory as to throw all caution ( and spit ) to the wind .
Never mind that they were walking up stairs to the building where they work as representatives elected by the majority of voters in their districts .
That does n't matter to Andrew Breitbart , because he just cannot stand the unbearable weight of intellectual honesty .
His remarks prove how deeply racist he , and the movement he champions , truly are .
If you went out on the streets and asked average Americans what the “ World Economic Forum ” is , how many of them do you think would be able to tell you what it is ?
Not very many .
But it is one of the most important international economic organizations in the world .
It is a non-profit foundation that holds a meeting for world power brokers and key executives from 1,000 of the world ’s most powerful companies every year for five days in Davos , Switzerland .
You can kind of think of it as a much larger and much more public Bilderberg Group .
The meetings this year were held from January 27th to January 31st , and there was such little coverage in the American media that you would think that the meetings were of little importance .
Even though we hear very , very little about the World Economic Forum in the U.S. media , the truth is that key global economic policy decisions are made each year at Davos , and often new global initiatives are launched during the meetings .
For example , the Global Health Initiative was launched by Kofi Annan at the World Economic Forum in 2002 .
This year , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation decided to announce at the World Economic Forum that the foundation will commit $ 10 billion over the next 10 years to help research , develop , and deliver vaccines in poor and developing countries .
The theme of this year ’s meetings was “ Rethink , Redesign , Rebuild ” , and most of the attendees seemed to recognize that the state of the world economy is not good .
In fact , Spiegel is reporting that the message coming out of the World Economic Forum was that 2010 was going to be a “ terrible ” year for the world economy .
But why is there such little coverage of such an important global conference in the media ?
After all , past attendees of the World Economic Forum include Ban Ki-moon , Condoleezza Rice , Gordon Brown , Hamid Karzai , Queen Rania of Jordan , Shimon Peres , Al Gore , Bill Clinton , Bill Gates , Bono , Tony Blair , Angela Merkel , Dmitry Medvedev , Henry Kissinger and Nelson Mandela .
Very big names gathering each year to make very big decisions about our economic future – should n’t that be newsworthy ?
But the truth is that the American press mostly ignores the World Economic Forum for the same reasons why it mostly ignores the Bilderberg Group .
The reality is that the elitist global organizations that make the real decisions do n’t want us to realize how important they really are .
We are n’t supposed to understand that global policies that impact us all are made on a global level by unelected global elitists who care very little about you and I .
If you do not know about the World Economic Forum , you need to find out .
After all , they are making decisions that are going to affect your future .
It ’s good to see a story from a branch of science with which I am familiar make the headlines , although the headlines themselves have been somewhat surprising .
“ Stanford researchers find electrical current stemming from plants ” , says the University press release .
They did n’t find it , really .
We knew it was there .
“ Ultrasharp Nano - Electrode Harnesses Electric Current from Plant Cell ? ” is better , although ‘ harnesses ’ implies the current could be put to some sort of useful work , which is unlikely , given the vanishingly small amount of current .
“ Stealing electricity from algae ” is perhaps a better headline , as that is exactly what was achieved .
And what was achieved was , in my opinion , something remarkable .
Plants make for marvellous experimental subjects .
No ethics approval required , no need to consider the health and well being of the plant .
Genomes have been cracked , distantly related species interbred .
Plants have been bombarded with radiation to create mutations , and genes introduced from entirely different kingdoms of life into plants , such as a gene encoding an anti-freeze protein from fish into tomatoes .
The science of plant breeding is thousands of years old , the study of plants fascinated the Greeks , and taxonomy and plant anatomy bloomed in the Enlightenment .
Despite this long history , there are aspects of plant science that remain technically challenging .
One such challenge is phloem analysis .
Plants carry the nutrients produced through photosynthesis through specialised tissues called phloem .
The sieve tube elements in the phloem , cells that are arranged end to end , with sieve plates at the adjoining walls , form a tube capable of transporting photosynthates like sucrose .
While we know in general terms what comprises the phloem sap , accurately identifying the specific components carried in the sieve elements is a surprisingly difficult task .
When a sieve element is cut , allowing phloem sap to exude , the contents of other cells are also released , contaminating the sample .
The sap can be diluted by water from the xylem .
Sap exudation rates are rapidly limited when sealing mechanisms in the plants are activated , and by the loss of the turgor pressure that drives phloem sap translocation .
Collecting pure phloem sap is tricky .
The solution to the phloem sap collection problem is by necessity ingenious , and uses aphids .
Aphids feed on the sap in phloem , and they do it so effectively – without interrupting sap flow – that their bodies overfill with it , excreting the excess as honeydew .
Aphids are able to insert their stylet into the sieve element without reducing the turgor pressure in the phloem , maintaining a continuous flow of sap .
The aphid ’s ability to do so neatly solves the problem for scientists of how to collect phloem sap , and only phloem sap : one cuts off the aphid stylet from the aphid , once it is inserted into the sieve element , with a laser .
The stylets continue exuding sap even when separated from the insect .
It ’s an ingenious solution to a tricky problem , and one that came to mind on reading about about the Stanford research .
" We believe we are the first to extract electrons out of living plant cells , " said the lead author , WonHyoung Ryu .
It is incredibly tricky to directly analyse phloem sap , even though it can be obtained in millilitre quantities .
One can imagine it to be orders of magnitude more difficult to directly intercept electron flow between protein complexes , located inside organelles , inside single plant cells .
And all without the aid of a ready made nanoprobe like the aphid ’s stylet .
The electrons in question are produced during the process of photosynthesis .
Light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic reaction centers and then used to split H2O , generating H+ and electrons .
The H+ generates a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane which , together with high energy electrons ( e- ) , reduces inorganic carbon to sugars and polysaccharides .
These are the electrons we are interested in .
When a molecule of chlorophyll in the reaction center of PSII absorbs a photon , an electron in the chlorophyll is excited to a higher energy state .
The state of the electron is highly unstable , so it is rapidly transferred into what is called the electron transfer chain , a series of molecules that flow electrons from one photosystem to another .
In fact , as a consequence of the high energy reactions taking place in the photosystem II reaction center , the D1 protein at the core is rapidly degraded and replaced ; photoinhibition occurs when the rate of D1 breakdown exceeds the rate of D1 repair , a condition that can occur in high light conditions .
Generating high energy electrons is not without cost .
Of course , the electrons are there for a reason .
One electron transport chain provides energy for the synthesis of ATP , via chemiosmosis , while the 2e - that reach the end of that electron transport chain reduce the chlorophyll in PSI .
When light excites chlorophyll in PSI , its electrons are transferred via another electron transport chain to NADP + reductase , creating 2NADPH .
Both ATP and NADPH are essential molecules , used for transporting chemical energy and the synthesis of lipids and nucleic acid , respectively .
By inserting an Au nanoelectrode into the algal chloroplast , the researchers were able to extract electrons directly from the electron transport chain .
Molecules in the electron transport chain donated electrons to the nanoelectrode ; electrons were extracted from either plastoquinone ( the PQ pool ) or Ferrodoxin ( Fd ) , at the point when the electrons were at their highest energy level immediately after being excited by light .
The figure below shows the two possible locations of the electrode and the two possible electron donors .
Electrons have been harvested from the electron transport chain before , using chemical mediators such as p-benzoquinone ( BQ ) .
To do that , the organelles that contain the photosynthetic apparatus , the thlyakoid membranes , are bathed in a solution of BQ and illuminated .
When the light comes on , electrons produced in photosystem II are accepted by BQ , which is reduced to p-hydroquinone ( QH2 ) .
Directly intercepting electrons from the electron transport chain , with an electrode , and without the use of a mediator like BQ , is what makes this such an achievement .
Nothing like this had been done before , and a number of obstacles had to be overcome to do it this time .
The nanoprobe had to be designed , it had to be able to penetrate through cell membranes without killing the cell , and the algal cell had to remain stationary .
A mutant of Chlamydomonas that has no motility was crossed with a strain of Chlamydomonas with a cell wall minus phenotype , to obtain an algal cell that would n’t swim around and , without cell walls , could be easily penetrated by the nanoprobe .
The nanoprobe itself was just 100 nm thick , and had to be carefully positioned within the thylakoid stack ( see inset box in the figure ) .
It makes for a fine piece of basic research .
However , the reporting on the story focused not so much on the aspects discussed above but on the potential for generating bioelectricity .
It ’s like visiting a restaurant that makes great steaks , but only ever tries to sell the sizzle .
Yet far from this being a story blown out of proportion by the press , bioelectricity generation is the motivation given for the research .
The abstract concludes with the following : “ This result may represent an initial step in generating “ high efficiency ” bioelectricity by directly harvesting high energy photosynthetic electrons . ”
It ’s only fair , then , to examine the sizzle .
As their introduction states , “ abundant solar energy is stored and converted into chemical bond energy by photosynthesis … one approach for extracting energy from the photosynthetic conversion process is to harvest the biomass stored as polysaccharide and convert it to ethanol , longer chain alcohols or hydrogen . ”
True , and there is a theoretical limit to how much solar energy can be converted this way to polysaccharide ; around 25 - 27 % , although in the real world this conversion efficiency is considerably lower .
So what can be done about it ?
“ To increase the efficiency of light energy conversion , we evaluated the feasibility of generating bioelectricity by extracting e- from the photosynthetic electron transport ( PET ) chain before they are used to fix CO2 …
This approach potentially reduces energy losses associated with the multistep transformation of solar energy into products used for the production of biodiesel and bioelectricity . ”
Ryu described the amount of electricity drawn from the cell , one picoampere , as “ so tiny that they would need a trillion cells photosynthesising for one hour just to equal the amount of energy stored in an AA battery ” .
And there ’s the rub .
It may be a more efficient way of tapping solar energy than burning biofuels , but it is n’t any where near as effective .
Solar energy is n’t a limiting factor for plant life and it is n’t complicated to grow a crop .
Biofuels as a means of utilising solar energy may not always be economical , and may even be carbon positive , but they do work , and they work at meaningful scales of power generation .
In contrast , this is n’t a technique for producing useful bioelectricity , and nor will it be anytime soon .
Stealing electrons from the process of photosynthesis in algal cells was not without consequence , as the cells died after about an hour .
The amount of current harvested did n’t exceed the energy used in running the experiment ( that is , the voltage applied to the electrode ) , so there was no net gain .
Even the suggestion of scaling up the size of the chloroplast and electrode , to be able to capture more electrons , wo n’t solve the problem of the vanishingly small amounts of current involved , the technical challenges of fixing the cells so they do n’t move , the difficulty of correctly inserting an electrode into each cell , and then having to start all over after an hour when the cell dies .
It may be a more efficient conversion of solar energy to electricity than biofuels , but that ’s just sizzle .
The meat of the story can be found , at least for me , in just a single line in their introduction :
“ In addition , the system allows direct monitoring of specific charge transfer reactions in live cells , leading to broad applications for investigating developmental processes and the responses of cells and organelles to light and chemical stimuli . ”
It did n’t need to be sold as a breakthrough in clean energy .
For photosynthesis research , the effort to elucidate one of the most important biological reactions on Earth , this technique is a great investigative tool .
It ’s as innovative as the aphid ’s stylet , a true milestone in scientific discovery and an exciting piece of research .
That ’s more than good enough .

Arcata is a tiny coastal town in Northern California , known for its beautiful redwood forests .
But over the past few weeks , a series of bizarre events suggest that somebody is selling seriously bad drugs to the town residents .
According to the Arcata Eye :
On April 18 , officers responded to a residence to assist the Arcata Mad River Ambulance with a 31 - year - old male subject who had just castrated himself .
Medical personnel and officers were unable to locate the subject 's testicles .
He later told officers that he flushed them down the toilet as he feared they contained " monsters . "
The victim , who police say had a Tennessee address , was with several friends when he began to experience negative feelings .
He was dropped off at the Jay Street residence , to which Arcata Police responded at 4:18 p.m. that day .
" We just thought it was an isolated incident , " said Police Chief Tom Chapman .
He said calls to aid people having a bad experience with LSD or psilocybin mushrooms are " not uncommon . "
But a flurry of subsequent incidents represent an unusual surge in LSD - related calls for service .
On May 8 , a 21 - year - old male subject took LSD and wandered away from his residence .
He left his shoes , adequate clothing , and cell phone behind and did not tell anyone where he was going .
He wandered around the forest for days while concerned friends and family looked for him .
He eventually returned a couple days later .
On May 9 , officers responded to the Mad River Hospital to assist with a combative 19 - year - old male subject who was undergoing " flashbacks . "
The subject had ingested LSD two weeks ago .
Today , officers found him standing in the field being held by three friends who were attempting to get him into the emergency room .
The friends were requesting police assistance and wanted their friend to get help .
The officers detained the subject and held him for psychiatric evaluation by Humboldt County Mental Health .
Last night , officers responded to the 900 block of H Street where an 18 - year - old male subject , who was under the influence of LSD , was throwing himself on the ground in the middle of the street .
He was arrested and taken to jail .
Also last night , May 11 , officers from APD assisted officers from UPD arrest a subject who was under the influence of LSD .
Officers from the Arcata Police Department also had two additional contacts with unrelated subjects undergoing " flashbacks . "
Both were cared for by friends and family .
One subject was taken out of the area and back home by his family .
Ten Spec Writing Rules ( and why you should care )
While giving her ten commandments on writing a spec script in an interview a few years ago , Jane Espenson thought that “ this could be a good blog entry . ”
She was n’t wrong .
How to write a spec script for TV is a broad question that has many answers .
Her comment made me reminisce about some of the standard spec writing ground - rules .
I find that having some does not hinder creativity , but rather focuses it .
Here ’s a little ( albeit detailed ) reminder of some of them , starting with the most obvious .
1 . Do n’t spec a dead show
For the love of God , we do n’t want to know what Carrie did with Mr. Big ’s underwear or Ross ’ latest honeymoon with Rachel .
If the show is buried , leave it there .
2 . Do n’t spec a show you want to get hired on
Where to send spec scripts is another issue , but your sample television script should not be destined for the show you ’re basing it on .
This might sound crazy for some but if you think about it , it ’s pretty logical .
There are , firstly , some legal issues that might become involved .
More importantly though , it ’s just very hard for an outsider to nail a show right on the money .
As Martie Cook explains it in Write to TV :
If you are anyone on the Desperate Housewives writing staff , you know each of the characters intimately [… ] , you know absolutely every minor detail .
As a freelance writer , no matter how much you study a show before you write it , you simply wo n’t have the same inside track that the show ’s script writers and producers do .
It is quite probable that here and there throughout your script you may have things that are slightly off .
[ The Desperate Housewives writing staff ] will no doubt pick up on the flaws in your script instantly .
Go for the next - of - kin , meaning the next show closest ( regarding genre / voice / stories ) to the one you want to get hired on .
There have been some successful rule - breakers , but these are extremely rare cases .
3 . Spec a show you like
Not speccing the series you ’re aiming at does n’t mean you should n’t write something you do n’t like ( if anything , it ’s gonna show in your writing ) .
Do n’t spec a show simply because it ’s hot , but also because you ’re into it and have some kind of appreciation for it .
Passion is what drives you to be a writer , so why not use the same fuel for your script ?
4 . Do n’t write mythological episodes
You know these little toys you had as a kid and did n’t want anyone else to touch ?
Well the characters you ’re using belong to someone else .
You ’re allowed to play with them a bit , but the show - runner expects you to bring them back safely to him / her .
When you spec a show , go for the memorable stand - alone episode , not the big season finale .
If House suddenly learns he has a tumor , or Meredith Grey finds out she ’s pregnant , you ’re doing something wrong .
You can obviously play with characters ’ relationships and / or use bigger mysteries / arcs , but one of the ( many ) questions you should be asking yourself is if your episode can neatly fit anywhere in a given season of the show .
If the answer is yes , congrats , you ’ve got a stand - alone episode .
This does n’t mean though that your script should be pointless .
You need to provide the reader with an emotional ride , and perhaps even some thought - provoking content .
Use the already - defined protagonists ; they ’re here just for that reason .
For overly - serialized character shows you would n’t be able to understand without a Previously , the WB Writers ’ Workshop advises to “ set up your episode : ”
If you are writing a serialized show ( e.g. Gossip Girl or Grey ’s Anatomy ) please include a “ Previously On ” page that lists where your main characters are within the series when we come across them in your spec .
This page should come after your title page and before your teaser .
5 . Do n’t write around new characters
You ’re trying to prove that you can “ blend in ” a writing staff , and more importantly “ get ” the voice of a show .
Writing the backstory of Don Draper ’s hairdresser might be fun , but it certainly does n’t show how you can write the other Mad Men characters ( the ones in suits and dresses ) .
And in case you ’re wondering , limiting the amount of screen time a new character has does n’t mean there should n’t be any guest - stars .
If you ’re writing a procedural , you will definitely need to introduce new people ( victim , murderer , suspect , etc. ) , just make sure they ’re not the protagonists of your episode .
6 . Do n’t go for the obvious
If you have thought of it , chances are other writers on staff have too .
Think of why the show did n’t use that particular storyline .
Now look at your spec script outline .
The aim is to write better TV than what ’s on TV .
You have months , they have two weeks ( at best ) .
Do n’t be that guy / girl who throws an empty can of beer at your screen yelling “ My dog can write better than that ! ” , and then come up with a body - switch episode .
7 . Do n’t think too big , your spec must be realistically producible …
Maybe you should edit your spec script down .
Jane Espenson once told the story behind a failed Star Trek spec she did :
It was all epic .
And unfilmable .
I had demonstrated a complete lack of ability to tell a story with an eye toward real - life budget constraints .
And , as a result , I had ended up telling a story that they simply would n’t do on their show .
Writing a filmable spec , keeping it small enough , is an important part of the process .
8. … but do n’t expect it to get produced
Specs are mainly here to showcase your talent as well as show you can blend in a predetermined ensemble .
One of the greatest ironies of TV spec writing is that , even though you ’re striving to prove you can successfully write a one - hour drama , your “ proof ” wo n’t be made .
You can use that to your advantage by going bigger on some of the stories .
Alex Epstein in Crafty TV
Writing also makes an interesting point about censorship , and how your material can be “ slightly edgier ” to what ’s on TV :
If you are going to push the envelope , it should be in a direction that the show would naturally take if the network censors were all on holiday that week .
With that said , do n’t go too far .
Although you can thematically go beyond the usual , do n’t go overboard and start putting “ fuck ” every pages ( unless it ’s The Sopranos — but what the hell are you doing speccing a dead show ? ) .
Like getting staffed on your specced show , there have been very rare instances ( mostly in sitcoms ) where specs ended up being made .
There ’s also that guy who got struck by lightning twice .
You know what I mean .
9 . Keep it fresh
This is both about your choice of main storyline ( who wants to see a rehash of a plot done to death ? ) , as well as arcs you might have to use in your spec .
Your Grey ’s Anatomy script about Izzy Stevens wo n’t be of much use now that Katherine Heigl is off the show .
Try to keep it updated enough so as not to make your spec stale .
Doing this on a serialized show is obviously harder .
But like Botox , too much nip and tuck on your finished script , and it quickly becomes a mess .
As Jane Espenson puts it :
It ’s better to let a spec show a few of the signs of aging than to keep fattening its lips and lifting its keister until even you ca n’t recognize it anymore .
Fellowships find that 6 - month old scripts are fine as they consider it the correct amount of time for a good polish / new writing .
However , if it ’s a couple seasons old , cross it off .
10 . Watch , read , and study
Perhaps the single most important rule here .
You ’re aiming to mimic an already - existing show so that your own spec script format matches theirs .
The best way to know how it works is to do the three things listed : watch their episodes , read their scripts , study their structure .
If you can , you should definitely try to get your hands on the series ’ bible ( though that ’s going to be a hard thing to do ) .
Ask yourself :
What would a typical A , B , or C story be ?
How long are the teaser and the tag ?
Why are the act breaks here but not there ?
And for that matter , how many acts are there altogether ?
The list goes on .
You should also have a feel of how the characters talk , and even think .
Basically know the show by heart .
Remember that writing a spec script is still art , not science .
You could forget about everything and write for the double - edged sword that is ‘ stunt speccing . ’
If you ’re on top of your game and make the perfect script , kudos to you .
However if not done correctly , it could bomb massively ( and you ’d have wasted a lot of time writing it ) .
Perhaps I ’ll post a spec script example or two next time around .
Rules are meant to be broken , but some are also meant to be respected .
And since I did mention Jane Espenson ’s own ten commandments of TV Spec writing , here they are :
– Do n’t spec a show you do n’t respect .
– Do n’t make your spec about a guest character .
Focus on the main character .
– Get sample scripts of produced episodes .
Study them .
– Follow the show ’s structure exactly .
– Find a story for your spec that plays on the show ’s main theme .
– Do n’t write an episode that resolves the show ’s mystery or consummates its romance .
– Place the story turns at the act breaks , and give us a reason to come back after the commercials .
– In a comedy , spend time polishing the jokes , especially the last one of each scene .
– Spelling , formatting , clarity of stage directions – they really matter .
– Use strong brass brads .

Kal Penn works for President Barack Obama
Actor Kal Penn , who appeared in US TV drama House , has been robbed at gunpoint in Washington , his former publicist has confirmed .
A police report said an unnamed victim was forced to lie on the ground and give up his cell phone and other items .
Penn , 32 , was unavailable for comment and the Metropolitan Police Department would not release further information .
Last year , the actor - who starred in the Harold and Kumar films - decided to start working in politics full time .
The Indian - American star , whose real name is Kalpen Suresh Modi - took a job in the administration of President Barack Obama .
Penn is working in the White House 's office of public liaison , focusing on connecting the president with the Asian - American and Pacific Islander communities .
However , he is expected to make a return to acting in A Very Harold And Kumar Christmas , scheduled for release next year .
It ’s a bit late in the game , but the PPA has stepped forward with a new plan to move poker out of the cross hairs of the UIGEA .
That ’s the word from PPA head John Pappas .
In a video released this week , Pappas outlined a new plan by the PPA to help the online poker industry dodge the impact of the UIGEA : a petition to exempt online poker ( and other peer - to - peer wagering games ) from the law .
The petition is simply the latest in a series of twists and turns involving the UIGEA .
Originally signed into law in 2006 as part of a broader measure dealing with port security , the act was the subject of delays and controversy , existing in a legislative limbo until 2009 .
It was in December of that year that enforcement of the act was to formally get under way , a deadline that the PPA fought off by lobbying successfully for a six - month extension .
That extension expires June 1st , and analysts have been generally skeptical about the PPA ’s ability to further stave off the act .
It ’s a bit early to speculate on the chances of this latest strategy , but with only 22 signatures and less than a month before enforcement begins , Pappas seems like he ’s certainly fighting an uphill battle .
Judge for yourself – below is the video where Pappas talks about the petition and the impact the UIGEA will have on poker if his group fails to win an exemption :
Note that Pappas goes out of his way to clarify a couple of key points – first , that even without an exception , nothing about the UIGEA makes playing poker online illegal .
Second , and perhaps more critically , nothing about the UIGEA is designed to prevent players from withdrawing from online poker sites .
The big question has been , and still remains , the degree to which depositing will be impacted by the act .

Airlines are warning there will be delays from a backlog of flights trying to get into the UK and Europe even after ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland clears .
Hundreds of thousands of passengers are stranded with some being told it could be a week before they can get another flight .
The ash plume from Iceland 's volcano has now closed the airports of 22 countries in Europe 's north and north west .
Among the latest countries to announce restrictions to their airspace are Italy , Hungary , Switzerland and Romania .
Big dollars are being lost , and so are tempers , although some commuters are good humoured .
" It 's part of the adventure , I 'd have to say .
I may end up not getting to go to Poland and go on down to Munich or Vienna , " said one stranded traveller .
But most have had enough .
Like a couple due to be married in Mexico , a family on a rare holiday .
" We 've spent a year saving for it .
We have n't budgeted for what so far has racked up to be nearly 2,500 pounds for us to try and arrange to get home and obviously sort of up ourselves up in hotels and everything else , " the family said .
And a man at Paris ' Charles De Gaulle airport who spoke to the BBC 's correspondent .
The correspondent says he has been given one night in a hotel in a suburb 20 miles out of Paris .
" He does n't know how he is going to pay for the following night .
He says he has lost his bags , his wife 's medicines are in the bags , " he said .
" He said ' I am suicidal ' .
I do n't think he was but we was certainly a very , very unhappy man . "
Travel paralysed
Brian Flynn from the airspace regulator Eurocontrol , says the system has been paralysed .
" On a normal day like today we would be expecting about 29,000 flights .
It looks at the moment now that up to 17,000 , 18,000 of those flights might have been cancelled and we 'll only have somewhere between 11,000 and 12,000 flights today , " he said .
Some commuters have pressed on , via rail and ferry services .
Eurostar services to Paris and Brussels for example have sold out and British comic actor John Cleese made a Norwegian taxi - driver 's day , paying $ 5,400 for a ride from Oslo to Brussels .
A taxi driver in Moscow has seen the flight nightmare as a business opportunity .
He is offering to drive people to any location in Europe for a fare of $ 1,400 plus petrol .
He says that for a person who really wants to get somewhere , it is a reasonable price to ask .
" When such situations occur , there are opportunities and needs .
Why not earn some money ? " he said .
" I think that for a person who really wants to get somewhere , for business or personal reasons , this is a totally reasonable fare . "
Qantas cancellations
Qantas and Singapore Airlines have cancelled flights to Europe but are still flying to Asian stopover destinations .
Both are offering to fly passengers stranded in Asia back to Australia .
Susan Bredow , from Singapore Airlines , says the company is looking at re-booking people on flights to Europe in several days time .
" We 're looking at re-booking people five days out but obviously we would rebook them again if the situation was still bad in Europe , " she said .
Ms Bredow says Milan airport is about to close and more European airports could follow .
" There 's quite a few people in Singapore , we 're going to bring them home as soon as we can and then without any additional cost we 're rebook them back to their destination when they want to travel again , " she said .
Emirates is also foreshadowing that a number of its flights may be cancelled throughout the weekend .
The airline is advising customers to check its website to see if their flight is going ahead , as their call centres have been overwhelmed .
Meanwhile , British weather expert Brian Golding is warning that more ash is on the way .
" One of the key issues is how long the volcano 's going to carry on erupting and it does seem to have reinvigorated so we have a new set of ash coming into the wind stream heading more south from Iceland now perhaps than some of the earlier stuff , " he said .
" We expect it to head down towards the UK again and to reinforce the cloud that 's already here . "
Timing is everything .
Half the internet is busy screaming in outrage that the new XCOM is a first - person shooter rather than a turn - based strategy game , and then along comes Frozen Synapse .
This is the turn - based strategy game that 's going to put its arms around you , stroke your hair and say , " There , there .
Mummy still loves you . "
You have not been abandoned .
Not that Frozen Synapse does n't have room for more children in its brood .
If you traditionally recoil at the words ' turn - based ' , you 're going to be surprised by the accessibility and fluidity of this neon treat .
Most matches are done and dusted in under 15 minutes , and the action plays out so quickly that you 'll need to squint at instant replays to work out exactly what just happened
While the three chaps who comprise Oxford - based indie studio Mode 7 promise extensive single - player modes come final release , in Synapse 's current form - a beta of which is available right away to anyone who preorders - it 's very much a multiplayer prospect .
So much so that buying the game rather wonderfully grants you two copies , so you can pass one to a chum and have an instant nemesis .
Again , if the mention of multiplayer strategy instantly curdles your stomach acid , there 's a good chance this will buck your fearful expectations .
There 's no building or equipping of units , and the order interface is no more complicated than double - clicking to set a destination or drawing a line to tell your tiny chaps where to look and shoot .
The complication comes from second - guessing where your enemy will be , not from trying to work out which one of two dozen buttons means ' Shoot Him , For God 's Sake Shoot Him ' .
Looks complicated , huh ?
Nope .
Just double - click to set each one of those waypoints .
You can also drag them around if you want to rearrange before committing .
This is the thing : unless you 're a baby and play the lights - on , no fog - of - war mode , you can't see anything except what your small squad of soldiers can see .
If they can see an enemy , they 'll try to shoot him .
He will , of course , try to shoot you back .
Shooting is largely automated , and it's a one hit , one kill affair .
So what happens when two blokes catch each others ' eye ?
Well , that depends .
How far away from each other are they , and what weapons do they have ?
If they 're at range , one 's got a shotgun and the other 's got a machine gun , shottyboy is going down .
If they 've just bumped into each other in a corridor , the fire - from - the - hip shotgun will certainly best the machine gun .
More interestingly , your units ' accuracy and response time improves if they stay in one place for a little while .
So if two snipers spot each other , if either one has been lurking in his current position for a turn or two , he 'll let off a fatal shot before the other can say , " hey , he looks exactly like me , but he 's bright red ! "
Rocket launchers can only be fired at walls .
Nonetheless , they 'll still kill half the world .
The key is having a strong sense of where the enemy is likely to attack from and leaving your men in positions where they can catch the bounders as they wander by .
This brings us to Frozen Synapse 's neatest feature - watching an instant preview of how things will go down if your guess is correct .
Set your movement and fire orders , hit space and the game will drop into real - time , all your wee chaps running and shooting and hiding in exact accordance with your commands .
This , in itself , is pretty valuable , especially with rocket - launcher troops .
Splash damage or a stray bit of wall can nobble your own squad in a bloody instant , so it 's always best to check you 've not made a rookie error .
Better still , however , each previously spotted enemy leaves a last - known location ghost , which you can drag around and position to see what happens if they move to where you think they 're going to move .
It 's psychic chess , essentially .
Alaska 's tallest structure , a 1,350 - foot tall radio navigation tower , has been knocked down .
The Coast Guard carried out the demolition using controlled explosives .
Officials say the tower was deteriorating and at risk of collapse .
It was the tallest tower of its kind in the US .
Overall good game , but some bugs need to work out
I 'm enjoying the game , but I 'm having trouble with the saves .
Once I filled all the save slots , overwriting does not carry to the next gaming session .
( CNN ) --
The man convicted of killing Kansas abortion provider Dr. George Tiller last year was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole eligibility for 50 years .
Scott Roeder , 52 , was facing a minimum mandatory life sentence , but a Kansas judge had the power to decide whether he could be eligible for parole after 25 years or after 50 .
" The blood of babies is in your hands , " Roeder said as he was escorted from a Wichita , Kansas , courtroom on Thursday evening , referring to the district attorney who prosecuted him .
The Tiller family praised the sentence in a statement Thursday night .
" It is the most severe penalty available ... under Kansas law , " the family said .
" This crime was cruel and heinous not only because it took our husband , father and grandfather , but because it was a hate crime committed against George -- [ and ] also against all women and their constitutional rights . "
Roeder was convicted in January of murdering Tiller , who operated a clinic in Wichita , Kansas , where late - term abortions were performed .
Tiller was shot to death in May in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita as Sunday services began .
Speaking before his sentencing , Roeder blasted Tiller , quoted the Bible at length and argued the slaying was justified because he was protecting the unborn .
" You have the power to acquit and if you were to obey the higher power , God himself , you would acquit me , " Roeder told the judge , Warren Wilbert , before the sentence was handed down .
The sentence included an additional 24 months in prison for two aggravated assault convictions related to Tiller 's murder .
Abortion rights groups praised the sentence on Thursday .
" [ The ] decision makes it crystal clear that there is no justification for vigilante violence against health care providers who perform abortions , " said Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
" Others who may harbor such plans have been put on notice that violent attacks by anti-choice extremists will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and punished decisively . "
Before the sentence was handed down , Roeder said in court Thursday that he agonized over the decision to kill Tiller , but said the act was done so that the doctor could not " kill again . "
" It was the most agonizing and stressful decision I have ever had to make , and it took years to come to this conclusion , especially with the knowledge that I may never see my son , my daughter or my family again , " Roeder said at his sentencing at the Sedgwick County Courthouse .
" It is the duty of the state of Kansas to protect all of the people , including those whom George Tiller killed .
Had the courts acted rightfully , I would have not shot George Tiller , " he said .
" The blame for George Tiller 's death lies more with the state of Kansas than with me , " he said .
He spoke quickly and clearly .
Earlier in the sentencing , Tiller 's attorney , Lee Thompson , spoke on behalf of the slain doctor 's family , saying that Tiller 's killing was " domestic terrorism " that robbed a family of a husband , father and grandfather .
" This man was devoted to his family .
...
He was very important , and they are desperately sorry and grieving over his loss , " Thompson told the court .
" He 's committed an act of terrorism , a heinous , atrocious , cruel murder planned , plotted and devised for years and years and designed and executed solely for the purpose of killing someone with whom he disagreed , " Thompson said .
Prosecutors argued for life in prison without the opportunity for parole until after 50 years .
" I believe he should be given the longest sentence possible , " District Attorney Nola Foulston said Thursday .
But Mark Rudy , an assistant public defender , said there were no aggravating factors to warrant the " hard 50 . "
He told the judge that he and the defense team offered condolences to Tiller 's family and asked that " you follow the law . "
Wilbert , the judge , said that the aggravating factors included the fact that Tiller was shot in his church .
" Reformation Lutheran Church was not holding Tiller accountable for his sins , " Roeder responded .
" They were not a true church .
...
It was a synagogue of Satan , as the Bible talks about . "
After Roeder had spoken for about 40 minutes about what he said was the biblical justification for the killing , Wilbert stopped him .
" I 'm sorry , I 'm not providing you a forum for an all - night dissertation on the political debate on the issue of abortion , " Wilbert said .
Eugene Frye , who spoke Thursday on Roeder 's behalf , said he has known and prayed with him since the mid-1990s and described him as polite and courteous .
He said Roeder " could and would " spend hours discussing abortion and the Bible .
" I know Scott 's character cannot be separated from abortion , " he said in asking for the lesser sentence .
During his trial , Roeder testified he believed he had to kill Tiller to save lives and said he had no regrets .
" There was nothing being done , and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " he said .
" I felt that if someone did not do something , he was going to continue . "
George Hough , a psychologist who examined Roeder at the behest of the defense , said Roeder was competent .
" He did know what he was doing , " Hough said .
Roeder felt justified and did n't feel guilty , Hough said .
Roeder believed there was a higher law , God 's law , according to Hough .
In closing arguments , prosecutor Ann Swengel called Roeder 's testimony " chillingly horrific " and said he carried out a " planned assassination . "
Prosecutors initially fought to keep abortion out of the trial , saying that Tiller 's death was a straightforward case of premeditated murder .
Eventually , the abortion issue took center stage as prosecutors portrayed Tiller as a target of Roeder 's anti-abortion agenda , and defense attorneys attempted to mitigate his culpability under the theory that he believed Tiller 's death was justified to save the lives of others .
Defense attorney Steve Osburn said after the verdict that Roeder " feels remorse toward the family , but not for what he did . "
The trial drew activists from both sides of the abortion debate to the courtroom , and a van plastered with slogans and photos of fetuses was parked in a prominent spot in front of the courthouse .
Among the attendees were the Rev. Michael Bray , whose history in the anti-abortion movement includes 1985 conspiracy convictions in connection with a string of clinic bombings , and Katherine Spillar , executive vice president of the Feminist Majority Foundation .
Congregants from Reformation Lutheran testified they had seen Roeder at church several times before the day he killed Tiller by shooting him at point - blank range in the head .
Roeder 's defense team did not dispute much of the evidence .
Roeder testified he chose to target Tiller at church because it presented the best " window of opportunity " to attack the doctor , who traveled in an armored vehicle and whose clinic was a " fortress . "
Speaking about the church Thursday , Hough said it was the only place where Roeder felt Tiller was vulnerable .
" It solved his access problem , " he said .
Illinois is bankrupt , financially , politically , and morally .
When it comes to politicians in jail , Illinois is at the top of the list .
The volcano has already erupted , but Illinois just sits , bankrupting companies the state owes money to but has not paid .
Please consider Illinois deep in debt , does n’t pay bills
For 35 years , frail senior citizens in southern Illinois could turn to the Shawnee Development Council for help cleaning the house , buying groceries or any of the chores that make the difference between living at home or moving to an institution .
No more .
The council shut down the program Thursday because of a budget crisis created by the state of Illinois ' failure to pay its bills .
Paralyzed by the worst deficit in its history , the state has fallen months behind in paying what it owes to businesses and organizations , pushing some of them to the edge of bankruptcy .
Illinois is n't bothering with the formality of issuing IOUs , as California did last year .
It simply does n't pay .
Right now , $ 4.4 billion worth of bills , some dating back to October , are sitting in the Illinois comptroller 's office waiting to be paid someday .
Shawnee Development , for instance , is waiting on about $ 380,000 in back payments , officials say .
That amounts to one - quarter of the council 's budget for senior care in seven southern counties .
Prisons refused bullets
Illinois ' deadbeat reputation has created some embarrassing situations .
A supplier refused to sell bullets to the Department of Corrections unless it got paid in advance .
Legislators have gotten eviction notices for their district offices because the state was n't paying rent .
One legislator said he had to use campaign funds to pay the telephone bill after service was cut off at his office .
Illinois is on track to end the current fiscal year with about $ 6 billion in unpaid bills .
Budget proposals for the coming year — when the state faces a $ 13 billion deficit — assume the same thing will happen again .
Many agencies have borrowed money to keep the doors open , but service providers say that 's getting harder to do — banks are more reluctant to lend money on a promise that the state will pay up someday .
" We have had members whose banks have told them it is the creditworthiness of the state of Illinois that is their primary concern , " said Janet Stover , executive director of the Illinois Association of Rehabilitation Facilities .
Democratic Gov.
Pat Quinn has called for an income tax increase , but any money from that would be allocated to other areas , not paying routine bills .
Republicans want to tackle the deficit through spending cuts , which would also mean letting old bills go unpaid .
It 's likely that no dramatic movement in either direction will take place until after the November elections .

It ’s only natural : you want your kids to have it better than you did .
So how do you balance paying for college and investing for your retirement ?
Collective wisdom says retirement is your top priority , if not your only priority .
Selfish ?
Not at all .
Look at some of the pros and cons :
Why retirement is your top priority :
No one but you can fund your retirement .
No grants , no scholarships , no low - interest loans .
Run short of funds in your golden years ?
Your options may be limited : keep working ( if health allows ) , reverse mortgage your home or get help from family .
20 - plus years of retirement costs more than four years of college .
Like most investing , the more time you have , the more growth potential and dividend reinvestment you may get .
Why college comes second :
Cluster bombs contain hundreds of " bomblets " that can cover a large area British armed forces are being banned from using cluster munitions under a law passed by the House of Commons .
The law comes after the UK in 2008 signed an international convention outlawing the weapons - which have maimed and killed thousands of people .
The bombs were withdrawn from use by the UK in May 2008 and stockpiles are due to be destroyed by the end of 2013 .
First developed in World War II , they contain smaller " bomblets " designed to cover a large area and deter armies .
The Cluster Munitions ( Prohibitions )
Bill received the backing of all parties as it received an unopposed third reading in the Commons , having already completed its passage through the Lords .
It now goes for Royal Assent .
' Small step '
Cluster munitions eject dozens , sometimes hundreds , of tiny bomblets which can be dispersed to cause explosions over a wide area .
However , sometimes they do not detonate immediately , which means they pose a danger to vehicles or people , often children , who come into contact with them at a later date .
HOW A CLUSTER BOMB WORKS 1 : The cluster bomb , in this case a CBU - 87 , is dropped from a plane and can fly about nine miles before releasing its load of about 200 bomblets .
2 : The canister starts to spin and opens at an altitude between 1,000 m and 100 m , spraying the bomblets across a wide area .
3 : Each bomblet is the size of a soft drink can and contains hundreds of metal pieces .
When it explodes , it can cause deadly injuries up to 25 m away .
Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant said understanding of the horrific impact of the weapons had led to a change of political mood in favour of their prohibition .
He said a third of the people affected by them were children and at least 60 % of those killed or maimed had been civilians .
The bill allows the UK to enforce prohibitions set out in the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions .
The convention prohibits the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster bombs .
Non-signatories include the United States , Russia , China , Pakistan and Israel .
Shadow foreign office minister David Lidington said at a time when there were concerns about nuclear proliferation " it is good this evening to be able to mark a small step towards ridding the world of at least one particularly unpleasant category of lethal weapons " .
Liberal Democrat spokesman Edward Davey called on the government to work on clearing land where British forces had dropped cluster bombs and to press for non-signatories to support the convention .
But concerns were raised about how the law would affect UK troops working alongside non-signatories in Afghanistan .

In the early 1960s , I wrote an appreciative essay for The New Yorker about the science fiction of Arthur Clarke .
Not long after I got a letter from Clarke written from Sri Lanka where he lived .
He told me that he was coming to New York in a few weeks and wanted to meet me .
When we met , I asked him the purpose of his visit .
His answer totally astonished me .
“ I am working on the son of Dr. Strangelove , ” is what he said .
The film had just come out and the first time I saw it I was so impressed that I sat through it a second time .
“ Stanley , ” he said referring to Kubrick , “ is a remarkable man .
You should meet him . ”
I told Clarke that nothing would please me more .
Much to my amazement , the next day Clarke called to say that I was expected that afternoon at Kubrick ’s apartment on Central Park West .
I had never met a movie mogul and had no idea what to expect .
But as soon as Kubrick opened the door I felt an immediate kindred spirit .
He looked and acted like every obsessive theoretical physicist I have ever known .
His obsession at that moment was whether or not anything could go faster than the speed of light .
I explained to him that according to the theory of relativity no information bearing signal could go faster .
We conversed like that for about an hour when I looked at my watch and realized I had to go .
“ Why ? ” he asked , seeing no reason why a conversation that he was finding interesting should stop .
I told him I had a date with a chess hustler in Washington Square Park to play for money .
Kubrick wanted the name .
“ Fred Duval ” I said .
Duval was a Haitian who claimed to be related to Francois Duvalier .
I was absolutely positive that the name would mean nothing to Kubrick .
His next remark nearly floored me .
“ Duval is a patzer , ” is what he said .
Unless you have been around chess players you cannot imagine what an insult this is .
Moreover , Duval and I were playing just about even .
What did that make me ?
Kubrick explained that early in his career he too played chess for money in the park and that Duval was so weak that it was hardly worth playing him .
I said that we should play some time and then left the apartment .
I was quite sure that we would never play .
I was wrong .
I wrote a Talk of the Town on my meeting with Kubrick , which he liked .
I was thus emboldened to ask if I could write a full scale profile of him .
He agreed but said that he was about to leave for London to begin production of what became 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Still better , I thought : I could watch the making of the film .
Our first meeting was at the Hotel Dorchester in London where he was temporarily living with his family .
Kubrick brought out a chess set and beat me promptly .
Then we played three more games and he beat me less promptly .
But I won the fifth game !
Seizing the moment I told him that I had been hustling him and had deliberately lost the first four games .
His response was that I was a patzer .
All during the filming of 2001 we played chess whenever I was in London and every fifth game I did something unusual .
Finally we reached the 25th game and it was agreed that this would decide the matter .
Well into the game he made a move that I was sure was a loser .
He even clutched his stomach to show how upset he was .
But it was a trap and I was promptly clobbered .
“ You did n’t know I could act too , ” he remarked .
The scene now shifts to the spring of 1972 .
I was spending the year at Oxford , and spent some Sundays with the Kubricks .
Our interest again turned to chess but this time it was with the imminent match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in Iceland .
One Sunday , Kubrick and I watched Fischer ’s interview with Mike Wallace for “ 60 Minutes . ”
It was around the time of Fischer ’s birthday and Wallace had come with a cake .
“ I do n’t like that kind of cake , ” Fischer said graciously .
Then he told Wallace how he had learned to play chess .
His older sister had taught him the moves .
He soon began beating her so he spotted her pieces .
Then he said that that no longer worked so he began playing with himself —
Fischer vs. Fischer .
“ Mostly I won , ” he commented with no trace of humor .
I expected a pleasant summer in Oxford reading about the match but one morning in May the phone rang in my office .
The man on the line identified himself as the features editor of Playboy .
He informed me that Hugh Heffner was interested in chess and had read my New Yorker profile of Kubrick .
They had decided that I was the perfect person to write about the Fischer - Spassky match for Playboy .
They would pay all my expenses and I would even have the American grandmaster Larry Evans at my disposal .
It sounded too good to be true and , indeed , I had a problem .
My writing for the New Yorker was not going down that well with my academic colleagues and writing for Playboy would be the last straw .
He said not to worry I could use an assumed name .
So I agreed .
( I chose “ Jay Amber ” — “ Bernstein ” being the German for “ Amber . ” )
Much has been written about the match and I will only add a few personal recollections .
Fischer got there the fourth of July , two days after the match had been scheduled to start .
When the first game actually began on the eleventh , Spassky showed up on time but there was no Fischer .
Finally , Fischer arrived , and quickly made it clear that he was much more concerned by a TV cameraman ’s recording of the games than actually playing them .
Indeed , after an incredibly bad move , he lost .
Fischer then failed to appear at all for the second game , which he forfeited to go down two - zip .
That was about as good as it got for Spassky .
Once Fischer actually began to play it was clear that Spassky had no chance .
Fischer was in another league .
There was a room at the tournament where grandmasters met to watch .
They would predict Fischer ’s next move and , more often than not , he would do something none of them had anticipated .
A remarkable group of writers including Arthur Koestler and Harold Schonberg , who had played chess with Fischer and was the music critic of The New York Times , also turned up .
We gathered in the lobby of the Hotel Loftleider to exchange stories and to catch an occasional glimpse of Fischer as he went off for midnight bowling .
When the match ended Schonberg predicted that Fischer would never play another .
At the time I thought that Schonberg was surely wrong , but he was n’t .
The only match he ever did play was in 1992 when he played Spassky again , this time in Yugoslavia .
Fischer won but the experts detected a decline in his game .
He was succeeded as world champion first by Anatoly Karpov and then by Garry Kasparov , whose 1997 loss to the chess computer Deep Blue , had , in a sense , been predicted by Kubrick and Clarke decades earlier .
In Kubrick ’s 2001 , before HAL 9000 , the villainous computer , turns murderous , he roundly beats his human opponent , the astronaut Frank Poole , in a chess match .
For his part , Fischer spent the rest of his life a fugitive from both American and Japanese law .
In 2005 he returned to Iceland , where he sought asylum .
He was granted Icelandic citizenship and died in Reykjavik on January 17 , 2008 .

Israeli Orders : KILL JFK !
The Problem : JFK would not allow Israel to have the nuclear bomb and plutonium from materials created at Dimona .
To make sure of it , he demanded 6 months inspections of the facility by the USA .
JFK was angry with France for having built the Dimona facility in the first place and he supported Algeria in their Revolutionary War for Independence .
His foreign policy absolutely enraged Ben-Gurion as well as French nationalists .
The Ben-Gurion government , already under pressure from the LAVON AFFAIR and JFK , collapsed on the 16th of June 1963 .
Read the letter from JFK to the followup Prime Minister , LEVI ESHKOL , dated July 5 , 1963 .
DIMONA AERIAL PHOTO
DIMONA MAP
THE MARILYN MONROE HONEY TRAP .
The original plan to get rid of JFK failed .
Then ......
assassinated in Dallas , Texas , Dealey Plaza , as his limousine drove by the Texas Scho Americans Wake Up !
JFK had to be eliminated and replaced by LBJ in order for Israel to make nuclear bombs .
LBJ , having several Jewish ancestors , maternal great grandparents , was totally sympathetic to Israel .
JFK had given orders for the CIA to eliminate the Chinese nuclear facility .
China was cooperating with Israeli nuclear testing in exchange for advanced nuclear technological information .
LBJ also rescinded that order .
All other Kennedys who even thought about running for President had to be eliminated , because they would find out the truth about Israel when in the presidency , and in control of the CIA .
The elimination of Ted Kennedy , by an arranged accident , and the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and John Kennedy Jr. were a necessity for Israel to keep the lid on the JFK assassination by the Mossad and their operatives .
JFK's father , Joseph P.Kennedy , ambassador to Great Britain in 1939 , was a known " anti-semite " - believed due to his early connections with the Jewish criminal mob , the pro-German British P.M. - Chamberlain , and the German company , I. G. Farben .
LEE HARVEY OSWALD was setup to be the " patsy " by his connections to Clay Shaw and Permindex which was a Mossad front organization and also by CIA agent E. Howard Hunt who wanted a " fake " assassination attempt to implicate Cuba .
The real assassins were French Corsicans set up by Yitzhak Shamir a Mossad assassin himself .
The fatal shots were fired from the GRASSY KNOLL .
Oswald was arrested and charged with 2 murders .
Enter Jack Ruby to seal the plot .
JACK RUBY ( RUBINSTEIN )
Age 52 in 1963 .
The 1st attempt to kill Oswald .
Jack Ruby was tied into the Jewish mob by dealings with Meyer Lansky , the " King of Crime . "
It was intended that Lee Harvey Oswald would die in the assassination plot .
According to the Warren Report Mark Lane testimony , a meeting took place between Ruby , Officer Tippit , and a " phoney carpet salesman " possible Mossad - agent Bernie Weissman * at Ruby 's Carousel Club on the 14th , eight days before the JFK assassination .
It is likely plans were made for the execution of Oswald by Officer Tippit at the pre-arranged meeting site known ahead of time .
Oswald by then , may have realized he was being set up as the patsy and shot Officer Tippit instead at 1:15 PM , 45 minutes after the assassination of JFK .
( Oswald was seen running away ) .
However , other reports indicate that Ruby was on the scene also intending to shoot Oswald but instead shot Officer Tippet .
Descriptions of the " other man " favored Ruby .
The weapon used was an automatic , not Oswald 's gun .
When Oswald unexpectedly survived , and was captured and arrested , he had to be killed by the Jewish mob to keep the real truth - of - the - matter from interrogators and the U.S. public .
(* Weissman arrived Nov 4th in Dallas and departed on the 27th .
He denied the meeting allegation , but his strange testimony could only be believed with a stretch of the political imagination .
We think he was lying . - ed. )
Below are some of the strange statements made by Jack Ruby .
The day before the JFK assassination , November 21st at noontime in Assistant District Attorney Ben Ellis ' office in front of 6 others , Ruby introduced himself to Ben Ellis and told Mr. Ellis , " You probably do n't know me now , but you will . " ( quoting report to Chief Curry from Lt W.F. Dyson - Dallas archives )
Ruby paid off a colored employee and said : " You had better get it all tonight , because I wo n't be around . "
Ruby then went to the Police station on Friday night , the 22nd , posed as a writer or interpreter for Jewish newspaper people , and on the 3rd floor of the police department tried to kill Oswald but could not get the opportunity .
( Verified by HUDKINS , reporter of the Houston Post . )
The wife of Yitzhak Rabin , Leah Rabin , revealed in a biography , that Rabin was in Dallas when Kennedy was assassinated .
There is little doubt that Ruby was connected to Rabin and Israel during those moments he was seeking to kill Oswald .
" Yes , Rabin could have been one of the " journalists , " writes Jewish author BARRY CHAMISH .
According to the Houston Post , and / or Houston Chronicle , after Ruby had finally seized the opportunity to kill Oswald at 11:21 AM on Sunday morning , the 24th , shortly after , he blurted out that he and others were going to be " the cause of the death of 25 million Jews , " meaning ... if the investigators could figure it out .
Ruby 's phoney story : he was " relieving Jackie Kennedy to have to come to Dallas to testify . "
But later he said : " the world will never know - nor would they believe - what took place here " and " take me to Washington DC and I will tell you all that I know .
I cannot say anything here , I am the only one left that can tell you everything . "
Then Ruby conveniently died of " Lung Cancer " .
- Maybe .
Ruby was noted for blurting out INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS .
Many believed that he could not hold a secret or be trusted .
Ruby was convinced that all the Jews of the world would be slaughtered .
( Yes , he had already tipped his mit about the Jews - ed. )
" When they brought in the death penalty , he cracked .
Ten days later he rammed his head into a cell wall .
Then he tried to kill himself with an electric light socket .
Then he tried to hang himself with sheets . "
( Then they just helped him do it with " lung cancer " , at age 55 .
Ruby told his family that he was injected with cancer cells .
He had to go , just like Oswald , to conceal the truth . - ed. ) .
DEATHS CONCEALING THE TRUTH .
Did Ruby meet Oswald at 2:15 AM
Friday , in the early morning hours before the JFK assassination ?
Read this testimony of MARY LAWRENCE , waitress at the B&B Cafe in Mesquite , Texas , just east of Dallas .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This short webpage is not intended to give all the details about the JFK assassination , but only the motivation of Israel to commit the crime , and the motive of Ruby for the assassination of Oswald - to save the Jewish People from what he thought would be total annihilation , if the truth were uncovered .
It also questions the official version , and as many as 35 other versions laying the blame on the " mafia , " , the CIA , etc .
It 's obvious to many that Oswald was the patsy , but the Israeli hand is invisible to the unaware .
In our opinion , Israel gave the order .
The Mossad carried it out .
Ruby covered it up .
The JFK assassination was the most successful crime of the century .

The only real incident of note at last year 's ' tea party ' rallies on tax day , April 15 , came when a passionate protester tossed a box of tea bags over the White House fence .
This year , things are looking a little dicier .
In towns large and small on Thursday , which is tax day , tea partyers are planning to march against big government – and the rhetoric is getting heated as counterdemonstrators mobilize .
Some agents provocateurs say they ’ll crash the tea parties , and the threat of fisticuffs and worse is hanging in the air .
IN PICTURES : Tea Parties
Both sides have been fueled by the Internet 's churning of partisan , even extreme , politics .
One commenter , a tea - party supporter , recently warned of a looming " low - grade civil war . ”
But evidence , political scientists say , shows that political conflict rarely erupts in the United States once protesters and counterprotesters are actually toe - to - toe .
In fact , partisans meeting on the street – away from their keyboards , TVs , and radios – may have a moderating effect .
" Mainstream politics is sort of like listening to two lawyers arguing , while [ political outsiders ] sound more like two guys getting ready for a bar fight , " says political scientist Charles Franklin at the University of Wisconsin in Madison .
" If opposition rallies start showing up or infiltrating the tea party , you do run the risk of fisticuffs .
But you might have the opposite effect :
If we 're face to face , I might not actually punch you in the nose . "
Yet the tension is palpable .
Crashing the tea party
A group called Crash the Tea Party is recruiting activists from New Hampshire to California to infiltrate hundreds of planned tea -party events .
It ’s urging activists to hold up racist signs in order to paint the movement in a negative light .
Tea partyers say they 'll bring video cameras to root out any imposters .
In North Carolina , a new state regulation bans flags and signs from being carried on poles .
This means that tax protesters can wave objects only as big as the flags handed out at a Fourth of July parade .
According to state officials , the rule was put into place last September to prevent ralliers from inadvertently injuring one another .
But others suspect that the measure is aimed at suppressing intentional violence .
Raleigh ’s News & Observer writes , " The ban comes as , elsewhere in the nation , demonstrations have become heated and raucous . "
" It 's sad our country has come to this , " Laura Long , who applied for a permit for a tea-party rally on Thursday , told the N&O .
Reports from New Orleans that a couple attending the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in the city was beaten up for wearing Sarah Palin pins were wrong .
But that did n't stop Internet commenters from sensing a looming battle .
" If i am attacked at a rally ... someone will end up in their grave ....
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !!!!! " writes a commenter at the conservative Gateway Pundit blog .
And the Sooner Tea Party group in Oklahoma made news this week when it announced it was getting help from legislators to start a state - sanctioned militia to protect residents from illegal federal encroachment and in anticipation of civil breakdown .
Then again , not all threats are rhetorical , as this street fight in Florida last year shows .
Liberal activists say tea partyers ratcheted up the threat when they began carrying guns to protests .
The counterprotesters have also been motivated by the provocative signs and rude epithets allegedly hurled by some tea -party members .
On liberal blogs , the phrase " violent racist teabaggers " occurs time and again .
" I predict the ... teabaggers will defeat themselves , and take down the Repubs with them .
Then again never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers , " writes a commenter on the progressive Truthout site .
The impact of agents provocateurs
Ultimately , agents provocateurs seldom make an impact , says Mr. Franklin , who is co-founder of Pollster.com .
He points to Rush Limbaugh 's exhortations for conservatives to vote in Democratic primaries during the 2008 presidential election .
Such votes were essentially a nonfactor .
" Ultimately , the way the progressives win against the tea party is more through mainstream political action and less through tricks at campaign rallies , " he says .
At a tea-party rally Wednesday morning in Boston , featuring Ms. Palin , liberal activists waving pro-Obama posters were keen to provide counterweight to a tea - party movement that polls show is itself becoming more mainstream .
But the passion never devolved to violence .
Scattered in small clumps throughout the crowd , tea-party opponents reported receiving mixed reactions from rally attendees , says the Monitor 's Will Buchanan , who was on the scene .
Obama supporter Annie Reed of Brookline , Mass. , for one , said she was called at various points a " communist " and " America hater . "
Someone suggested that she move to Russia .
But for others , the rally was an opportunity for constructive political discourse .
One man in the crowd engaged several tea partyers in a measured back - and - forth discussion about the definition of patriotism and what " real American " means .
As for displays of anger and rudeness , something the tea -party movement has been criticized for , liberals in Boston showed they can dish it out , too .
Derogatory statements about Palin were in evidence on signs and T - shirts sported by the counterprotesters .

In March , I wrote a column detailing a number of credible accusations made against the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) for instituting a quota system for arrests and for stop - and - frisk searches .
At the same time , additional allegations charged higher - ups in the department with actively discouraging crime victims from reporting crimes — as well as downgrading felonies to misdemeanors — in order to make the city 's crime statistics look better .
Taken together , these allegations painted an ugly picture of New Yorkers being stopped , hassled , and frisked for either petty offenses or for no offense at all , while the victims of acutal crimes faced unsympathetic law enforcement officials .
The quota allegations stemmed from several audio recordings made by Officer Adil Polanco of instructions given to him and other officers by various superiors .
When the recordings surfaced , NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said officers are encouraged to meet " goals , " but denied the existence of arrest or citation quotas .
As for the charge that the NYPD was burying reports of actual crime , those allegations came from a survey of retired high - ranking NYPD officers conducted by two Molloy College criminologists .
The NYPD dismissed the study , while critics such as the Manhattan Institute 's Heather Mac Donald called it " irredeemably flawed . "
Now comes another set of recordings from another New York precinct that validates both the Molloy study and Polanco 's allegations .
Earlier this month , the Village Voice obtained over 100 recordings of roll call meetings in Brooklyn's 81st precinct made by Officer Adrian Schoolcraft .
They 're damning .
Schoolcraft , for example , recorded a fellow officer lamenting that he'd been instructed to downgrade a car theft to " unauthorized use of a vehicle , " as well as to find a way around reporting the thefts of a cell phone and video game system .
In another recording , Schoolcraft captured the results as he voiced his concerns about crime stats manipulation to a unit within the department that audits such data .
One officer with the unit acknowledged the political pressure to juke the stats .
" The mayor 's looking for it , the police commissioner 's looking for it …every commanding officer wants to show it , " he said .
" So there 's motivation not to classify reports for the seven major crimes . "
In other words , the statistical manipulation extends beyond property crimes .
Journalist Debbie Nathan , who was sexually assaulted in a city park last February , says that she was shocked to learn that the officers who wrote up her report classified the crime as a misdemeanor .
It was later upgraded to a felony , but only after Nathan went to the district attorney .
And according to the DA 's investigation , the six officers who responded to Nathan 's attack admitted leaving key portions of her story out of the report .
As Nathan told the Village Voice , rape crisis centers throughout New York City have documented similar complaints from victims of sexual assault .
Schoolcraft also documented evidence of the hard quotas officers had to meet with respect to both arrests and citations .
As the Voice summarized :
Police officers were routinely threatened with discipline ( transfers , shift changes , partner changes , and assignment changes ) by their superiors if they did not make their monthly quota of summonses , stop - and - frisks , arrests , and community visits .
Officers were instructed to arrest people for " blocking the sidewalk , " for not possessing ID ( even while just feet from their homes ) , even for no reason at all ( cops were told to " articulate " a charge at a later time ) .
The cops were told to make arrests even if they knew they'd be voiding the charge at the end of their shifts .
As a sergeant implores in one recording , " Again , it 's all about the numbers . "
About those numbers :
While only about one tenth of 1 percent of the stops yielded a gun ( at present it 's nearly impossible to legally carry a gun in New York ) , the practice has helped drive up the city 's marijuana arrests from 4,000 in 1997 to 40,000 in 2007 .
Marijuana for personal use was actually decriminalized in New York during that period .
But you still can't display your pot in public .
So the police simply stop people , trick them into emptying their pockets , and then arrest them for displaying marijuana in public .
This is the natural progression of two related policing trends in New York : Broken Windows , which posits that cracking down on petty crime leads to a reduction in more serious crime , and COMPSTAT , a data - driven method of policing .
There 's debate over the effectiveness of both policies , but even if they do work to drive down crime , it 's important to understand the political realities of the institutions that are using them .
Politicians want lower crime rates .
This is the demand they make of the police officials who report to them .
If your policing philosophy is Broken Windows , and your method of accountability is COMPSTAT , over time there will be a natural pull on the police department to enforce increasingly petty offenses and to manipulate data on more serious crimes .
The department brass knows they 're evaluated on the serious crime rate , and they 've bought into the idea that the best way to control the serious crime rate is to aggressively enforce the low - level stuff .
In addition to the obvious civil liberties concerns about stopping , arresting , and holding people for non-crimes , these practices also poison police - community relations , particularly among minority groups .
Harass people for non-crimes while brushing off actual crimes , and the people are eventually going to lose trust in law enforcement .
Blacks and Latinos made up an incredible 90 percent of the stop - and - frisks in 2009 , yet the arrest rate among those stopped was about the same as that of whites .
( It is n't clear how many arrests led to actual convictions . )
And while the city 's crime rate has dropped dramatically since the early 1990s , the stop - and - frisk phenomenon is relatively recent and growing fast .
The rate has tripled since 2003 .
Unfortunately , the current political class in New York has bought into the idea that these policies are responsible for the drop in crime .
It seems odd to say that it will take an unusually conscientious politician to call for a crime policy that does n't involve suppressing real crimes , manufacturing fake ones , and harassing the citizenry .
But that is precisely what it will take .

U.S. not accepting foreign help on oil spill
When State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley refused to tell reporters which countries have offered assistance to help respond to the BP oil spill , the State Department press corps was flabbergasted .
" As a policy matter , we ’re not going to identify those offers of assistance until we are able to see , you know , what we need , assess the ongoing situation .
And as we accept those offers of assistance , we will inform you , " Crowley said .
Reporters pointed out that the Bush administration identified assistance offers after the Katrina disaster , so what is this , a new policy ?
They pressed Crowley , but he refused to budge .
Then they mentioned Iran ’s offer of assistance , through its National Iranian Drilling Company .
Crowley said there was no Iranian offer of assistance , at least in any official capacity .
The reporters kept on it , asking why it was taking so long to figure out what was needed in the first place ?
That ’s the Coast Guard ’s decision , Crowley explained .
Late Wednesday evening , the State Department emailed reporters identifying the 13 entities that had offered the U.S. oil spill assistance .
They were the governments of Canada , Croatia , France , Germany , Ireland , Mexico , the Netherlands , Norway , Romania , Republic of Korea , Spain , Sweden , the United Kingdom , and the United Nations .
" These offers include experts in various aspects of oil spill impacts , research and technical expertise , booms , chemical oil dispersants , oil pumps , skimmers , and wildlife treatment , " the email read .
" While there is no need right now that the U.S. cannot meet , the U.S. Coast Guard is assessing these offers of assistance to see if there will be something which we will need in the near future . "
The Obama administration has been relentless in its messaging that it is doing everything possible to aggressively respond to the oil spill .
But for the record , the current message to foreign governments is :
Thanks but no thanks , we ’ve got it covered .
A State Department official , speaking on background , said that the decision not to initially release the names of offering countries came directly from the State Department leadership .
libjpeg - turbo
libjpeg - turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions ( MMX , SSE2 , AVX2 , NEON , AltiVec ) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86 , x86-64 , ARM , and PowerPC systems , as well as progressive JPEG compression on x86 and x86 - 64 systems .
On such systems , libjpeg - turbo is generally 2 - 6 x as fast as libjpeg , all else being equal .
On other types of systems , libjpeg - turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount , by virtue of its highly - optimized Huffman coding routines .
In many cases , the performance of libjpeg - turbo rivals that of proprietary high - speed JPEG codecs .
libjpeg - turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API .
libjpeg - turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from / decompress to 32 - bit and big-endian pixel buffers ( RGBX , XBGR , etc. ) , as well as a full - featured Java interface .
libjpeg - turbo was originally based on libjpeg / SIMD , an MMX - accelerated derivative of libjpeg v6b developed by Miyasaka Masaru .
The TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec in 2009 , and in early 2010 , libjpeg - turbo spun off into an independent project , with the goal of making high - speed JPEG compression / decompression technology available to a broader range of users and developers .

Had we done that on the morning of 9/12 — when gasoline averaged $ 1.66 a gallon — the majority of Americans would have signed on .
They wanted to do something to strengthen the country they love .
Instead , Bush told a few of us to go to war and the rest of us to go shopping .
So today , gasoline costs twice as much at the pump , with most of that increase going to countries hostile to our values , while China is rapidly becoming the world ’s leader in wind , solar , electric cars and high - speed rail .

Sadly , President Obama seems intent on squandering his environmental 9/11 with a Bush - level failure of imagination .
So far , the Obama policy is : “ Think small and carry a big stick . ”
He is rightly hammering the oil company executives .
But he is offering no big strategy to end our oil addiction .
Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman have unveiled their new energy bill , which the president has endorsed but only in a very tepid way .
Why tepid ?
Because Kerry - Lieberman embraces vitally important fees on carbon emissions that the White House is afraid will be exploited by Republicans in the midterm elections .
The G.O.P. , they fear , will scream carbon “ tax ” at every Democrat who would support this bill , and Obama , having already asked Democrats to make a hard vote on health care , feels he ca n’t ask them for another .
I do n’t buy it .
In the wake of this historic oil spill , the right policy — a bill to help end our addiction to oil — is also the right politics .
The people are ahead of their politicians .
So is the U.S. military .
There are many conservatives who would embrace a carbon tax or gasoline tax if it was offset by a cut in payroll taxes or corporate taxes , so we could foster new jobs and clean air at the same time .
If Republicans label Democrats “ gas taxers ” then Democrats should label them “ Conservatives for OPEC ” or “ Friends of BP . ”
Shill , baby , shill .
Why is Obama playing defense ?
Just how much oil has to spill into the gulf , how much wildlife has to die , how many radical mosques need to be built with our gasoline purchases to produce more Times Square bombers , before it becomes politically “ safe ” for the president to say he is going to end our oil addiction ?
Indeed , where is “ The Obama End to Oil Addiction Act ” ?
Why does everything have to emerge from the House and Senate ?
What does he want ?
What is his vision ?
What are his redlines ?
I do n’t know .
But I do know that without a fixed , long - term price on carbon , none of the president ’s important investments in clean power research and development will ever scale .
Obama has assembled a great team that could help him make his case — John Holdren , science adviser ; Carol Browner , energy adviser ; Energy Secretary Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize winner ; and Lisa Jackson , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency .
But they have been badly underutilized by the White House .
I know endangered species that are seen by the public more often than them .

BERLIN — Europe on Thursday moved closer to approving a Greek bailout after Germany 's three main opposition parties agreed to fast - track consideration for € 8.4 billion ( $ 11.08 billion ) in German aid for its debt - laden euro - zone partner .
Support from all parties in Parliament was necessary to implement the fast - track procedure in Germany 's lower house , where it usually takes months for a bill to become law .
What ...
Apple last week instated a stay on new retail orders for MacBook Pros as it prepares to introduce the first significant updates to the professional notebook line in over a year .
Meanwhile , AppleInsider has learned of the Mac maker 's plans to adopt Intel 's lower - spec'd Core i3 series of processors in some of its future offerings .
MacBook Pros
Over the weekend , several people with ties to Apple 's retail and reseller channels passed along word of anomalies regarding inventories of MacBook Pros , specifically :
One person noted that his / her Apple retail store 's inventory manager has been prohibited from placing any new orders for MacBook Pros through the company even though the store had run out of models to sell to customers .
Another person noted that his / her Apple retail store had similarly run out of 13 - and 17 - inch MacBook Pros , which has never happened at that particular store since he / she worked there .
A third person employed at an Apple retail store noted that stock of all three sizes of MacBook Pros were dangerously low as of this weekend .
The inventory manager at that store was instructed to make room for a shipment of 16 palettes of Mac merchandise on either Tuesday or Wednesday , which is 4 palettes more Mac merchandize than the store typically stocks in total .
Those reports arrived on the heels of a screenshot posting by a MicroCenter employee to his Reedit page this weekend showing four new Apple SKUs for Mac products in his store 's database with price points that match those of Apple 's existing 15 - and 17 - inch MacBook Pros :
Apple System Good -USA MC371LL / A ( $ 1,799.99 )
Mac system # 1 Best - USA MC373LL / A ( $ 2,199.99 )
Mac system # 2 Best - USA MC024LL / A ( $ 2,299.99 )
Mac system Better - USA MC372LL / A ( $ 1,999.99 )
Also , an AppleInsider reader has posted to his blog a list of 11 online Apple stores where MacBook Pros can't be shipped in 24 hours .
Last week , Taiwanese newspaper Apple Daily reported that Apple would update MacBooks , MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs this month .
That report was followed by one out of Macworld Australia pegging the date for MacBook Pros as Tuesday , April 13th ( tomorrow ) .
Intel Core i3
Meanwhile , people familiar with the matter tell AppleInsider that Apple has intended to use Intel 's 2.26 GHz 350M
Core i3 processor for the low end of at least some of its forthcoming Mac models and the Core i7 for some of its extreme or BTO models , employing the Core i5's for the meat of the product refreshes .
It was n't specified , however , whether the models in question were notebooks or iMacs .
And so finally , 10 men , six categories and 198 Test players come together to produce one all - time Pakistan XI .
It was n't , on final balance , as difficult a task as it may have initially appeared .
As many as four players were unanimous picks : Imran Khan , Javed Miandad , Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis would in all likelihood be among the top contenders on any such global list .
Two more batting greats , Hanif Mohammad and Inzamam - ul - Haq , were near - unanimous selections , with nine votes each .
And with Abdul Qadir picking up eight votes as the sole spinner , it means as many as seven of an all - time Pakistan XI pick themselves .
Pleasingly perhaps , the XI takes in players from all eras , recognition of the prolific ability of the land to keep producing talent no matter the circumstances of the time and era : Hanif Mohammad and Fazal Mahmood from the 50s and 60s , Zaheer Abbas , Miandad , Imran and Qadir from the 70s through to the early 90s , and the rest from the mid-80s onwards .
Tellingly , given how Pakistan have fared this last decade , the latest Test debutant is Rashid Latif ( 1992 ) .
The choice of Latif , in fact , was n't a straightforward one ; his greater batting ability tips the scales in his favour .
Finally , a word about the shape of the line - up .
Pakistan have been at their best when they have played attacking , aggressive cricket , Almost exclusively , that has come from the nature of their bowling attack , which is why the all - time XI has a four - man bowling attack and Imran Khan .
Some might argue that another specialist middle - order batsman should have been in the line - up , but the selection assumes picking players at the peak of their skills .
So Imran 's naturally solid technique provides a robust enough presence at six , around which the line - up pivots .
Latif and Akram below him add up to almost another batsman .
That leaves the bowling attack to be as spectacular as any that can be conceived .
Just imagine a four - man fast - bowling attack of the variety , skill and pace of this one : Imran , Fazal , Wasim and Waqar .
With Qadir backing up , there is enough wicket - taking threat here to trouble any batting side , on any surface , from any era .
The XI
Saeed Anwar
" He used an eclectic approach to batting - classical betrothed to unorthodox , footwork against spin as quick as a hiccup , and wrists supple yet powerful to brush the field like a Picasso . "
Ramiz Raja
Hanif Mohammad
" Hanif bestrode the cricket world like a Colossus of Rhodes .
His patience was monumental , his judgement unique ; fearless of his opponents , he shared his respect for them , both in victory and defeat .
In common with many great sporting figures of the 20th century , his legend continues to grow with time . "
Khadim Baloch
Zaheer Abbas
" Zaheer Abbas ' consistency both at first - class level and in Tests was phenomenal .
Where his contemporaries struggled he remained calm and calculating , displaying his technique against great spinners of time ; and not a bad player of fast bowling . "
Qamar Ahmed
Javed Miandad
" He was positive and aggressive in his approach , and the tougher the situation the more he seemed to revel in the challenge .
His enthusiasm was extremely infectious , which made him one of the best team men I have ever had the pleasure to play with or against . "
Tony Greig
Inzamam -ul - Haq
" Inzamam was colossal in frame , ability , and attitude .
He could play strokes all around the wicket with brute strength or exquisite subtlety .
But what made Inzi great was his determination to stand firm as his illustrious colleagues collapsed around him .
He was the rock that broke the onslaught of Pakistan 's opponents .
A few last stands would have been remarkable .
To do it for over a decade was genius . "
Kamran Abbasi
Imran Khan
Imran combined thoughtfulness with a natural ability which had always been outstanding .
What brought about this transformation , as Imran readily admits , was his appointment to the captaincy of Pakistan .
This sense of responsibility turned a fine cavalier into a great cricketer .
Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack
Rashid Latif
" Few wicketkeepers in Pakistan have been as athletic and yet as unobtrusive as Latif .
A dive in front of first slip was often accomplished with the same ease of a regular , standing take ; and to spin , he was outstanding and swift .
His errors are difficult to remember .
His batting , combative and elegant , was vastly underrated . "
Osman Samiuddin
Wasim Akram
" If I ever get a chance to be reborn as a cricketer , I would want to be Wasim Akram . "
Allan Border
Fazal Mahmood
" Fazal Mahmood was a great human being , always willing to help anyone who sought his advice .
He was the doyen of Pakistan bowlers in the formative years and all our wins since we started playing Test cricket were indebted to him .
It was just because of his bowling feats that Pakistan achieved the rare honour of beating every country in our early series in the 1950s and 60s . "
Hanif Mohammad
Abdul Qadir
" In the pantheon of wrist - spinners he [ Qadir ] surely ranks near the very top .
Facing him or Warne at their best must have been as severe a test of a batsman 's nerve and capacity as any slow bowler has ever represented .
But unlike Warne , Qadir was always on the attack .
He knew no other way ...
When it comes to deception , as in the way in which he disguised his googly and various legbreaks , not to mention his flipper , he was a real little sorcerer . "
John Woodcock
Waqar Younis
Beyond doubt Waqar is an outstanding bowler , probably the finest to emerge from Pakistan since Fazal Mahmood .
This is a bowler of brilliance and élan , a bowler as entertaining in his way as any batsman , as enthralling as any spinner , a bowler who could become , as Imran predicted , the greatest of them all .

" We should n’t draw too many conclusions .
After all , Scarface just would n't have been the same if Al Pacino dropped his head into a pile of burgers on his desk and came up shooting . "

Favorite Programming Language Features
Posted 7 Jul 2004 at 19:05 UTC by johnnyb
I 'm curious what everyone 's favorite programming language features are .
I 'm looking for both the general and the specific .
I 'm especially looking for features that few people know about or use , but are really useful for those who do know about them .
A couple of examples to kick off the conversation : 1 ) Continuations Continuations are very interesting , because they can be used to implement a number of flow - control features such as exceptions , coroutines , cooperative multithreading , and are better at modelling web interactions .
This is a more general feature , but most people use these in conjunction with either scheme or ML .
2 ) Tuple - returning
It is a huuuuge time - saver that languages like Perl allow functions to return tuples .
( $ a , $b , $ c ) = $ sth -> fetchrow_array ( ) is a wonderful time - saver .
3 ) The flip - flop operator Another perlism that I just think is cool .
Read more about it here : http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/06/18/variables.html
Okay , on to yours .
What are your favorite programming language features ?
Metaprogramming , posted 7 Jul 2004 at 19:56 UTC by chalst » ( Master )
With things like continuations , higher - order functions , logic variables , etc .
I value the expressivity that comes with them , but there are times that the inevitable assocaited runtime and its sometimes difficult to predict overhead are unwanted .
What I find impossible to excuse is depriving the programmer of decent metaprogramming facilties .
The C++ template system is probably the most widely understood facility , although it is underpowered by contrast to LISP / scheme macros ( you can use them in a runtimeless language : Richard Kelsey 's prescheme ) .
The most underappreciated metaprogramming system , I think , is that of Prolog .
The nicest neglected avenue I know of to layering high - level features on a runtimeless language was ' C .
Alas , now abandoned and mostly unnoticed .
straightforward OO stuff , posted 7 Jul 2004 at 20:06 UTC by lkcl » ( Master )
my favourites ?
honestly ?
straightforward object - orientated inheritance .
i love to think about where the common ground is , where the critical flux points are , and then to partition things off in ways that make the implementation and use of each component a heck of a lot simpler , so OO inheritance is at the top of the list .
operator overloading ( although this is n't everyone 's favourite because they tend to mangle its use by not THINKING .
operator overloading should only be used in intuitive ways , e.g. for + , * etc on a vector class ! )
i especially like , in c , using tables of function pointers to define an API ( with the implementation being in a dynamically loaded library with only one published function , which returns a pointer to the table ) .
i definitely like python 's use of indentation to indicate blocks of code .
whilst that makes for minor inconvenience in having to think of ways to code around the lack of a repeat until construct and the lack of a do while , the " tidy " look enforced upon programmers by the indentation makes for much easier code reading : you _know_ what to expect .
definitely tuples .
c and c++ are _such_ a pain in the arse having to code up a pointer to parameters or a structure or use references , instead of being able to return multiple results .
the introduction of const was very fortunate but a little too late , there : at least in ADA they got it right by requiring that you specify IN , OUT or INOUT on the parameters .
by not being able to return tuples , and by not having IN or OUT on the function parameters , you get no assistance from the compiler in validation of what parameters were thingied .
you know what i mean :)
so , yes , ADA 's IN , OUT and INOUT parameter clarification - not that i've _used_ ADA but [ in ] and [ out ] are in DCE / RPC where it is utterly necessary to have in order to save network bandwidth .
python 's import system , and the fact that you can overload it (! ) to provide your own importing - e.g. from a database , on a per-server basis (! ) as i once implemented for a remote server management system (! ) uhm , i'm sure that there are more , but hey :)
named parameters , posted 7 Jul 2004 at 23:58 UTC by brondsem » ( Journeyer )
I 've only used smalltalk some , but it 's named parameters ( as opposed to ordered parameters ) were nice .
I think , however , that some functions are better suited to named and some better suited to ordered .
Mostly OO stuff , posted 8 Jul 2004 at 03:37 UTC by abg » ( Journeyer )
Good question , btw .
After spending a few years doing Python work , I really , truly miss simple structures like dictionaries and lists in other languages .
( VB , with it 's promise and subsequent botching of same , is particularly heinous in this regard )
If I have to write another set of linked lists , I swear I 'll start shooting machines .
in other languages .
( VB , with it 's promise and subsequent botching of same , is particularly heinous in this regard )
If I have to write another set of linked lists , I swear I 'll start shooting machines .
Garbage collection , for that matter
, for that matter Simple IO , type conversion ( especially for dates ) , and polymorphism are day to day things that a language should do well .
are day to day things that a language should do well .
Named parameters are good for maintainability , predictability , and readability , but a PITA to write code for .
And yet , I still love C , which does none of this .
I love the way that BCPL deals with the dangling ELSE porblem .
For the uninitiated , this is the problem of IF a THEN IF b THEN c ELSE d - does the ELSE d belong to the first IF or the second one ?
Many languages take the approach of IF a THEN b [ ELSE c ] FI ; i.e. has a terminator for the IF .
BCPL takes the approach that you have a choice of verb : either you can say IF a THEN b or you can say TEST a THEN b ELSE c. i.e.
IF may not have an ELSE ; TEST must have an ELSE .
That is all .
Data types , posted 8 Jul 2004 at 14:02 UTC by Platypus » ( Journeyer )
I 'll cast another vote for built - in data types like lists and dictionaries .
It seems like such a small thing , but it makes a huge difference in the tedium level of programming for a wide variety of tasks .
Besides being able to slice and dice them and initialize them inline ( unlike what you get with mere operator overloading ) they make it trivially possible to return multiple values from a function .
Second favorite would be exceptions .
Sure they can be ( and very often are ) abused , but limiting the code for an error to the place that detects it and the place that handles it , without every intervening level needing to propagate error codes ( meaning that you can't use the error code for something else , which is particularly annoying without the capability of returning a list ) can make code much more readable .
I do n't see designing a programming language as analogous to building a white - box computer : picking lots of components and sticking them together .
My favorite programming languages all express a coherent view of programming , and implement that reasonably cleanly .
That said , one of the features I 'd vote for is integration with other languages , particularly low - level ones like C .
The most important programming these days is n't building monolithic apps , but rather modules that exist in a larger ecosystem .
I 've been particularly happy with writing modules for CPython .
To a large extent , combining C and a dynamic programming language creates an aggregate language .
I think it makes sense to consider the quality of this language .
Are the semantics well defined ?
Can a debugger reasonably trace across langauge boundaries ?
Is the build process straightforward ?
In practice , the answers to these questions are often disappointing , but I do n't think it has to be that way .
Destructors , posted 8 Jul 2004 at 18:46 UTC by ncm » ( Master )
Only one language I know of makes it possible to encapsulate resource management .
( Many otherwise - powerful languages fake it as well as they can using " with - foo " macros , but that just does n't go very far .
They build into the runtime astonishingly complex apparatus just for managing memory , and leave all other resources to be managed manually , little better than must be done in C. )
Therefore , my vote goes to destructors .
" Object - oriented " features -- most particularly , virtual functions -- turn out to be of secondary importance , and I would like to see if they could n't just be moved into the library .
( Certainly they should n't be anybody 's default ! )
Explicit support for " thunking " , and tail recursion , delegation , and programmed conversions , along with powerful generics to tie it together , might suffice .
While we 're at it , we should list language features we hate .
I hate default automatic conversions and other invisible bug generators .
I hate features or semantics that work on built - in elements but cannot be made to work the same way for equivalent user elements .
I hate shovelware features that do n't earn their keep , or that make it easier to do what should n't be done at all , or that make it impossible to implement more valuable features , or that make implementations unavoidably slow .
I hate features that make it easier to solve trivial problems , but that make it even harder to solve hard problems .
I hate core language features that could just as well be implemented in the library , particularly when trying to do that exposes a language design failure .
I hate most those features that the language designer did n't understand , but put in broken so that code using them is even worse than code that does n't .
I hate ideology and haste .
auto type conversion , posted 8 Jul 2004 at 21:24 UTC by deekayen » ( Master )
I like the the idea behind the auto variable type conversion in PHP .
Safe by default , posted 8 Jul 2004 at 21:57 UTC by guerby » ( Master )
That means at least by default the language mandates array bound checking before access and allows for GC or reasonablu foolproof memory management .
C and C++ both fail this , and we get insecure software all over the place .
Hopefully most other languages pass the check , and they do gain a lot of mindshare : a few years ago at work everyone was talking C++ , now they 're talking Java , C# and scripting which is good news , C / C++ is totally legacy .
Another feature I see has a must - have is a free software implementation with commercial support available .
Having a real standard and a freely available validation suite also helps .
I believe Just In Time compilation and dynamic languages are the way to go .
I 'm more functional in my approach , that excludes your typical " OO " program with state changes all over the place .
At work I use Ada with paid Ada Core Technologies support and Python , no support yet do n't know if it exists since I started one month ago .

Formal definition
I find important formal syntax and semantics .
A language specification should not be written just for implementers but also users of a language .
You should know precisely what sentences are valid and their precise meaning .
Focusing on a consise readable specification may improve the language as well .
Simple syntax and semantics
I think 1 . implies that a language be simple to define as well as understand .
Classic games have this property " minutes to learn a lifetime to master " , programming should be fun and game - like .
Extensible
I like the idea of that a simple core can be extended to suit different tasks .
There is an unlimited number of " features " ( semantics ) one might want to implement , putting all of it ( or much of it ) in the core makes a language more difficult to learn , and potentially cumbersome to use .
Language Features , posted 9 Jul 2004 at 07:51 UTC by nymia » ( Master )
Not sure exactly what features belong to the language , the example seem to be saying features of the runtime as well .
I would imagine the article was asking about features that a language provide are the following :
Declarations - Pascal and COBOL reminded me of how storage should be explicitly stated at the earliest possible opportunity .
Code written this way tend to look cleaner and easier to read .
Expressions - C++ , C# and Java are definitely the winners for this one .
Personally , I prefer simple / basic expressions that do type coercions by default .
Sort of like Basic with a twist of Pascal .
Data Types -
I 'm a big fan of user - defined types , mostly found in object based environments , though .
I 'd prefer grouping related identifiers and then putting a big label on top of it .
Runtime Features
I like most :
A facility for externs .
Automatic conversion when marshaling types .
PInvoke , eat your heart out .
A fully - working - breathing - living DOM !
Runtime Features
I like most :
interactivity , posted 9 Jul 2004 at 14:23 UTC by mwh » ( Master )
Mainly because noone 's said it yet , I 'll drop in a word for interactivity and introspection .
Other than that , well , a lack of cruft , a sense of letting me get on with whatever it is I want to be doing .
I agree with ncm 's condemnation of automatic coercions and the like .
oh , and ... , posted 9 Jul 2004 at 14:24 UTC by mwh » ( Master )

Not exactly a " programming language feature " , but very , very important .
My Favourite Features , posted 10 Jul 2004 at 17:20 UTC by shlomif » ( Master )
Here 's a roundup of some of my favourite programming language features .
These are basically Perl features that I miss in C or in Python ; Haskell features that I miss elsewhere ; Matlab features that I miss elsewhere , and perhaps other random bits and pieces .
Garbage Collection ( or Managed Programming ) - Joel Spolsky believes that managed programming is the ultimate productivity booster and I believe he has a point .
The ability to allocate any amount of data and not to worry about cleaning it up is a huge improvement over C's malloc ( ) and free ( ) .
Garbage Collection proper ( i.e : one that can handle reference cycles well ) is also something very desirable , that does not yet exist in Perl and many other back - ends .
Nested data - structures .
In Perl I can initialize a complex data structure in one command , and also handle them very well .
In C , it is practically impossible .
Multiple return values ( like you said ) .
Here documents .
The < < " EOF " ... EOF ( where EOF is user - speicified ) is something I miss in Python , and exists in Perl .
I know that it makes the tokenizing harder , but it 's still a great feature which saves a lot of headaches .
Perl 's last LABEL and next LABEL .
Enables you to manage nested loops easily .
Java has absolutely no way of doing it , because it even lacks C's goto .
Lexical scoping and closures .
Defining functions inside functions , returning the inner functions which remember the enclosing scope 's state .
Groovy .
Regular expression operations with a convenient syntax .
Perl programmers tend to use regexps to do many things that do n't really require them , because of their convenient syntax .
That was one thing I was criticized for in FreeNode 's #python .
Some of Haskell 's paradigms like accumArray .
Bindings for the operating systems services , like files , sockets , etc. ( heavily missing in Scheme and Common Lisp ) .
foreach .
Unlimited ( capacity - wise ) strings , arrays , dictionaries , etc. Matlab 's bulk operations on tensors .
That 's just the things off the top of my head .
There may be more .
shlomif :
Here documents .
The < < " EOF " ... EOF ( where EOF is user - speicified ) is something I miss in Python , and exists in Perl .
Do you know Python 's triple - quote ?
Perl 's last LABEL and next LABEL .
Enables you to manage nested loops easily .
Java has absolutely no way of doing it , because it even lacks C's goto .
Hmm ?
Java has break LABEL and next LABEL , they work exactly like Perl 's last and next .
Old school view , posted 11 Jul 2004 at 19:44 UTC by ksb » ( Master )
I love C's mix of features .
The language can be described as 4 parts ( the C implementation langauge , the C pre-processor , the C library , and mechanical code generators ) .
C's operator set is only missing " min " and " max " ( maybe spelled ?< and ? >) .
And C's control structure is only really missing the ' else ' on loops ( like Python ) .
C's has some nits ( like x = a /* pb ; being half a comment ) , but these are mostly well - known and easy to find .
In fact some of the " weak spots " ( viz. varargs ) in C make it more useful .
Thank about this : the most often reused function ever coded is printf ; it is in every smart device built in the last 25 years .
Tools like rpcgen , flex , bison , give the C programmer a huge turbo ( as CPAN does for perl programmers ) .
That 's why every other programming language I see is writen ( itself ) in C .
The most important feature available in any language is that it not assume that it knows more about what I 'm doing than I do .
The only language ( that I 've done serious work in ) that has never hit me with " you ca n't do that here " is C .
Of course , this also assumes that I better actually know what I 'm doing .
I 'll leave it to others to offer opinions on that .
From a wider perspective , if I chose a language that embodied what I feel is the key element of a language , I 'd probably go with SQL ( yes , I know a lot of people think it stands for " Scarcely Qualifies as a Language " ) .
I see it as the closest attempt yet to express a pre-existing theory of information handling ( set theory in this case ) in a complete and consistent way for use with digital technology .
In my opinion , the existence of computers does n't negate the value of several centuries of logic and research on the hows and why 's of information management .
Other languages have borrowed heavily from the past , but it tends to be rather piece - meal .
SQL is the only language that explicitly builds on that tradition .
( In the interest of disclosure , I 'm actively involved with the Standards Council of Canada , and was part of the group that provided the National contributions for SQL:2000 , but I think my reasons for choosing SQL go beyond that )
Having said that , I think the best possible language is the one that 's most appropriate for the programmer 's need .
If it lets you do what you need to do and does n't inflict pain on you in the process , how bad can it be ?
Cheers .
Ternary operator , posted 14 Jul 2004 at 22:03 UTC by jds » ( Journeyer )
By far , my favorite feature in a language is the perlesque Ternary Operator .
I dunno where it originated , but I sure like it : Instead of : if ( condition ) then $x = 1 else $x = 2 endif
The ternary operator allows you to say $x = ( condition ) ?
1 : 2 . I like its conciseness .

First KSK Rollover Project ( 2015 -2018 )
Commencing in 2015 , a community design team was formed to develop recommendations on how to perform the first " KSK rollover " , replacing the Root Zone Key Signing Key as required by our DNSSEC Practice Statement .
These recommendations were operationalized , and the first KSK rollover resulted in the generation of a new KSK in October 2016 , and replacing the KSK in the root zone in October 2018 .
Reconstruction of a Mass Hysteria The Swine Flu Panic of 2009
Swine flu kept the world in suspense for almost a year .
A massive vaccination campaign was mounted to put a stop to the anticipated pandemic .
But , as it turned out , it was a relatively harmless strain of the flu virus .
How , and why , did the world overreact ?

Perhaps most surprising is that this same principle also explains how many high explosives work .
They are called " high " because their explosive reaction expands through a supersonic pressure wave that travels much faster than ordinary burning , making them far more powerful than low explosives like gunpowder .
Each successive bit of material in a high explosive ignites when the pressure wave compresses and heats trapped microscopic bubbles of gas .
When manufactured without bubbles , even extremely powerful high explosives can be impossible to detonate .
Without gas to compress , there is no way for the detonation wave to heat up neighboring areas .
The Java 7 Features Bound to Make Developers More Productive
If you 've tracked each major Java release , you probably were eager to see what new packages were in each one and how you could employ them in your Java projects .
Along the same lines , the next major Java SE release , Java 7 , promises several new features across all packages , such as modularization , multi-language support , developer productivity tools , and performance improvement .
I think programmers eventually will begin specializing in individual Java packages ( i.e. , java.util programmers , java .
io programmers , java.lang programmers , etc. ) , but until then , let 's explore a few of the notable new developer productivity features slated for Java 7 .
Find examples of all the features discussed here in the code download for this article .
New Objects Class
The new Objects class of the java.util package provides a fail - proof way for comparing two objects at runtime :
The equals ( ) method of the Objects class does a reference comparison .
The deepEquals ( ) method piggybacks on the first argument 's equals ( ) method definition .
Similarly , when both the arguments are object arrays , Array.deepEquals ( ) is invoked on the objects .
The new Objects class provides all the required static utility methods .
New Classes to Operate on File System
Java SE 7 provides classes that greatly simplify the age old integration processes of one application dropping files at a predefined shared location and other application picking them up .
Java 7 provides a new class WatchService that notifies any events that take place in the file system under the watch .
The following steps create an asynchronous file - watcher service :
Obtain the path from the File class .
Path fPath = new File( filePath ) .toPath ( ) ;
Obtain a handle to the Watch service from the file system .
dirWatcher = fPath.getFileSystem().newWatchService ( ) ;
Register which type of events you are interested in .
Related Articles Non-Blocking I/O Made Possible in Java
Keynote highlights from JavaOne 2005 fPath.register( dirWatcher , StandardWatchEventKind.ENTRY_CREATE , StandardWatchEventKind.ENTRY_DELETE , StandardWatchEventKind.ENTRY_MODIFY ) ;
Wait for the event to happen .
try{ WatchKey key = dirWatcher. take ( ) ; }catch ( InterruptedException ie ) { return ; }
The WatchKey class now has all the details of the event that occurred in the directory .
Loop through Step 4 to continue receiving events .
New Classes for Concurrency Package
The Java SE team added a wide variety of new classes to Java 7 to cater to various concurrency functionalities .
Most notable among them are the RecursiveAction and RecursiveTask classes , which simplify new algorithm development .
Understanding the difference between heavyweight and lightweight processes will help you grasp the value of these new classes .
A heavyweight process gets a replica of the code , stack , and data from the parent process .
You create a heavyweight process by invoking fork ( ) .
.
A lightweight process gets its own stack and shares resources and data with other threads or the parent thread .
The Unix Thread API standard ( POSIX ) provides methods to create a thread .
Java 7 defines a new abstract class called ForkJoinTask , a lightweight process that generates a distinct stream of control flow from within a process .
RecursiveAction and RecursiveTask are abstract subclasses of ForkJoinTask .
To code a recursive call , you must subclass either one of these classes and define the compute ( ) method .
The getRawResult ( ) method returns null for RecursiveAction and returns a value for RecursiveTask .
The Java 7 documentation provides a simple example for each of these classes .
Code Development Made Too Easy ?
For me , the joy of being a computer scientist is spending long hours writing code for various algorithms .
The problem solving keeps my mind alert , and the computations keep going in my head even in sleep .
All the utilities in Java 7 take much of that joy of programming away , but they contribute to the bottom line for the companies supporting Java projects , which is what really matters for Java .

LAYTON --
The Layton Police Department released probable cause statements Wednesday in the case of 4 - year - old Ethan Stacy 's death .
It was a custody fight in Virginia that led to a judge 's order that the boy spend the summer in Utah with his mother , who will be charged as an accomplice to the boy 's killing .
Gruesome police documents describe in graphic detail the beatings Ethan endured at the hand of his stepfather , Nathan Sloop , before he was ultimately murdered .
They also reveal the little boy 's mother , Stephanie Sloop , did nothing to stop the beatings , nor did she attempt to get help for her dying son .
We want to warn you , the details are extremely disturbing .
Documents describe horrific abuse
Sloop told police on May 5 , shortly after Ethan had arrived from his father 's home in Virginia to spend the summer with her , her then - fiancé , Nathan , beat the little boy several times in the head while disciplining him .
The abuse caused severe swelling , but she did nothing .
The next day , the couple locked Ethan in his bedroom alone while they went to the courthouse to get married .
Sloop admitted she feared the boy 's injuries would tip off police to the abuse , so they removed the doorknob to Ethan 's bedroom door so he could n't get out .
Over the next several days , Sloop could tell Ethan needed medical attention , but did not take him to a hospital for fear they would be arrested for abuse .
She told police Nathan burned Ethan in scalding water while she was gone and continued to physically abuse him .
She also said , at one point , Nathan forced Ethan to drink water when he was vomiting and lethargic .
On Sunday , May 9 , Stephanie says she returned from a trip to the store to find a calm Nathan , who told her Ethan was dead in his bed .
Neighbors and friends gather Wednesday at the Layton apartment complex where Ethan lived for a vigil in his memory .
Charges claim before burying the boy , the couple took measures to make his face unrecognizable .
Sloop initially said Nathan and another man then took Ethan to the mountains , where they desecrated his body and buried him .
She later admitted there was no other man and that she had helped conceal and bury her son 's body .
Investigators said they obtained photographs and video images of the boy 's progressively worse condition from the mother 's cell phone , starting more than a week ago .
Neighbors hold vigil in Ethan 's honor
Wednesday night , about 200 people gathered at the Layton apartment complex where Ethan spent his final torturous days to mourn his tragic death .
The crowd included friends and people from other cities that had no connection to the boy .
Apartment residents say they wish there was something they could have done to save him .
" He was a wonderful boy and he did n't deserve to die that way , " said Gary McPhie , who lives on the floor below the Sloops .
" I have a 5 - year - old little boy and it tears me apart , " Alicia Spiegel said .
Court battle leads to mother 's custody
The biological father of Ethan Stacy received a full briefing on the crime Wednesday , he told The Associated Press .
Stephanie Sloop
" I can't talk right now .
I just got the horrible news , talking to prosecutors , " said Joe G. Stacy of Tazewell , Va .
" Right now is not the time . "
Joe Stacy later told the Salt Lake Tribune he did n't want to send Ethan to live with Stephanie Sloop and her new husband for the summer because she was too unstable .
But Stephanie had visitation rights .
Joe Stacy says Ethan kept telling him he did n't want to go .
Stacy describes his son as the " best little boy . "
He says he 'll be haunted by no longer being able to play Spider - man with him on the PlayStation or go to the park , as they did every day .
Police have not revealed the motive for this murder , saying they wanted to reveal all the details to Joe Stacy before they release anything to the media .
The Deseret News quoted Joe Stacy 's stepmother saying he was forced by a judge to give up the boy to his mother for a summer visit .
Layton police provided a similar account , saying Ethan arrived in Utah May 1 " after divorce and custody issues were finalized . "
Joe Stacy 's stepmother , Freida Stacy , called Stephanie Sloop a " spiteful " woman intent on hurting her ex-husband .
The AP has not been able to reach family members of Stephanie Sloop .
" She was just an evil person .
There is evil in the world , and she is that , " Freida Stacy told the Salt Lake City newspaper .
She did not immediately return a message from the AP .
" I do n't think she cared anything for that little boy .
I think she did anything she could to irritate " Joe Stacy , his stepmother said .
The state medical examiner performed the autopsy Wednesday morning .
Once that information is collected , prosecutors will decide on what formal charges will be filed against Nathanael and Stephanie Sloop .
The Sloops are currently being held in the Davis County Jail on charges of felony child abuse , obstruction of justice and desecration of a corpse .
Nathanael is also being charged with aggravated homicide and damaging his holding cell at the Layton Police Department .
Ex -girlfriend , cousin not surprised by charges
Nathan Sloop
Wednesday , KSL
News talked to a woman claiming to be Nathanael 's ex-girlfriend , and another claiming to be his cousin .
Both say they 're not surprised this happened .
" I actually spoke to somebody in the family , and they had said that Nate will eventually kill somebody and he will be on the news one day , " said the cousin , who did not want to be identified .
Nathanael 's ex-girlfriend , who we 're only identifying as Shelley , said , " I 'm shocked that he could murder a child , but honestly I 'm not surprised . "
" He just had a fetish with throwing knives , holding knives , " Shelley continued .
" He would slice his hands from playing with knives . "
Nathanael 's cousin says he had some sort of multiple personality disorder .
She believes that it was his raging personality , called " New York , " who killed Ethan .
" It hurts .
It makes us sick to our stomachs , " the cousin said .
" For something like this to affect our family , and to hurt a little boy , it 's just unbelievable . "
Neighbors still in shock
Meanwhile , those who live in the apartment complex where Ethan lived watched as police were back again Wednesday searching for additional evidence .
Shana Godfrey shook her head in disgust as she and some other neighbors talked about what happened in the nearby apartment .
Law enforcement officers found Ethan 's body Tuesday afternoon in the Ogden Valley , near Wolf Canyon Trail .
" It hit home , " she said .
" My daughter 's 4 , and when that officer came to my door at 3 a.m. , my heart hit the ground . "
Godfrey says police searched everywhere in her apartment -- under the beds , in the washer and dryer -- and she 's glad they were so thorough .
Police believe Nathanael Sloop is responsible for Ethan 's death , and that Stephanie Sloop helped cover it up .
They say she went as far as to lie to police about Ethan 's disappearance , claiming he had a history of wandering away from their apartment in the middle of the night .
Police say the couple eventually confessed to where their son's body was buried Tuesday afternoon after hours of searching for the boy .
Officers would not say how Ethan died , but they did say he had been killed sometime in the last 10 days .
" They took them to the site of the , the burial site .
The crime scene , due to the weather -- Powder Mountain received a lot of snow -- the crime scene was just difficult to process , " Layton police Lt. Garrett Atkin said in a press conference Tuesday evening .
According to Davis County records , the couple has been married for only six days .
We 've been told they met in October of last year .
Once charges are filed against the couple on Friday morning , they will make their first appearance in court .
They are currently being held in the Davis County Jail .
Utah State Courts records show that between 2000 and 2003 , Nathanael Sloop had several convictions , including for criminal mischief , disorderly conduct and drug possession .
In 2003 , he served 30 days in jail for one drug possession charge and received a six - month suspended sentence for another .
No criminal history was found for Stephanie Sloop .

Yesterday , the online storage locker RapidShare announced that it triumphed in its appeal over copyright holders who demanded that the service take more steps to control online infringement .
Because RapidShare does not make uploaded files publicly available ( those who upload them can control access ) , the court found that it could not be held liable for distribution and that running filename filters on all uploads would produce too many false positives .
It 's a huge win for the site , which suffered a major setback in the case before a Düsseldorf court back in 2008 .
In that decision , the court found for rightsholders , and it looked as though RapidShare would have to start prescreening all uploads by file name , IP address , and other measures to preempt infringement .
RapidShare appealed from the Landesgericht ( Regional court ) Düsseldorf to the Oberlandesgericht ( Appeals court ) Düsseldorf , which overturned the lower court 's decision .
According to the new ruling , RapidShare cannot be held responsible for actions of third parties , since it forces people to choose how their content should be distributed rather than making it automatically available to the public .
In addition , the appeals court took aim at several filtering schemes .
Blocking all files of a certain type ( such as RAR files ) was deemed inappropriate , since a file type has no bearing on the legality of an upload .
Scanning by IP address was also tossed , because numerous people can use a single IP address .
File name filtering tells you nothing about the contents of a file , so that was tossed .
Even content scanning was problematic , as the court noted that this would just lead to encrypted files .
Besides , even if you could know that a file was copyrighted , it could still be a legal " private backup " not distributed to anyone else .
Given all these problems , the appeals court reversed the earlier judgment .
Christian Schmid , who started RapidShare , said , " We are very happy about the judgment .
The court has confirmed that RapidShare is not responsible for the contents of files uploaded by its users .
The judgment shows that attempts to denounce our business model as illegal will not be successful in the long run .
With its 1 - click file - hosting model , RapidShare responds to legitimate interests of its users and will continue to do so in the future . "
Causes
Fundamental Cause
The root causes of biodiversity loss are population growth and increasing natural resource consumption .
The world 's population has more than tripled in the 20th Century and projections show that continued growth is expected over the next 50 years .
At the present pace , the Earth 's renewable resources are rapidly being depleted .
According to the Ecological Footprint and many other studies , human consumption of renewable resources has surpassed the Earth 's ability to regenerate them .
The expected doubling of the world 's population over the next 50 years will exacerbate these pressures .
The pressure on the environment from growing populations is exacerbated by the patterns and levels of Humanity 's renewable resource consumption .
The combination of a growing population coupled with unsustainable resource use patterns is the dire problem facing humanity .
The average resident of an industrialized nation uses 15 times as much paper , 10 times as much steel , and 12 times as much fuel as a person in a developing country ( Alan Durning , State of the World 1991 , World Watch Institute ) .
Population growth and increasing resource consumption affect biodiversity in two ways :
They create pressure to convert wildlife habitat into agricultural and urban land ; and
They produce wastes that pollute habitat and poison wildlife .
However , these trends can be off - set by stabilizing population growth , using the Earth 's natural resources more efficiently , and recycling and controlling pollution .
Understanding Species and Ecosystems
Knowledge about the world 's life forms is well behind other fields of scientific inquiry .
Although a great deal is known about individual species of birds , fishes , mammals , and plant , fewer than 1.4 million of the world 's 5 - 30 million species have been named , let alone studied .
Information is also limited on the condition and value of biological resources , as well as uses and management techniques employed by traditional cultures over centuries .
Traditional knowledge , which has sustained many indigenous peoples for centuries , is rapidly disappearing .
Compounding the problem is the lack of trained scientists in many developing countries where biodiversity loss is most prominent .
National Policies
Government policies designed to encourage some sectors , such as agriculture and forestry , also encourages the destruction of biodiversity .
This is especially true if these policies do not incorporate sustainable development components as part of the development requirement .
Lack of coordination between government agencies with overlapping responsibilities may also result in loss of biodiversity .
For example , an environmental agency mandated to halt or minimize deforestation will be in conflict with another agency that is trying to boost economic growth in the agricultural sector .
Agencies such as the ones highlighted in the example need to communicate to ensure that governmental programs coordinate to protect the environment while facilitating economic growth .
This is especially true in developing countries where human , technical , and financial capacity is limited .
Effects of Globalization
The world economies reliance on trade has greatly influenced nations to build their economic sectors base on comparative advantage and specialization .
For example , in many developing countries , which rely heavily on agricultural commodities for export earnings , have turned to large - scale plantations focusing on a small range of crops that are in demand on the world market .
However , as the variety of crop species declines , so too does the complex system of supporting species that would have evolved with traditional agricultural systems .
The growth of such farming systems has often been at the expense of species - rich forests , wetlands , and diverse small - scale agricultural lands .
Resource Distribution
People who depend on the natural resources provided by their surroundings have a strong interest in maintaining the productivity of those resources .
However , more often than not , local communities see little benefit of those resources but are left with paying the cost for their unsustainable use .
The inequities in who manages resources versus who receives their benefits can be found between rich and poor , men and women , and among societal groups .
Globally , there are inequities between rich and poor countries .
The rich countries have the technology and financial capability to develop and exploit natural resources in the poorer countries where the resources typically exist .
For example , a successful drug for childhood leukemia has been developed from the rosy periwinkle of Madagascar , but none of the $ 100 million annual estimated revenue has flowed back to its country of origin ( M.D. Jenkins , ed. , Madagascar : An Environmental Profile , World Conservation Monitoring Center ) .
The Value of Biodiversity
The value of goods and services derived from biodiversity are typically not taken into consideration or undervalued , thereby promoting ( directly or indirectly ) their depletion .
The value of biodiversity are almost totally ignored in national economic accounts because it is so difficult to value .
However , when markets undervalue biodiversity , policies may encourage unsustainable or destructive activities .
( See How Much Are Nature 's Services Worth ? and Ecosystems Services : Free , But Valuable . )
Root Causes
The causes of biodiversity loss described above do not operate in isolation , but rather tend to act with and exacerbate one another .
In order to preserve and manage biodiversity :
we must gain greater understanding our natural environment ;
traditional knowledge must be preserved ;
governmental policies should facilitate responsible and sustainable resource use ;
economic incentives should not contradict environmental priorities ; and
local communities must be involved in , and see the benefits of , the use of their natural resources .
In order to be effective in addressing the sustainable management of resources , biodiversity issues must be incorporated throughout national planning processes .
A wholistic approach to sustainable use of natural resources must be taken to ensure that , from inception to completion , biodiversity issues are incorporated into all facets of development .
There ’s been a lot of speculation recently that Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) will be introducing legislation that would legalize and regulate online poker in the United States , separate from the current bills that exist in the House of Representatives .
The rumors have been circulating for a while that Reid , who represents Nevada ( Las Vegas ) casinos ’ interests in the Senate , may be moving in this direction .
But the chatter has been picking up in recent days .
A story at proactiveinvestors .co.uk had this to say , after interviewing London - based stockbroker Daniel Stewart :
“ The stockbroker noted speculation that US Senator Harry Reid and his pro-legislation cohorts are preparing a Bill that could be introduced into the Senate within the next three months and ready for approval by the President during H2 2010 .
Daniel Stewart believes that the proposed Federal legislation will encompass just online poker and exclude casino and sports betting services , which should ensure that it is easier to implement . ”
In the wake of that bit of news / speculation , a couple of respected online poker blogs have been trying to put together the pieces to figure out why this makes sense .
For most of the existence of online poker and gambling , the U.S. - based casino industry has opposed online gaming and resisted its legalization and acceptance .
But Frank Fahrenkopf , president of the American Gaming Association , gave an interview in March in which the AGA changed its stance .
Here ’s what he said at the time : “ We are open to the concept of legalized internet gambling , so long as there is a regulatory regime that is put in place that protects the consumer and protects the integrity of the game .
We ’re at this point in time open to the question of whether it ’s a federal or state regulatory regime , although I must tell you I think a majority of the board would favor the states .
But until we have something that we ’re really going to look at , we ca n’t get to that question . ”
So why the change of heart ?
A Reid - sponsored bill , which would only deal with online poker and no other forms coming up would make sense , as it would could be a boon to the brick and mortar casinos in the U.S.
Here ’s a take from Pokerati.com , which independently , and unofficially confirmed that Reid legislation could be on the way :
Considering that [ the AGA is ] the representative voice for B/M casinos , you can see a plausible plan taking shape : 1 . Let the UIGEA go into full effect June 1 .
2. Eliminate the most powerful online poker operators currently in the industry ( i.e. Tilt and Stars ) .
3 . Pass a new law .
4. Let Harrah ’s , the Sands , and MGM / Mirage set up shop .
5 . Then let the European poker sites join the party .
Certainly that ’s just speculation at this point , but it makes sense .
Then , industry insider Bill Rini had this to say in the wake of pokerati’s post on the matter :
As [ Pokerati ] points out , letting the UIGEA go into effect and give the Feds a reason to go after companies like Stars and Tilt clears the playing field for brick and mortar casinos to set up and get a head start while these companies fight multi- year lawsuits trying to get back in the US market .
Even “ clean ” operators who never offered gaming in the US will probably need to establish a US based presence and have all sorts of hurdles to clear before they can offer gaming in the US .
This slows everyone down .
Currently there are several bills in the House of Representatives that would affect online poker , but these would not have the same aim of creating a more favorable market for U.S. casinos :
— The Reasonable Prudence in Regulation Act ( H.R 2266 ) , which would delay implementation of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement
Act for one year .
— Internet Gambling Regulation , Consumer Protection and Enforcement Act of 2009 ( H.R. 2267 ) , which would legalize and regulate online poker and gambling
— The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act ( HR 4976 ) , which would tax online poker and gambling , a companion bill to H.R. 2267 .
This is all still speculation and unconfirmed rumor at this point .
No Senate bill exists right now , and what exactly it would encompass if it did exist is purely conjecture .
But it seems like that this new front on the battle over online poker in the United States may get opened up soon .
UPDATE : WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
After insisting for a year that failure was not an option , President Barack Obama is now acknowledging his health care overhaul may die in Congress .
His remarks at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser Thursday night sounded contradictory at times , complicating congressional leaders ’ effort to revive health care legislation as Democrats hunger for guidance from the White House .
Even while saying he still wanted to get the job done , Obama counseled going slow , and bowed to new political realities .
Democrats no longer command a filibuster - proof Senate majority , and voters and lawmakers are far more concerned with jobs and the economy than with enacting sweeping and expensive changes to the health system .

“ I think it ’s very important for us to have a methodical , open process over the next several weeks , and then let ’s go ahead and make a decision , ” Obama said Thursday night .
“ And it may be that … if Congress decides we ’re not going to do it , even after all the facts are laid out , all the options are clear , then the American people can make a judgment as to whether this Congress has done the right thing for them or not , ” the president said .
“ And that ’s how democracy works .
There will be elections coming up and they ’ll be able to make a determination and register their concerns one way or the other during election time . ”
It seemed to be a shift in tone for the issue Obama campaigned on and made the centerpiece of his domestic agenda last year .
“ Here ’s the key , is to not let the moment slip away , ” Obama also said .
Raw ’s original story follows .

Echoing Republican rhetoric leading up to the Senate ’s passage of a health care overhaul last year , President Barack Obama told a Democratic fundraiser Thursday night “ we should take our time ” in approving a healthcare bill .
“ [ I ]t may be that — you know , if Congress decides — if Congress decides we ’re not going to do it , even after all the facts are laid out , all the options are clear , then the American people can make a judgment as to whether this Congress has done the right thing for them or not , ” Obama said .
The comments drew immediate concern from liberal bloggers , including Talking Points Memo and Crooks and Liars .

“ It ’s hard to know what to make of this , ” TPM ’s Brian Beutler wrote .
“ On the one hand : Obama says he sees a way forward , and lays it out pretty clearly .
“ But on the other hand … he ’s pretty clearly suggesting Congress might just completely drop the ball .
That could be a warning shot at Congress , or it could be an attempt to put some distance between his presidency and the potential failure of his signature initiative .
Either way , it ’s probably left some people on the Hill feeling disgruntled . ”
“ What the hell is wrong with Obama ? ” wrote liberal blogger Susie Madrak .
“ Why does he always choose accommodation over moral action ?
And his lack of leadership is getting downright scary .
Congress is fumbling through a game of charades , trying to figure out the clues , while it becomes increasingly clear :
There ’s no game plan . ”

Obama told donors that creating jobs was his first priority .
“ As I said at the State of the Union , I think we should be very deliberate , take our time , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to be moving a jobs package forward over the next several weeks ; that ’s the thing that ’s most urgent right now in the minds of Americans all across the country . ”
Obama said letting time pass will allow “ everybody to get the real facts . ”

“ What I ’d like to do is have a meeting whereby I ’m sitting with the Republicans , sitting with the Democrats , sitting with health care experts , and let ’s just go through these bills — their ideas , our ideas — let ’s walk through them in a methodical way so that the American people can see and compare what makes the most sense , ” he said .
Democrats put a massive healthcare reform package on hold after losing a key Senate seat in Massachusetts .
In November , the Senate ’s top ranking Republican defended delaying passage of the healthcare bill , saying that delaying the process would help legislators better understand what they were voting on .
“ I think we ought to at least have as much time for the other 99 senators and all of the American people to take a look at this bill as Majority Leader Reid has had , ” Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) said .
“ The only way to guarantee that for sure would be to delay the process to allow everyone to fully understand what ’s in the bill . ”

Today I 'm going to dive into the deep end and take a look at the State monad , with an implementation in Clojure .
This will be done using Konrad Hinsen 's clojure.contrib.monads
API , but I will be providing my own specific monad implementations for continuity .
You should use the API versions of any of these monads in the real world however .
Monad tutorials
If you are unfamiliar with monads I would suggest you look else where .
The api documentation provides links to a set of tutorials that are a good resource for Clojure programmers .
You might also find my post Functions of functions useful .
The first question to ask is “ why use a State monad in Clojure ; there is already great support for state management in the language ” .
My answer is “ because the State Monad is the foundation of more interesting monads . ”
In particular we will be looking at Backtracking State and Nondeterministic State monads .
You might use Backtracking to build a parser combinator library .
The Nondeterministic state allows you to find all the solutions that fit some problem .
A simple example might be an implementation of the Quadratic Formula .
Parser Combinators Parser Combinators are a way of describing a recursive decent parser using combinations of functions .
These parsers can trivially have infinite lookahead , and the full expressive power of the host language .
The canonical example of this idea is Parsec in Haskell , but the concept has been ported to many languages .
In languages other than Haskell , they are often implemented using tricks other than monads , but Parsec is still the most elegant example .
We 'll look at these monads in turn , and then wrap up with a quick high level look at the role Monad Transformers could play , and the relationships between these variations on State and some other monads you may have already encountered : Identity , Maybe and Set .
State
First thing to consider about the state monad is what it is .
Ignore the more academic answers to that question , the state monad is a way of building a state machine .
It does not hold some state in it , instead it is a series of functions which a state is threaded through .
Haskell has a curious looking type for State
newtype State s a = State { runState :: ( s -> ( a , s ) ) }
State is a wrapper type that contains a single value .
This value is a function from type s to a pair of type a and type s .
The curious thing about this definition is it uses the record syntax in Haskell to call the value runState .
It does this so that you can unpack the state and apply it to the initial state in one step .
Eg :
( runState myStateMachine ) initialState -- parens are for clarity
In Clojure land , we are going to not concern ourselves with a concrete wrapping type .
Instead our monad will just return a function .
The last thing to think about is what s and a represent .
s is the state , and a is the value that that function returns .
In our clojure code this will look like a function of one argument ( the initial state ) that returns a vector of two items : the value and the new state .
Before we go any further , lets have a quick look at the code for this state -m monad .
I 've called it state - m1 to avoid clashing with the state -m in the monad library .
( use ' clojure.contrib.monads ) ( defmonad state - m1 [ m - result ( fn [ value ] ( fn [ state ] [ value state ] ) ) m-bind ( fn [ computation func ] ( fn [ state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( computation state ) ] ( ( func value ) new - state ) ) ) ) ] )
While all the interesting behavior happens inside m-bind , m-result is indicative of the nature of the monad .
Haskell calls this function return which sufficiently confuses many people , and I like to call it introduce because it introduces a new value into the computation .
As is mentioned above , the State is a function from initial state to a value and new state , and as you can see m-result takes a value and returns a function .
In this function , the value is constant , and the state is whatever state that gets passed through it .
m - bind provides the guts of the monad .
And , because it does a whole lot of function wrangling , it can be a little difficult to wrap your brain around at first .
Because this is key to understanding the rest of the monad , and the derivative monads , we will examine this one slowly .
First thing to notice is that like m-result , m- bind returns a new function that takes a state and returns a value - state pair .
Second thing is the names of the arguments to m-bind .
I have called them computation and func .
computation is the existing state - machine and func is the function to use as the next step in the state - machine .
In the same way that a linked list is a head and tail , and cons stitches them together , m- bind stitches together func and computation , the big difference is the facing .
computation is the many unit , and func is the singular unit3 .
Lets look at a very simple ( and contrived ) example .
We 'll look at how you set would write some code to use it , and then have a look at what that transforms into .
This is going to introduce a value into the computation , increment it , and return that new value , all the while ignoring the state that the caller has specified .
( def my - state - machine ( domonad state - m1 [ my - val ( m - result 1 ) my - val2 ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ] my - val2 ) ) ( my - state - machine " state " ) ;; -> [ 2 " state " ]
If this looks like a strange way to write a let form to you , you would be right .
We currently have no easy way to deal with the state in our state machine , we can only thread the value through .
Before we do that though , lets unwind that expression .
First up is ( m- result 1 ) .
This creates a function as we can see from the definition of state - m1 .
Specifically it produces
( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] )
This becomes our computation for the first bind4 :
( m- bind ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) )
Lets do a straight forward reduction here to see what we get .
I 've copied the body of m-bind from above , and where it says computation I 'm replacing it with ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) and whenever it says func I 'm replacing it with ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) :
( fn [ state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) state ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) value ) new - state ) ) )
Lastly we have a bind to get my - val2 out of the big computation .
This is once again a fairly straight forward reduction , only with a larger computation .
( fn [ state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) state ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) value ) new - state ) ) ) state ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) ) )
So thats the basic transformation from the domonad notation .
You can see how the various expressions have been stitched into the state - machine .
Next we 'll do another set of reductions so you can see how the state is threaded through the stages of the machine .
As above the string " state " be passed through .
Reducing the state - machine
Note :
If you are comfortable with how this reduces down , skip on to the next section
First the argument to the machine is replaced ( see the end of the second last line ) :
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) state ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) value ) new - state ) ) ) " state " ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
Next that function in can be reduced down .
This time the string " state " has moved to the end of the first line .
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] [ 1 state ] ) " state " ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) value ) new - state ) ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
And again .
Note that the function producing the pair has been replaced with the specific pair .
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( let [ [ value new - state ] [ 1 " state " ] ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) value ) new - state ) ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
At this point we can remove the top let , destructuring the pair we just created into value and new - state :
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val ] ( m- result ( inc my - val ) ) ) 1 ) " state " ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
Now we can reduce down function .
Recall that this function was introduced by the first m-bind .
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( ( m- result ( inc 1 ) ) ) " state " ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
This time we can increment 1 and replace the m-result with the result of that function .
( let [ [ value new - state ] ( ( fn [ state ] [ 2 state ] ) " state " ) ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) )
The reduction should be starting to look familiar .
" state " will be used to reduce the result of that m-result .
( let [ [ value new - state ] [ 2 " state " ] ] ( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) value ) new - state ) ) )
Once more destructuring out the let form
( ( ( fn [ my - val2 ] ( m- result my - val2 ) ) 2 ) " state " )
Reduce the inter function
( ( m - result 2 ) " state " )
Expand out m-result
( ( fn [ state ] [ 2 state ] ) " state " )
And finally reduce that down .
[ 2 " state " ]
That looks like a lot of work , but it is actually straight forward .
Still , its not very useful if it just provides a complicated version of the let form .
Manipulating the state
The most obvious state managing functions will be two primitives get - state which returns the current value of the state , and put - state which updates the current state5 .
To get handle on whats going on at this stage , I like think of the value as something like a register in the state - machine , and state as the sole memory location .
( defn get - state [ ] ( fn [ state ] [ state state ] ) ) ( defn put - state [ new - state ] ( fn [ _ ] [ nil new - state ] ) )
These functions follow the familiar form indicated by m-result .
The return a function that takes an initial state and returns a pair of value and current state .
get - state returns a function that takes the state value and places it in the value ' register ' , and leaves it in the state as well .
In contrast , put - state takes a new state as its argument and the returns a function that ignores the current state , obliterates the value ' register ' and updates the state .
So how would you go about using these two functions ?
Here is another contrived example that increments the current state , and returns the original value :
( ( domonad state - m1 [ v ( get - state ) _ ( put- state ( inc v ) ) ] v ) 1 ) ; ; -> [ 1 2 ]
I 'll leave reductions of this to the more eager reader .
Wrapping up
So that 's the basic State monad .
It 's likely you wo n't use this very often ( ever ? ) in Clojure , but understanding it is very useful .
In the second ( and final ) part we 'll take a look at a couple of variations on this concept , including looking at some small example programs that make use of them .
The game has five difficulty settings and a head - to - head mode where players can compete against each other to complete an obstacle course in the quickest time .
Target says it 's launched recycling stations this week at all 1,740 U.S. stores , and Whole Foods Market announced drop boxes for recycling wine corks at its 292 stores .
At the front of each store , Target 's recycling bins accept aluminum , glass and plastic beverage containers as well as plastic bags , MP3 players , cell phones and ink cartridges .
" We know that eco -friendly living is top - of - mind for our guests , " Shawn Gensch , Target 's vice president of brand marketing said in the announcement .
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day ( April 22 ) , Minneapolis - based Target says it 's also launching an online eco-boutique with eco-friendly products and on Sunday , April 18 , it will give buyers 1.5 million free reusable shopping bags .
It offers gift cards for old laptops and phones and a nickel discount for each reusable bag used .
Whole Foods Market says the new drop boxes at its stores in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom will make it easier for wine enthusiasts to dispose properly of corks .
" We often forget that cork is a renewable , recyclable material that does not belong in landfills , " Erez Klein , wine and beer buyer for Whole Foods Market 's Pacific Northwest Region , said in the press release .
The Austin - based company is partnering with Cork ReHarvest to collect and recycle the corks , which will be transported to recycling centers on trucks already en route to each destination .
West of the Rockies , Whole Foods Market says the corks will be delivered to Western Pulp , where they 'll be turned into recyclable wine shippers .
In the Midwest , the corks will go to Yemm & Hart to produce cork floor tiles and on the East Coast and in the United Kingdom , they 'll be sent to Jelinek Cork Group , which makes various cork products .
What he was trying to do when he began the site in May 2008 , he says , was start a conversation .
Since March 2009 , Mill has worked for the Sunlight Foundation , a Washington - based nonprofit group that tries to make government workings more transparent .
His site turns that notion on himself .
“ The taboo around talking about money is ill - founded , ” he says .
“ When you ’re the only person dealing with it , you ’re subject to all of the dysfunctions we all have .
If we could all be a little less uptight and more communicative and social about it , we ’d be getting better advice , and it would n’t be the sort of thing that we stress about privately . ”
So Mill ’s money is laid bare for the world to see .
In the fall of 2008 , he became a freelance Web developer .
The timing could not have been worse .
“ I had $ 3,000 and no firm gigs , ” he says , adding that at one point a potential client , after telling him that he had seen Mill ’s negative net worth online , tried to lowball him on a job , letting him know that he assumed that Mill probably needed the money .
“ During that time , my emotional well - being was completely tied to the number in my savings account . ”
It was n’t a happy time , but during this period , Mill figured out how to feel comfortable handling his money .
Mill now saves a quarter to half of his take - home pay in a savings account in an online bank , but he is not making as many extra payments as he could on the $ 20,000 or so in student loans he is carrying , nor does he have any money set aside for retirement .
“ I put a much higher value on flexibility , ” he says .
“ And I feel like the better investment right now is in me .
It ’s much more important that I have as much freedom and liquidity as I can . ”
Net worth is not precisely calibrated with financial freedom .
If Mill used all of his savings to pay down some debt , his net - worth figure would remain the same , but he would have no emergency fund if he lost his job .
For this reason , he has come to think of the figure as a number that does n’t really tell his whole story .
Some financial advisers agree .
“ To me , it ’s an irrelevant number , ” says Spencer Sherman , author of “ The Cure for Money Madness ” and a founder and the chief executive of Abacus Wealth Partners .
“ If people have a billion in net worth and are spending half a billion in a year , they ’re really poor . ”
After all , they ’re on pace to be broke in 24 months .
( Sherman ’s preferred measure of financial health for retirees is a ratio that compares net worth , excluding home equity , with the amount of money people take from their portfolios each year .
He generally does n’t want clients spending more than 4 to 6 percent of their holdings annually . )
Mill acknowledges that his philosophy of financial openness has its limits .
“ This would be hard for me to do if I was totally affluent , ” Mill told me .
He balked at revealing his salary for this article , even though some of his friends already know what it is .
“ I do n’t want to cause any tension with my co-workers , ” he says , allowing only that the figure was at the upper end of the midfive figures .
I talked to one NetworthIQ user , a South Florida woman , who has about $ 856,000 in net worth .
She blogs about her financial life at adventures - of - sam.blogspot.com , but says she would never reveal her name on the site .
She worries that doing so would inject tension into her offline life .
Her friends might think she was bragging about her frugal habits or implicitly criticizing their spending .
Indeed , talking about wealth or good fortune can seem coarse or boastful , and maybe some people do n’t want poor relatives to know to what extent they could be helping — and are n’t .
El barrio de Tepito es el arsenal donde los cárteles dedicados al tráfico de drogas se abastecen de armamento , que llega al país en remesas mensuales o quincenales por distintos puntos y se distribuye a diferentes destinos .
Desde revólveres calibre .380 hasta metralletas antiaéreas y lanzagranadas pasando por rifles R - 15 y AK - 47 , se venden a particulares y a los grupos del crimen organizado , a precios que fluctúan entre los 4 o 5 mil pesos hasta los 20 mil por pieza , de acuerdo con el testimonio de un vendedor que surte de armas a una de estas organizaciones .
“ Cada 15 días o cada mes me llegan pedidos fuertes : desde 20 hasta 60 armas .
Mi gente se encarga de llevarlas a donde nos las piden ” , reveló en entrevista con EL UNIVERSAL el vendedor , quien asegura tener ocho años dedicado a este negocio , con su base de operaciones en el barrio de Tepito .
Ahí llegan los cargamentos de armas y de ahí salen para su entrega en las zonas donde son requeridos .
Él mismo sale a distintos puntos del país a recibir y entregar pedidos .
“ Cliente consentido ” Admite que no es el único , pues la venta de armas en Tepito está organizada en función de los compradores .
La regla que todos respetan es que cada vendedor o grupo de vendedores trabaja para un solo cártel y no puede vender armas a los demás ; “ está prohibido ”
El entrevistado asegura trabajar de manera exclusiva para uno de los cárteles de la droga del país , cuya demanda atiende en primer lugar , aunque también recibe pedidos de particulares , “ gente cercana y de confianza ” , que acuden a comprarle una o dos armas .
Su versión contradice el informe “ Tráfico de armas México - USA ” , difundido por la Procuraduría General de la República ( PGR ) en abril de 2009 , según el cual , el ingreso de armas a México se realiza mediante “ operación hormiga ” , y no hay grupos del crimen organizado dedicados de manera exclusiva a la actividad .
Según el documento , de las investigaciones realizadas en México , así como del intercambio de información a través de la asistencia jurídica con las autoridades de justicia de Estados Unidos “ la modalidad preferida de los traficantes de armas es comprarlas a ciudadanos americanos o residentes legales a cambio de una cantidad de dinero ” .
“ Así , los traficantes median entre el interesado y el vendedor autorizado de armas , para introducirlas a nuestro país , tanto por los 19 cruces de paso formales existen como por los incontables cruces informales a lo largo de los 3 mil 152 kilómetros de frontera común ” , según detalla el informe .
El vendedor asegura que , al menos su grupo , recibe remesas importantes de armas una o dos veces al mes , según las necesidades del cártel al que abastece .
Los pedidos “ fuertes ” “ Cada 15 días más o menos , cada mes , me llegan pedidos fuertes , y no falta quién me contacte , que sea de confianza y se lleva una o dos armas , pero eso nada más lo hacemos con gente cercana , especial y ya los volúmenes grandes los manejamos con un cártel ” .
La procedencia de las armas es variada , explica .
Llegan de Estados Unidos , España , Colombia , Paquistán , entre otros países , pero también de México ; por ejemplo , de personal de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional ( Sedena ) parte del armamento que se decomisa en operativos , o el que roba del propio arsenal de la dependencia federal .
“ ( Las armas vienen ) de varias gentes .
Lo que pasa es que tenemos hay gente que trabaja para nosotros de la ( Secretaría de la ) Defensa Nacional y ya sea que nos las trae de otros países , también , de Estados Unidos , de Colombia , de ahí principalmente ” , detalla .
— Pero esas armas ¿están registradas ?
— Así es , pero al cártel no le importa eso .
Según el informe difundido por la Procuraduría General de la República , las armas se pasan de Estados Unidos “ ocultas en vehículos terrestres , en las llantas de refacción , en el respaldo de asientos , en oquedades fabricadas en las carrocerías , etcétera ” .
Y agrega que “ la introducción se verifica a modo de operación hormiga ” y no en grandes cantidades a la vez .
Hasta el momento , no se ha detectado en México que alguna organización delictiva extranjera o nacional , se dedique exclusivamente al tráfico de armas ” .
“ De las investigaciones en poder de la PGR , sólo se desprenden personas que en lo individual realizan esa actividad ” .
Una red de corrupción
De la entrevista con el vendedor de armamento del barrio de Tepito , en cambio , se desprende que existen varios grupos organizados para la compra , recepción y entrega del armamento , nuevo y usado , que “ a veces entra por barco , otras por el aeropuerto ( de la ciudad de México ) ” en cargamentos importantes , protegidos por toda una red de corrupción .
“ Aquí se tiene comprada a mucha gente .
Desde gobernadores , policías federales , comandantes , mucha gente de ese tipo está metida en este medio ” , afirma el entrevistado .
Agrega que su gente , un grupo de entre 10 y 15 personas , “ se encarga de llevar las cosas a donde las pidan , dependiendo del cártel , más que nada se mueven para los cárteles ” .
Su grupo , detalla , no maneja calibres pequeños , sino a partir de .380 mm , con un costo de entre 4 mil y 5 mil pesos , que se incrementa cuando el comprador pide el arma con “ accesorios ” especiales , como piezas cromadas o bañadas en oro , y entonces el precio se eleva entre 10 mil y 12 mil pesos cada artefacto .
En su inventario se pueden encontrar armas cortas ( calibres 45 , .380 y 9 mm. ) a un precio promedio de 5 mil pesos , pero también rifles AK - 47 R15 y granadas de fragmentación con un costo de 19 mil a 20 mil pesos por pieza .
Sin embargo , aclara el entrevistado , casi nunca tiene disponibles más de 10 o 15 armas , por la misma dinámica de la demanda del cártel al que surte y los compradores particulares , por lo que los pedidos fuertes se toman y se surten a la semana o , al menos , varios días después de realizado el pedido .
Sobre el grupo para el que trabaja prefiere no dar detalles .
Sólo relata que se inició en el negocio durante su estancia en la cárcel , donde conoció a “ gente bastante fuerte . ”
“ Empezaron a contactarme desde para robos , robos a camionetas blindadas .
De ahí fui subiendo de categoría , después fueron secuestros , después homicidio , me contrataban a mí y a mi gente .
Cuando llegas a un sicario ya estás arriba , después hicieron una cita con unos comandantes del cártel ( de drogas ) y ahí empecé a trabajar para ellos ” .
Pirelli has expressed an interest in F1 © Sutton Images Enlarge Related Links News :
Tyre company Avon confirms F1 interest
News :
Michelin return dependant on tyre war
Pirelli is set to put forward a bid to return to Formula One as a tyre supplier next year .
Last week Pirelli said it would look into F1 if certain conditions were met over future tyre regulations , including a move from 13 inch rims to 18 inch .
Michelin and Cooper Avon have already approached the teams and the FIA with proposals for tyre supply in 2011 and now Pirelli will present its proposal at the next grand prix .
" Pirelli communicates its decision to present a technical and commercial offer for supply of tyres to all the teams in the Formula One world championship , " said a statement from the manufacturer .
" The company plans to present the bid to FIA ( Federation Internationale de l'Automobile ) and FOA ( Formula One Administration Limited ) by 9 May , the date of the next Formula One Gran Prix to be held in Spain . "
Pirelli was last in F1 between 1989 and 1991
When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective , the need for both acceptance , understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent .
The following is also something to ponder ...
If you woke up this morning with more health than illness ... you are more blessed than the million who will not survive this week .
If you have never experienced the danger of battle , the loneliness of imprisonment , the agony of torture , or the pangs of starvation ... you are ahead of 500 million people in the world .
If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment , arrest , torture , or wrath ... you are more blessed than three billion people in the world , about 60 % of the world population .
If you have food in the refrigerator , clothes on your back , a roof overhead and a place to sleep ... you are richer than 75 % of this world .
If you have money in the bank , in your wallet , and spare change in a dish someplace ... you are among the top 8 % of the world 's wealthy .
If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very rare , even in the United States and Canada .
If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly thankful ... you are blessed because the majority can , but most do not .
If you can read this message , you are more blessed than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all .
We 're a fortunate group of people ...
Since I stopped painting , entirely , in 1990 , and have been concentrating mostly , on sculptures , my collaborations with musicians seemed to be over until Korn came along .
Usually , I become aware of new band only when someone calls them
to my attention or if I am sent their music , for some reason .
I first heard the name KORN when I was contacted with the proposal to create a special microphone stand for the lead singer , Jonathan Davis .
The idea was suggested to him by one of his friends who knew that Jonathan was
a fan of my artwork .
Since the music has always been the most important thing for me and I must , absolutely , like it before
I can work with a band , or even agree to
let them use one of my old paintings ,
first I listened to all the Korn CDs they
sent to me .
The same day I decided to accept the project , I started making many sketches ,
at first , in the form of plantlike snakes and vertebrae mixed with technical elements .
Meanwhile , Leslie , my agent , went to film the Korn concerts in New York and Philadelphia to show me how Jonathan performed .
They called me from his dressing room and I talked to Jonathan for the first time .
He told me I had complete freedom to design the microphone stand as I wanted and his only concern was that it had be totally functional and as movable as possible .
He also wanted it be Biomechanical and very erotic .
After the concert , Jonathan gave Les the microphone stand he was using to send to me in Zurich .
It was very useful for me to have it handy to help assure that my sculpture will be the exact height , to have an idea of the approximate weight and feel .
In the meantime , the more I listened to the Korn music and watched the tapes , the more amazed I was by the intensity and seriousness of these musicians .
In July 2000 , when KORN was touring Europe , Jonathan and several of his group members visited the H.R. Giger Museum in Gruyeres , and then came to my home .
Since it was still very early in the project , I only had some sketches .
We did n't talk much
about the designs , maybe Jonathan was too polite to make any criticisms .
He is a very nice man and a good singer with absolutely unique music .
After the visit ,
I continued to make more and faxed them to Les .
Before becoming my agent , he had been an art director for many years .
His opinion is always helpful to me and , from a practical standpoint , he is very good at seeing what will work best for everyone .
We discussed my drawings and , with his constructive critique , the figure
got thinner and thinner .
When Jonathan gave his approval , I started with the first 1:1 clay model with Roni , my assistant , and we emailed photos of our progress to the USA .
Over the next weeks , we also started a second , even thinner , clay model , keeping the first one for comparison .
Only after I was , finally , very happy with the figure , we proceeded to add the Biomechanical elements .
We integrated it with bullets , tubes and wires .
When the clay model was finished , we took it to the foundry without waiting for anyone ’s reaction so I could see what it would really look like after the wax model was done .
I liked it so much that I requested an aluminum cast to be made and sent to Jonathan immediately .
After testing the prototype , Jonathan decided that my original idea of a pop- up stand , balanced and weighed to spring back when it is pushed over , could become a problem in live performances because of the extra weight it added .
Otherwise , he was very happy with the mic-stand and asked for only some minor adjustments , to cut away some of the back - head to expose the clip , so he could grab it more easily .
After the stand was returned to Zurich , I made the changes and also cast the second one for him .
I hope Jonathan will be able to can work with my microphone stand with the same intensity as before without being limited by it .

An astronomer at the University of Western Ontario has found a Soviet moon rover in recently released images from a NASA satellite .
Phil Stooke combed through data and images of the moon 's surface from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that NASA released Monday .
Stooke compared the images to his own recently published reference book on moon geography , The International Atlas of Lunar Exploration , and pinpointed the location of the Soviet rover Lunokhod 2 .
" The tracks were visible at once , " said Stooke , in a statement .
The location of the rover was already known through laser ranging experiments , but there 's no telescope on Earth or in Earth orbit powerful enough to actually see it .
" We knew within a few kilometres where it was .
The laser beam spreads out a bit .
It 's not a pinpoint on the moon , " Stooke said in an email .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is taking pictures of the moon from its orbit about 50 kilometres above the surface .
Its one - year mission is to produce a comprehensive moon map .
The Soviet Union landed Lunokhod 2 on the moon in January 1973 , a month after the last American moonwalk .
As the name suggests , it was the second of two solar - powered robotic rovers the Soviets sent to the moon .
Record - setting trip on lunar surface
The Lunokhod rovers were the first remote - controlled vehicles to travel on an extraterrestrial body and still hold the record for longest rover trip at 35 kilometres .
( The Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity have travelled 7.7 kilometres and 19.5 kilometres , respectively . )
Lunokhod 2's mission was to collect images from the moon , observe X - rays from the sun , study the moon 's soil and measure its magnetic fields .
" The value here is partly the visual identification , but also the tracks , which will allow a detailed route map to be drawn for the first time , " Stooke said .
" Knowing the history of the mission , it 's possible to trace the rover 's activities in fine detail .
We can see where it measured the magnetic field , driving back and forth over the same route to improve the data , " he said .
" And we can also see where it drove into a small crater , and accidentally covered its heat radiator with soil as it struggled to get out again .
That ultimately caused it to overheat and stop working .
And the rover itself shows up as a dark spot right where it stopped , " said Stooke .
NASA released the first images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in July 2009 , revealing the landing sites of five of the six Apollo missions .
In 2010 America , schools , students , and teachers share the pain .
The heirs to our mega rich , meanwhile , do n’t have to share anything .
By Sam Pizzigati
A moment of silence , please , for Dan Duncan .
The 77 - year - old Duncan , a Houston resident , passed away the end of March .
He left behind a spouse , four grown children , four grandkids — and a fortune worth $ 9 billion .
Duncan also left behind another distinction .
He has become the first American billionaire to ever leave his heirs a tax - free fortune .
America ’s first - ever billionaire — John D. Rockefeller — slid into the hereafter back in 1937 .
At that time , a federal estate tax had already been in effect for 21 years .
John D. ’s heirs faced a 70 percent tax rate on the bulk of his estate .
Dan Duncan ’s heirs face a 0 percent estate tax levy .
His son and three daughters have now become instant billionaires .
If Duncan had passed on last year , instead of this one , his heirs would have had to share their new billions , as many as four of them , with the rest of America .
But this year , for the first time since 1916 , no estate tax graces the tax code .
How much will the absence of an estate tax this year cost the federal treasury ?
We ca n’t say with any certainty .
No one knows , after all , how many other billionaires may kick the bucket between now and December 31 .
We do know that in 2008 , the latest year with figures available , the federal government collected $ 25.7 billion in estate tax revenue .
That sum , by coincidence , would be enough to fully fund the $ 23 billion Rep. George Miller from California and Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa want Congress to appropriate , as soon as possible , to avert the nation ’s worst teacher layoff crisis since the Great Depression .
Two - thirds of the nation ’s school districts , says a new American Association of School Administrators survey , have already axed educators .
In the coming school year , without additional budget help , 90 percent expect to have to let jobs go .
That help , at this point , seems a longshot .
The 2009 Obama administration stimulus legislation did save tens of thousands of teacher jobs .
But the stimulus dollars earmarked for education are running out , and deficit hawks in Congress say the nation ca n’t afford to appropriate any more .
How can a civilized nation afford to hand the heirs of the super rich billions of dollars tax - free and not afford to keep teachers in classrooms ?
We can trace our current budget inanity back to 2001 , the year the Bush White House pushed Congress to repeal the federal estate tax .
But the White House did n’t have the votes needed , under Senate rules , for a costly permanent repeal .
So White House officials cooked the budget books to camouflage the true cost of estate tax repeal .
They maneuvered a tax bill through Congress that lowered estate tax rates over the rest of the decade and repealed the estate tax only for 2010 .
The estate tax , under the 2001 legislation , would then reappear in 2011 .
White House strategists , of course , never expected to ever see this reappearance .
They figured a future Congress would extend repeal beyond 2010 .
But this “ breathtakingly cynical ” move , as the University of Cincinnati Law School ’s Paul Caron notes , would prove too clever by half .
By 2007 , Bush had lost his House of Representatives majority and any realistic shot at making the repeal in 2010 permanent .
Supporters of the estate tax , meanwhile , assumed that the Congress elected in 2008 would legislate away the one - year estate tax repeal slated for 2010 .
But that did n’t happen either .
In 2009 , lawmakers deadlocked .
The friends of the financially fortunate in Congress , a bipartisan group , wanted any new estate tax set at a rate that would , at worse , merely inconvenience the super rich .
Lawmakers less friendly to the fortunate wanted much more : estate tax rates high enough to break up grand concentrations of private wealth , a key goal of the reformers who championed the original estate tax a century ago .
Amid this stalemate , last year ended without any legislative estate tax action , and total estate tax repeal for 2010 , as stipulated by the 2001 tax cut legislation , went into effect January 1 .
The conventional wisdom on Capitol Hill then shifted .
Lawmakers , observers opined , would move expeditiously in 2010 to pass some sort of an estate tax and make the levy retroactive for the entire year .
But no one in Congress , notes legal trade journal editor Scott Martin , apparently expected that a billionaire of Dan Duncan ’s magnitude would actually go and die without an estate tax on the books .
Duncan ’s death has changed everything .
“ Big estates , ” explains editor Martin , “ mean big lawyers ready to fight to see those billions of dollars go to the deceased ’s heirs . ”
Those lawyers will likely battle in the courts , to the last billable hour , any move to make the estate tax retroactive for all of 2010 .
And the longer 2010 goes without an estate tax on the books , the higher the chances the courts will agree .
In the meantime , none of the obituaries for Dan Duncan that have appeared since his death explore his status as America ’s first estate tax - free billionaire .
The obituaries have instead gushed over Duncan ’s philanthropy .
He had contributed , over his last five years , more than $ 250 million to hospitals and other institutions .
But Duncan , by yardsticks that measure capacity to give , rates as distinctly second tier as a philanthropist .
The first tier belongs to philanthropists like Judith Anderson , a teacher in Houston ’s Almeda Elementary School .
Last week , on the occasion of National Teacher Appreciation Day , a local media outlet in Houston spotlighted Anderson ’s long philanthropic history .
Over the course of her 20 - year school career , she has spent thousands of dollars on her students , all without reimbursement .
On one project alone , setting up a school soccer league , Anderson spent $ 2,000 — on a teacher ’s salary .
By comparison , Duncan ’s energy pipeline empire now generates $ 600 million a year in annual cash flow .
Next to that , $ 50 million in annual tax - deductible charitable contributions hardly matches the sacrifice that teachers like Judith Anderson are making year in and year out .
The reward for these sacrifices ?
Budget cuts that pink slip teachers and overcrowd classrooms , budget cuts that could be avoided if the rich were paying their appropriate tax share .
Dan Duncan , a close friend noted after his death , “ really wanted to help everybody . ”
If Dan Duncan ’s heirs really want to help everybody , they ’ll troop over to Capitol Hill and demand the immediate reinstatement of a meaningful federal estate tax .
His billionaire heirs , odds are , wo n’t do that .
That burden ’s on the rest of us .

Court to rule if marriage commissioners have right to refuse same - sex ceremonies By Charles Lewis , National Post In 2005 , around the time Parliament declared same - sex marriage legal , Orville Nichols , a civil marriage commissioner in Regina , was approached by a man who asked him to perform a wedding ceremony .
He had been overseeing civil ceremonies for more than 20 years , so there was nothing unusual about the request .
But the man who approached Mr. Nichols , since identified in court documents as M.J. , then added it would be a same - sex ceremony .
Mr. Nichols refused , explaining his Christian beliefs forbade him from taking part in the marriage of two men .
M.J. found a willing commissioner to marry him and his partner , but still decided to bring Mr. Nichols before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission .
Mr. Nichols was fined $ 2,500 in 2008 for violating M.J. ’s rights .
Mr. Nichols then brought his case to the Court of Queen ’s Bench , which rejected his appeal last year .
“ I have nothing against gay people , ” he said from his home in Regina .
“ I have a nephew and niece who are gay .
I do n’t hate them .
I just do n’t want to take part in a same - sex service . ”
On Thursday , the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Regina will consider whether marriage commissioners are within their Charter rights to refuse to conduct ceremonies that offend their religious beliefs .
While some other provinces have allowed for exemptions since same - sex marriage became legal , this will be the first time that a court will evaluate if that refusal meets the standards of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , so it could have ramifications for the rest of the country .
Saskatchewan ’s attorney - general , Don Morgan , through a reference to the provincial Court of Appeal , has taken the unusual step of hiring two outside lawyers to argue both for and against the constitutionality of exemptions .
Mr. Morgan said if the court allows the exemptions , his government will introduce legislation ; if the court decides that any exemption is unconstitutional , the matter will end there .
The court will also hear from interested parties , intervenors , on both sides of the issue .
“ Accommodations have to be made to respect both parties ’ rights but now and again we ’ve seen circumstances where some rights conflict with other rights and sometimes rather directly , ” said Faye Sonier , legal counsel for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada , who will argue for the exemptions .
“ The Supreme Court [ ruled in another case 2001 ] that there is no hierarchy of rights .
What we hope to do in this case is find a way to respect both parties ’ rights .
That ’s what the Charter demands . ”
Abby Deshman , a lawyer with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , said her group decided to intervene against the exemptions .
She called it a difficult decision given how many shades of grey there are in this case .
“ We have come down in favour of reasonable accommodation of conscientious objection or religious views in other cases in the past , ” she said .
“ Except the crucial difference here is that this will help decide the nature of government and the right of all citizens to equally access non-religious services .
“ I think there are higher obligations on government , which is to treat all citizens equally when providing services . ”
However , she said her group does not agree that civil servants must give up all religious rights .
“ We think that reasonable accommodation should be made when possible .
But we just think in this case this accommodation takes too heavy a toll on a equality .
“ It ’s put into stark contrast when you switch out the grounds of discrimination .
So if we go back to the 1950s and there were people who publicly declared that mixed marriages were contrary to religious doctrine .
If we had a government that said , Yes , if this is your belief , you have the right to refuse to provide this service to mixed marriage couples when they come in ... I think most people would find it objectionable . ”
Ruth Ross , executive director and general legal counsel for the Ontario - based Christian Legal Fellowship , rejects the comparison to mixed marriages or racially based motivations .
“ It ’s not the same thing because there is no inner malice here , ” said Ms. Ross .
“ This has nothing to do with malice or discrimination .
It is about asking the marriage commissioner to participate and co-operate with something that is immoral and wrong .
And the court is being asked to show tolerance toward religion as they would show tolerance in other situations . ”
Reynold Robertson , a Saskatoon lawyer hired by the government to argue against the exemptions , said when a marriage commissioner refuses to marry a gay couple , he is saying , “ My religious right is paramount to your right to equality . ”
When a marriage commissioner refuses to work on a holy day , that is not discrimination because it applies to anyone who would ask to be married , he said .
“ These people are n’t by virtue of their religious belief visiting their conduct on someone because they ’re gay , ” he said .
“ On the other hand , when he says his calendar is free but wo n’t marry a gay couple , that ’s visiting his religious belief onto somebody else and then it becomes discrimination . ”

The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged investment banking titan Goldman Sachs with civil fraud over a pre-packaged mortgage instrument they say was designed to fail .
Goldman Sachs created the derivative — called Abacus 2007 - AC1 — in response to a request from a hedge fund manager who predicted that the housing market would collapse and wanted to bet against it .
The trader , John Paulson , later earned $ 3.7 billion for his wager .
Goldman ’s practices cost investors $ 1 billion , according to the filing .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the New York Times , which first revealed details of the Abacus case , the instrument was among 25 Goldman created so that clients could bet against the housing market :
As the Abacus deals plunged in value , Goldman and certain hedge funds made money on their negative bets , while the Goldman clients who bought the $ 10.9 billion in investments lost billions of dollars .
Goldman let Mr. Paulson select mortgage bonds that he wanted to bet against Ã¢â‚¬â€ the ones he believed were most likely to lose value Ã¢â‚¬â€ and packaged those bonds into Abacus 2007 - AC1 , according to the S.E.C. complaint .
Goldman then sold the Abacus deal to investors like foreign banks , pension funds , insurance companies and other hedge funds .
But the deck was stacked against the Abacus investors , the complaint contends , because the investment was filled with bonds chosen by Mr. Paulson as likely to default .
Goldman told investors in Abacus marketing materials reviewed by The Times that the bonds would be chosen by an independent manager .
Apparently , they were n’t .
Fabrice Tourre , a vice president at Goldman who helped design and market Abacus , was also named in the SEC suit .
84 percent of Abacus ’ mortgage bonds would be downgraded within five months of their sale .
By the end of 2007 , Paulson ’s credit hedge fund soared 590 percent , and Goldman ’s clients lost billions .
Goldman reportedly targeted specific mortgage bonds at Paulson ’s request that Paulson felt were most likely to lose their golden credit ratings , which would trigger a payout for his firm .

Goldman did not immediately comment on the suit .
The company ’s shares fell more than 10 percent on the news .
Shareholder recently sued firm for huge bonus payouts
In January , a lawsuit filed against the investment bank by a shareholder alleged that the company spent more money on corporate bonuses than it earned in 2008 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shareholder Ken Brown ’s lawsuit is one of two suits filed against the company over its controversial decision to hand out billions of dollars in bonuses even after it was accused of playing a central role in the financial collapse of 2008 and receiving $ 10 billion in direct aid from the US government .
In his lawsuit ( PDF ) , Brown asserted that Goldman Sachs gave out $ 4.82 billion in bonuses in 2008 , despite earnings of only $ 2.32 billion that year .
The lawsuit alleges that the company spent 259 percent of its income in the first quarter of 2009 on compensation .
ADVERTISEMENT
Goldman Sachs handed out $ 16.7 billion in compensation in the first nine months of 2009 , according to Bloomberg News , and that figure may reach $ 22 billion for the entire year .
Brown ’s suit says the company typically sets aside 44 percent of its net revenue for employees .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Payment of this exorbitant amount of compensation , which has little to do with Goldman SachsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s performance , and was financed in large part with government bailout and taxpayer money , is a waste of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s assets and a breach of duty and loyalty , ” Brown asserts in the suit .
Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein earned $ 9 million in a non-cash bonus for 2009 .
In prior years , he ’d earned more than $ 20 million .
Roger Ebert is getting a little taste of some very nasty tea ... from tea partiers IRATE at the nerve of Roger Ebert for an offhand tweet he made in response to the California teens disciplined for wearing American flag t- shirts at a Cinco de Mayo school event .
Ebert tweeted :
Kids who wear American Flag t- shirts on 5 May should have to share a lunchroom table with those who wear a hammer and sickle on 4 July .
Well , you know that co-opting the favorite symbol of the tea party crowd was n't going to set well , especially when you imply the perhaps there is a lack of empathy going on .
There are a few points of etiquette most of us learn early :
Always send thank - you cards .
Do n't talk with your mouth full .
Do n't mock those who have battled cancer and won .
Those crazy tea partiers ?
They forgot lesson number three .
It seems they 've worked themselves into a tizzy over Roger Ebert 's comments on Twitter in response to the case in California where five kids were sent home early from school for wearing American flag garb on Cinco de Mayo . [.. ]
CNN.com reported response tweets from the Tea Party Tweeters like : “ I mean honestly .
How many pieces need to fall off @ebertchicago before he gets the hint to shut the ( expletive ) up ” and “ You know , @ebertchicago , I ’m not as expert on flag etiquette as you .
Tell me , which do I fly when you die of cancer ? ”
Hoo boy .
You stay classy now .
Ebert , bless his heart , has battled far more formidable foes than your nasty little tea bagger , so he 's been giving as good as he 's gotten on Twitter ( follow him here : @ebertchicago ) .
He also blogged about it in more than 140 characters on his blog :
The impression is spreading that I have drawn an equation between the American flag and the hammer and the sickle .
I 'm currently serving for target practice on some right - wing websites , and a group of Tweeters are having jolly fun portraying me as an America hater and worse .[.. ]
[ My post ] was tweeted at the height of the discussion over five white California kids who wore matching t- shirts to school on Cinco de Mayo , and were sent home by their school .
This inspired predictable outrage in the usual circles .
Tweeted from lonestarag05 : Its the USA not Mexico .
They are allowed to be proud of their country .
I wonder sometimes why you even stay here .
Many others informed me that Americans have the right to be proud of our flag , and wear it on T - shirts .
Of course they do .
That is n't the question .
It 's not what my Tweet said .
What I suggested , in its 108 letters , is that we could all use a little empathy .
I wish I had worded it better .
Let 's begin with a fact few Americans know : Celebrating Cinco de Mayo is an American custom .
The first such celebration was held in California in 1863 , and they have continued without interruption .
In Mexico itself it is not observed , except in the state of Puebla -- the site of Mexico 's underdog victory over the French on May 5 , 1862 .
Cinco de Mayo's purpose is to celebrate Mexican - American culture in the United States .
We are a nation of immigrants , and have many such observances , for example St. Patrick 's Day parades , which began in Boston in 1737 and not in Ireland until 1931 .
Or Pulaski Day , officially established in Illinois in 1977 , and not observed in Poland .
The first Chinese New Year 's parade was held in San Francisco in the 1860s , and such parades began only later in China .
In Chicago this August we will have the 81st annual Bud Billiken Parade , one of the largest parades in America , celebrating the African - American heritage .[..]
The question is obviously not whether Americans , or anyone else , has the right to wear our flag on their t- shirts .
But empathetic people realize much depends on context .
If , on Cinco de Mayo , you turn up at your school with a large Mexican - American student population wearing such shirts , are you ( 1 ) joining in the spirit of the holiday , or ( 2 ) looking for trouble ?
I suggest you intend to insult your fellow students .
Not because they do not respect THEIR flag , but because you do not respect their heritage .
That there are five of you in matching shirts demonstrates you want to be deliberately provocative .
Give 'em hell , Roger .
Of all the challenges we face as humans , none is more difficult than death .
Whether it ’s the death of a loved one , the death of thousands in some natural disaster , or the fear of our own eventual demise , death is the terrible problem that wo n’t go away .
Nothing causes more suffering .
Confronted with age , sickness , and death , the Buddha strove with all his might to find an answer to the problem of human suffering .
Through immense effort and penetrating inquiry into the mental nature of things , he eventually made a historic breakthrough in understanding the nature of mind and its relationship to the body and matter .
This “ answer ” to the problem of suffering was n’t a new set of metaphysical suppositions one was supposed to believe in to be saved .
Nor was the answer to suffering hoping for a heavenly afterlife — assuming you were n’t going to the other place !
Rather , the Buddha outlined a process of awakening that anybody can learn and immediately put to work in his or her life .
This process involves learning and cultivating mental skills and gaining deep insights into the mental origins of becoming , of cause and effect .
With his revolutionary insight into our psychological and cosmological world - making , the Buddha was able to look deeply into the problem of death and see its final solution .
There is a path to the Deathless !
And we can have a foretaste of the Deathless even in this life .
What We Can Do About Death in This Life
Here is the very good news of Buddhism : even though we can’t avoid death , that does n’t mean we ca n’t do a great deal in this life to alleviate the suffering associated with death .
We can even begin to weaken and break the chains of cause and effect that bind us to cycles of aging , sickness , and death .
In these dharma talks , below , three very skilled , very compassionate dharma teachers share their insights into how the Buddha ’s teaching can help us find refuge from aging , sickness , and death .
I hope they will be both a comfort and inspiration to you .
We can all do far more in this “ precious human life ” than we might realize to bring an end to death and the suffering of death .

Nuclear Weapons - Western Assessments
The economic situation in Iran constrained the funding of military improvements generally , and was thought to have constrained Iran 's nuclear weapons plans .
American counter - proliferation efforts initially appeared to have limited Iran 's options .
The US had imposed sanctions prohibiting trade and investment in Iran .
Tehran had attempted to portray US containment efforts as unjust , in an attempt to convince European or Asian suppliers to relax export restrictions on key technologies .
Foreign suppliers have been discouraged by the risk of sanctions or political embarrassment because of US - led containment efforts .
By the mid 1990s Tehran 's international debt exceeded $ 30 billion , although oil price increases in 1996 could have relieved the pressure at least temporarily .
Despite severe economic distress , Iran 's use of limited funds to procure new conventional weapons and suspected programs to develop weapons of mass destruction revealed a commitment to achieve Gulf preeminence .
Russia , China , and North Korea supported the effort by selling T - 72 tanks , Kilo- class submarines , and ballistic missiles .
Purchases of submarines and modern missile patrol boats , combined with reinforcement of the southern Arabian Gulf islands , bolstered the Iranian Navy 's ability to interdict strategic sea - lines - of - communication and impose its control over these critical shipping passages .
In the early 1990s it appeared that Iran planned to invest considerable resources in military procurement , including establishment of a new and larger Air Force , a new armored corps , and a revamped artillery corps .
What actually happened was far below the predictions .
Air Force modernization with new Russian planes had taken place in modest numbers .
The acquisition of several hundred new tanks left Iran in an inferior position relative to Iraq .
Iran had aggressively pursued nuclear technology from both Western and Eastern sources .
Russia and China provided assistance in developing nuclear energy capabilities .
Since the early 1990's the Iranians had been purchasing dual - use nuclear equipment from Europe , China , Russia and third world countries .
Some of this equipment could be used to enrich uranium , which in turn could be used for nuclear weapon development .
Iran had also made extensive efforts in training nuclear personnel in Iran itself and in western universities .
Through the end of the 1990s unclassified assessments based on Iran 's known nuclear infrastructure reflected a technology and production base inadequate to the task of producing nuclear weapons for many years .
In April 1984 , West German intelligence sources had leaked reports to the press that Iran 's clandestine nuclear weapons program was so far advanced that it would be capable of producing a bomb " within two years , " but these reports turned out to be greatly exaggerated .
Israel and the United States believed in 1992 that Iran would attain a military nuclear capability within eight to 10 years .
In 1995 ACDA Director John Holum testified that Iran could have the bomb by 2003 , though by 1997 he testified that Iran could have the bomb by 2005 - 2007 .
In the mid-1990 's the view of the United States government was that Iran was implementing a military nuclear program that could achieve a weapons capability within five years , at the time meaning by the year 2000 .
As of 1998 the estimate of the US Central Command ( CENTCOM ) was that Iranian efforts could result in the development of a nuclear device by the middle of the next decade , that is , by the year 2005 .
In a statement to the US public made 7 January 1998 and broadcast by Cable News Network , President Sayed Mohamad Khatami said , " we are not a nuclear power and do not intend to become one .
We have accepted IAEA safeguards and our facilities are routinely inspected by that agency . "
Some western observers asserted that Khatami , a moderate cleric elected president of Iran in May 1997 , had not taken charge of Iran 's nuclear development program .
Despite Khatami's emergence as a political figure , developments suggested that he was not in control of the military and security sphere .
In January 2000 , marking a significant departure from previous assessments , the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon .
This evaluation was not based on evidence that Iran 's efforts had achieved a breakthrough , but rather on the fact that the United States could not track with great certainty increased efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear materials and technology .
Analysts at other intelligence agencies believed that Iran 's efforts were still moving , albeit very slowly .
In an April 2004 speech , John R Bolton , the Bush Administration 's primary policymaker on weapons of mass destruction , said : " If we permit Iran 's deception to go on much longer , it will be too late .
Iran will have nuclear weapons . "
On 10 November 2004 the Wall Street Journal reported that European officials believed Iran was five or six years away from possessing nuclear weapons .
The European goal in the proposed deal on suspension of Iran 's uranium - enrichment activities was to ensure that Iran got no closer than that .
Some American estimates were that as of late 2004 Iran was only one year away from a bomb , while others estimated that Iran could have enough material for one bomb in 1.5 to 2 years , meaning by early to mid-2005 .
In January 2005 IDF Intelligence Branch chief Major General Aharon Ze'evi Farkash stated in a presentation at the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa that if Iran 's uranium enrichment activities were not halted , it could develop its first atomic bomb at some point between 2007 and 2009 .
At that time , he said that Iran was six months away from enriching uranium , a step that had been described as the " point of no return . "
On 16 February 2005 Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacoby , US Navy , Director , Defense Intelligence Agency , testified that " Iran is likely continuing nuclear weapon - related endeavors in an effort to become the dominant regional power and deter what it perceives as the potential for US or Israeli attacks .
We judge Iran is devoting significant resources to its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs .
Unless constrained by a nuclear non-proliferation agreement , Tehran probably will have the ability to produce nuclear weapons early in the next decade . "
In June 2005 , Robert G. Joseph , undersecretary of state for arms control , was asked whether Iran had a nuclear effort underway , Bolton 's successor , said : " I do n't know quite how to answer that because we do n't have perfect information or perfect understanding .
But the Iranian record , plus what the Iranian leaders have said ... lead us to conclude that we have to be highly skeptical . "
On 1 August 2005 the The Jerusalem Post reported that the Israeli government estimated that Iran would be able to build an atomic bomb as soon as the year 2008 , " if all goes well for it " in the words of a high ranking IDF commander .
The new estimate indicated that Iran will " probably " have an atomic bomb by 2012 .
The anonymous Israeli military officer indicated that Israel 's assessement , in contrast to earlier views , that Iran did not have a separate military nuclear program , and that Iran 's nuclear weapons effort was entirely dependent on the overt civilian effort .
The officer was quoted as saying " We no longer think that a secret military track runs independent of the civilian one ...
If it were , then they could acquire weapons in 2007 ...
Now we think the military track is dependent on the civilian one .
However , from a certain point it will be able to run independently .
But not earlier than 2008 . "
The " point of no return " was said to be within a few months to a year .
On 2 August 2005 The Washington Post reported a new US National Intelligence Estimate had concluded that Iran was about a decade away from acquiring nuclear weapons , doubling the previous estimate of five years .
The NIE expressed uncertainty about whether Iran 's leaders had made a decision to build a nuclear arsenal , though " it is the judgment of the intelligence community that , left to its own devices , Iran is determined to build nuclear weapons . "
The new estimate judged that Iran was unlikely to produce sufficient quantities of highly enriched uranium before " early to mid-next decade . "
The timeline was depicted reflecting a program " moving full speed ahead without major technical obstacles . "
As with the Israeli estimate , the new NIE concluded that it was improbable that Iran 's military had covert enrichment effort separate from the overt effort .
In November 2007 another US National Intelligence Estimate was published .
In it , it stated that revised intelligence suggested that Tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
It also said that the earliest possible date Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) for a weapon was late 2009 , but that this was very unlikely .
There was moderate confidence Iran probably would be technically capable of producing enough HEU for a weapon sometime during the 2010 - 2015 time frame .
This was widely recieved as evidence that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program and was not developing nuclear weapons at all .
While the NIE stated that it did not set out to answer that question , it defined " nuclear weapons program " as Iran 's nuclear weapon design and weaponization work and covert uranium conversion - related and uranium enrichment - related work .
Halting this process could also have meant that Iran had finished this work and was capable , after 2003 , of construction nuclear weapons , simply lacking the nuclear material ( HEU ) to do so .
Image caption Internet Explorer still dominates the market
Microsoft's Internet Explorer ( IE ) web browser , now accounts for less than 60 % of the market , down from 95 % at its peak in 2003 , according to new figures .
Latest statistics , from measurement firm NetApplications , show that IE has 59.9 % of the market , with Firefox gaining on it , with 24.5 % .
While third - place Google Chrome 's 6.7 % share of the market looks tiny by comparison it is rising sharply , up from just 1.7 % this time last year .
A new version of IE is in development .
Microsoft has gradually been losing market share , largely due to concerns over security , experts said .
Viable alternatives
Measurement firms tend to agree that IE is losing market share although the percentage share of rival browsers is more hotly contested .
In the UK , research firm Nielsen suggests that IE still commands 70 % of the market , with Mozilla 's Firefox on 18 % .
It does not include figures for Apple 's Safari .
It still shows a downwards trend for IE , losing 6 % of market share since last year .
This could be due to more awareness of rivals , thinks Gartner analyst Jeffrey Mann .
" There are more viable alternatives now .
Google has been advertising and there are more people using Macs and Apple 's Safari .
There is just a great awareness that there are alternatives , " he said .
Recently people using version 6 of the browser were advised to find an alternative due to large security holes .
It may shift loyalty away from Microsoft , thinks Gartner analyst Jeffrey Mann .
" There were a lot of people using IE6 and some will have said that if they are going to change , they may as well look at some alternatives , " he said .
Microsoft introduced browser choice to European Windows users in March .
BROWSER MARKET SHARE Internet Explorer - 59.9 %
Firefox - 24.5 %
Chrome - 6.7 %
Safari - 4.7 %
Opera - 2.3 %
Opera Mini - 0.7 %
Netscape - 0.46 %
Mozilla - 0.16 %
Flock - 0.06 %
Lunascape - 0.04 %
Source : Net Applications
This was the result of a ten - year dispute with the European Union over the fairness of IE being installed as the default browser on billions of computers using the Microsoft Windows operating system .
Now customers get the choice of 12 browsers .
But this is unlikely to have affected current market - share figures thinks Mr Mann .
" That is only just beginning to kick in and is likely to have a minor effect overall .
It will see some really small browsers getting a lot of prominence , " he said .
For rivals to IE it is going to be a " long , slow rise " , thinks Mr Mann , as Microsoft remains dominant .
And with the release of version 9 of Internet Explorer , the battle could really hot up .
IE9 promises to support HTML5 , the next - generation standard for coding web pages , which aims to reduce the need for software plug-ins , such as Flash .
Apple remains a key rival for Microsoft in the browser market and it has seen its Safari browser gain market share but the two rivals are united when it comes to supporting the HTML5 web standards .
Apple sees HTML5 - along with other technologies such as the h.264 standard for video - as a replacement for Flash and has been involved in a high - profile spat with Flash owners Adobe .
Apple has banned Flash from many of its products .
An intro to modern OpenGL . Chapter 2.3 : Rendering
At this point in our " hello world " program , we 've loaded our buffers and textures and compiled and linked our shader program .
The pieces are all finally in place — let 's render our image .
Overview of a rendering job
Rendering potentially takes a lot of parameters .
In addition to all of the buffers , textures , shaders , and uniform parameters it may involve , there are dozens of miscellaneous settings I have n't touched on that control how a rendering job behaves .
Rather than offer a monolithic " draw " function with all of these flags as arguments , or require you to fill out a struct with dozens of fields , OpenGL 's approach is to lay all of these settings out as a state machine .
When you bind objects to targets using glBindTexture , glBindBuffer , and their kin , you are not only making the objects available for modification , you are also binding them to the current rendering job 's state .
There are also state manipulation functions that set the current shader program , assign values to uniform parameters , and describe the structure of the vertex array .
When you finally submit a job with glDrawElements , OpenGL takes a snapshot of the current state and adds it to the GPU 's command queue , where it will be executed as soon as the GPU is available .
Meanwhile , you can change the OpenGL state around and queue up additional jobs without waiting for your previous jobs to finish .
Once you 're done queueing up jobs , you tell the window system to " swap buffers " , which will wait for all of the queued jobs to finish and then commit the result to the screen .
Let 's start writing the code to set up our rendering job state :
Activating the shader program and assigning uniforms
static void render ( void ) { glUseProgram( g_resources.program ) ;
We begin by activating our shader program by passing the name of the linked program object to glUseProgram .
Once the program is active , we can start assigning values to our uniform variables .
If you recall from looking at our fragment shader source , we have the float fade_factor and an array of two sampler2D s named textures to assign .
glUniform1f( g_resources.uniforms.fade_factor , g_resources.fade_factor ) ;
OpenGL provides a family of glUniform * functions for assigning to uniform variables , with each member corresponding to a possible type for a uniform variable in a GLSL program .
These functions all have names of the form glUniform {dim}{type} , where the dim indicates the size of a vector type ( 1 for an int or float uniform , 2 for a vec2 , etc. ) , and the type indicates the component type : either i for integer , or f for floating - point .
Our fade_factor uniform is a simple float , so we assign it by calling glUniform1f , passing in the uniform 's location and new value as arguments .
glActiveTexture ( GL_TEXTURE0 ) ; glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , g_resources.textures [0 ] ) ; glUniform1i( g_resources.uniforms.textures[0 ] , 0 ) ; glActiveTexture ( GL_TEXTURE1 ) ; glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , g_resources.textures [ 1 ] ) ; glUniform1i( g_resources.uniforms.textures [ 1 ] , 1 ) ;
Assigning textures to sampler s is a bit more complicated .
The GPU has a limited number of texture units that can supply texture data to any one rendering job .
We have to bind our texture objects to these texture units , then assign the indexes of the texture units to our sampler uniform variables as if they were int variables .
The GL_TEXTURE _* target name we bind to must also correspond to the type of the sampler uniform .
In our case , GL_TEXTURE_2D corresponds to the sampler 2D type of our textures variable .
glActiveTexture sets the active texture unit .
glBindTexture takes the active texture unit as an implicit parameter , binding the given texture object to the target on that unit .
( Other texture object manipulation functions like glTexParameteri and glTexImage2D also operate on the texture bound to the active texture unit . )
Once we 've bound the texture unit , we can assign its index to the uniform using glUniform 1i .
Setting up the vertex array
glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , g_resources.vertex_buffer ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.attributes.position , /* attribute */ 2 , /* size */ GL_FLOAT , /* type */ GL_FALSE , /* normalized ? */ sizeof ( GLfloat ) * 2 , /* stride */ ( void * ) 0 /* array buffer offset */ ) ; glEnableVertexAttribArray( g_resources.attributes.position ) ;
Next , we tell OpenGL the format of our vertex array .
We do this by going through each vertex attribute and calling glVertexAttribPointer , which associates a part of a vertex buffer with the attribute , and glEnableVertexAttribArray , which tells OpenGL to read values for that attribute from the vertex array while rendering .
glVertexAttribPointer takes as arguments the attribute location , the size and component type of the associated attribute variable ( for our position attribute , size 2 and type GL_FLOAT ) , the number of bytes between attribute values ( called the stride ) , and the offset of the first attribute value inside the currently bound GL_ARRAY_BUFFER .
For historic reasons , the offset is passed as a pointer , but the parameter is used for its integer value , so we pass an integer cast to void * .
In our case , our vertex array consists only of the single vec2 position attribute ; if we had multiple attributes , the attributes ' values could be either interleaved , like an array of struct s , or kept in separate arrays .
The flexibility glVertexAttribPointer gives in letting us choose the stride and offset of each attribute can accommodate either arrangement .
Different attributes can even be potentially read from separate buffer objects ; changing the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding wo n't affect the buffer used by attribute array pointers that have already been set .
( The normalized ?
argument I skipped mentioning above is used with arrays of integers in the vertex array .
If true , the components will be mapped from the range of their integer type , such as 0 – 255 for an unsigned byte , to the floating - point range 0.0 –1.0 , like color components in an image .
If false , their integer values will be preserved .
For components like ours that are already floating - point , it does n't have any effect . )
Submitting the rendering job
glBindBuffer( GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER , g_resources.element_buffer ) ; glDrawElements ( GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP , /* mode */ 4 , /* count */ GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT , /* type */ ( void * ) 0 /* element array buffer offset */ ) ;
glDrawElements is the function that sets the graphics pipeline in motion .
We tell it what triangle assembly mode we want , how many vertices to assemble triangles from , the type of the components of our element array , and the offset within the currently bound GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER of the first component to render , again as a fake - pointer - but - really - integer .
It will then take the pointed - to element array indexes , gather them up with the currently bound shader program , uniform values , texture units , and vertex attribute pointers we just set up , bundle everything into a rendering job , and place the job in the GPU 's queue .
Cleaning up after ourselves
glDisableVertexAttribArray( g_resources.attributes.position ) ;
" Always leave things the way you found them , " the late Bill Brasky once advised .
A downside of OpenGL 's state machine model is that all of these bindings and settings persist globally , even after glDrawElements is called .
This means that we have to take some care with how our OpenGL code will interact with all of the other OpenGL code throughout the program .
While there is no other OpenGL code yet in this program to interact with , we should still start learning good habits .
Particular care is needed with vertex attributes :
In a complex program involving multiple shader programs and multiple vertex arrays , an incorrectly enabled vertex attribute array could potentially cause glDrawElements to try to feed the GPU invalid data , leading to corrupted output or segfaults .
It 's a good idea to keep a vertex array attribute enabled only as long as it's needed .
Here , we disable the vertex attribute array for position .
You might also be thinking , we 're rebinding all of the same objects , setting all of the same uniform values ( aside from the fade_factor ) , and reactivating all of the same vertex attributes every time we render .
If the state settings persist across glDrawElements calls , we could technically do without almost all of this per - frame setup , getting away with binding everything once before entering glutMainLoop and having render only update the fade factor and call glDrawElements .
But again , it 's a good idea to set up all the state you expect at the point you expect it .
Depending on bits of OpenGL state to remain unchanged between frames is an easy way to breed bugs as your programs grow .
Displaying our finished scene
glutSwapBuffers ( ) ; }
We only have the one rendering job to wait on , so now that we 've submitted the job and tidied up , we can sync immediately .
The GLUT function glutSwapBuffers waits for all running jobs to finish , then swaps the color buffers of our double - buffered framebuffer , moving the currently visible buffer to the " back " to be rendered into by the next frame , and pushing the image we just rendered to the " front " , showing the newly - rendered scene in our window .
Our rendering is done !
Animating the scene
static void update_fade_factor( void ) { int milliseconds = glutGet ( GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME ) ; g_resources.fade_factor = sinf (( float ) milliseconds * 0.001f ) * 0.5 f + 0.5f ; glutPostRedisplay ( ) ; }
To keep the image moving , our glutIdleFunc callback continuously updates the value we assign to the fade_factor uniform .
GLUT maintains a millisecond timer we can access with glutGet ( GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME ) ; we just feed this through the standard C sinf function to get a smooth , periodic fade from zero to one and back .
Every time we update the fade factor , we call glutPostRedisplay , which forces our render callback to get invoked again , updating the window .
Compiling and running the program , again
It 's finally time to compile and run the whole program with all of our new code .
The command to build the executable will look much as it did last time when we built the dummied - out version , but this time , you 'll build from the real hello - gl.c and util . c source files .
If you use the Makefiles , you can build with the default target :
make -f Makefile.MacOSX # or Makefile .
Unix or Makefile .
Mingw
nmake /f Nmakefile .
Windows
Once built , the program assumes that all its image and shader resources are in the current directory , so it will work best to run it from the command line from inside the directory containing the executable , the image files , and the shader source .
We can finally bask in the glory of our hard work :
Conclusion
That was admittedly a long way to go for a simple " hello world " .
But the framework we 've built up here is actually pretty flexible ; you could swap in your own images and tweak the shaders to transform or filter the images further before sampling them , all without recompiling the C .
In the next chapter , we 'll mess around with the vertex shader to demonstrate the basics of 3d transformation and projection .
If you 're interested in breaking off on your own at this point and looking over the OpenGL specifications yourself , note that the OpenGL 2 specs still include all of the deprecated features I 've been avoiding discussing .
I would highly recommend looking instead at the spec for OpenGL 3.1 or later , being sure to look at the " core profile " specs rather than the ones for the " compatibility profiles " .
While OpenGL 3 and later add a lot of new features over OpenGL 2 , all of the basic APIs I 've gone over here for OpenGL 2 still form the basis for newer versions .
OpenGL ES 2 is also worth looking at .
It consists mostly of the forward - looking subset of OpenGL 2 I 've been covering ; all of the OpenGL APIs I 've mentioned are present in OpenGL ES 2 as well .
OpenGL ES also adds additional features for mobile platforms , such as fixed - point numeric support and offline shader compilation , that the desktop version of the spec does n't offer .
If you want to try your hand at OpenGL ES development , it is part of the Android NDK and iPhone SDKs , among other mobile development platforms .
On Windows , Google 's ANGLE project also provides an implementation of OpenGL ES 2 built on top of DirectX .
Hopefully this chapter has given you a good taste of the OpenGL API and GLSL language .
As always , if you felt something I touched on bears clarification , or there 's something in particular you 'd like to see me cover , .

I. Introduction
Large or small , letters seem to inhabit their own universe .
Re-arrangeable in any combination , they can spell out all conceivable messages , be they poetic , bureaucratic , or anything in between .
But sometimes a text is just about its letters themselves , not an object to be read , but one to be looked at .
Type specimens have taken various forms over the centuries , from posters to postcards and from primers to pamphlets .
In fact , this web ‘ page ’ that you are reading now is also a type specimen , at least of some sort .
In our digital age , creating type specimens has become easier than ever before .
But what did our predecessors do 100 years ago , or even 500 years ago ?

See figure three below for larger detail .
For hundreds of years , this small German city along the Rhine has been known for Johannes Gutenberg and his invention — printing with movable metal type .
Almost any graphic designer who has passed through Mainz has stopped at the Gutenberg Museum .
Next to the city ’s landmark Romanesque cathedral , the Gutenberg Museum presents the history of Western ( and some Eastern ) printing .
Several incunabula books are on display — including three Gutenberg Bibles — as well as printing presses and bits of city paraphernalia .
Figure 2 : 1785 –1786 specimen from William Caslon ’s foundry in Great Britain ( dimensions not recorded by the author ) .
In addition to their famous serif typefaces , the Caslons cut seminal a blackletter type called Caslon Black .
This forms a large part of the base of what we refer to as “ Old English ” - style fonts today .

Lesser known is the museum ’s small library , which is open to the public .
Aside from trade and academic titles on printing and typographic history , the library has a large collection of type specimens from the 17th through 20th centuries .
These were largely collected by Gustav Mori ( 1872 –1950 ) during the first half of the 20th century , especially the large , one - sheet specimen from German type foundries .
III .
Type Specimen
Mori may be most known for his work collecting type specimen from Frankfurt am Main .
Just 40 kilometers east of Mainz , Frankfurt has played an important role in the book trade for almost 500 years .
Over several decades , Mori was an employee at the D. Stempel AG type foundry , one of several large type foundries in Frankfurt at the time .
Frankfurt ’s University Library also includes a Mori collection of type specimen . [ 1 ]
Mori published several works during his lifetime , but one of his most significant volumes was published posthumously in 1955 : a folio book reproducing his collection of type specimen from Frankfurt - based founders from the 16th through 18th centuries . [ 2 ]
Today , type foundries tend to design and produce folded or bound catalogs to show off their typefaces .
Increasingly , they post their designs online thus minimizing print advertising costs .
Centuries earlier , many type specimens tended to take another form : large , over - sized single sheets , on which a type founder would display paragraph settings of each of his types at their various sizes — almost like a poster .
The Gutenberg Museum library ’s oldest specimens all take this form .
Figure 3 : Detail from Johann Erasmus Luther ’s 1678 specimen . ( see fig . 1 above ) .
The Gutenberg Museum library ’s specimen collection is broad , drawing on holdings from all over Europe .
Traditional serif typefaces ( called Antiqua type in German ) are to be found in abundance , as are Greek , Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac , Armenian , and of course , blackletter typefaces .
The first type sorts cast in lead — that were , in all likelihood , cast in Mainz — were blackletter designs .
Blackletter remained immensely popular in Germany through the 20th century ; even as late as 1900 , perhaps half of all printed items there were still set in it .
Only since the beginning of the post - war era has blackletter disappeared from the German mainstream media environment .
IV .
Blackletter Classification
Figure 4 : The basic blackletter styles — Textura , Rotunda , Bastarda , Fraktur , and “ Experimental . ”
While many contemporary designs fall under the lattermost category , classical revivals are still being undertaken across the blackletter spectrum .
Understanding classification schemes can be the key to choosing the right typeface .
For example , a German Fraktur would be a poor choice for an English Pub , while almost any style could look right on a certificate , depending on its overall design .
Old English , & Gotisch designs are further evolutions of the Textura idea .
Gotisch ( gothic ) alone has several styles … from the Romanticist Fette Gotisch ( pictured ) to the so - called “ jackboot grotesques ” of the 1930s ( not pictured ) .
Schwabacher is a style of Bastarda that has been traditionally used in Germany .
Indeed , Fraktur itself could even be classified as another Bastarda , but I have given it its own category , because it became the most - widely used blackletter text style in German typography .
Evolving out of late medieval and early renaissance handwriting , the various blackletter styles also influenced each other over time .
Another Bastarda gené , Civilité , was common in late 16th century printing in France & the Low Countries — not areas one would call “ German . ”
What styles of blackletter ( “ broken types , ” or gebrochene Schriften , in German ) types can one find in this specimen collection ?
Mostly Fraktur and Schwabacher typefaces .
Although the first books produced in Mainz were set in Textura types , Schwabacher ( c. 1480 ) and Fraktur styles ( c. 1517 ) would come to dominate the German trade during the 16th century .
The best Textura specimen in the Gutenberg Museum Library ’s collection comes not from Germany , but from Great Britain : an Old English face in an 18th century catalog from William Caslon ’s foundry ( see figure two above ) . [ 3 ]
Rotunda types — the second oldest blackletter style — never really caught on as a book type in German - speaking lands , although 20th century calligraphers , as well as arts and crafts designers , have used it quite well for display purposes .
However , these rounder styles were popular during the Renaissance in Italy , Southern France , and Spain .
Figure 5 : An 1840 specimen of a Fette Fraktur display weight from the J.B. Metzler ’schen Schrift - Schneiderei of Stuttgart , Germany .
The digital “ Fette Fraktur ” is one of today ’s best selling blackletter fonts .
As can be seen here , it was a mainstay of 19th century German foundries too ( book dimensions not recorded by the author ) .
V. Digital Blackletter Fonts
Most remarkable is that many of the typefaces used in these blackletter specimens are available again to designers and publishers in digital format .
For instance , Caslon ’s above - mentioned blackletter design is sold today under the name Old English .
Type from famous 17th century Frankfurt type founder , Johann Erasmus Luther , served as the basis for Linotype Luthersche Fraktur .
Wittenberger Fraktur is based on Frakturs used in Wittenberg during the 17th and 18th centuries .
Fette Gotisch and Fette Fraktur are both direct interpretations of big display types that were popular all over Germany during the 19th century .

Figure 7 : Fette Gotisch
What use are these old specimens to contemporary designers ?
The first lesson that old specimens can teach us does n’t apply to blackletter designers alone : historically , punchcutters and typeface designers designed type in optical sizes .
Before the age of scalable photo- and digital - typesetting , type could only be set in a range of sizes that were available as cast lead ( or carved wooden ) letters .
Founders would produce each size individually .
A six - point letter looked very different from a 24 - point one .
These days , designers tend to use one font for every size — from caption to headline .
The result ?
Headlines that are often too heavy and too loosely spaced , and fine print that is too light and too tight .
Secondly , old specimens are beautiful pieces of history , and can act as springboards for the design of new blackletter types .
For over two decades , blackletter has undergone a huge revival among designers — particularly in North America .
Other than may be the case in Central Europe , one might even argue that its popularity in North America never really subsided .
The digital revolution made blackletter democratic : now everyone can use new blackletter fonts , or even design their own .
VI .
How is blackletter used today ?
Figure 8 : The New York Times Building
Mostly for display text .
Fonts like Fette Fraktur are used for old - fashioned headlines and beer advertising .
Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch adorns many a wine label .
Linotext and Old English are popular choices for certificates .
Any of the above can be found the world over in tattoos .
Pop culture is more enthralled with blackletter than ever before , examples range from newspaper mastheads ( like The New York Times ) to heavy metal band logos ( à la Motörhead ) and sneaker advertising ( look no further than Reebok ’s ca. 2006 global “ I am ” campaign ) .

About the Gutenberg Museum
Figure 9 : Image from Reebok ’s 2006 global ‘ I am what I am ’ campaign .
Centrally located in Mainz ’s historic inner-city , the Gutenberg Museum is a must see for any type , book , or printing fan .
The museum was founded in 1900 to coincide with a city - wide celebration of the 500th anniversary of Johannes Gutenberg ’s birth , and is dedicated both to him and to his invention .
The museum is open daily , closed only on Mondays and holidays .
Besides rotating exhibitions , some of which are very typographic in nature , the museum displays an enviable permanent collection .
Books , typesetting machines , and printing presses can be seen side by side .
A working print shop , called the Druckladen , is even on hand too .
Inside , visitors may still set type and letterpress print by hand , a favorite for school children and book artists alike .
The museum also has an excellent bookstore , which sells reproductions of pages from the Gutenberg Bible , plus the latest typographic titles from German design publishers .
There are currently more than 60,000 taxis cruising around Japan , a number that accounts for 20 percent of the country 's CO2 emissions .
To promote environmental health , the Japanese government has joined with Better Place , a US firm specializing in electric vehicle development , to come up with a solution : electric taxis powered by replaceable batteries .

Co is under criminal investigation by the FBI after the deadly mine explosion in West Virginia , U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Friday , news that sent the company ’s stock plummeting .

The FBI is probing the company and the circumstances surrounding the explosion which killed 29 miners , including for potential negligence , the officials said , declining further identification .
The miners died at the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal , West Virginia , on April 5 , in the worst U.S. mining disaster since 1970 .
President Barack Obama attended a memorial service for the men on Sunday and stressed the need for greater mine safety .
On April 15 , he placed primary blame for the disaster on Massey .
FBI and Justice Department officials declined to comment .
National Public Radio reported that the agency that regulates the industry , the Mine Safety and Health Administration , was also under investigation related to potential bribery , but one U.S. official denied that report .
“ We are aware that investigators are interviewing witnesses , but are not aware of the nature of their investigation , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We intend to cooperate in all phases of the accident investigation . ”
Shares of Massey Energy dropped 11 percent , or $ 4.53 , to $ 36.63 by the end of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The stock is down 33 percent since the explosion .
Another mining accident happened this week in which two miners were killed in a Kentucky mine when a roof collapsed .
Massey earlier this week accused unions of spreading a “ big lie ” that the company had traded safety for profit , and Massey director Bobby Inman dismissed calls by shareholders to remove Chief Executive Officer Don Blankenship .
Inman said Blankenship had borne the brunt of criticism for the accident at the Upper Big Branch , where the 29 miners who died were non-union , and he said firing the CEO was “ not in the cards . ”
Last week , Blankenship denied the explosion was the result of “ willful disregard ” for safety regulations but acknowledged that eight Massey mines were targets for an inspection “ blitz ” by MSHA .
Earlier the company said it will take a second - quarter charge of $ 80 million to $ 150 million to cover family benefits and costs of the blast at the mine .
“ The explosion was not caused by willful disregard for safety regulations , as the media would have you believe .
We have one of the most comprehensive safety programs , ” Blankenship told Wall Street analysts .
Organized labor has charged that Massey ’s safety record is inferior to that of most other major coal companies .
“ The big truth is that 52 people have been killed on Massey property since 2000 , ” United Mine Workers of America spokesman Phil Smith told Reuters .
“ No other coal company has had even half that . ”
One investor , CtW , has called on shareholders to vote for removal of three directors because the Upper Big Branch blast “ destroyed $ 1.1 billion in shareholder value , was preventable and occurred at a mine with an alarming record of serious violations . ”
Also , the law firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP said it has filed a class action suit on behalf of Massey shareholders charging Massey and company officers and directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act .
Maybe you can somehow forgive bankers for destroying our economy .
But the lyrics of this rap , performed at a 2006 Washington Mutual " President 's Club Dinner " in Hawaii , are unforgivable .
They were revealed at a very awkward Senate hearing today .
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is currently looking into how Washington Mutual became the largest bank failure in history .
Here is a hint :
Two years prior , someone named KATHY and " BIG BUCKS " RAPPER performed this delightful ditty set to the tune of Sir Mix - a - Lot 's " Baby Got Back " — a favorite of 13 year - olds and investment bankers everywhere .
Washington Mutual !
Frankly ,
This does not look good .
Are you bankers or participants in some awful University of Florida Business School hazing ritual ?
Did you wake up the next day , bleary - eyed and shamefully naked atop an Arby 's roof ?
Or did just go ruin the economy ?
Here is how we imagine today 's hearing went :
SEN LEVIN : Washington Mutual executives , you failed miserably and took an enormous chunk of the economy down with you .
But , you know what ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
You are free to go .
PAGE : ( Running into the meeting room . )
Wait !
Senator Levin !
Did you read this ?
It 's a horrible rap about how Washington Mutual bankers are the worst humans on earth .
SEN LEVIN : My God.
WAMU EXECS : Um ... can we go now ?
SEN LEVIN : Send all the bankers to Guantanamo Bay .
Every banker in America .
Nobody messes with Sir Mix -a - Lot.
Not on Senator Carl Levin 's watch .
Here 's the full rap , via Dealbreaker :
THIRTY years ago the bosses of America 's car industry were shocked to learn that Japan had overtaken America to become the world 's leading car producer .
They were even more shocked when they visited Japan to find out what was going on .
They found that the secret of Japan 's success did not lie in cheap labour or government subsidies ( their preferred explanations ) but in what was rapidly dubbed “ lean manufacturing ” .
While Detroit slept , Japan had transformed itself from a low - wage economy into a hotbed of business innovation .
Soon every factory around the world was lean — or a ruin .
Management gurus are always glibly proclaiming revolutions .
What happened in Japan qualified , as did the advent of mass production in America a century ago .
Now something comparable is taking place in the developing world .
It is hardly news that the world 's centre of economic gravity is shifting towards emerging markets .
Buy a mobile phone and it will almost certainly have been made in China .
Use it to phone a customer helpline and your call may well be answered by an Indian .
Over the past five years China 's annual growth rate has been more than 10 % , and India 's more than 8 % .
Yet even these figures understate the change that is taking place .
Emerging countries are no longer content to be sources of cheap hands and low - cost brains .
Instead they too are becoming hotbeds of innovation , producing breakthroughs in everything from telecoms to carmaking to health care .
They are redesigning products to reduce costs not just by 10 % , but by up to 90 % .
They are redesigning entire business processes to do things better and faster than their rivals in the West .
Forget about flat — the world of business is turning upside down .
Competing for the future
As our special report argues , the rich world is losing its leadership in the sort of breakthrough ideas that transform industries .
This is partly because rich - world companies are doing more research and development in emerging markets .
Fortune 500 companies now have 98 R&D facilities in China and 63 in India .
IBM employs more people in developing countries than in America .
But it is also because emerging - market firms and consumers are both moving upmarket .
Huawei , a Chinese telecoms giant , applied for more international patents than any other firm did in 2008 .
Chinese 20 - somethings spend even more time on the internet than do their American peers .
Even more striking is the emerging world 's growing ability to make established products for dramatically lower costs : no -frills $ 3,000 cars and $ 300 laptops may not seem as exciting as a new iPad but they promise to change far more people 's lives .
This sort of advance — dubbed “ frugal innovation ” by some — is not just a matter of exploiting cheap labour ( though cheap labour helps ) .
It is a matter of redesigning products and processes to cut out unnecessary costs .
In India Tata created the world 's cheapest car , the Nano , by combining dozens of cost - saving tricks .
Bharti Airtel has slashed the cost of providing mobile - phone services by radically rethinking its relationship with its competitors and suppliers .
It shares radio towers with rivals and contracts out network construction , operations and support to specialists such as Ericsson and IBM .
Just as Henry Ford and Toyota both helped change other industries , entrepreneurs in the developing world are applying the classic principles of division of labour and economies of scale to surprising areas such as heart operations and cataract surgery , reducing costs without sacrificing quality .
They are using new technologies such as mobile phones to bring sophisticated services , in everything from health care to banking , to rural communities .
And they are combining technological and business - model innovation to produce entirely new categories of services : Kenya leads the world in money - transfer by mobile phone , for example .
Hope versus fear
All this is obviously good news for the billions of people who live in the BRICS ( see article ) and other developing countries .
More consumers will have access to goods and services that were once confined to the elite .
More than 90 % of Indians and Chinese tell pollsters that they are optimistic about the future .
Anand Mahindra , an Indian business leader , has described his dreams about the future as “ not just colourful , but steroidal ” .
What about the slow - growth rich world ?
Emerging firms are advancing on a greater number of fronts than the Japanese did 30 years ago and also advancing much faster , gobbling up Western rivals .
Their charge will upset many established Western firms , which will face increasingly savage price competition , and also overturn many assumptions about the rich world 's competitive advantage .
Many of globalisation 's most vocal supporters have justified the loss of manufacturing jobs in the West on the ground that the rich world will maintain an edge in innovation ; the clever jobs will stay at home .
Emerging economies are not merely challenging that lead in innovation .
They are unleashing a wave of low - cost , disruptive innovations that will , as they spread to the rich world , shake many industries to their foundations .
All sorts of chief executives will scream for protection .
Change will indeed be painful for incumbents , as disruptive innovation always is .
But cheaper goods and services will be a blessing for Western consumers , who are likely to face years of slow income growth .
It could also be good news for rich - world governments , which are plagued with deficits even before the baby - boomers begin to retire .
Frugal innovation may well prevent America 's health - care system ( which already consumes 17 % of its GDP ) from swamping the rest of the economy .
Clever ways of applying economies of scale and scope in new ways could boost public - sector productivity .
Moreover , it is in the nature of innovation to feed upon itself .
Innovation in the emerging world will encourage , rather than undermine , innovation in the rich world .
Western carmakers learned the techniques of lean production from their Japanese rivals , just as the Japanese had earlier learned the techniques of mass production from the Americans .
This great insurrection , like its predecessors , will make us all richer .

When you first head off to places in the world that are a lot different from where you live , a number of things change .
You have to learn to adapt .
I still make a lot of mistakes everywhere I go , but I try to learn from each of them .
Here ’s a short list of things I wish I ’d known before I started my routine of extensive overseas travel , especially in countries in Africa , South Asia , Eastern Europe , and Latin America that are not part of the tourist circuit .
Health Care
1 . You can legally buy safe medicine , including prescription drugs , for very little money overseas .
When in Africa or Asia , I stock up on anti-malarials that cost $ 5 a day in Seattle .
On location , it ’s more like $ 1 for a 10 - day supply .
Editor 's note :
While drugs may be cheaper in other countries , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do n't recommend buying drugs while traveling as they may be counterfeit , expired , a different drug than expected or may contain too much or too little active ingredient .
Click here for more information about the CDC 's recommendations regarding counterfeit drugs and travel and here for the CDC 's recommendations about counterfeit and substandard antimalarial drugs .
2 . The best health care is not in the U.S. , Canada , or the U.K .
The best healthcare is in places like Thailand and Costa Rica ; that ’s why the practice of medical tourism will continue to surge as both travel and overseas healthcare become more accessible .
Editor 's note : Click here for information from the CDC about medical tourism .
Money
3 . Take a lot of cash with you , and make sure the bills are new and have no writing on them .
If you go to a place that accepts credit cards , then you can just redeposit the cash when you get home .
It is far worse to end up short of cash with no credit card option .
4 . If you do use your credit card , check the online statement at least once a week while traveling to make sure there are no fraudulent charges .
Keep all your receipts , especially for large purchases such as hotel stays , and compare the amounts charged when you get back .
5 . When you exchange money , hang on to the receipt you get until you ’ve left the country .
Once in a great while , someone at the airport will want to see proof of all your foreign exchanges .
Outside the Tiger 's Nest Monastery in Bhutan .
6 . The U.S. dollar is no longer the world ’s currency .
( In fact , some currency exchange shops will no longer accept dollars ! )
Travel with a stock of Euros to complement your dollars .
The exceptions to this rule include some countries in Africa and Latin America that still use the dollar as their primary currency , and any country that has had a recent war .
Taxis
7 . Hire a taxi outside the airport , not from the guys who approach you inside as you ’re walking out .
Even better , walk further outside the airport to where the taxis pull in , and you ’ll get a better deal because the driver wo n’t have to pay the entrance fee .
8 . Never assume that your taxi driver knows where your destination is .
Double - check and get him to ask someone before you go if there ’s any doubt .
9 . The universal rule of taxi haggling , for both driver and passenger , is that once both sides agree on a fare before setting off , neither side can reopen negotiations once you ’re en route .
You should not try to get a better deal nor should you accept any increase in the fare from the driver after the journey has started .
10 .
If you have a dispute with a taxi driver and you think you are being taken advantage of , offer to call the police and have them settle it .
Many taxi drivers are scared of the police , and often for good reason ( see below ) .
If they are being dishonest and you mention the police , they will quickly back down .
On the other hand , if they continue to press their claims , they may be right and you ’ll need to pay more .
Safety
11 . The police are not always your friends .
Sad but true — in a lot of places in the world , the services of the police are sold to the highest bidder .
Therefore , if you can pay them , they may turn out to be your friends … but in other cases , they may actually be the least trustworthy people in the country .
Do n’t be afraid , just be aware .
12 . When you feel pressured beyond your comfort level by someone who tries to follow you , be polite but increasingly firm .
Do n’t string anyone along out of guilt — tell them you do n’t want their help , and move on .
If they keep following you , tell them to stop .
Memorial to the Fallen in Bhutan .
13 .
When it comes to visas ( and all immigration issues ) , your experience will vary from place to place .
The rules are flexible in most places , and sometimes they will work in your favor and sometimes they will work against you .
Planes , Trains , and Buses
14 .
All plane tickets are changeable no matter what is written on them , and any fees for changing can be waived with the right airline agent .
You have a few options for making this happen : a )
Hang up and call back to try with someone else , b) Call the Premium Traveler line or ask at an airline lounge , or c ) Offer a “ tip ” at the airline counter ( do this at your own risk ) .
15 . Round - the - World tickets are the best bargains for extensive international travel .
I use and recommend both the Star Alliance and the OneWorld products .
Each have their advantages .
SkyTeam also has a Round - the - World product , but it ’s not nearly as good as the other two .
16 . Most people flying Business Class are not paying full - fare .
A high percentage of them on most flights are using awards tickets , special tickets , or have upgraded from Economy .
Flying in premium cabins can help you in more ways than just being comfortable on long flights , because the tickets can almost always be changed or refunded without penalty .
You ’ll also get to hang out in airline lounges and get priority treatment , which may become very useful when you need to get in or out of somewhere fast .
First Class is nice too , but the difference between First and Business is rarely as great as the difference between Business and Economy .
17 .
In some places , buses are better than trains for overland travel … in other places , trains are better than buses .
Check out the options before you go to make the best decision for each place .
Culture
18 . The concept of personal space means very different things in different countries .
You kind of have to get used to that .
19 .
Like it or not , you have to be somewhat tolerant of smoking .
There are lots of places in the world that have n’t picked up on the Western anti-smoking crusade .
If this is hard for you to accept , you ’ll likely be frustrated .
20 .
Unless you can be very discreet , never take photos of people without asking .
Do n’t be surprised if they say no , because many cultures are not comfortable with strangers taking photos of them all the time .
If they do say yes , you may find yourselves indebted to them for a gift or other favor .
21 . Never touch members of the opposite sex .
This includes sitting next to them on buses and trains — you ’ll often be shuffled around to ensure that you only sit next to people of the same sex , although you ’ll also usually be given the best seat .
22 . Do n’t point your feet at people or touch anyone on the head .
In several cultures , this is disrespectful or otherwise inappropriate .
23 .
Be careful with all hand gestures , including the “ thumbs - up ” sign and the “ a - OK ” sign .
Both of these are highly provocative in some places .
24 . Never make promises you do n’t intend to keep .
Do n’t tell vendors you ’ll buy from them tomorrow , do n’t offer to help anyone visit your country , do n’t say you ’ll write to someone later if you wo n’t really do it , and so on .
25 .
Most important : do n’t be a colonialist .
Be careful about calling people “ locals . ”
Do n’t assume that your culture is superior .
People are not stupid just because they do n’t speak English or think like you do .
Politics
26 .
Be prepared to represent your country , whether you care about politics or not .
For better or worse , many people will expect you to know a lot about politics in your home country and how governmental decisions in one country affect the lives of people thousands of miles away .
Do n’t say you ’re from Canada unless you really are .
27 .
Always point out that a government ’s actions and the beliefs of an individual ( e.g. , yourself ) are not always the same .
Most people understand this and some will even say the same thing without prompting , but it ’s usually a good reminder to put forward .
28 .
No matter whom you are talking to , never say anything negative about the government of the country you are in .
Many rogue states , from Zimbabwe to Iran to North Korea , employ English - speaking spies who will deliberately try to incite foreign visitors into saying something incriminating .
( I ’m not making this up .
In Guinea I was followed by the Secret Service everywhere I went .
A friend of mine went to North Korea and found an extensive tape recording system in his hotel room . )

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Lastly , remember that there are not many “ undiscovered ” places left in the world .
Focus on the places that are undiscovered to you and you wo n’t go wrong .
Obviously , each place you go to will offer unique challenges , but following this list will get you off to a good start .
Above all , do n’t forget the cardinal rule of traveling — pack light .
You really do n’t need all the extra stuff .

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Thailand took a tough stand against anti-government protesters on Sunday , rejecting demands for U.N. - supervised talks and calling on their leaders to surrender on the fourth day of deadly clashes with troops .
The government doused hopes of a compromise to end fighting that has killed at least 31 people , all civilians , and wounded 230 , transforming one of Asia ’s most dynamic cities into a battleground and raising the risk of a broader conflict .
“ We can not retreat now , ” Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a televised statement , encapsulating the government ’s all - or - nothing campaign to end two months of protests seeking to topple his fragile , ruling six - party coalition .
The mostly rural and urban poor protesters , supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra , accuse the government of colluding with the royalist elite and meddling with the judiciary to bring down two Thaksin - allied governments .
Analysts and diplomats said the military appears to have underestimated the resolve of thousands of “ red shirt ” protesters barricaded in 3 sq-km ( 1.2 sq- mile ) district of luxury hotels and shopping malls for six weeks .
“ Unless the government cracks down and does so decisively -- and that ’s a big if -- we are going to be seeing rioting and guerrilla warfare , possibly spreading out to other areas , ” said an Asian diplomat who declined to be identified .
That was already starting to happen .
A state of emergency has spread to more than a quarter of the country after emergency decrees were declared in five more provinces on Sunday , bringing the total to 22 , as violence erupted in the north and northeast , a Thaksin stronghold home to just over half of Thailand ’s 67 million people .
In Ubon Ratchathani province , protesters burned tires on several roads .
One group tried to break into a military compound but were forced back by soldiers firing guns in the air .
“ The potential for a broader civil conflict is high , ” said Federico Ferrara , a political science professor at the National University of Singapore .
“ It is conceivable they might have an even worse problem on their hands after they have ‘ cleansed ’ Bangkok of the red shirts --- especially if they have to massacre hundreds of people in the process , ” he added .
At least 60 people have died and more than 1,600 have been wounded since the red shirts began their protests in March , according to government figures .
URGE U.N. TALKS
A red shirt leader , Nattawut Saikua , called for a ceasefire and U.N. moderated talks to end the violence that began on Thursday evening with an attempted assassination on a renegade general advising the red shirts , who was shot in the head .
“ We have no other condition .
We do not want any more losses , ” he told supporters .
But the government swiftly dismissed the offer .
“ If they really want to talk , they should not set conditions like asking us to withdraw troops , ” said Korbsak Sabhavasu , the prime minister ’s secretary - general .
As fighting raged in two areas of the city of 15 million people , residents hoarded food at supermarkets , stayed indoors or fled to escape neighborhoods transformed into battlegrounds .

“ Rejection of any ceasefire talk is very ominous , ” said political scientist Vienrat Nethito at Chulalongkorn University .
“ This pretty much guarantees fighting will continue and the city will be even closer to the brink of civil war . ”
The most severe fighting took place in the Bon Kai area of Rama IV , a major artery to the business district .
Troops and snipers fired semi-automatic weapons as protesters hurled petrol bombs and burned kerosene - soaked tires to camoflauge themselves .
Intense gun shots and explosions were heard well into the night on Sunday .
A commercial building on Rama IV was ablaze .
Some wounded protesters were taken to hospital on the back of motorcycles , witnesses said , as medical rescue workers stayed clear of some of the most violent clashes after two were killed .

Monday and Tuesday were declared public holidays , but banks and financial markets would remain open .
Some women , children and the elderly at the encampment the red shirts have occupied the past six weeks are trickling into a nearby Buddhist temple for safety .
The government is seeking cooperation with protest leaders to dispatch Red Cross workers and other human rights volunteers to persuade people to leave .
“ We will not flee , ” Jatuporn Prompan , a protest leader , told supporters in their 3.5 sq-km ( 1.2 sq- mile ) encampment , where at least 5,000 remain , including women and children , barricaded behind walls of tires , poles and concrete .
Abhisit briefly threatened to impose a curfew , a rare and jarring event for a city known for raucous nightlife , saying it could help isolate the area .
Thousands of protesters were rallying in a separate area in working - class Klong Toey area near the fighting on Rama IV Road .
A new protest site would vastly complicate attempts to end the protests and resolve a crisis that has battered the economy .
ONE - SIDED BATTLE
As Bangkok braced for more unrest , many residents hoarded food and other supplies from grocery stores .
“ We do n’t know how much longer this nightmare is going to last and how far it will spread , ” said Panna Srisuwan , a Bangkok resident waiting in line at a supermarket .
“ I am stocking up for the rest of the week . ”
Soldiers can shoot if protesters come within 36 meters ( 120 ft ) of army lines , said army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd , adding more soldiers were needed to establish control .
The government insists that some of the protesters are armed with grenades and guns and showed footage on national television in an attempt to bolster their case .
Five journalists have been shot , though one escaped unwounded because the bullet deflected off his flak jacket .
Many protest leaders now face terrorism charges that carry a maximum penalty of death , raising the stakes in a crisis that has stifled Southeast Asia ’s second - biggest economy and choked investment in one of Asia ’s most promising emerging markets .
The government ’s strategy of starving protesters out of their encampment was showing signs of having an effect .
Supplies of food , water and fuel were starting to run thin as the red shirt delivery trucks were being blocked .
But red shirt leaders said they had enough to last for days .
The line between nerd and sports fan is almost invisible when you get down to it :
Is there really that much of a difference between a cosplayer wearing a bathrobe and waving a glow - stick at comic - con , and a fat high school burnout wearing a $ 200 Walter Payton throwback jersey while referring to the Bears in the first person plural ?
Whedon groupies and Jim Rome 's clone army share the same doomed wish .
But at least the jocks pine to matter in sports that actually exist .
For the rest of us , we can always dream of sports like ...

Major League Baseball 's opening - day rosters were comprised of 27.7 % foreign - born players , just shy of its all - time record ( 29.2 % in 2005 ) , MLB announced Tuesday .
There were 231 foreign players on opening - day rosters , including a record number of Venezuelans ( 58 ) .
The New York Mets lead the major leaguers with 18 foreign - born players , the most in history , MLB said , and have players from seven different countries and territories .
The Dominican Republic has the most major league players born outside the United States with 86 , followed by Venezuela , Puerto Rico ( 21 ) , Japan ( 14 ) , Canada ( 13 ) and Mexico ( 12 ) .
The percentage of foreign players could see another significant spike in coming years .
MLB reports that 48 % of current minor - league players were born outside the USA .
That 's 3,370 of 7,026 players under contract .

The Tone of the Third Millennium
The reprehensible Al - Qaeda attack on New York ( WTC ) and Washington ( Pentagon ) in the USA on Tuesday , September 11 , 2001 , set the stage for the Third Millennium in its very first year .
This audacious attack on the economic and military nerve-centres of the world ’s greatest power shook the then US President G.W. Bush and his administration such that nobody paused to think what might be the true cause .
As expected , the attacks drew retaliatory action , later named by US President G.W. Bush as the global war on terror ( GWOT ) .
This was mainly to retrieve American pride and prop up the USA ’s international image , since the intelligence services of the military and security agencies of the most powerful nation on earth were effectively deceived by a terrorist outfit .
US President G.W. Bush reckoned that civilisation was under threat and , typical of any mighty power , used USA ’s military sledgehammer to swat the Al - Qaeda mosquito .
The mosquito easily escaped even as the hammer descended , but Afghanistan was broken , and the destruction continues nine years later to this day , while all manner of costs all round keep mounting .
The sledgehammer - mosquito analogy is offered to highlight the need for appropriate tools for the task in hand .
A screw can be driven home with a hammer but it will not perform its function as a screw , while it may not at all be possible to hammer a nail with a screwdriver .
The Military ’s Nexus with Commercial Interests
Any thinking person would wonder why the USA continues to use its military in Afghanistan when everybody knows that Osama bin Laden is not in Afghanistan and is suspected to be in Pakistan .
The fact is that the USA cannot stop its own military juggernaut , because the GWOT brings huge , steady profits to industrial and business corporations that are engaged in profiteering from the bloody business of armed conflicts and wars .
Known earlier as the military industrial complex , as coined by US President Dwight Eisenhower , it has since incorporated the media , with professional journalists being embedded with military units as in the US invasion of Iraq post - 9/11 , to bring news that is vetted or controlled by the military - political commanders in the field , to the TV screens of viewers across the globe .
This is referred to as the military - industrial - media - information complex or MIMIC .
It is well understood that armed conflicts of various types and intensities the world over are supplied with arms , ammunition , weapon systems and equipment from the arms industries of various countries , and that corporate profit usually overrides national feeling because there is no God more demanding than Mammon .
[ Note 1 ]
It is also well known that the USA is the world ’s largest arms exporter and that arms export is vital for its economy .
Right from the end of World War II , the stoking of existing armed conflicts , even their creation , with or without the direct involvement of the US military , has been and remains in the corporate interests of MIMIC .
General Dwight Eisenhower , the victorious soldier freshly home from World War II , had declared :
Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies in a final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are cold and are not clothed .
This world in arms is not spending money alone .
It is spending the sweat of its labourers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children .
This is not a way of life at all in any true sense .
Under the clouds of war , it is humanity hanging on an iron cross ...
I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can , only as one who has seen its brutality , its futility , its stupidity .
However , as the US President later , he was powerless to stop the MIC juggernaut .
An earlier , revealing account of the influence of commercial and banking corporations on the US Government to send US troops abroad to acquire , protect or consolidate corporate interests is contained in a book titled War is a Racket by Major General Smedley Butler of the US Marine Corps .

Technology for War by Remote Control
Famous World War II US General George Patton was credited with having advised his troops that a good soldier does not die for his country , but makes the enemy soldier die for his own country .
Of course , he said it in much more colourful , unprintable language , but it is impeccable advice in a purely military - versus - military context .
However in present times , the USA uses hi-tech weapons and weapon systems to save its troops on the ground at the cost of indiscriminately inflicting disproportionate , horrendous casualties upon the opponent ’s civilians .
In Afghanistan , targeting the Al - Qaeda or Taliban fighters most often results in killing large numbers of innocent civilians .
The loss of a single US soldier to the Al - Qaeda or Taliban action draws immediate and harsh retribution on civilians on mere suspicion of harbouring the fighters .
Military action against civilian populations using state - of - the - art technology of the times was started by Britain and the USA during World War II against Germany and Japan .
Even though these attacks have been justified by the winning side , the fact remains that indiscriminate and even deliberate targeting of civilians was ordered by the Allied Forces during World War II .
The Examples are the firebombing of German cities by British and US air forces , and US firebomb attacks on Japanese cities culminating in nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
But this continued even after World War II .
The US military used napalm and Agent Orange ( gas ) in Vietnam , and carpet - bombed Cambodia with over 2.75 million tons of explosive to disrupt the North Vietnamese People ’s Liberation Army ’s logistics , killing around 150,000 Cambodian civilians ( 1969 - 1973 ) .
More recently , in 1991 the US military used depleted uranium artillery projectiles in Iraq , and in 2001 in Afghanistan , dropped “ Daisy - cutter ” bombs and BLU - 82 bombs ( explosive equivalent to tactical nuclear weapons ) on civilians with devastating effect .
The use of hi-tech by the US military is making killing increasingly easy from remote , safe , comfortable locations , disconnecting soldiers from the harsh realities of death and destruction .
The deployment of remotely - controlled unmanned aircraft ( drones ) in Afghanistan for surveillance and missile attack is enabling the USA to project power without vulnerability , killing without risk .
Which is all very well , except that General George Patton may not approve were he still alive , because those being killed are civilians unconnected with the conflict .
The young soldier remote - controlling a drone mission in Afghanistan may be sitting in a bunker half way across the globe in Nevada , USA , chewing gum as he punches a button on a joystick that launches a missile , much as he did in violent video games a few years earlier .
He would go home to a hot dinner and a comfortable bed after having carried out a missile attack on a suspected safe haven that killed innocent civilians in a marriage party .
[ Ref 1 ]
The US military plans to have 50 drones operating at a time in 2011 against 38 in 2009 , and is said to be currently training more drone pilots , than pilots for manned combat aircraft .
[ Ref 1 , 2 ]
This is aimed at minimising physical casualties to troops on the ground , by waging an electronic , troop - less war in Afghanistan .
No nation would like its soldiers to die or be maimed .
But such remote - controlled killing [ which also includes remote - controlled or pre-programmed robotic infantry ( Note 3 ) ] raises moral , ethical and legal questions especially concerning command and control responsibility for civilian casualties and property destruction , and the need to redefine collateral damage and friendly fire .
Besides , such attacks are increasingly turning civilian populations against the USA ’s invading military .
Whatever the intention of James Cameron ’s award - winning movie Avatar , it was possibly inspired by presently available and on - the - drawing - board hi-tech weaponry , and shows the worms - eye view of the inhabitants of Pandora resisting occupation by a US corporate - owned military .
Need for a Military
From militias of frontiersmen used against native Americans and competing European powers like the French , to a regular Army and Navy to dominate Central and South America , the 20th Century saw US military presence on every continent .
The USA did not own territory outside North America until 1898 , but the US military as an extension of US diplomacy was deployed to secure the USA ’s economic interests abroad .
The current US military global presence on land , on and under the sea , in air and in space , is seen as a beneficial by some countries , as strong - arm politics by some others , as a threat or an enemy by yet others .
In the contemporary world , every country needs a defensive military to secure its territorial integrity , national sovereignty and economic interests .
But even though the US military is administered by the USA ’s Department of Defence , there are those who argue that it has more of an offensive role , while the USA justifies its global military presence as the obvious measure to protect its national interests which have spread across the globe .
This is viewed as hubris in many quarters .
US President Truman had approved the formation of seven unified combatant commands ( UCCs ) way back in 1946 soon after the end of World War II , and created the Alaskan , Atlantic Fleet , Carribean , European , Far East , Northeast and Pacific Commands .
USA ’s War Machine
The USA is widely acknowledged as the world ’s premier democracy .
In spite of its past of slavery and massacre of native Americans , and its short - comings of colour , racial and gender discrimination , and the power of wealth over voice , successive US Administrations since 1776 have been democratically elected .
And the US military is under civilian control , as it should be in a democracy .
Thus , successive US administrations have been responsible for the USA ’s global military operations .
Presently the USA has about 700 military bases , stations and installations ( for combat or communications - surveillance - intelligence functions ) in 63 countries around the globe , with about 250,000 military personnel deployed abroad out of a 1.4 million - strong military .
The total land occupied by US military bases within and outside the USA is estimated at about 2.5 million hectares , making it one of the largest land owners in the world .
The US military divides the world into six regions , each under a UCC with military command and control responsibility .
Each of these six UCCs spans large swathes of global longitude and latitude : the Africa Command or AFRICOM ( HQ in Germany ) ; Central Command or USCENTCOM ( HQ in Florida , USA ) ; European Command or USEUCOM ( HQ in Germany ) ; Pacific Command or USPACOM ( HQ in Honolulu , USA ) ; Northern Command or USNORTHCOM ( HQ in Colorado , USA ) ; Southern Command or USSOUTHCOM ( HQ in Florida , USA ) .
Besides these six UCCs , there are four more UCCs with functional responsibilities , headquartered in USA : Joint Forces Command ( USJFCOM ) ; Special Operations Command ( USSOCOM ) ; Strategic Command ( USSTRATCOM ) and ; Transportation Command ( USTRANSCOM ) .
Each UCC commander maintains contact with all national governments and their militaries in his region of responsibility , under orders of the US President to whom he is directly answerable , and his Secretary of Defense .
For example , the area of responsibility of the USPACOM includes India and China , extending from around 40 degrees north latitude to include Australia and Antartica , while the USEUCOM includes not only all of Europe but extends to the eastern end of Russia at Vladivostok , spanning 180 degrees of longitude , and the AFRICOM covers the whole African continent .
The USCENTCOM is possibly the most busy command right now since it includes the Middle East and parts of Central Asia and Africa , and includes Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan , prosecuting USA ’s much - vaunted global war on terror ( GWOT ) .
This integrated network of military bases , stations and installations covers not only the global landmass , oceans and air space but also outer space .
With such global responsibility to maintain liaison and project the USA ’s unmatched military power to enforce its economic and political interests , the UCC ’s Commanding General or Admiral is in effect a US political entity in addition to being a military commander responsible for operations , intelligence and logistics .
All military operations do not necessarily include hostilities ; the UCC commander is well placed to prosecute USA ’s GWOT , which is as much a political war as it is military in character .
MIMIC holds economic , social and political control at a global level , and the extremely powerful and unmatched US military is its enforcer .
Virtually every US President after World War II , has been under the influence or even control of MIMIC , and orders direct or indirect military interventions to further US interests , which are inextricably linked with MIMIC interests .
Strategy may be largely based on periodic assessment of threat levels from people and organisations at various points on the globe that adversely affect US interests .
Thus , even democratically elected political leaders in nations across the globe , who may have been thwarting US strategic plans , have been overthrown by the US military or CIA intervention ; there are abundant examples in the open literature .
The coup d’etat in Iran ( 1953 ) was to support the corporate interests of British - owned Anglo - Iranian Oil Company , demons - trating how corporate interests can be congruent with national strategic interests .
The Plan for the New American Century ( PNAC ) formulated by a think - tank during US President Clinton ’s tenure is possibly the global strategy which is now playing out .
The USA ’s war machine has been growing in lethality since World War II ( the war - to - end - all - wars , a pious aim that has been belied several times over ) , and is increasingly being deployed worldwide , at enormous financial and economic cost to the USA itself , and enormous human , social and economic cost to all other countries worldwide , especially those which are at the focus of the USA ’s military attentions .
The tangible and intangible , irreversible or irretrievable global ecological costs of warfare and armed conflict need to be addressed elsewhere .
USA ’s Wars over the Centuries
The USA ’s military history begins with its independence from the British crown , declared in July 1776 .
At that time , there was no regular military in North America apart from the British and French .
The US military started in 1775 as a volunteer , non-professional body called the Continental Army under George Washington , fired by the idea of independence , taking to arms against the British .
But soon enough , the USA created its own professional military paid for from taxes , to consolidate expansion into the lands of the Native American tribes and establish dominance within North America .
The US military came under civilian control when the Continental Army was disbanded soon after the American revolution and its Commander - in - Chief , George Washington , resigned in deference to the wishes of elected officials .
In the late 19th Century , the US military was engaged in the Spanish - American War ( 1898 ) and the Philippines - American War ( 1899 - 1902 ) , both for territory and economic control .
It also joined an international force to suppress a movement among the Chinese people in mainland China ( the so - called Boxer Rebellion ) protesting commercial , religious and political interference by the Western trading nations in China .
The US military had regular engagements of varying scale in Central America from the end of the 19th Century right upto the middle of the 20th Century .
It entered World War I ( 1914 - 1918 ) in Europe in 1917 and played a decisive role starting December 1941 , in World War II ( 1939 - 1945 ) in Europe , Africa , Asia and the Pacific — around 16 million American soldiers ( 13 per cent of the US population at the time ) served , with around 400,000 killed .
World War II was a turning point for the US military , which had proved itself as second to none in the dangerous and difficult situations of pitched battles .
But it was not just the performance of the US military , but the USA ’s industrial might that supplied the US military and the militaries of its allies , the precursor of the military - industrial complex , which made the USA an undisputed military power .
The USA ’s material supply for the war effort was made on condition of gold bullion payment by its European allies and , with nearly 80 per cent of the world ’s gold possessed by USA , it also became an undisputed economic power .
The USA ’s superpower status was the combination of undisputed economic and military power .
This superpower status saw the US military getting involved in engagements principally to contain the spread of communism emanating from the USSR and China , but also to secure US resource bases ( mainly oil , but also mineral and other raw materials ) and its market interests .
The strategy was one of military and economic encirclement of the USSR and China .
A lot of science and technology research , much of it by funding universities , and enormous military expenditures were justified to the people of the USA by quoting the communist threat .
But after the collapse of the USSR in 1989 , instead of reducing its military , the military actually expanded to press home the USA ’s economic and political agendas on a global scale .
Two major engagements of the US military in the Cold War period ( 1945 - 1991 ) were the Korean War and the Vietnam War .
The Korean War , starting in 1950 , was fought to a stalemate in 1953 , and US troops are even today stationed in South Korea .
The Vietnam War ( 1957 - 1975 ) saw major US military involvement starting 1964 in South Vietnam , but went on to include adjoining Cambodia and Laos .
Other engagements in the same period in which the US military has taken part with few troops but with huge political effect because of political pressure and intelligence , are Lebanon ( 1958 ) , Dominican Republic ( 1975 ) , Teheran hostage rescue ( 1980 ) , Grenada ( 1983 ) , Beirut ( 1983 ) and Panama ( 1989 ) .
In the post -Cold War period ( 1991 - 2001 ) , the US military was committed in Iraq for what is known as the Gulf War starting January 1991 .
The actual fighting was over in just 100 days , but the US military has remained on the ground and at sea and in the air around Iraq .
There was also US military presence in Somalia ( 1992 ) and Yugoslavia ( 1999 ) .
The year 2001 was a military watershed for the whole world because of the 9/11 attack , and the period 2001 to date concerns the on - going global war on terror or GWOT .
The US military invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban government in retaliation for the 9/11 attack , and continues as an occupation force even today .
In Iraq ( 1994 ) , the USA fielded 250,000 troops on the ground .
The USA sent 2000 troops to the Philippines ( 2002 ) to assist in quelling the Al - Qaeda - linked terrorists , and made a show of power in Liberia ( 2003 ) , deploying the US Navy off - shore .
The internet yields a staggering list of dozens of US military engagements on every continent over the decades starting 1898 . [ Ref 3 ]
The late Chinese leader Mao Tse Tung ( Mao Zedong ) of the Long March fame had said , among many other quotable quotes , that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun and war is the continuation of politics by other means .
These may be interpreted to mean that politics is war without bloodshed and war is politics with bloodshed .
Had Mao been alive today , he would be gratified to learn that the USA has wholeheartedly adopted his dictum .
Costs of USA ’s Global Military Operations
The prosecution of war needs huge financial support .
The USA ’s annual expenditure on its military now nears $ 1 trillion ( about four per cent of its GDP ) , up from $ 360 billion in 1998 .
That works out to around $ 2.5 billion per day .
This is about 50 per cent of the entire world ’s military expenditure and 2.5 per cent of world GDP .
Needless to say , this expenditure benefits the manufacturers of weapons and armaments ; corporations that supply materials , real - time intelligence and logistics to US forces at home and in the field , and corporations that conduct research to produce , test , advertise and deliver ever more destructive weapons and weapon systems — in short , the USA ’s MIMIC .
The costs are internally borne by the US soldiery and their families through death and permanent physical and psychological disabilities , and by the people of the USA by taxes and reduced welfare and social expenditure .
The USA ’s mounting debt burden due to military spending cannot but fall on the shoulders of its future generations .
It is interesting that US legislators staunchly oppose cuts in defence spending that affect their constituencies .
Of the costs in the countries where war is waged , the less said the better , because it exceeds the USA ’s internal costs by orders of magnitude in every conceivable manner .
In terms of affordability to the USA , Chalmers Johnson , Professor Emeritus of the University of California at San Diego , went so far as to say in 2008 , still using US President Eisenhower ’s term of MIC :
... Congress has been corrupted by the military - industrial complex into believing that , by voting for more defense spending , they are supplying jobs for the economy .
In fact they are only diverting scarce resources from the desperately needed rebuilding of the Americam infrastructure and other crucial spending necessities into utterly wasteful munitions .
If we can not cut back our longstanding , ever increasing military spending in a major way , then the bankruptcy of the United States is inevitable .
As the current Wall Street meltdown has demonstrated , that is no longer an abstract possibility but a growing likelihood .
Conclusion
The USA is a society that needs enormous resources to keep it going at its present very high levels of consumption .
( It is estimated that the USA ’s has about six per cent of the global population , but consumes around 40 per cent of global resources ) .
Securing these resources is vital for the USA , and because resources are spread all over the globe , USA has global interests , and has designed its military accordingly , to literally keep an eye on all social , economic and political activities around the globe .
Any real or perceived threat or attack on US interests will be spotted immediately and economic , political or military action taken to eliminate the threat or destroy the attacker — US President G.W. Bush ’s pre-emptive war .
Of course , whether this policy succeeds or not , MIMIC laughs all the way to the bank .
And the world has seen how Osama bin Laden and other Al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders continue plotting against USA .
With depleting oil reserves and peak oil production already past , and an anticipated shortage of water , food , and biological resources especially with on - going global warming and climate change , competition for resources will only intensify .
In that scenario , the more powerful will snatch and grab resources by economic or military force .
The USA is militarily well poised for such a situation , but whether it ( and indeed the international community , which lends money to the USA , the world ’s biggest debtor nation ) can sustain such an expensive military in view of its declining economic status , and if so for how long , is debatable .
Without a doubt , USA has the most powerful military ever , which cannot be defeated by any other military of the world today ; a veritable Goliath , straddling the globe like a colossus .
[ Note 4 ]
But all man-made institutions , like living beings , are created , grow , mature , decline and fall , according to the remorseless law of entropy — the US military cannot be an exception .
It is only a matter of when and how the mighty fall and what will fall with it .
Will this Goliath fall under the weight of domestic economic burden or serious mistakes committed due to arrogance ?
Or will some David fell it with a stone from a slingshot ?
And what else may be hurt by the fall ?

On that issue , and on her written warnings of a “ humanitarian catastrophe ” in the invasion ’s wake , she said that Mr. Blair had effectively circumvented cabinet debate .
Instead , she said , he had relied on an inner circle of “ his mates ” in government , having “ little chats ” with outsiders like herself and plying what she called a “ poodle - like ” relationship with the United States .
She also accused Mr. Blair of deceit in his argument shortly before the invasion that France had said that it would veto a so - called “ second resolution ” in the United Nations Security Council approving military action against Iraq , and that it would not shift from that position under any circumstances .
That allowed Mr. Blair to say he had exhausted the diplomatic possibilities for dealing with Mr. Hussein and cleared the way for fulfilling his pledge to fight at America ’s side .
“ That was , in my view , a deliberate lie , ” Ms. Short said .
“ It was one of the big deceits . ”
She said the truth was that that the French president at the time , Jacques Chirac , could have been persuaded to back military action if London and Washington had been prepared to give United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq more time .
“ There was no emergency ; no one had attacked anyone , ” she said .
“ There was n’t any new W.M.D , ” she added , referring to weapons of mass destruction .
“ We could have taken the time and got it right . ”
There was little surprise in Ms. Short ’s bitterness toward Mr. Blair , whose relations with the former minister had long been strained by her role as a left - wing firebrand within the governing Labour Party .
The more damaging element in her testimony might prove to be her revelations about the equivocal role played in the approach to the war by Mr. Blair ’s successor as prime minister , Gordon Brown , who was then Britain ’s finance minister and deeply estranged from Mr. Blair .
AN elite North Korean suicide squad of human torpedoes may have been involved in the sinking of a South Korean ship in mysterious circumstances .
South Korea 's Defence Intelligence Command had alerted the Navy weeks ahead of the sinking that North Korean suicide squads were being deployed , according to reports in Seoul , Sky News reports
The " Human torpedo " squads were said to involve small submarines , Sky News reports .
They are navigated so close to the target that their torpedoes or explosives blow up both target and the attackers .
They can also be timed to explode while the attackers escape from the vessel , the mass - circulation South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported .
The attack by North Korea on the 1200 - tonne Cheonan claimed the lives of more than 40 sailors and was in retaliation for an earlier naval defeat , the report added .
" It is the military intelligence 's assessment that the North attacked with a heavy torpedo , " a military source was quoted as saying by the news agency Yonhap .
" The military intelligence has made the report to the Blue House - the Presidential residence - and to the Defence Ministry immediately after the sinking of the Cheonan that it is clearly the work of North Korea 's military , " the source added .
South Korea now plans to raise the front half of the Cheonan , which went down near a disputed sea border with North Korea .
It will issue its verdict on the cause of the explosion that sank the warship after that .
If Pyongyang did carry out the attack it would be the deadliest confrontation between the two countries since the Korean War ended in 1953 .
The North has denied it had anything to do with the sinking .

In a pattern that is becoming all too familiar – naturopath Christopher Maloney has allegedly forced the shutdown of a blog that was critical of his medical advice .
Student Michael Hawkins wrote in the Kennebec Journal :
Naturopathic medicine is pure bull .
Let ’s not beat around the bush on this one .
Those who practice naturopathy are quacks .
They may be sincere quacks , but sincerity does not translate to evidence — or your health .
He expressed similar views on his blog , which was hosted by WordPress .
Maloney allegedly responded with the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) maneuver , not by defending his claims , but by complaining about the content of Hawkins ’ blog to WordPress , who responded by demanding that Hawkins censor his criticism .
Hawkins apparently made changes , but not sufficient to please the WordPress censors , and so they shut him down .
( Note – Maloney claims he never complained to WordPress and had nothing to do with the shutdown . )
By now you should know what happens next – fellow science and reality - based bloggers ( most notably PZ Myers ) got wind of the story and decided to amplify Hawkins ’ criticism by many orders of magnitude .
What sparked Hawkins ’ criticism of Maloney was this article , also in the Kennebec Journal , that was nothing but a thinly - veiled advertisement for Maloney ’s practice , in which Maloney wrote :
It will have no effect on deadly complications in any population group ( Cochrane ) .
No study of flu vaccinations has shown any benefit for children under 2 , and every year half of those killed from vaccine side effects are under 2 years old .
( Cochrane and CDC data for the last 10 years ) .
Those promoting vaccination should provide published research to inform patients .
Parents waiting for vaccinations can provide their children with black elderberry , which blocks the H1N1 virus .
A single garlic capsule daily cuts in half the incidence and the severity of a flu episode for children .
Maloney pulls the typical CAM fast one here .
First he disparages the efficacy of the flu vaccine , then scaremongers about side effects , without providing any actual numbers .
I prefer this summary of flu vaccine efficacy by Mark Crislip .
Mark acknowledges that this is a complex question without a simple yes / no answer .
The flu vaccine is not a great vaccine , as vaccines go , but it does have efficacy , and clear benefit in excess of risk .
Serious vaccine reactions are “ very rare ” , according to the same CDC sources that Maloney is apparently referring to .
Life threatening adverse events occur on the order of 1/100,000 to 1/1 million injections .
Meanwhile , 30,000 or so people die each year from the flu .
After Maloney cherry picks information to scaremonger about the flu vaccine , he then recommends elderberry and garlic .
Ironically , he exhorts mainstream practitioners offering the flu vaccine to provide published research – then he recommends two treatments without reference to published research .
Let ’s take a look at the published research , shall we .
First – elderberry contains chemicals ( specifically flavonoids ) that have pharmacological activity .
So there is some plausibility for biological activity .
And in fact there are in vitro studies showing that flavonoids from elderberry extract have anti-H1N1 flu virus activity .
But , as I discussed just yesterday , it is not appropriate to extrapolate from such basic science data to net clinical effects .
If these flavonoids turn out to be useful , it will be because they are isolated , purified , and then studied in specific doses – in other words , just like any other drug .
Perhaps this will lead to the development of the next Tamiflu .
Meanwhile , I would recommend using Tamiflu – which as already been purified and studied clinically .
There is also one clinical study showing some effect , but this is a small and preliminary study .
Most such preliminary studies will turn out to be wrong , when larger better studies are done .
We have been through this with just about every popular herbal remedy , from echinacea to gingko biloba – early studies showing promise followed by large definitive studies that are dead negative .
So , in essence , black elderberry shows promise as an eventual source for an anti-viral treatment , but it is still preliminary and therefore unreliable .
So Maloney is recommending a treatment with unreliable evidence ( one small study ) in favor of one with far more evidence ( literally hundreds of studies and thousands of published papers ) .
My PubMed search on “ garlic ” and “ flu ” or “ influenza ” gave 7 results total .
There was only one paper that looked like a clinical study – a Japanese paper from 1973 ( unfortunately no abstract is available online ) .
Maloney ’s website has this to say :
Volunteers taking garlic capsules had half as many flus , and the flus were half as long .
Adv Ther. 2001 Jul - Aug;18(4) :189-93
But the reference cited was for the common cold – NOT the flu .
Apparently , naturopathic training did not prepare Maloney to distinguish the cold from influenza .
Further , Maloney is massively cherry picking ( even from evidence not relevant to the question ) .
A Cochrane review of garlic for the common cold concluded :
There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold .
A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold , but more studies are needed to validate this finding .
Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor quality evidence .
Once again we see the reliance on cherry picked weak evidence that may not even be relevant to the clinical question , while disparaging science - based treatments .
This is the standard of science within naturopathy .
Conclusion
Hawkins was correct to criticize Maloney and his claims .
Maloney , rather than defend his views , decided to silence criticism , and WordPress should be ashamed for caving to such obvious censorship of important public debate .
But in our brave new world at least there are science - based outlets that will not let criticism of pseudoscience be silenced .
Thanks to PZ for bringing this to wider attention .
Addendum :
This story developed rather quickly yesterday .
We now know that it is Andreas Mortiz who is threatening lawsuits against Hawkins , and now PZ Myers as well , as an intimidation tactic .

What 's one way the American and Chinese economy are the same ?
Both have a problematic dependence on foreign oil .
Thing is , for China this dependence is soaring .
Hellenic Shipping News :
In the first quarter of 2010 , China 's dependence on imported oil reached 54.5 percent , hitting a new high , according to a report released by the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association .
The report showed that China 's apparent oil consumption in the first quarter totaled 106 million tons , 17 percent higher year - on - year .
Apparent consumption of natural gas increased 19 percent to 26.4 billion cubic meters .
It is notable that China 's dependence on imported oil was 54.5 percent in the first quarter .
The figure exceeded 50 percent for the first time in 2009 .
Last year , China produced 189 million tons of crude oil , and net crude oil import was 199 million tons .
China is rapidly approaching America 's level of foreign oil dependence , which is 57 % according to the EIA .
Given the trends for both nations , we should expect China to surpass America 's level of dependence in the near future .
If the leadership debates were supermarkets – which they 're not – ITV's would be Tesco , Sky 's would be Morrisons , and the BBC 's offering would be Waitrose .
The ITV debate felt like a 1990s gameshow whose rules required Alastair Stewart to bellow " Mr Clegg ! " , " Mr Brown ! " or " Mr Cameron ! " every thirty seconds ; the Sky studio was a poky black cave cluttered with discarded British Airways tail fins and dwarfed by an immense Sky logo .
With its mix of cavernous space and high - tech backdrops , the BBC debate resembled a cross between Songs of Praise and current Saturday night talent - show splurge Over the Rainbow : I half expected the loser to hand his shoes to Dimbleby at the end before jetting off into the sky on a rocket - powered podium .
The chief topic was the economy , a subject upon which I have such a poor grasp that from my ignorant perspective all three men may as well have been debating the best way to kidnap a space wraith .
Cameron proposed ' efficiency savings ' which seemed to boil down to a war on unnecessary leaflets ; Brown boomed that this would shrink the economy by £ 6bn and risk a double - dip recession .
Clegg did n't care what happened as long as it was fair .
He proposed some kind of cross-party economic fairness committee which , as secret fellowships go , sounds about as much fun as a cardboard - licking party .
Clegg was big on fairness generally .
Fairness and difference .
He used so many distancing tactics – references to " these two " , phrases like " there they go again " , constant calls to " get beyond political point - scoring " – he may as well have thrown in a " hark at these arseholes " at the end for good measure .
It 's a tactic that largely works : he sometimes came across as a slightly exasperated translator sadly explaining to his fellow earthmen in the audience that these two visiting Gallifreyan dignitaries were well - meaning but essentially wrong .
Brown 's ears are amazing .
I think they 're made out of sausages .
And he still can't smile properly , which is hardly surprisinggiven his ongoing luck allergy .
Following the overblown ' bigotgate ' media piss - fight , which saw him force - fed fistfuls of shame , it was vaguely impressive to see him standing at a podium instead of screaming on a ledge .
Just as Cameron likes to shoehorn the " change " meme into every sentence ( or rather did , before Cleggmania flared up ) , so Brown mentioned " the same old Conservative Party " so many times he began to sound like a novelty anti-Tory talking keyring .
According to some polls , Cameron won , or at the very least tied with Clegg .
Which is odd , because to my biased eyes , he looked hilariously worried whenever the others were talking .
He often wore a face like the Fat Controller trying to wee through a Hula Hoop without splashing the sides , in fact .
Perhaps that 's just the expression he pulls when he 's concentrating , in which case it 's fair to say he'd be the first prime minister in history who could look inadvertently funny while pushing the nuclear button .

Barry Farber was brought into my organization to highlight the “ Top Down Selling ” strategy .
At first there was a skepticism amongst the sales reps .
How do we go straight to the top and not “ sell ” anything and even more ensure we can get close to an appointment … with someone …. anyone ?
We were assigned to make a list of our dream accounts and to find out who the CEO was and a few fun facts about them .
After my first visit with Barry all skepticism was GONE .
We walked right in asked for the CEO like we knew him for years .
When the CEO walked out we discussed his recent interview with Inc. magazine on his personal journey to get the coveted top spot and what he learned during the process .
The conversation was effortless pulling challenges that I have faced as an individual starting out in an entrepreneurial type position and how he has overcome most of the same challenges .
He was impressed at the research we did and actually thanked us .
At the very end of the conversation the CEO asked of course , “ and what is it that you do . ”
At that point I gave him my value proposition and his response was oh , you must meet my IT director who is in charge of those decisions .
IT WAS BRILLIANT !
I have never had to work so little to get an appointment and with the exact person I needed at that .
Every stop after that went the same way .
Everyone should be taught this in sales 101 .
On a teeming street in Mumbai's Dharavi slum , amid a colorful swirl of sweet lime carts and red-clay pottery , Pastor Bala Singh brings an assortment of buckets to retrieve his daily ration of water .
The indoor spigot he uses provides water only three hours a day .
It is the only source for the six small homes on his street , and each family has 30 minutes to fill its containers .
Pastor Singh is not complaining , though .
Things are greatly improved from when he first immigrated to Dharavi – the most crowded part of one the world 's most crowded cities .
" The roads were muddy , " he says from his second - floor office , above the popping sizzle of a man welding , sans protective gear , downstairs .
" Now they put down bricks . "
Singh ministers to a small congregation that meets above the church - sponsored kindergarten where his wife has taught for 17 years .
Though relatives have begged him to come home to Tamil Nadu , 700 miles east , he has no plans to leave .
" Three times I tried to go back to my native place , " the pastor says , explaining that there were no jobs there .
" I do n't want to live here ... but God 's plan is different . "
Singh 's migration to the city , a combination of divine impulsion and the simple need to work , is part of what could be called an epic trend affecting billions of people worldwide .
Sometime in 2007 , for the first time in human history , more people began to live within the cacophonous swirl of cities than in rural hamlets or on countryside farms .
It 's a fundamental shift that may be altering the very fabric of human life , from the intimate , intricate structures of individual families to the massive , far - flung infrastructures of human civilizations .
In 1950 , fewer than 30 percent of the world 's 2.5 billion inhabitants lived in urban regions .
By 2050 , almost 70 percent of the world 's estimated 10 billion inhabitants – or more than the number of people living today – will be part of massive urban networks , according to the Population Division of the United Nations ' Department of Economic and Social Affairs .
These staggering statistical trends are driving the evolution of the " megacity , " defined as an urban agglomeration of more than 10 million people .
Sixty years ago there were only two : New York / Newark and Tokyo .
Today there are 22 such megacities – the majority in the developing countries of Asia , Africa , and Latin America – and by 2025 there will probably be 30 or more .
Consider just India .
Though the country is still largely one of villagers – about 70 percent of India 's 1.2 billion inhabitants live in rural areas – immigration and internal migrations have transformed it into a country with 25 of the 100 fastest - growing cities worldwide .
Two of them , Mumbai ( Bombay ) and Delhi , already rank among the top five most populous urban areas .
In the " developed " countries of the West , this trend had been building since the Industrial Revolution , which sparked , relatively quickly , the exponential growth of cities seen today .
The quest for " efficiency " and the corresponding divisions of labor generated technological innovations that obliterated the need for farm laborers and local artisans .
This drove populations from the country to the city over time and transformed the plow and the hoe into mere tools for backyard gardeners .
Today , on average , 3 out of 4 people living in modern industrialized states are already building their lives within an urban area – a ratio that will jump to more than 5 in 6 by 2050 .
By contrast , today in the least - developed regions of the world , more than 2 out of 3 people still eke out a living in a rural area .
For these people , even the slumdog existence in places like Dharavi can offer more opportunities than their villages ever could .
And within these developing regions , according to UN - HABITAT , cities are gaining an average of 5 million new residents – per month .
" Most of these [ urban immigrants ] could n't earn cash in their rural situations , " says Chuck Redman , director of the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University in Tempe .
" There 's not as much of a cash economy there , but they still want cash to buy radios and mobile phones or TVs – or even send their kids to school , which costs money in many of these countries . "
Call it the lag of modernity :
The changes wrought by industrialization began slowly 200 years ago , accelerated through the 20th century in the West , and now are spreading exponentially around the globe .
Many observers see great promise in this urbanizing trend :
The efficiencies of cities can cut energy consumption up to 20 percent , transportation costs for goods and labor can drop significantly , and entertainment industries can thrive when millions live together .
In other words , cities are giant cash machines , the primary locus of economic growth .
" Some companies look at this as a huge opportunity , " says Fariborz Ghadar , director of Penn State 's Center for Global Business Studies and the author of a book on megacities .
" We 're going to build roads , we 're going to build buildings , and [ tech companies ] love this because you can put the Internet in concentrated cities much more efficiently . "
Yet , as megacities evolve in the developing world , many groan under the weight of a sudden , massive , and unprecedented demand for services never seen in the West .
The basic necessities of clean water , of sanitation systems to remove megatons of garbage and human waste , of transportation systems to shuttle millions of workers , not to mention the need for electrical networks , health - care facilities , and policing and security , are , simply put , creating one of the greatest logistical challenges ever seen in human history .
And this is even before factoring in the challenges of climate change , terrorism , and the preservation of human dignity .
Mexico City : on a bowl of pudding
An orange metal elevator heads deep into the bowels of Mexico City , where a crew of technicians and engineers is inspecting a 900 - ton machine , longer than a football field , that burrows through a muddy mélange of rock , silt , and water .
It 's the first stage of the city 's plan to build a massive new tunnel that officials hope will relieve the pressures on Mexico City 's drainage system .
Nearly 1,000 feet into the passageway , made up of adjacent rings each composed of concrete slabs weighing some 4 tons each , the air is thin .
Oxygen roars in through a tube , providing relief for those working on the project 's edge .
Workers crawl along scaffolding , crouching under an Erector Set of tanks and pipes that pump out water and hurl the deep - earth 's rock and mud to the surface .
Their task is to prevent large portions of Mexico City , one of the world 's most populous megacities , from catastrophic flooding .
The area 's growing population has placed demands on water supplies that are simply unsustainable .
Its 20 million residents have laid down an urban jungle that obstructs water from naturally filtering into the ground .
Today , the city is sucking up water from the natural aquifers at twice the rate they are being replenished .
The result : Mexico City is sinking , in some areas up to 16 inches a year , threatening its entire infrastructure .
This includes the city 's deteriorating drainage system , whose capacity has diminished by 30 percent since 1975 while the area 's population has doubled .
" It 's an alarming situation , " says Felipe Arreguin , the technical general subdirector at Mexico 's National Water Commission ( Conagua ) , which is building the drainage tunnel .
" We are taking [ out ] so much water , the city is sinking .
What if an entire block were to go under ? "
It nearly has .
In 2007 , a giant sinkhole swallowed a large swath of a busy street .
At Revolution Monument , a water pipe installed over 75 years ago now stands near nearly 30 feet above ground .
Given Mexico
City 's history as a " floating city " in the middle of a lake , it 's no surprise that water is what vexes most urban planners here .
When the Spaniards arrived to conquer the great Aztec Empire , the mode of transportation was not horses but canoes .
Today , the city sits essentially on a bowl of pudding .
Jose Miguel Guevara , the general coordinator for water supply and drainage projects at Conagua , calls this basin a giant " saucepan , " with no natural exit for the torrential rains that fall each year .
But these drainage problems and the corresponding threats of catastrophic flooding belie one of the great ironies of its urban plumbing .
When it comes to water , the city is also facing the kind of shortages that plague the rest of the globe .
Mexico City , which sits at an altitude of over 7,300 feet , must pump water up 3,000 feet to reach residents .
Last year it had to ration water after one of the worst droughts in six decades .
The drainage program includes plans for treatment plants to turn runoff into clean water for use by farmers .
These problems , and the enormously complex engineering and plumbing challenges they create , reveal a much larger global concern .
Like Mexico
City , megacities around the world must find ways to control runoff while providing clean water for millions of inhabitants .
With 1.1 billion people – or 18 percent of the world 's population – now lacking access to safe drinking water , according to the World Health Organization , governments of developing countries need the money and know - how to build massive public works .
In São Paulo , Brazil , for instance , planners are struggling to cope with a drainage system that was built when the city was a fraction of its current size .
Poor maintenance has left much of it clogged , while forest and parkland have given way to haphazard housing in many areas of the world 's third - largest city .
Now there are fewer green areas to soak up incessant rains .
" Irregular construction and expansion have taken place in areas that the rain runs into , and , as the weather has been so bad over the last six months , these areas that act as natural reservoirs have become flooded , " says state meteorologist Marcelo Schneider .
" Now they are occupied , but people should n't really be there .
It is the poor that suffer . "
Beijing :
The commute that never ends
Zhao Ning lives just outside Beijing 's Fifth Ring Road , one of the massive concentric expressways that circle the center of China 's second - largest city .
She wakes up at 5:30 a.m. each workday morning , quickly puts on makeup , and then rushes out to catch her first bus for her interminable commute to work .
She barely has time for breakfast .
She transfers to a second bus , which takes her to the subway .
Then she transfers twice more , needing three different lines to make her way to another bus that will take her to her office in northwest Beijing , where she is the associate director of an American study - abroad program .
The subway system is only two - thirds the size of New York 's , but it carries the same number of daily commuters , more than 5 million .
" Each day I spend four hours on the road , " she says .
" It is very exhausting and it puts so much pressure on me , especially in the morning . "
Despite Beijing 's modern , well - kept web of beltways and feeder roads into the city , driving is not an option now for Ms. Zhao , even though she and her husband own a car .
Like most sprawling megacities , traffic – and the resulting , oft - reported pollution problem – is a constant urban plague .
More than 4 million cars jostle along Beijing 's roadways , with nearly 1,300 added every day , according to the city 's Traffic Management Bureau .
In April , the city began to adjust the working hours for nearly 810,000 of these commuters , hoping to alleviate the morning and evening rush .
When Zhao once tried to drive , her car was quickly entombed in traffic .
" I was so worried – like an ant dancing in a hot pan , " she says , using a classic Chinese expression .
" Since then I have n't driven to work . "
Indeed , along with water and sanitation , the challenges of mobility virtually define the growth of megacities .
At the same time , they reveal the profound social and political upheaval the world 's transition to city life can create .
Cities bring economic growth and the expansion of the middle class .
Members of the middle class want to own property – homes and , increasingly , cars .
That is certainly the case in São Paulo .
Brazil 's economy has grown enormously over the past few years and a full 15 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product is based here .
The country 's family aid programs and a progressive government have helped more than 20 million people become middle - class since 2000 .
Big - ticket items like cars and houses are now within reach .
More than 600 additional vehicles hit São Paulo 's roads every day .
" One of the main characteristics of the city is that it grows horizontally , " says Dr. Marcel Solimeo , the chief economist of the São Paulo Commercial Association , an interest group .
" Housing is further and further away , and jobs are concentrated in the city center .
The amount of time we spend getting to work is enormous . "
The city and state have added bus lanes , and authorities have put restrictions on trucks and other big vehicles .
But it is the city 's nascent rail system that holds the key to easing gridlock on the roads .
São Paulo currently has just 37 miles of rail line .
The city hopes to expand that sevenfold by the time it hosts the soccer World Cup in 2014
" All investments were based on cars , but that is starting to change and the focus is moving towards organizing public transport , " says Antonio Carlos Barrossi , an urban expert at the University of São Paulo .
" Now it is about people .
It is late , but it is important . "
A major problem confronting expanding cities is how to graft new subways and sewer systems onto existing neighborhoods .
In China , authorities have tried to circumvent that by creating entire cities from scratch .
As part of the government 's aggressive urbanization program , it has poured large resources into building new communities , especially deep within the mainland .
In fact , many of the most educated Chinese professionals on the coast have never heard of cities in their own country , some with populations the size of Houston .
In 1980 , only 51 cities with more than 500,000 people existed in China , according to UN figures .
Since then , that number has jumped to 236 .
By 2025 , the UN estimates , China will add 100 more cities to this group , as it pursues moving millions of rural peasants into vast urban networks .
And with its robust rate of economic growth , China has the money to pursue the theorem , " If we build it , they will come . "
Its centralized political system also makes it easier to plan new urban networks without significant resistance .
India , by contrast , is a democracy that must confront layers of competing political interests as it plans new large - scale projects for its megacities .
The building of the Bangalore airport , finished just last year , took more than 15 years to plan and develop , and many consider the process a disaster .
Yet the massive migration to cities is causing challenges beyond taxed sewer systems and tribal politics .
Mumbai , for instance , is experiencing the arrival of 500 newcomers a day , many of whom compete with locals for jobs .
This has caused a backlash among regional politicians , who are trying to pass laws to preserve work for area residents .
" While European cities are struggling with multiculturalism [ from other countries ] , we are coping with cities that have huge proportions of internal migrants – and internal migrants who are still diverse , " says Amita Bhide , an urban expert at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai .
In China , the effects of massive urbanization may be more political .
As its middle class grows , the freedoms that come with greater wealth could put more pressure on Beijing to open up its political system .
For now , though , people like Zhao are simply enjoying the allure of urban life .
" I think the most attractive thing about big cities like Beijing is the invisible halo it brings to me , " says Zhao .
" My friends back home think I 'm amazing that I can survive and even have a good life in a big city like Beijing . "
Tokyo : the megacity that works
Zhao 's friends raise a basic question :
As the world tilts inexorably urban , will the megacities of tomorrow even be livable ?
Experts point to cities like Lagos , Nigeria , as the kind of urban beehive that does n't work – traffic , untold pollution , the lack of even the most basic services .
Yet other megacities have certainly found the right blend of concrete and urban cachet .
Most notable is the world 's largest urban conglomeration – Tokyo .
Though the multitudes in Tokyo proper are shoehorned into a relatively small area , the city consistently ranks near the top in surveys of the world 's most livable places .
It boasts high - quality goods and services , a wealth of world - class restaurants , and an enviable choice of museums , galleries , and architectural wonders .
But its near - faultless transportation system may be the most impressive and efficient means of public mobility ever built .
Many residents cite the ease with which they can explore their city as a primary reason Tokyo is a desirable place to live .
" You can be anywhere in the city within an hour , easily , " says Mami Ishikawa , a university student .
Outside Shinjuku Station , the busiest train station in the world , a swarm of 3.64 million commuters per day spill out onto the streets , seemingly in unison , via countless exits and well - designed traffic lights .
Innovative " cycle trees , " multilevel mechanized parking lots for cyclists , make it simple to get around without a car .
Yet Tokyo's urban efficiency is due as much to social factors as it is to its transportation system and technological prowess .
" Cultural aspects , such as the Japanese penchant for order , respect for social rules and norms , and reluctance to intrude on others ' private realms is also very important to minimizing friction , " says Julian Worrall , an expert at Waseda University .
Undeniably , Tokyo has its challenges : high costs , dense living , patience - sapping gridlock for those brave enough to drive .
Mr. Worrall points to aesthetic deficiencies , too – the spread of high - rise condos , the lack of urban space devoted to something other than consumption and production .
Maybe so .
But to someone like Pastor Singh , who has to line up each day in Mumbai just to get water , those might seem like petty annoyances .

Earth ’s big problem :
Too many people
Sustainable population , minus the control
Tarhjicht is a small town in southern Morocco , some 200 kilometers south of the city of Agadir .
It 's a picturesque village on the edge of the Sahara desert whose serenity is punctuated by five ritual daily calls to prayers .
On December 2 , 2009 , the peace was interrupted by the clamors of local students protesting their difficult situation and lack of decent infrastructure .
The peaceful march was violently confronted by the authorities who proceeded to arrest a number of students .
Later that day , an ad hoc committee was created to support the arrested protesters .
It issued a statement calling for the immediate release of the students and condemned what it described as “ harsh and barbaric treatment ” by the authorities .
Bashir Hazzam , a blogger from the region published the statement [ Ar ] along with links to a video taken at the scene .
A couple of days later , Bashir , and Abdullah Boukfou , the owner of the Internet café frequented by the blogger , were arrested and accused of “ publishing false information harmful to the image of the country on human rights . ”
An Internet campaign of support followed , backed by calls from international human rights organizations to release Bashir and his colleagues .
However , a court in the neighboring city of Guelmim sentenced the blogger to 4 months in prison while his prison mates received even harsher sentences .
Nevertheless , campaigners and supporters from all over the world mounted pressure on the Moroccan authorities .
Bashir was released on February 8 , 2010 , two months after his arrest .
In the following interview Bashir tells his story .
Could you please introduce yourself to our readers ?
First , I want to thank the people working for Global Voices for giving me this opportunity to connect with their readers , and for their support and solidarity with me and my cause .
I wish them more success and progress .
My name is Bashir Hazzam .
I was born in 1982 in Tarhjicht where I received primary education , then moved to Bouizakarne for secondary education .
I got my baccalaureate in 2002 in Tarhjicht , then joined the Faculty of Sharia ( Islamic Law ) at Ait Melloul in Agadir , from which I graduated in Sharia Law in 2008 .
I engaged very early on in associative work within local associations and was involved in student activities with the National Union of the Students of Morocco ( UNEM ) .
I'm a member of the Justice and Charity group ( a de jure banned Islamist group , also known as Al - Adl wal - Ihssan or Al - Adl ) , and also a blogger since 2007 .
How did you discover the blogosphere and what do you write about in general ?
I discovered the world of blogging when I was a student : I came across a number of blogs and realized that blogging enables people to publish their ideas easily , without control and for free .
I liked the idea so much that , after a brief research , I ended up creating my own blog on the Arabic blog publishing website Maktoob .
That was back in September 1th , 2007 .
I chose to call it Al - Bushra ( The Good News ) .
My first post was titled : “ Electoral Promises : Facts or Fiction . ”
By the way , I was interrogated by the police about the content of this article when I was arrested last December .
As for my writings , I generally blog about national , international political , intellectual and religious issues .
To what extent has blogging and the Internet in general helped you in your life and activities ?
The blogosphere enabled me to exchange views and ideas and communicate with many bloggers and writers from around the world .
This had a positive impact on my life .
Though I 'm new to this field , I believe that with the passage of time , I will be able to discover new and important things that will help me improve my blogging and everyday life skills .
The Internet is growing so fast , which makes the use of it highly beneficial for those who master it .
After your arrest with Abdullah Boukfou and others , the authorities claimed they had done so because you published “ false information harmful to the reputation of Morocco . ”
Do you agree with this version of events ?
How do you explain the reasons behind your detention ?
I completely disagree with the official version because the statement [ I published on my blog ] does not include any term that could cause harm to the reputation or interests of the country .
And anyone who takes a look at the content of this statement can confirm that it is perfectly harmless , and that it does not include any insult to the country 's reputation .
To the extent that the Court decided the statement was inoffensive and acquitted me on this specific charge , but still it prosecuted me on the charge of participating in an armed protest , even though I did not participate in the demonstration in the first place .
This is something that surprised me really .
I think the reason behind my arrest was to impose a media blackout around the events that occurred in Tarhjicht , after the violent intervention of the security forces against unarmed students and the population that sided with them .
They are trying to prevent the truth from filtering to the public .
In fact , the charge of insulting the country 's reputation on human rights should be directed at the local authority which perpetrated violence of various kinds against protesters and detainees , who simply demanded their rights in a peaceful and civilized way .
We should never have been blamed .
We have published the facts that occurred on the ground only to become victims of the tyranny met upon the population at random .
How were you treated during detention ?
And do you think you received a fair trial ?
Except for some sporadic provocations at the beginning of the investigation , officers treated me well .
The trial was not fair : I was sentenced to four months in prison , Abdullah Boukfou , the owner of the internet café , to one year , while three students and blogger Boubaker Al - Yadib ( who was since released ) received a six - month sentence .
The trial was moving towards clearing us of all charges when , against the odds , the verdict was pronounced against us .
We , and our defense team , felt that the process was controlled by the authorities .
So much so that the verdicts were so unequal , particularly as the charges against me were the same as those filed against Abdullah Boukfou , but he ended up receiving a harsher sentence .
There were several interpretations of your release from jail : some said it was an implicit recognition by the authorities of their “ mistake , ” others suggested it was a public relations exercise to save the reputation of the country abroad .
What 's your take on this ?
All these things might be true .
Those indeed might have been the motives behind the authorities ’ decision to retreat from their initial stance , that has only distorted the image and reputation of the country abroad .
Has the campaign of solidarity in your opinion , influenced the course of events ?
Do these campaigns really matter ?
Yes , campaigns of solidarity conducted by bloggers in Morocco and abroad , led by the Moroccan Association of Bloggers , and broadly supported by national and international human rights organizations , particularly Reporters Without Borders , Freedom House , as well as the media , have contributed significantly to influence and pressure the officials to release us .
Thanks to the efforts of all those - and praise first be to Allah - I regained my freedom after two months spent in prison .
Without their campaigning , I would have remained behind bars .
Also , my affiliation to Al - Adl , has brought a significant pressure to bear , as it is the largest political force of opposition in Morocco .
All those factors have eventually contributed to my release .
How would you characterize freedom of expression in Morocco , especially on the Internet ?
Freedom of expression in our country is plummeting and is in constant deterioration .
Figures from international organizations shore up this claim , placing Morocco among countries with the least regard for freedom of expression .
Reality as well supports this perception with a succession of arrests and trials of many bloggers , journalists , human rights activists and opposition figures , harassed solely because of their views .
As for freedom over the Internet , the state increasingly wants to impose its control on it .
This has been made evident after the attacks suffered by bloggers and the latest arrest , a couple of weeks ago , of a web designer , Abdellatif Ouiass , creator of the website “ The World 's Best Head of State , ” although he has since been released on bail .
This shows clearly how the hands and the eyes of the Moroccan intelligence services want now to extend to the Internet .
This , however , will have no significant impact given the extent of the information revolution , which each day overpowers repressive regimes .
After all that 's happened , have you changed the way you blog or write ?
Do you have self - censorship ?
What happened will not affect me .
Despite the arbitrary detention , I kept my writing style intact .
It will not affect my thoughts or my views .
Everyone in this world has the right to express her / his opinions without censorship as long as that does not contradict laws , that are well known in this regard .
What advice would you have for bloggers in Morocco , and in the world who fear the wrath of their governments or regimes ?
I would invite people to take advantage of technologies offered by the Internet to highlight their skills and talents , and express their ambitions and aspirations through blogging , so as to break the systematic marginalization imposed by authoritarian states , especially on the youth .
That 's a way for those countries to reach real progress and keep pace with developed nations , provided that expression remains disciplined , responsible and respectful of the privacy and specificity of others .
There should n't be any fear of arrest or the repression that hinders the will of the people , as long as what is published by the blogger does not violate the law .
Do you have a final word for those who stood in solidarity with you ?
In the end , and through this free outlet , I wish to extend my thanks and gratitude to each one of those who supported me during this ordeal , especially the Moroccan Association of Bloggers , all bloggers and activists in and outside the country , who have shown great solidarity with me .
I also thank my defense lawyers , media outlets that highlighted my case , my brothers in the Justice and charity group , and all national and international human rights organizations , especially Freedom House , Reporters Without Borders and all those throughout the world whose conscience has led them to support my case .
I urge upon them to continue their solidarity until Abdullah Boukfou , Abdellatif Ouiass ( who 's now released on bail ) and all prisoners of conscience in the prisons of the country are released .
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - A Persian kitten gave her owners the shock of their lives when she emerged from the washing machine , dizzy and bedraggled after surviving a full cycle .
Brendon Rogers , from Manly Vale , Sydney , said four - month - old Kimba , a white , fluffy kitten , must have climbed into the front - loader machine when the door was open and curled up on the dirty clothes -- unbeknownst to his father Lyndsay who turned the machine on for a cold wash .
They were both amazed when the cycle -- including a high level spin -- finished and they opened the door to pull out the clothes to find Kimba in the machine .
“ We could hardly believe our eyes when she emerged , looking like a drowned rat , ” he told Reuters .
Although Kimba was alive she clearly needed help so they rushed her to the vet where she was put on an intravenous drip and treated for shock and hypothermia .
Her eyes were also badly affected by the detergent and needed treatment .
“ It is just amazing that she survived but we reckon she ’s used all of her nine lives , ” said Rogers .
Robaina was an ambassador for the cigar industry Cuba 's most famous cigar maker , Alejandro Robaina , has died aged 91 .
Mr Robaina , the only grower to have a brand of Cuban cigars named after him , had been a roving ambassador for the country 's state - run cigar industry .
But more typically , he could be found on his small farm in the Vuelta Abajo region of western Cuba , tending his beloved tobacco plants .
He was famous for their quality and always told visitors : you have to love the land and care for it .
If Cuba 's hugely profitable state - run cigar industry had a face in recent years , it was that of Don Alejandro Robaina , says the BBC's Danny Aeberhard .
Veils of cotton
And what a face this venerable gentleman had - bronzed and deeply wrinkled , like one of his prized , dried tobacco leaves , he adds .
Although he met kings and celebrities , this modest man was perhaps more comfortable greeting visitors to his smallholding in Vuelta Abajo .
There he would show people how to nurture the plants , protecting them from the fierce glare of the Cuban sun with veils of cotton cloth .
Their quality was legendary .
When the tobacco grows , he said , it talks to you , telling you what it needs - and you must listen .
Your comments and memories of Mr Robaina : I met Mr Robaina during a visit to Cuba in 2003 .
We were shown round the tobacco farm and storage sheds .
Wonderful gentleman .
A lifetime of smoking cigars did not seem to do him much harm , but I guess the anti smokers would say he'd have lived to 100 as a non smoker .
But what pleasure he would have missed and what pleasure he has given to many thousands .
I 'll smoke a cigar in his memory tonight .
RIP .
David Watts , Chiang Mai Thailand
My friends and I had the pleasure of having a private audience with Robaina last summer ( July 2009 ) .
When I called the plantation and asked if we could visit , the family member who answered said yes !
The day before we drove to see him , I called to reconfirm .
When I asked if he'd be there , he responded " as long as I 'm not dead I 'll be here " ( translated ) .
When we arrived , he was having a nap so we were given a tour of the plantation until he awoke .
When we met him , he was in good spirits , was very pleased that two Canadians and one Brit had driven all the way from Havana to meet him .
He offered each of us home - rolled cigars and proceeded to cut and light them for us .
He asked us questions and talked to us about him family and plantation .
We have some great photos with him and some wonderful memories .
He was a pleasant , jovial man .
I am saddened by the loss .
Shaun Henriksen , Ottawa , Canada I was born in Vuelta Abajo ( Pinar del Rio ) .
My father is a cigar lover , but in Cuba , just the people with money can have a taste of our good cigars , and my father just makes $ 15.00 a month .
After years living outside Cuba , I went to visit my family , and I took my father to Vinales and to Mr Robaina 's farm .
I told Mr Robaina about my father and he just closed his eyes and said to my father ...
" Oh my god !
You are a lucky man , here ... have one of mine , they are the best ones , trust me . "
We had a great time with him .
Just a nice man and an honest human being .
He will be miss by all the Vueltabajersos ( people from the province of Pinar del Rio ) .
Radan Hernandez , Victoria , BC , Canada I met Mr Robaina in Pinar del Rio province in 2004 .
We were driving into Pinar del Rio to visit the local cigar factory .
Two guys on bicycles were waiting at the entrance of the town , saying that the cigar factory was closed but they know of a better place .
Thinking this was all a big hoax , but with nothing to lose , we agreed .
They hopped in the car , and we drove a while away to this farm .
Still thinking this was all a hoax , we were given a tour and then introduced to Mr Robaina ( and of course offered to buy a box of Unicos ) .
When I got home , I googled the brand and of course , there he was !
Lucky we had met him in his own farm .
Just goes to show sometimes its nice to trust the local people and put away some of your mistrust when travelling !
Mike Pasoff , Montreal , Quebec
I 'm very sad to hear this news .
I met Alejandro Robaina last summer at his home in Cuba .
We were incredibly lucky to see him as he was n't seeing visitors to his farm at the time but we'd come a long way from Havana and he graciously agreed to meet us .
He was an extremely warm , gentle man giving us cigars from his own collection and even lighting them for us .
Spending half an hour with him was the highlight of the trip and I 'm grateful I had the chance to meet a legend in the cigar world before he passed away .

Last fall , Apple Inc.'s head of Internet services began making the Hollywood rounds with a proposal to launch a subscription television service that would offer a package of broadcast shows for $ 10 a month .
The service was intended as a dazzling new entertainment feature to spark sales of Apple ’s soon - to - be - launched iPad .
But the plan fizzled when several of the biggest studios rejected the concept out of hand .
They also dismissed Apple ’s comeback pitch : to charge 99 cents per TV episode .
Apple ’s plan conjured a nightmare scenario for the TV industry , which worried it would suffer the same dismal fate as the music business .
Apple ’s iTunes service , after all , had created a market for 99 - cent single downloads , helping cripple the sale of $ 12 music CDs .
Some feared that Apple ’s proposition would wreak the same havoc upon the average $ 70 - a - month cable - TV customer .
That ’s not to say that Apple has dropped its ambitions in television .
At the annual cable convention underway in Los Angeles this week , Brian Roberts , the chief executive of Comcast Corp. , the nation ’s largest cable company , predicted a robust future for watching TV shows on the iPad .

Just not in the way Apple envisioned .
The cable industry and the studios are working to hold Apple at bay , racing to come up with an alternative that will keep their business intact .
As consumers increasingly expect to watch TV on their computers and portable devices , the future of online television is up for grabs .
One solution : TV Everywhere , which is intended to address changing viewer habits while preserving the profitable status quo for program producers and the networks that carry the shows .
The idea , presented by Time Warner Inc. CEO Jeff Bewkes at last year ’s cable - TV industry trade show , was straightforward .
Consumer could watch TV shows free , any time and on any device , as long as they were already paying customers .
But in the year since Bewkes introduced TV Everywhere , his grand plan has hit resistance , even from within his own industry .
Three of the most powerful players in cable — Disney , NBC and Fox parent News Corp. — have championed another alternative , Hulu , and a host of other smaller networks and operators have yet to sign on .

Speaking Tuesday before thousands of cable executives , Roberts acknowledged that acceptance of TV Everywhere — which Comcast supports — has been slow .
He blamed technology that makes the authentication process cumbersome and promised it would improve .
“ We have made real progress , ” Roberts said .
“ Would I like it to be faster and ubiquitous ?
Sure . ”
TV Everywhere has taken tentative steps , with early tests by cable , satellite and telecommunications companies offering a smattering of programming from nearly 30 networks , including powerhouses like HBO and Fox News and struggling channels like Epix .
Bewkes sees substantial support for the idea .

“ Just about all of the distribution companies … have endorsed it or implemented it in tests or actual launches , ” Bewkes said , calling it a “ huge change ” since last year .
The initiative is important to Bewkes because his company , Time Warner , owns popular cable channels — including TNT , TBS , CNN , Cartoon Network and HBO — that customers already pay to receive .
TV executives worry that conditioning viewers to go online will lead them to cancel their cable service , seeing no need to pay for channels they do n’t watch when they can cherry - pick the shows they want .
Last summer Comcast signed on to Bewkes ’ vision .
At the time , Comcast was determined not to let free services , such as the fast - growing Hulu , get more traction .
But for now , the initiative might more aptly be described as TV Somewhere .

Time Warner Cable , for instance , is conducting limited trials with a total of 6,000 subscribers in New York City , Syracuse , N.Y. , and Columbus , Ohio .
Satellite - TV operator Dish Network plans to test TV Everywhere as early as this summer .
Bewkes is expected to announce Wednesday that phone company Verizon will offer the service to the 3 million subscribers of its FiOS television service .
Comcast is by far the most aggressive , having rolled out an early version of TV Everywhere — which it brands Fancast Xfinity TV — to all of its 16 million broadband Internet subscribers last December .
Those who ’ve tried the service to watch movies or shows such as HBO ’s “ True Blood ” are online addicts , watching nearly three times as long as the average visitor to the site , according to Comcast .
But few people have tried the service .
Comcast has n’t promoted it to subscribers because it ’s still getting the kinks out .
For example , it takes 11 steps to determine which cable programs an online viewer pays to receive .
Comcast is trying to simplify this authentication process to a single click .
Although two dozen networks have signed on during the test phase , there are obvious gaps in the TV Everywhere lineup , including Time Warner ’s CNN and Viacom Inc. 's Nickelodeon .
Advertisement
Seemingly minor issues — such as whether online viewers would be part of Nielsen ’s program ratings , or whether the same TV commercials would appear online — have stymied the process .
Even the partners have debated whether to allow heavily trafficked portals , such as MSN or Yahoo , to be included .
And only one of the four major broadcast networks , CBS , is participating in the trials .
The three other networks — ABC parent Walt Disney Co. , NBC Universal , and Fox parent News Corp. — are owners of Hulu .
Hulu ’s owners plan to begin offering a premium service for $ 10 a month that would provide a greater library of TV shows to watch .
One person familiar with the issue said those networks are n’t part of TV Everywhere because , initially , they did n’t know what it was going to look like .
But now it appears they ’re holding back online distribution rights as leverage in the retransmission fee negotiations .
Advertisement
ABC is in an unusual spot .
Although parent company Disney is a partner in Hulu , its largest individual shareholder is Steve Jobs , the head of Apple .
Not surprisingly , ABC was the only broadcast network to have an app on the iPad when it debuted for users to watch ABC shows .
While the cable industry sees TV Everywhere as a way to offer subscribers broad access to programming online , others see a far more sinister motivation : snuffing out free online TV .
Their fear is that the cable industry is determined to maintain its control as television gatekeeper , locking out competition .
“ TV Everywhere is just a tactic to keep people paying , ” said Mike Vorhaus , president of Magid Advisors , a media consulting firm .
“ The cable companies want more customers .
They want to build a wall and penalize us if we do n’t pay . ”
But a wall that keeps out nonpaying viewers is exactly want Bewkes wants .
And he thinks the threat of cord-cutting is pretty much bluster in a country where 93 % of households pay to get TV .

“ The viewing of television is going up , not down .
More people are paying for it and watching it , in terms of absolute millions of people , ” Bewkes said .
“ What we ’re saying now is , let ’s take that very powerful incoming tide of TV and put it online . ”

Startups need to have a great lawyer , accountant , patent attorney , etc .
But founders need to know how to ask for their advice and when to ignore it .
Why Entrepreneurs Hate Lawyers
I was having coffee with a friend who teaches at the U.C. Berkeley Boalt Law School and runs their entrepreneurship program .
Our conversation led us to Scott Walkers post Why Entrepreneurs Hate Lawyers and why we both recommend that entrepreneurs print it out and tape it to their wall .
I remember when I encountered bullet # 1 on Walkers list .
You Ca n’t Sign This Deal
After being in business for all of seven months , one of our first deals at Epiphany was with a software company called Visio , ( now owned by Microsoft . )
After some heroics from our CTO in extracting data from SAP , the Visio CFO loved our product , thought we could save them a ton of time and money and wanted it installed ASAP .
We were excited that we were getting our first six - figure check and a reference customer .
Then Visio gave us their boilerplate contract .
We passed it to our law firm who promptly threw up all over it .
“ You guys ca n’t sign this .
It has you putting your software in escrow , giving them all of your source code if you go out of business , indemnifying them from all possible lawsuits , not selling to competitors , first rights on a number of irrelevant issues and has a clause about promising them your first - born children . ”
I stopped listening for a while as it dawned on me that the deal I thought we had was probably now gone .
I was feeling pretty deflated .
I tuned back in when our lawyer said , “ Let us start negotiating better terms with Visio ’s company counsel . ”
When I was a younger entrepreneur my answer would have been , “ Ok .
See if you can get us better terms .
Call me when you ’re done . ”
This time I said , “ Make a list of the issues in bullet form , send them to me and I ’ll get back to you . ”
Strategy Questions Not Legal Questions
The issues our lawyer had raised about the contract , while correct , were strategy questions the founders needed to answer , not legal questions .
Negotiating deal points before we thought through our strategy at best would have cost us a ton of money with little progress .
Looking at the Visio contract the question we were faced with was ; how bad would the short term consequences be in signing the deal ?
The answer to that was easy – none .
We ’d have money in the bank and a reference customer .
The next question was , how bad would the deal points Visio was asking for screw us in the long term ?
This was more complex .
Some of them would have limited our ability to sell to other software companies .
Those were clearly unacceptable .
Some of their other requests were just “ comfort ” issues like putting the software in escrow to protect Visio in case our startup went out of business .
Finally , there was a class of what I call “ business development contract terms . ”
This happens in every company when a contract is passed around for review and everyone feels they have to mark it up with extraneous demands to feel like they had their say .
Most of these points might have sounded great in law school but were impossible for a startup to deliver .
So we had to decide what deal points we could live with that would n’t kill our company .
For example , I could agree to put our software in escrow if Visio would pay for all the legal and logistical expenses ( knowing full well it was a “ see , we ’re doing our job ” issue the Visio lawyers were insisting on , but one that Visio would never implement . )
Other deal points , which my lawyers said were fatal , were also easy to agree to – do n’t sell to competitors ?
We could easily agree to a 90 - day non-compete as a sign of good faith ( what Visio did n’t know is that we had no bandwidth to take on another customer while we were getting their software installed . )
My co-founder and a few board members brainstormed to make sure we were n’t missing anything .
Then we got on the phone .
Why Lawyers Do n’t Run Startups
We realized that our goal 1 ) was to get a deal done , 2 ) on terms we could live with and 3 ) it required talking to someone senior at Visio with the authority to make decisions on their side .
Only then could we have our lawyer spend any time on the contract .
We called the Visio CFO .
We explained that their boilerplate contract was something we could n’t sign because it would put us out of business .
We said we would be happy to work with him in providing assurances on issues that were of importance to him and his company .
We suggested that we see if we could agree to them in this call .
But we wondered if he had the flexibility ( meaning the authority ) to overrule his lawyer on their standard contract ?
( It now became a matter of pride that he could . )
We said that if we agreed on the big issues we could send the deal back to our lawyers .
( He was surprised to hear about half of the things in his own contract .
“ It says what ? ! ” )
We agreed to the major points in a half hour .
The lawyers had the final contract done in two days .
Lessons Learned
Lawyers provide a service ; they are not running your company .
If you find a lawyer who talks about solutions not problems , hold on to them .
In every company that gives you a contract there ’s someone who wants a deal .
When you run into contract issues , call them first for advice .
Recognize whether you have a legal problem or strategy problem .
The web has great blogs by lawyers who get it .
Read them .

Cable news broadcaster CNN has put a few liberal noses out of joint by hiring conservative blogger Erick Erickson as a political contributor on its new evening news program " John King , USA . "
Critics point to a long list of controversial statements by Erickson , including floating the idea of beating liberal lawmakers " to a bloody pulp . "
Is CNN making a mistake by bringing Erickson aboard ?
( Watch Erick Erickson 's recent appearance on CNN )
Shame on you , CNN : CNN should be " ashamed " of hiring Erickson , says Steve Benen in Washington Monthly .
Not because he is a conservative , but because he is an " extremist " with a " record of radical rhetoric " who should be " shut out of the mainstream , " not welcomed in .
There are plenty of " thoughtful , intelligent conservative bloggers " out there , but " Erickson is n't one of them . "
" This is CNN ? "
Does this mean it 's finally safe to watch CNN ?
This is an " interesting play " for CNN , says Dan Riehl at Riehl World View , and evidence it is leaving the " dwindling , almost nonexistent " liberal news market to MSNBC .
The only bad news about this is that we on the right might " actually have to watch CNN occasionally now . "
As for Erickson , let 's just hope he does n't turn into a " typical elitist mainstream media jerk " like the rest of their pundits .
" Erick Erickson : Jerk "
The reality is , CNN needs to compete with Fox :
This is further evidence of CNN's " shift toward opinion journalism , " says Frances Martel in Mediaite , after news of the " revamping " of its morning program to be more like " Fox and Friends . "
" Done right , " this is n't a bad thing , especially as CNN has been losing ground to Fox News for months .
Bringing " outspoken and polarizing " figures like Erickson to the network could result in " a hit in the ratings . "

Shark attacks are most likely to occur on Sunday , in less than 6 feet of water , during a new moon and involve surfers wearing black and white bathing suits , a first of its kind study from the University of Florida suggests .
Researchers analyzed statistics from shark attacks that occurred in Florida 's Volusia County , dubbed the " Shark Attack Capital of the World , " between 1956 and 2008 .
They also spent a year observing people between Daytona Beach and New Smyrna Beach , said George Burgess , director of the International Shark Attack File at UF .
" It 's basically an analysis of why , where and when in an area that traditionally has had more shark - human interactions than any other stretch of coastline in the world , " he said .
" One of our students , Brittany Garner , essentially camped out there , counted the number of heads on the beach and took photographs . "
While this 47 - mile - long section of Central Florida 's Atlantic coast leads in human - shark skirmishes , making up 21 percent of all global attacks between 1999 and 2008 , most are " hit and run " incidents that seldom cause serious injury and no fatalities occurred , he said .
" Calling them attacks is probably a misnomer because the consequences are usually no more severe than a dog bite , " he said .
" They 're not the same kind of bites made by 10 - to 20 - foot - long white sharks that you have off the coast of California .
Here we see a different style of attack , primarily perpetrated by smaller fish - eating sharks such as spinners and blacktips that are less than 6 to 7 feet long , which because of their size normally seek smaller prey . "
There have been 231 shark attacks between the first one reported in 1956 in Volusia County and 2008 , said Burgess , who works at UF 's Florida Museum of Natural History .
The study , part of which was published recently in the edited volume " Sharks and Their Relatives II , " uses statistics from 220 of those cases for which detailed information is available .

Human , shark and environmental factors combine to create a perfect storm of favorable conditions in Volusia County for attacks , particularly near Ponce Inlet between Daytona Beach and New Smyrna Beach , he said .
The more people in the water the greater the chances they will encounter a shark , and New Smyrna Beach south of the inlet is a " hot spot " for surfers with its well developed sand bars and good waves , Burgess said .
Hand splashing and feet kicking provoke sharks , which bite and release what they mistake for normal prey items in the turbid waters , he said .
Also , the strong tidal flow in the inlet makes it " an aquatic smorgasbord of food items for sharks , barracudas , mackerel and other large predators , " boosting shark numbers , he said .
Young white males were attacked most because they spend the most time in the water , Burgess said .
Ninety percent of victims were male , 77 percent of 196 victims were between 11 and 30 years old and in the 171 cases where race was known , 98 percent were white , he said .
Well over half of the 220 victims were bit on the leg -- 158 -- more than five times the number bit on the arms -- 34 -- the second highest body part to be injured , he said .
advertisement
Surfers were the most frequent victims , making up 61 percent of the total , Burgess said .
They tended to be bitten more in the early morning and late afternoon when waves were highest and they spend more time surfing , he said .
" At the time of the attack , most of the surfers were sitting or holding onto the board waiting for a wave , which explains why most surf victims were bitten on the legs , " he said .
Sharks are not weekend warriors .
Rather it is human leisure that leads to the fewest number of human encounters on Wednesdays and the highest on Sundays , followed by Saturdays , Burgess said .
" There are a fair number of attacks on Fridays as well , reflective of people skipping work and taking three - day weekends , " he said .
The greatest number of attacks occurred during new moons , followed by full moons , the edges of the lunar extreme when the moon has its biggest pull on the tidal phase , Burgess said .
Probably the moon 's phases influence the movements and reproductive patterns of fish , the shark 's food source , just as they affect human behavior , he said .
Not surprisingly , attacks were highest during the swimming season , from May through October , peaking in August , Burgess said .
They spiked in April as sharks began their seasonal northern migration up the eastern coast of the United States , he said .
Most incidents involved one bite , occurred in turbid , murky or muddy waters and were at the water 's surface , Burgess said .
Only one attack was on a diver , he said .
More victims wore swimsuits that were black and white than any other color combination , followed by black and yellow , attesting to sharks ' abilities to see contrast , he said .
Between 1999 and 2008 , shark attacks worldwide numbered 639 , of which there were 428 reports in the United States , 275 in Florida and 135 in Volusia County .
Burgess said .
President Barack Obama on Monday selected FBI Deputy Director John Pistole to head the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) .
If approved by the Senate , Pistole will head the agency responsible for securing the nation 's air travel .

TSA has been without a permanent director since Obama took office .
Former FBI agent Erroll Southers withdrew his nomination in January after he gave conflicting statements about using police background checks for private purposes .
Obama 's second nominee , retired Army Gen. Robert Harding withdrew his nomination in March after some questioned his work as a defense contractor .
“ The talent and knowledge John has acquired in more than two decades of service with the FBI will make him a valuable asset to our administration 's efforts to strengthen the security and screening measures at our airports , " Obama said in a statement .
" I am grateful that he has agreed to take on this important role , and I look forward to working with him in the weeks and months ahead . "
Pistole recently played a key role in the arrest of Faisal Shahzad , who is suspected of trying to explode a bomb in New York City 's Times Square .
Shahzad was taken off an airplane bound for Dubai at New York 's Kennedy Airport two days after the bomb attempt was foiled .
Thanks to Shea Gunther over at Mother Nature Network for putting attention on this .
It 's always so nice to see the good guys win .
The Westboro Baptist Church thrives on spreading a nice helping of hate around .
They sent their minions to West Virginia to let the families of the 29 dead miners know their loved ones died because we 're too tolerant of alternative lifestyles .
Their website says there are too many Catholics in West Virginia , another reason for the protest .
Anyway , watch this video .
Seriously , watch the whole thing .
I especially love the part where the guy from West Virginia starts quoting Bible verses back at them and tells them to " get out " .
As it rolls on , it 's clear the good people of West Virginia have no intention of letting the haters get even a little bit of traction in their state .
But the WBC are an unstable bunch of busy haters .
Not only did they head to West Virginia for a harassment fix , but they also deployed to Iowa , where their 6 protesters were met by a group of 500 , letting them know that Iowa is a spacious state , but there is no room for haters .
It 's so nice to see free speech at work on both sides .
While the Phelps family cult depends on indoctrinating children and using them for their evil ends , the good people of Iowa and West Virginia gave their kids an object lesson in meeting evil with good .
A virtual fist bump to Iowa and West Virginia , and true prayers for the families of the mine victims goes to them , from me .
Long live the first amendment .
Over the past few decades , researchers have started finding behaviors that were once considered uniquely human , like tool use and empathy , in a number of other species .
Many of these findings have come from our fellow primates , who presumably share a lot of our evolutionary legacy .
But a surprising number of sophisticated behaviors have been showing up in birds , which have n't shared a common ancestor with any mammals for a very long time .
The latest behaviors to add to birds ' growing list are empathy and consolation , according to a paper released on Wednesday by PLoS one .
As the list of complex behavior in birds grows , it seems our expectations for the evolution of behavior may have to evolve , as well .
The finding comes from a study of ravens which spend up to a decade in socially complex flocks before settling down into a pair - bonded relationship .
A previous study using other corvids ( rooks ) indicates that pair - bonded mates will perform what are termed " affiliation behaviors " following conflicts , suggesting that there may be some degree of consolation at play .
So , the questions the authors tried to address here was whether , in the absence of pair bonding , the same sort of affiliation would occur within a larger social group where pair bonding has n't occurred .
The research involved a flock of 13 ravens kept in an aviary , a social group in which a number of the individuals were directly related .
As in the wild , the flock displayed various forms of aggression .
All of these were recorded over a span of two years , and the researchers looked for signs of affiliation ( " defined as contact sitting , preening , or beak - to - beak or beak - to - body touching " ) or further incidents of aggression .
The timing and birds involved in these events were recorded , and the researchers noted whether the victim solicited the affiliation , or whether it was offered spontaneously .
What was n't observed was the sort of reconciliation that has been seen in chimps .
Sometimes , the victim and aggressor engaged in affiliation , but a statistical analysis of these events indicated that they were more of a randomly timed event , rather than a deliberate strategy to diffuse tension .
In fact , the victim was generally at risk for renewed aggression from the same attacker in the immediate post - conflict period .
But affiliative displays showed some very clear trends .
For starters , the victims of aggression were not likely to lash out at another individual in the social group , a behavior that has been observed in some species .
That means approaching the loser does n't carry any exceptional risks .
Affiliation displays also had a practical value , as renewed aggression was less likely while affiliation was taking place .
So , it 's not much of a surprise to find out that the losers tended to actively solicit affiliation from their fellow flock members .
What is somewhat surprising is that many of those flock members appeared to offer affiliation without a request .
This occurred most often among those members of the flock that were related by kinship , although it still occurred at an appreciable rate among unrelated birds .
Strikingly , this unsolicited affiliation did n't seem to confer a protective function — renewed aggression was just as likely in these instances .
The authors speculate at length in the paper 's discussion about whether those latter events indicate some limited form of empathy , and if they serve to console the victim .
It 's an interesting question , but one that 's extremely difficult to answer , in part because we can't really get inside the mind of a bird , and in part because " consolation " implies lots of context and mental processes , which make determining whether something is consolation a matter as much of semantics as anything else .
Evolutionary parallels across a great divide
What 's very interesting , but not discussed at all , is what this means from an evolutionary perspective .
We tend to accept that something complex — a gene , a tissue , a behavior — that is shared between two related species probably got to both of them via common descent .
But the distance between birds and mammals is immense .
Birds are essentially the modern form of the dinosaurs , while mammals are an offshoot of a completely different group of reptiles .
In fact , the brains of the two groups are structured differently enough that biologists have struggled to figure out what structures might functionally correspond to each other .
At the same time , these sorts of complex behaviors seem to be absent from many of the species that , if they were really ancient , should also have picked them up from a common ancestor .
The alternative — that they arose separately in these groups — raises a whole series of other questions about behaviors , like consolation , that we tend to think of as complex , and once thought were something that made humans distinct from other animals .
Maybe they 're not really all that complex , or the selective pressures that produce them are simply common within social species , like the protection from aggression that 's offered by affiliation requests seen here .
Maybe once a certain behavior like pair bonding evolves , a degree of consolation just comes along for free .
In any case , the fact that we 're now finding so many complex behaviors in birds — tool use , problem solving , social learning , planning — may catalyze a significant rethink of what we thought we knew about the biology of behavior .

It 's not in our nature to get all excited about firmware updates , but B &N sure seems to be bringing the good stuff in release 1.3 of the Nook 's software .
The major new features include a Beta release of a " basic " web browser and a Read In Store feature that 's reassuringly true to its name .
You 'll basically be allowed to browse and read the full versions of books while inside a Barnes and Noble outlet .
That looks like a win - win to us , as it directly addresses the goal of using the Nook to get people in stores while affording consumers the opportunity to get a good idea about a book .
The first Android apps on the device are also offered , in the form of games like chess and sudoku , both perfectly suited to the glacially refreshing monochome screen .
Speaking of which , B&N claims it 's also improved page turning and loading speeds .
The update is available via manual download now or you can wait for the OTA stuff to hit your Nook within the next week .

Oil company wants to see off potential opposition from US Environmental Protection Agency
BP is lobbying on Capitol Hill against a federal US environmental agency being given jurisdiction over the use of a controversial method of extracting gas from shale deposits , ahead of an important meeting this week .
The London - based oil company wants decisions on drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing – which uses high - pressure liquids to force fissures – to be taken at state level , rather than being left to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , whose specialist committee meets on Wednesday to discuss its concerns .
BP is also opposed to the public disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing , on the basis that the information is commercially sensitive – something that will anger environmentalists , who are highly suspicious of the process .
Although BP was unable to comment , the New York Times published a " discussion draft " said to have been produced by BP which says : " States with existing oil and gas regulatory programmes have the authority to and are best situated to continue regulating hydraulic fracturing processes and procedures . "
Tony Hayward , the chief executive of BP , said in a recent speech that abundant shale gas had the potential to transform the US 's dependence on foreign gas imports .
The shale gas deposits have been known about for decades but recent technological developments have opened the way for supplies to be exploited in North America – and potentially in Europe and Asia .
Environmental groups fear that the chemicals used in fracturing are highly toxic and are worried about them filtering into reservoirs .
Oil companies have found significant shale deposits in New York state and Pennsylvania , close to densely populated areas .
Requests to drill have met opposition from green groups , as well as from local politicians .
But the EPA is seen as an even tougher potential opponent .
The environmental engineering committee of the agency 's science advisory board is scheduled to meet on 7 and 8 April to evaluate " fracking " , as it is known .
The EPA is well known to BP , having recently challenged a permit given by the state of Indiana allowing the company to expand its
Whiting refinery for use as a centre for treating crude from the controversial Canadian tar sands .
BP was once seen as one of the most environmentally conscious oil companies but that reputation is now under strain as it becomes a vocal supporter of and active participant in the carbon - intensive tar sands extraction in Canada .
The green rhetoric of its former chief executive Lord Browne has been toned down since Hayward took the reins three years ago , although the company retains the use of the slogan " Beyond petroleum " – adopted under Browne 's leadership – for some of its activities .
Hayward has promised to boost annual profits at BP by $ 3bn ( £ 2 bn ) over the next two or three years and committed the company to increasing production by 1 % - 2 % a year until 2015 .
BP will face further questions about its attitude to the environment when directors appear before shareholders at the annual meeting next week .
Image caption BT sent Beverley McCartney a quote for broadband connection
A pensioner says BT has quoted her more than £ 150,000 to install broadband to her rural home .
Beverley McCartney , of Salem , near Llandeilo , Carmarthenshire , has wanted a broadband connection for years .
BT had previously told her it was not able to connect broadband , but sent a letter last week saying it could .
The company said in very rare cases exceptional charges are needed .
It will contribute £ 8,000 to the costs but only if £ 129,613.54 plus VAT is paid .
Mrs McCartney said : " I just laughed , I thought it was ludicrous in view of their profits .
" I phoned BT and said surely this is a typing error and the girl said ' No , there 's been no mistake , other people have had bills for much more than this . ' "
Mrs McCartney said that BT had told her on separate occasions that there would be no charge for the connection and also that one could not be made .

The letter quoted a price of over £ 150,000 once VAT is included
She said : " Clearly the departments do n't speak to each other and do n't consult each other over the engineering cost .
" It 's outrageous .
I can only laugh otherwise I 'd probably burst into tears . "
Chris Orum of BT said : " There can be very rare cases where additional charges need to be applied because of an exceptional amount of work required to the network in order to provide service .
" These charges reflect the additional line plant and equipment needed to provide broadband to a particular location .
" BT is making a multi-billion pound investment in its UK network and is continuing to work with the Welsh Assembly Government to find solutions for the relatively few areas in Wales still unable to access a broadband service . "
BT is working with the assembly government on the Regional Innovative Broadband Support Scheme ( RIBS ) to enable broadband connection in " not - spots " in more remote areas of Wales .
I 'm not on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere - it 's rural but not a wildnerness Beverley McCartney , , BT customer
Mr Orum said : " We 've been working on broadband ' notspots ' but it requires huge amounts of engineering work .
" If it 's just one individual person and it requires upgrading the network for one person , no company would cover that . "
However , he said Salem , the village where Mrs McCartney lives , is not a ' not - spot ' .
Mrs McCartney said : " I live three miles out of Llandeilo but there 's 50 odd houses in Salem and I 'm quite sure they 'd like broadband too . "
" I 'm not on top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere .
It 's rural but not a wildnerness .
" I could n't afford £ 2,000 , let alone £ 150,000 , " she said .
Der Bundesgerichtshof ( BGH ) hat neue Möglichkeiten zur Patentierbarkeit von Software und Verfahren , die mit Hilfe von Computern ausgeführt werden , aufgezeigt .
Im Streit über eine Patentanmeldung von Siemens auf ein " Verfahren zur dynamischen Generierung strukturierter Dokumente " beim Deutschen Patentamt mit der Nummer DE 10232674 hat die Berufungsinstanz entschieden , dass auch rein konzeptionelle Überlegungen unter bestimmten Umständen ein technisches Problem lösen können und somit prinzipiell schutzwürdig sind .
Ein Verfahren , welches das unmittelbare Zusammenwirken der Elemente eines Datenverarbeitungssystems betreffe , " ist stets technischer Natur " , heißt es in der jetzt veröffentlichten Entscheidung Xa ZB 20/08 ( PDF - Datei ) vom 22 .
April .
Dabei komme es nicht darauf an , " ob es in der Ausgestaltung , in der es zum Patent angemeldet wird , durch technische Anweisungen geprägt ist " .
Auf die Rechtsbeschwerde von Siemens hin hat der BGH so den Beschluss des Technischen Beschwerdesenats des Bundespatentgerichts vom 17 .
Januar 2008 aufgehoben .
Die Sache wird zur weiteren Verhandlung und Entscheidung , auch über die Kosten der Rechtsbeschwerde , an die niedere Instanz zurückverwiesen .
Das Patentamt hatte die zehn Ansprüche der 2002 eingereichten Anmeldung zunächst wegen " Fehlens erfinderischer Tätigkeit " zurückgewiesen .
Siemens legte daraufhin Beschwerde ein .
Der Konzern hielt darin den Großteil des Antrags unverändert und die Patentansprüche 1 und 10 in überarbeiteter Form aufrecht .
Das Bundespatentgericht wies das Begehr zur erneuten Überprüfung der Anmeldung zurück .
Zur Begründung holte es etwas weiter aus .
So hielten die Richter fest , dass mit den Ansprüchen eine Möglichkeit geschaffen werden solle , strukturierte , mit rechnerlesbaren Instruktionen versehene Dokumente wie Dateien im HTML - Format aus Vorlagedokumenten , die in einer Skript - oder skriptähnlichen Sprache wie Java Server Pages abgefasst seien , auch auf solchen Leitrechnern dynamisch zu generieren , deren zu geringe Leistungsfähigkeit die Installation einer vollständigen Skriptsprachen - Laufzeitumgebung wie einer Java Virtual Machine nicht zulasse .
Zur Lösung dieses Problems lehre Patentanspruch 1 , dass der Server aus den Anforderungsdaten für ein Dokument die Anfrageparameter extrahiere und diese durch ein Kontrollmodul auf den Befehlssatz des Leitrechners abbilde .
Die von den Dienstnehmern enthaltenen Anweisungen sollten ebenfalls extrahiert , auf den beschränkten spezifischen Befehlssatz des Schnittstellenmoduls des Leitrechners abgebildet und unter Hinzuziehung der abgebildeten Anfrageparameter in der Laufzeitumgebung des Kontrollmoduls ausgeführt werden .
Dies reiche nicht aus , um ein gewerbliches Schutzrecht zu erteilen .
Die beanspruchte Lehre müsse vielmehr Anweisungen enthalten , die der Lösung " eines konkreten technischen Problems mit technischen Mitteln " dienten , befand das Patentgericht .
Zwar möge die beanspruchte Lehre der Lösung eines grundsätzlich technischen Problems dienen , soweit sie versuche , durch eine bestimmte Weise der Erzeugung von Dokumenten die unterschiedliche Leistungsfähigkeit von Leitrechnern zu kompensieren .
Dies werde aber nicht durch den Einsatz technischer Mittel bewirkt , sondern beruhe auf konzeptionellen Überlegungen .
Damit verstoße der Anspruch gegen § 1 Absatz 3 des Patentgesetzes , der genauso wie Artikel 52 des Europäischen Patentübereinkommens ( EPÜ ) " Programme für Datenverarbeitungsanlagen " beziehungsweise Software " als solche " von der Patentierbarkeit ausschließt .
Siemens machte in der Beschwerde geltend , Computer und deren Programmierung gehörten zum Gebiet der Technik .
Die Verneinung der Technizität von Computerprogrammen sei eine von der Wirklichkeit nicht gedeckte Fiktion .
Computerprogramme seien dem Grunde nach technisch .
Dieser Ansicht schloss sich der BGH nun im Prinzip an .
Das Berufungsgericht betonte zunächst , dass das beanspruchte " System " aus Leitrechner und Client insgesamt " eine ( komplexe ) Datenverarbeitungsanlage " darstelle .
Weiter hält es unter Verweis auf die umstrittene BGH - Entscheidung zur Patentierbarkeit einer " Steuerungseinrichtung für Untersuchungsmodalitäten " vom vergangenen Jahr fest , dass es für das Technizitätserfordernis unerheblich sei , ob der Gegenstand einer Anmeldung neben technischen Merkmalen auch nicht - technische aufweise und welche dieser Merkmale die beanspruchte Lehre prägten .
Ob entsprechende Kombinationen patentfähig seien , hänge vielmehr allein davon ab , ob sie neu sind und auf einer erfinderischen Tätigkeit beruhen .
In den entscheidenden Urteilspassagen heißt es weiter , dass " ein technisches Mittel zur Lösung eines technischen Problems nicht nur dann " vorliege , " wenn Gerätekomponenten modifiziert oder grundsätzlich abweichend adressiert werden " .
Es reiche vielmehr auch aus , " wenn die Lösung gerade darin besteht , ein Datenverarbeitungsprogramm so auszugestalten , dass es auf die technischen Gegebenheiten der Datenverarbeitungsanlage Rücksicht nimmt " .
Diese Voraussetzung sei im vorliegenden Fall erfüllt .
Die erfindungsgemäße
Lehre betreffe , gibt der BGH dem Patentgericht recht , " das grundsätzliche Konzept für die Generierung dynamischer Dokumente " .
Die Berufungsrichter unterstreichen aber weiter , dass sich die Lehre so " an den Systemdesigner " wende , " der die Gesamtarchitektur des Datenverarbeitungssystems im Auge hat und die unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften und die Leistungsfähigkeit von Hard - und Softwarekomponenten berücksichtigt " .
Gerade deshalb gehe es um " den Einsatz technischer Mittel zur Lösung des zu Grunde liegenden technischen Problems " .
Dass die Lehre nicht auf konkrete Maßnahmen zur Abbildung der Anfrageparameter auf einen begrenzten Befehlssatz beschränkt , sondern eher abstrakt formuliert sei , werde aber bei der noch vorzunehmenden Prüfung von Neuheit und erfinderischer Tätigkeit zu berücksichtigen sein .
Für die dynamische Generierung statischer Webseiten wies das World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) bereits 2000 mit Standardisierungen für XML und XSLT einen Weg .
Es bleibt so trotz der Ansage des BGH fraglich , ob Siemens das Patent doch noch erhält .
In ersten Reaktionen zeigten sich Softwarepatentgegner enttäuscht von dem Beschluss .
Damit werde Software in Deutschland als unbegrenzt patentierbar eingestuft , erklärte der Patentblogger Florian Müller gegenüber heise online .
" Unter Umständen wird es jetzt zu einer Flut von Durchsetzungsklagen durch Patentinhaber gegen sogenannte Verletzer kommen . "
Hartmut Pilch vom Förderverein für eine Freie Informationelle Infrastruktur ( FFII ) betonte : " Wo Richterrecht zu Unrecht wird , ist der Gesetzgeber gefragt . "
Jetzt müsse " ein Ruck durch die Softwarebranche gehen und den Bundestag erreichen " .

He has also dropped the idea of Bloc Party for a while too , which leaves him free to pursue his solo material .
Fresh off of his work with Tiesto , Kele continues to go down the hard dance route with Tenderoni , which has a sound that is reminiscent of Fake Blood .

When the Nobel Foundation awarded Ray Davis and Masatoshi Koshiba the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics , it could have chosen to emphasize any of their many accomplishments .
Davis made his name detecting neutrinos from the sun — the first of these notoriously elusive particles ever seen from beyond our planet — and Koshiba discovered them coming from the great supernova explosion of 1987 .
Their work was an experimental tour de force and helped to establish that neutrinos , which theorists had assumed were massless , in fact have a small mass .
Yet the Nobel Foundation recognized Davis and Koshiba , above all , for establishing a new branch of science : neutrino astronomy .
In particular , Gates singled out a company called TerraPower , which designs nuclear reactors that run on depleted and unenriched uranium .
By producing power from these less pure forms of uranium , TerraPower 's reactors would produce electricity at a far lower cost than current nuclear plants , since they could use both spent fuel from other reactors and skip the costly enrichment process for newly mined uranium .
Plus , by running on used fuel rods , TerraPower reactors also solve the problem of nuclear waste .
So far , TerraPower reactors running on U - 238 have succeeded in computer simulations , but have yet to see action in the real world .
Listen up …
It is hard to believe but the guys of Top Gear have taken responsibility for the eruption of Iceland ’s Eyjafallajökull .
Yeah right !
We all know that they were spotted using Toyota ’s mighty Hilux on the ice and fire of a volcano somewhere in Iceland .
It now seems that they were on the slopes of the Eyjafallajökull just hours before its eruption brought chaos to the skies of Europe .
The vehicles used for the expedition were prepared by specialist firm Arctic Trucks to the same extreme environment specification as the Hilux used by Jeremy Clarkson and James May for their historic polar expedition .
With giant low pressure 38 inch tyres , the go - anywhere Hilux had the measure of every challenge in its path as it made its way through ice and snow towards the volcano ’s fiery heart .
The event was described as added proof that “ Top Gear is responsible for almost every evil in the modern world . ”
So now we know where to send our extra bills and transportations cost !

At Wondercon today , DC Comics announced that the long - delayed All - Star Batman and Robin is officially over -- but that the story will continue in a new series titled " Dark Knight : Boy Wonder . "
And rather than the All - Star universe , it will take place in the universe of " Dark Knight Returns , " " Dark Knight Strikes Again " and " Batman : Year One . "
More details on from DC :
" The first Chapter of the story of how Batman and Robin came to be has been told in issues 1 - 10 of ALL STAR BATMAN AND ROBIN , " said ALL STAR BATMAN AND ROBIN artist Jim Lee .
" Frank and I sat down just recently to have a long talk about how best to finish this very ' deadline challenged ' project and give the loyal fans the second part of this epic storyline they have been patiently waiting for .
Moreover , we wanted fans to know that this story is part of the overall Batman mythos and DARK KNIGHT RETURNS universe which Frank [ Miller ] started back in 1986 . "
Out of this meeting came the decision to rebrand the series DARK KNIGHT : BOY WONDER .
It will fit into the library of Frank Miller Batman titles : THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS , BATMAN : YEAR ONE and THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN . "
The good news is that they 're guaranteeing that all remaining six issues of the story will ship on time .
The bad news ?
It wo n't be happening til February 2011 .
But still , look at that art .
Massage helped relax people but no more than other cheaper therapies Massage is no more effective at cutting anxiety than deep breathing and soothing music , say US researchers .
The study of 68 people , reported in Depression and Anxiety , showed anxiety symptoms were halved for those given 10 massage sessions over three months .
But those given relaxation therapy , which is much cheaper , improved by the same amount .
Massage experts say the primary aim of massage is to treat damage to soft tissue rather than relaxation .
The study looked at people with generalised anxiety disorder , a condition involving excessive worry that makes normal life difficult .
The patients were given one of three treatments .
One group had massage .
The other two groups had relaxation therapy ( breathing deeply while lying down ) or thermotherapy ( having their arms and legs wrapped up intermittently with heating pads and warm towels ) .
We were surprised to find that the benefits of massage were no greater than those of the same number of sessions of ' thermotherapy ' or listening to relaxing music
Karen Sherman , lead researcher
All three therapies were given in a relaxing environment with soft lighting and quiet music .
At the end of the treatments , all three groups reported their anxiety had decreased by about 40 % - and about 50 % three months later .
Lead researcher , Dr Karen Sherman from the Seattle based Group Health Centre for Health Studies said they were surprised to find that the benefits of massage were no greater than those of the same number of sessions of ' thermotherapy ' or listening to relaxing music .
" This suggests that the benefits of massage may be due to a generalised relaxation response , " she said .
" Treatment in a relaxing room is much less expensive than the other treatments ( massage or thermotherapy ) , so it might be the most cost - effective option for people with generalised anxiety disorder who want to try a relaxation - oriented complementary medicine therapy . "
Tension
But massage organisations pointed out that massage aims to do more than relax people .
Susan Findlay , spokesman for the General Council for Massage Therapies , said massage was not just about dealing with emotional issues and relaxation .
" Massage therapists do corrective work with soft tissue such as muscles and tendons .
They try to make these tissues work as well as possible , " she said .
" However , by releasing tension in a shoulder for example , massage may also reduce pain and so make the person feel more relaxed .
" This can give the person being treated a powerful psychological boost . "

65 Jahre nach dem Niedergang : Der Mythos vom Retter und die Verantwortung der Kirchen
Dass Adolf Hitler und die NSDAP nach ihrem Machtantritt auf so große Zustimmung stießen , ist und bleibt ohne die begleitende Unterstützung der Volkskirchen nicht erklärbar .
In der Gestalt des Führers sahen die meisten deutschen Kirchenfürsten noch bis weit ins Jahr 1944 hinein einen Wundermann , den nur Gott der Nation geschenkt haben konnte .
Die Mehrzahl der Deutschen - Katholiken gleichermaßen wie Protestanten - übten sich nur zu gern im Glauben an die nationale Erhebung .
Noch im Angesicht der Katastrophe entschied der katholische deutsche Kardinal Bertram , ein Requiem für Hitler feiern zu lassen .
Deutschland während der NS - Herrschaft : 95 Prozent aller Deutschen waren entweder evangelisch oder katholisch .
Fast 32 Millionen Deutsche , über 40 Prozent , waren Katholiken .
Auch fast die gesamte Bevölkerung der europäischen Verbündeten Deutschlands - ganz Österreich und Italien - war katholisch .
Sogar die gefürchtete SS bestand im Jahre 1939 zu fast einem Viertel aus Katholiken , obwohl die SS - Führung darauf drängte , aus der Kirche auszutreten .
Wie war es möglich , dass Menschen mit einem von der Kirche geschulten Gewissen bereit waren , jedes von ihren Führern befohlene Verbrechen zu begehen ?
Der normale Bürger unterstützte Hitlers Kriege , weil sich die Kriegsziele mit seinem Gewissen vereinbaren ließen .
Hitlers Ziele galten auch für den einfachen Kirchenbesucher unstreitig als theologisch legitimiert .
Katholische und protestantische Kriegstheologie sind heute gleichermaßen gut überliefert ; das Interesse in Wissenschaft und Publizistik ist jedoch auch 65 Jahre nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs gedämpft .
Oft noch wird Geschichte als beliebige Verfügungsmasse gesehen und zweckentsprechend interpretiert .
Militärseelsorge , Kriegserfahrungen der Soldaten im Feld und der Gläubigen an der Heimatfront , der Einsatz von Zwangsarbeitern in kirchlichen Einrichtungen und die NS - Kirchenpolitik , das und vieles mehr wird gern den Spezialisten unter den Historikern oder Sozialpsychologen zur Aufarbeitung überlassen .
Dabei ist das Thema brandaktuell , kommt der braun - violette Bodensatz der Geschichte bei passender ( oder unpassender ) Gelegenheit doch erstaunlich rasch ans Licht .
Ein Beispiel lieferte unlängst der katholische deutsche Ordinarius Gerhard Ludwig Müller .
Als der Regensburger Oberhirte im März die laufende Berichterstattung über Missbrauch in der katholischen Kirche mit der kirchenfeindlichen Haltung des NS - Regimes gleichsetzte , mied er bei seinem Vergleich nicht nur die Schuldfrage der Kirche .
Müller ignorierte auch geflissentlich einige Jahrzehnte historischer Forschung .
Er offenbarte damit stramme systemtreue Vergesslichkeit sowie gravierende staatsbürgerliche Defizite .
Der Schuss zielte wohl in Richtung Medien und Öffentlichkeit - in Wahrheit ging er nach hinten los .
Katholizismus und Führerstaat
Die politische Funktion des Katholizismus der Jahre 1933 bis 1945 ist vielfach festgestellt worden und ohne die verquaste Ideologie des papistischen Systems und seiner Getreuen nicht zu begreifen .
Georg Werthmann , von 1936 bis 1945 Feldgeneralvikar der Deutschen Wehrmacht und von 1956 bis 1962 Generalvikar der deutschen Bundeswehr , äußerte sich interessanterweise in späteren Jahren einmal so :
Dokumente übernehmen die Rolle von schlechthin idealen Zeugen .
Sie sind keinem Erinnerungsverlust unterworfen und erliegen keiner Selbsttäuschung ; sie sind sinnlich und geistig unbestechliche Zeugen der Zeit .
Georg Werthmann
Bitter für alle Papisten , zu erkennen : Die großen christlichen Kirchen waren Grundbestandteil der europäischen Kriegsgesellschaften .
Dass der Katholizismus ' 33 bis ' 45 als nationale und supranationale ernst zu nehmende Widerstandskraft kaum in Erscheinung trat , ist heute unter Historikern unbestritten .
Zu den Verfolgten des III .
Reiches gehörten eben nicht an vorderster Front der katholische Klerus und seine Schäfchen .
Man könnte den Spieß umdrehen und sagen :
In großem Stil erwies sich der Krieg ja geradezu als moralischer Bankrott der Volkskirchen und ihrer Anhänger .
Die amtliche Gewissensbindung an den Führerstaat erfolgte katholischerseits per Statut im Sommer 1933 , im " Konkordat zwischen dem Heiligen Stuhl und dem Deutschen Reich " , veröffentlicht im Reichsgesetzblatt vom 18 .
September 1933 .
Artikel 14 des Konkordats bestimmte das Wohlverhalten des Klerus gegenüber dem NS - Staat .
Es hieß dort laut Absatz 2 :
Die Bulle für die Ernennung von Erzbischöfen , Bischöfen , eines Koadjutors cum jure successionis oder eine Praelatus nullius wird erst ausgestellt , nachdem der Name des dazu Ausersehenen dem Reichsstatthalter in dem zuständigen Lande mitgeteilt und festgestellt ist , daß gegen ihn Bedenken allgemein politischer Natur nicht bestehen .
Konkordat
Mit diesem Paragrafen war die Bestallung der oberen Amtsinhaber der Kirche in seltsamem Einvernehmen an die Staatsmacht geknüpft .
Artikel 16 ergänzt :
Bevor die Bischöfe von ihrer Diözese Besitz ergreifen , leisten sie in die Hand des Reichsstatthalters in dem zuständigen Lande bzw .
des Reichspräsidenten einen Treueid nach folgender Formel : " Vor Gott und auf die heiligen Evangelien schwöre und verspreche ich , so wie es einem Bischof geziemt , dem Deutschen Reich und dem Lande … Treue .
Ich schwöre und verspreche , die verfassungsmäßig gebildete Regierung zu achten und von meinem Klerus achten zu lassen .
In der pflichtmäßigen Sorge um das Wohl und das Interesse des deutschen Staatswesens werde ich in Ausübung des mir übertragenen geistlichen Amtes jeden Schaden zu verhüten trachten , der es bedrohen könnte . "
Konkordat
Während des ganzen Krieges erhielten die großen Kirchen staatliche Zuschüsse von der Hitlerregierung .
Für die katholische Kirche war das geregelt in Artikel 17 und 18 der Abmachung .
Am 20 .
Juli 1933 unterzeichneten Vizekanzler Franz von Papen ( Katholik und " Päpstlicher Kammerherr " ) und Kardinalstaatssekretär Eugenio Pacelli ( der spätere Papst Pius XII . ) im Vatikan den Konkordatsvertrag , der Bestand und Einrichtungen der katholischen Kirche im Reich sichern half .
Die beim Unterzeichnungsakt anwesenden Vertreter der abschlusswilligen Vertragsparteien repräsentierten auf der einen Seite den amtierenden Pontifex " Seine Heiligkeit Papst Pius XI. " , auf der anderen Seite den Deutschen Reichspräsidenten .
Laut Schlussprotokoll bestand ausdrücklich Einigkeit darüber , dass das Recht der Kirche , Steuern zu erheben , gewährleistet blieb .
Pacelli verlieh dem Abgesandten des Deutschen Reiches ein hohes päpstliches Ehrenzeichen : das Großkreuz des Piusordens .
Papen erwiderte die Huldigung mit einer fast meterhohen Rokoko - Statue der Madonna mit dem Heiligen Antonius aus feinstem Potsdamer Porzellan .
Der Arm des Staates reichte nach Artikel 30 des Abkommens bis in die kirchliche Liturgie und sorgte für die Verankerung der erwünschten patriotischen Gesinnung der Gläubigen sogar im Gebetsleben .
Ziel war die Loyalität der Kirche in Sachen Volk und Reich .
Gemäß einer einfachen , aber in den Konsequenzen weitreichenden Selbstverpflichtung hieß es : " An den Sonntagen und gebotenen Feiertagen wird in den Bischofskirchen sowie in den Pfarr - , 'Filial - und Klosterkirchen des Deutschen Reiches im Anschluß an den Hauptgottesdienst , entsprechend den Vorschriften der kirchlichen Liturgie , ein Gebet für das Wohlergehen des Deutschen Reiches und Volkes eingelegt . "
1933 festgeschrieben , sollte dies zu einer verhängnisvollen liturgischen Praxis bis in die Tage der Katastrophe hinein werden .
Der Pakt war geschlossen , die Geistlichkeit , deren Pfründe weitgehend gesichert waren , forderte lauthals dazu auf , den politischen Autoritäten zu folgen ( Konkordatstext mit Geheimanhang ) .
Das Passauer Bistumsblatt , das Mitteilungsorgan des dortigen Bischöflichen Stuhles , artikulierte die Haltung des Klerus am 20 .
April 1941 unter der Überschrift " Zum 52 . Geburtstag des Führers " unzweideutig :
In Deiner Hand , o Gott , liegt die Herrschaft über alle Reiche und Völker der Erde . (…)
Laß uns ein heldenhaftes Geschlecht sein und unserer
Ahnen würdig werden .
Segne die deutsche Wehrmacht , welche dazu berufen ist , den heimischen Herd zu schützen , und gib ihren Angehörigen die Kraft zum höchsten Opfer für das Vaterland .
Segne besonders unsern Führer und Obersten Befehlshaber in allen Aufgaben , die ihm gestellt sind .
Laß uns alle unter seiner Führung in der Hingabe an Volk und Vaterland eine heilige Aufgabe sehen , damit wir durch Glauben , Gehorsam und Treue die ewige Heimat erlangen … Passauer Bistumsblatt
An demselben Apriltag 1941 , dem " Tag des Führergeburtstags " , flog die deutsche Luftwaffe einen schweren Angriff gegen die britische Hauptstadt .
Der Münchner Kardinal Michael Faulhaber schrieb an Hitler : " Uns kommt es aufrichtig aus der Seele : Gott erhalte unserem Volk unseren Reichskanzler . "
Schnell , aber zu spät begriffen einige Bischöfe , welchen Preis sie für ihren Pakt mit dem Teufel zahlen würden .
Die meisten blieben blind .
So ermahnte der Osnabrücker Bischof Wilhelm Berning 1936 beim Besuch von Konzentrationslagern die aus religiösen Gründen eingekerkerten Gefangenen zum Gehorsam gegen den Staat und verabschiedete sich mit einem dreifachen " Sieg Heil " .

Während Hitler dabei war , Europa und die Welt in den mörderischen großen Krieg zu stürzen , posierte Pacelli , inzwischen Pius XII. , in den Gärten der päpstlichen Sommerresidenz Castel Gandolfo inmitten von eigens hingestellten jungen Lämmern vor der Kamera .
Die Aufnahmen wurden 1955 einem erstaunten Publikum in einer zehnseitigen Reportage in der französischen Starpostille " Paris Match " gezeigt : Der Pontifex als fürsorglicher Hirte .
Nicht genug damit , es gab sogar ein Stelldichein als regelrechter Filmstar .
1942 agierte Pius als Darsteller des Dokumentarfilms " Pastor Angelicus " ( Der engelgleiche Hirte ) , wobei er erstmals Einblick in die päpstlichen Privatgemächer gewährte .
Zurück in die Gegenwart , Frühjahr 2010 : Der Regensburger Bischof Müller hat allen Anlass , vorsichtiger zu sein .
Der historischen Wahrheit näher kommt man nur über Redlichkeit im Umgang mit der Geschichte .
Und hier weisen die Fakten in die Richtung : " Kirche " als Bollwerk der Verfolgten im Protest gegen das Unrechtsregime gab es nicht .
Im Gegenteil , " Kirche " im Nationalsozialismus stand vereint für Gott , Führer und Vaterland .
Katholisches deutsches Soldatentum wurde glatt mit Zuversicht , Gotteskraft , Todesbereitschaft und Ewigkeitsglauben gleichgesetzt .
In den Gottesdiensten betete man für den Sieg der völkischen Idee und gebrauchte gern die Idiomatik von einem " nationalen Opfergang " .
Der Münchner Weihbischof Ernst Tewes , während des Krieges als Wehrmachtsseelsorger im Einsatz , bezweifelt in seinen " Erinnerungen " ( München 1995 ) , " ob ein Priester je einem geraten hat , den Kriegsdienst zu verweigern .
Sie wären wohl auch von ihren Bischöfen nicht gedeckt worden . "
Auch schon vergessen :
Der deutsche Episkopat schürte während der NS - Herrschaftsjahre emsig den Hass auf den atheistischen " Bolschewismus " und zeigte sich Hitler gegenüber überaus dankbar , dass dieser den Kampf gegen den " wahren " Feind nun endlich konsequent aufnehme .
Hitlers Vernichtungskrieg , zumal im Osten , wurde auf die Weise pseudotheologisch legitimiert ; der katholische Soldat war Vollstrecker eines höheren Gedankens .
Dem entsprach der öffentliche Tonfall in den Gotteshäusern .
" Gut , Blut und Leben will ich dir geben " , das vielgesungene Kirchenlied war Ausdruck absoluter staatsbürgerlicher Loyalität , fundiert durch Glauben und Papsttreue .
Protestanten : Der Hirt muss Krieger sein !
Dass Protestanten sich bei den Machthabern der " Nationalen Erhebung " manchmal noch unerfreulicher anbiederten , kann den Katholiken kein Trost sein .
Bereits im April 1933 bekräftigten protestantische Kirchenvertreter ihre Solidarität mit dem Regime .
In einer Osterbotschaft des Evangelischen Oberkirchenrates von Altpreußen hieß es am 16.4.1933 : " Die Osterbotschaft von dem auferstandenen Christus ergeht in Deutschland in diesem Jahr an ein Volk , zu dem Gott durch eine große Wende gesprochen hat .
Mit allen evangelischen Glaubensgenossen wissen wir uns eins in der Freude über den Aufbruch der tiefsten Kräfte unserer vaterländischen Nation zu nationalem Bewusstsein , echter Volksgemeinschaft und religiöser Erneuerung .
Schon im Jahre 1927 hat die evangelische Kirche in ihrer Königsberger Botschaft feierlich erklärt : " Wir sind Deutsche und wollen Deutsche sein .
Unser Volkstum ist uns von Gott gegeben … Christentum und Deutschtum sind mehr als ein Jahrtausend eng miteinander verwachsen . "
Die evangelische Kirche , die sich als so " freudig bereit zur Mitarbeit an der nationalen und sittlichen Erneuerung unseres Volkes " ( ebenda ) zeigte , wurde alsbald zur treibenden nationalen Kraft .
" Der Hirt muss Krieger sein " , orakelte das Braunschweiger Volksblatt 1934 .
Nach dem Sieg über Frankreich schreibt die Zeitung linientreu : " In tiefer Demut beugen wir uns vor IHM , der unserm Volk die Gnade gegeben hat , so Großes zu vollbringen .
Er halte seine schützende Hand über unseren Führer und über alle , die unseres Landes Grenzen schirmen . " 1
In allen Stadt - und Landeskirchen Braunschweigs wurden Dankgottesdienste abgehalten .
Das protestantische Pfarrhaus als Topos der Kulturgeschichte behandelt der Film " Das weiße Band " von Michael Haneke .
" Das weiße Band " legt in beeindruckenden Bildern die Entstehungsbedingungen von Gewalt und Terror offen .
Es ist auch ein Film über den Weg , der vom Protestantismus des 19 .
und des frühen 20 .
Jahrhunderts zum Faschismus führt ( Die Farbe der Wahrheit ) .
Die Mehrzahl der protestantischen Pfarrer stand für die nationalsozialistische Bewegung .
Luthers Lehre von den zwei Reichen bildete die Grundlage für ein gutes Gewissen .
In Wahrheit führte diese Lehre zur Verkürzung des Evangeliums : durch die falsch verstandene Rolle des Staates und seiner Eigengesetzlichkeit .
Der Theologe Theodor Kuessner beschrieb das fatale Ineinander von vaterländischer Geschichte und Frömmigkeit in einem Briefwechsel mit seinem Sohn Dietrich .

Kuessner erinnert an die Emporen der Insterburger Lutherkirche , geschmückt mit den Bildern der Propheten und Apostel , " und nahtlos ging es weiter mit den Bildern der hohenzollernschen Landesfürsten . "
3 Damit markiert er die Linie bürgerlicher Frömmigkeit und patriotischer Volksverbundenheit .
Dem protestantischen Bürgertum unter Hitler kam entgegen , dass das erste Kabinett Legalität und Kontinuität versprach ; zu den Ministern zählten auch führende Politiker bürgerlicher Parteien .
Neuanfang , nationale Erhebung , Anbruch eines " neuen Tages " , lauter Parolen , die das Gefühl und die Instinkte ansprachen und sich während der Olympischen Spiele in Berlin 1936 in einer trügerischen Demonstration zeigten , beeindruckten Protestanten und Katholiken im Reich gleichermaßen .

Zu Wortführern der Protestanten machten sich Zeitgenossen wie der thüringische Landesbischof Martin Sasse von den " Deutschen Christen " , der im November 1938 - kurz nach der Reichspogromnacht - Martin Luthers Abhandlung " Von den Juden und ihren Lügen " neu auflegte , wobei er vielsagend ins Vorwort schrieb :
Am 10 .
November 1938 , an Luthers Geburtstag , brennen in Deutschland die Synagogen .
...
In dieser Stunde muss die Stimme des Mannes gehört werden , der als der Deutschen Prophet ... der größte Antisemit seiner Zeit geworden ist , der Warner seines Volkes wider die Juden ... Landesbischof Martin Sasse
Artikel 24 des NSDAP - Programms enthielt den Begriff eines " positiven Christentums " .
Darunter verstand man ein aktionistisches Christsein , ein von jüdisch - römischer " Sklavenmoral " befreites " heldisches Überwindungschristentum " .
Die " Deutschen Christen " ( DC ) übten sich in dieser Ideologie und erstrebten als protestantische Bewegung die Angleichung der Kirche an die Nationalsozialistische Doktrin .
Sie erhofften sich von der NSDAP einen reindeutschen Volkskörper und die Zusammenführung der zersplitterten 29 evangelischen Kleinkirchen zu einer geeinten und starken " Reichskirche " .
Christoph Kleine formuliert in einer Arbeit der Universität Marburg das Programm wie folgt :
Das " deutsch- christliche Programm " von 1932 forderte ein " Positives Christentum , Kampf gegen den Marxismus , gegen Juden , Weltbürgertum und Freimaurerei , Reinerhaltung der Rasse und Schutz des Volkes vor Entartung " .
Auf einer Großkundgebung in Berlin am 13 .
November 1933 sagte der Gauobmann der Deutschen Christen von Großberlin , Reinhold Krause , vor 20.000 Zuhörern : " Voraussetzung für den Bau der deutschen Volkskirche sei die Befreiung von allem Undeutschen im Gottesdienst und im Bekenntnismäßigen , [ und ]
Befreiung vom Alten Testament mit seiner jüdischen Lernmoral [ … ] " .
Er forderte zudem , dass " alle offenbar entstellten und abergläubischen Berichte des Neuen Testaments entfernt [ … ] und [ … ] ein grundsätzlicher Verzicht auf die ganze Sündenbock - und Minderwertigkeitstheologie des Rabbiners Paulus ausgesprochen " werden .
Christoph Kleine
Bischof Sasse , deutschchristlicher Kirchenführer in Thüringen , gehörte zu denen , die seit 1938 die " Entjudung der Kirche " programmatisch vorantrieben .
Zu diesem Zweck wurde am 4 .
April 1939 auf Betreiben maßgeblicher Kreise der Deutschen Christen durch 13 evangelische Landeskirchen in Eisenach ein " Entjudungsinstitut " mit pseudowissenschaftlichem Status gegründet .
Sein Leiter wurde Oberregierungsrat Siegfried Leffler .
Hauptamtliche Mitarbeiter waren Walter Grundmann , Professor für Neues Testament an der Universität Jena , Heinz Hunger , Pfarrer in Eisenach , und Max - Adolf Wagenführer , Theologe in Jena , als wissenschaftlicher Assistent .
Nahezu 200 Mitarbeiter , darunter hohe Geistliche , Konsistorialräte , Professoren , Doktoren , Pastoren , Religionspädagogen und Regierungsbeamte sollten dem Institut in zehn Arbeitskreisen bei der " Entjudung von Theologie und Kirche " zur Verfügung stehen .
Damit unterwarfen sich großer
Teile des theologischen und kirchlichen Personals der protestantischen deutschen Landeskirchen der NS - Ideologie .
" Blutige Saat " und " Segensernte "
Bereits im Frühjahr 1934 , nachdem die Deutschen Christen durch die linientreue Umsetzung des Arierparagraphen alle kirchlichen Amtsinhaber jüdischer Abstammung von der Amtsausübung ausschließen wollten , gründete sich als Gegenbewegung die " Bekennende Kirche " ( BK ) .
Auch diese unternahm nichts dagegen , dass Juden , die zum evangelischen Glauben konvertiert waren , von kirchlichen Ämtern ferngehalten und letztendlich sogar ausgeschlossen wurden - von einem Eintreten für die verfolgten Juden insgesamt ganz zu schweigen .
Im Sommer 1934 trafen sich die Landesbischöfe Meiser und Wurm mit Hitler .
Sie bekundeten die innerkirchliche Lehropposition der Bekennenden Kirche gegenüber der Lehre der Deutschen Christen , sicherten dem Führer aber die politische Loyalität der Bekennenden Kirche zu . " Widerstand " leistete die BK nur gegen die Versuche des Staates , in das kirchliche Selbstbestimmungsrecht einzugreifen .
" Die BK war eher ein stabilisierender Faktor für die Nazis als ein Hindernis " , urteilt der Historiker Karl - Ludwig Sommer in seiner Habilitationsschrift .
4
Das Bekenntnis zu " Christus " war für die BK kein Widerspruch zur politischen Ergebenheit gegenüber Hitler .
Der als " Kirchenkampf " bezeichnete Konflikt war lediglich ein Streit um innerkirchliche Angelegenheiten , er bedeutete nicht den kirchlichen Widerstand gegen das Unrechtsregime .
Am 21 .
Juli 1944 , unmittelbar nach dem Attentat auf Hitler , ordnete Landesbischof Marahrens im Namen der Evangelisch - lutherischen Landeskirche Hannovers unter dem Titel : " Dank für die gnädige Errettung des Führers " ein gebetsvolles Gedenken an .
Im Kirchlichen Amtsblatt Hannover legten Bischof und Landeskirchenamt den folgenden Gebetstext als amtliches Muster vor :
Heiliger barmherziger Gott !
Vom Grunde unseres Herzens danken wir Dir , daß Du unserm Führer bei dem verbrecherischen Anschlag Leben und Gesundheit bewahrt und ihn unserem Volke in einer Stunde höchster Gefahr erhalten hast .
In Deine Hände befehlen wir ihn .
Nimm ihn in Deinen gnädigen Schutz .
Sei und bleibe Du sein starker Helfer und Retter ( … ) .
Sei mit unserem tapferen Heere .
Laß unsere Soldaten im Aufblick zu Dir kämpfen ; im Ansturm der Feinde sei ihr Schild , im tapferen Vordringen ihr Geleiter .
Erhalte unserem Volke in unbeirrter Treue Mut und Opfersinn .
Hilf uns durch Deine gnädige Führung auf den Weg des Friedens und laß unserem Volke aus der blutigen Saat des Krieges eine Segensernte erwachsen .
Hier zeigt sich exemplarisch der Moralkodex einer gänzlich missratenen patriotischen " Sinngebung " .
Im Hintergrund die Ideologie des " gesunden Volksempfindens " , eine Orientierung , die an die Stelle von Recht und Moral getreten war .
Aber war 1944 das " gesunde Volksempfinden " im Sinne unbedingter Staatsloyalität noch " intakt " ?
Längst war klar :
In den Kriegszielen kam es zwischen NS - Regierung und Kirche zu jener furchtbaren " Teilidentität " , von der die historische Wissenschaft heute ausgeht ; eine Übereinstimmung , die sich in der " Gemeinsamkeit des Handelns " auf fatale Weise niederschlug .
Das " Wegsehen " der Kirchenoberen bei Hitlers mörderischen Feldzügen , die Inkaufnahme der verbrecherischen Befehle sind nicht unerheblich auf die Wirkung der NS - Ideologie bis tief hinein in den kirchlichen Gedankenkosmos zurückzuführen .
Nicht nur , um den Krieg zu gewinnen , wurde dort über die Verbrechen hinweggesehen , sondern auch , weil viele Gläubige die Theorie vom " Untermenschen " verinnerlicht hatten .
Vielfach verdrängt bis heute ist auch das Schicksal der - nach gut recherchierten Schätzungen - etwa 200.000 " Euthanasie " - Opfer in Nazi-Deutschland , die in Gaskammern der Tötungsanstalten oder durch Überdosen von Medikamenten und Nahrungsentzug umgebracht wurden .
Das geschah nicht ohne Wissen der Kirchen .
Und der Blutzoll der siegreichen Kämpfer ?
Von den zwischen 1939 und 1945 über 17 Millionen eingezogenen Wehrmachtssoldaten ließen etwa 4,7 Millionen ihr Leben ( Tod durch Kriegshandlungen und Verluste deutscher Kriegsgefangener ; nicht eingerechnet fast 1,3 Millionen " Wehrmachtsvermisste " , anders Wikipedia , vgl. auch hier ) .
Die " Helden " waren in Wahrheit nur Menschenmaterial , aber der Opfermythos wurde auch auf den Gräbern im eisigen Winter des Russlandfeldzuges und im Angesicht des vollständigen Ruins noch zelebriert .
Dazu zählte die Ideologie vom doppelten Treuebruch : vom Treuebruch am " Führer " , auf den der Soldat vereidigt war , und vom Treuebruch an der " Volksgemeinschaft " .
Im Sinne der sozialdarwinistischen
Idee gab es keine Nachsicht mit den " Minderwertigen " , in den eigenen Reihen auch nicht mit " Stimmungslabilen " oder " Willensschwachen " .
Was hatten die Kirchen dem entgegenzusetzen ?
Es waren leer klingende Formeln von Glaube und Manneszucht , " geistiger Wehrhaftigkeit " , heldischer Tugend , Tapferkeit , Pflichterfüllung , Gehorsam und Treue bis in den Tod.
Mit Hilfe der Kirchen - und nur auf diese Weise - gelang neben der militärischen Mobilmachung eine beispiellose Mobilisierung der Herzen und der Gemüter .
Was folgte , war ein spätes , ein viel zu spätes Erwachen .
Ein Requiem für Hitler
Aber wurden 1944 /45 alle Deutschen wach , namentlich diejenigen , die in verantwortlichen Stellungen amteten ?
Die Frage ist wohl berechtigt und auch 65 Jahre nach Kriegsende , im Jahr des Missbrauchsskandals , angebracht .
Der damalige Vorsitzende der reichsdeutschen Bischofskonferenz , der Breslauer Erzbischof Adolf Kardinal Bertram , zeigte sich noch im Angesicht der Katastrophe 1945 unbeirrt staatstreu und nationalbewusst .
Als " Senior des deutschen Episkopats " , das heißt mit dem Anspruch , Sprecher des ganzen deutschen Katholizismus zu sein , hatte Bertram zwischen 1940 und 1944 persönlich mit Hitler korrespondiert .
Adolf Kardinal Bertram , Fürstbischof von Breslau ( 14.3.1859 - 6.7.1945 )
Und nun , unmittelbar nachdem Hitler seinem Leben in der Reichskanzlei ein feiges und schmähliches Ende gesetzt hatte , gab der 86 jährige Kirchenobere , selbst schon aus Breslau geflohen und von Krankheit gezeichnet , Anfang Mai 1945 noch eigenhändig allen Pfarrämtern seiner Erzdiözese Anweisung ,
ein feierliches Requiem zu halten im Gedenken an den Führer und alle im Kampf für das deutsche Vaterland gefallenen Angehörigen der Wehrmacht , zugleich verbunden mit innigstem Gebete für Volk und Vaterland und für die Zukunft der katholischen Kirche in Deutschland .
Erzbischof Adolf Kardinal Bertram
Die eigenhändige Niederschrift dieser Anweisung ist erhalten ; ob sie noch ausgeführt wurde , ist unklar .
Sie zeigt aber die Stilisierung des " Führers " als eines Heiligen bis zum bitteren Ende , bis über den Tod hinaus , allen offenkundigen Erweisen seines pathologischen Charakters und seiner kriminellen Absichten zum Trotz .
Hier wird der Verlust an moralischer Orientierung und Glaubwürdigkeit auf oberster Leitungsebene besonders sinnfällig ; Gut und Böse zu unterscheiden war einer bis zur Selbstaufgabe angepassten Kirche im III .
Reich offensichtlich nicht mehr möglich .
Die Theologie des Nationalismus hatte ihren innersten Kern bloßgelegt , der auf Machterhalt angelegt war .
Mit welchen Folgen ?
Kardinal Bertram , Manuskript der Anweisung zum Requiem für den " Führer "
Die frommen Steigbügelhalter des NS - Staates überstanden den Zusammenbruch des tausendjährigen Reiches erstaunlich gut .
Wie Phönix aus der Asche stiegen beide Kirchen zu neuer Machtfülle auf .
Neue und alte Privilegien bewiesen die erstaunliche Stabilität der'kirchlichen Systeme abseits jeder Logik : Wohl auch ein Kunststück kollektiver Vergesslichkeit weiter Bevölkerungskreise ( " Keine Schuld , keine Verdrängung " ) .
Die klerikale Verbundenheit mit den tragenden Ideen des Nationalsozialismus sollte plötzlich in der bundesrepublikanischen Öffentlichkeit keine Rolle mehr spielen ; Nationalstolz ; Opfermythos und Mannesehre suchten nach anderen Ausdrucksformen .
Auch die manchmal zitierte Enzyklika " Mit brennender Sorge " Pius ’ XI .
hatte den Lauf der Dinge nicht aufgehalten , hatte die politische Meinungs - und Willensbildung der NS - Diktatur , ihrer Propagandisten und Satrapen weder verändert noch gestoppt .
Der Zivilisationsbruch , den der Holocaust bedeutet , war nicht abgewehrt worden .
Aber er war auch kein Naturereignis , als das ihn die Propheten einer rassistischen und nationalbiologistischen Ideologie verkündet hatten und als das man ihn nach 1945 gar zu gern wieder sehen wollte .
Erstaunt reagierten Juden und auch viele Katholiken auf die von Benedikt XVI . im Februar 2008 formulierte Karfreitagsfürbitte für die alte tridentinische Liturgie .
Darin heißt es : " Lasset uns auch beten für die Juden : Dass unser Gott und Herr ihre Herzen erleuchte , damit sie Jesus Christus als den Heiland aller Menschen anerkennen . "
Das war zwar keine Rückkehr zur Formulierung von den " treulosen " Juden , die noch unter Pius XII .
gegolten hatte , aber Vertreter des Judentums und viele Katholiken erblickten darin eine Aufforderung zur Judenmission , die der Vatikan prompt dementierte .
In den heutigen Strukturen der Macht , deren Umrisse hinter den jahrzehntelang verschwiegenen Missbrauchsfällen sichtbar werden , erkennt man den Schatten der Vergangenheit wieder .
Einer unrühmlichen Vergangenheit , die selbst dem offenkundigsten Verbrecher und Täter noch Asyl gewährte .
" Ich erinnere mich in tiefer Dankbarkeit an die Hilfe katholischer Priester bei meiner Flucht aus Europa und entschied , den katholischen Glauben zu honorieren , indem ich Ehrenmitglied wurde " , ließ Adolf Eichmann 1961 eine erstaunte Öffentlichkeit wissen .
5
1945 lag Deutschland in Trümmern - und suchte verzweifelt nach einer geistigen Orientierung .
Die Frage , inwieweit eine ganze Generation am Entstehen einer menschenverachtenden Diktatur und an deren furchtbaren Verbrechen mitschuldig war , stand im Raum , wurde jedoch angesichts der äußeren wie inneren
Not ebenso schnell verdrängt .
Die Kirche brachte es sogar fertig , in der Stunde Null das moralische Gewissen der am Boden liegenden Nation vorzutäuschen .
Von Proudhon ist der Spruch überliefert : " Es ist überraschend , dass wir am Grunde der Politik stets der Theologie begegnen . "
Das wäre ein guter Satz ins Stammbuch des Regensburger Bischofs Gerhard Ludwig Müller .
Er sieht 65 Jahre nach Kriegsende die Kirche verfolgt und greift zu politisch inkorrekten Vergleichen .
Während die katholische
Welt durch den anhaltenden Missbrauchsskandal verunsichert ist , päppeln die Verantwortlichen Groll gegen angebliche Verschwörer und machen sie unter den Journalisten aus .
Aber noch in einem anderen Punkt liegt der Regensburger Ordinarius voll daneben .
Indem er die heutige Rolle kritischer Medien der NS - Propaganda der Hitlerjahre gleichstellt , zeigt er nämlich , dass er nicht nur unter Erinnerungsverlust leidet , sondern auch grundsätzlich nicht verstanden hat , wie Demokratie funktioniert .
Vom moralischen Auftrag und der Verantwortung seiner Kirche vor der Geschichte ganz zu schweigen .

A containment dome has been lowered to the site of a massive oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , a BP spokesman said Friday .
The hope is that the container will collect the leaking oil , which would be sucked up to a drill ship on the surface .
If the operation is successful , BP plans to deploy a second , smaller dome to deal with a second leak in the ruptured pipe .
An oil slick has been spreading across the northern Gulf of Mexico since late April , when the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River .
BP owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick .
Efforts to shut down the well have failed , leaving it spewing about 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico .

Yet - Ming Chiang relishes his 20 - mile drive to work .
His hybrid car gets more than 100 miles per gallon , recharges by plugging into a regular wall outlet and purrs so quietly that it ’s his favorite place for making important phone calls .
But what makes Chiang ’s ordinary - looking beige Toyota Prius even more special is that it ’s powered by a breakthrough battery that he invented and is working to turn into the kind of high - tech , green , “ Made in America ” product that many see as the key to the nation ’s economic future .
Safer and longer - lasting than conventional lithium - ion car batteries , the 52 - year old MIT professor ’s invention packs 600 cells into a case the size of an airplane carry - on bag .
His technology has transformed the batteries used in many cordless power tools .
So why are Chiang and his company , A123 Systems , having trouble moving to full - scale commercial production and creating thousands of new American jobs with his better mousetrap ?
The answer is a story of the obstacles to a rebirth of U.S. manufacturing , and of the tantalizing possibilities if such a rebirth could be achieved .
For Chiang ’s company has one foot in China and the other in the U.S. , reflecting the forces that drive manufacturers overseas and the potential for a renaissance at home .
The obstacles here are rooted in the sad history of manufacturing ’s decline in the United States : Despite the promise of Chiang ’s batteries , many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley were incredulous when he and other leaders at A123 asked for capital to build factories in America — Asia , yes , but Michigan , why would you want to ?
Even more daunting , nearly all of the world ’s battery manufacturing industry is in Asia , where plants can be built faster and supplies and equipment are much easier to get than in the United States .
These days , it ’s hard to find Americans who even know how to build a battery factory .
That ’s why A123 had to give in and build its first plants in China , where the company could move into production quickly to show auto industry customers that it could deliver on future contracts .
“ Without question , we would rather have done it all in the U.S. , ” said Chiang , who left Taiwan as a 6 - year - old with his family , earned degrees at MIT and has been a materials science professor there since the mid-1980s .
“ I ’m an American citizen .
We ’re an American company .
It ’s an American - born technology . ”
Despite the obstacles , A123 and a few other advanced battery producers are building plants in Michigan and other states , thanks to massive government support that has offset Wall Street ’s skepticism and should help domestic producers narrow cost disadvantages with Asian rivals .
A123 is getting $ 250 million in aid from the Obama administration ’s stimulus program as well as tax incentives from Michigan .
Its first U.S. plant opens in June in an abandoned brick building near Detroit that once made VHS tapes for Disney .
That achievement is a testament to American inventiveness , still - flourishing entrepreneurism and a belated conclusion on the part of government that making things in America is crucial to the nation ’s economic future .
“ Too often we ’ve done the innovation and we ’ve outsourced the manufacturing , ” said Matt Rogers , a senior advisor to Secretary of Energy Steven Chu .
“ That ’s where A123 becomes important . ”
Such talk challenges the long - held view that the U.S. economy could continue to prosper even when manufacturing moved overseas , so long as Americans churned out the best research and ideas for high - value products .
But recent experience has suggested that big manufacturing complexes devoted to a single industry , such as those in China , act as magnets for research - and - development facilities too .
Chiang , who wears big silver - rimmed glasses and smiles easily , won an initial $ 100,000 grant from the Energy Department in late 2001 .
It helped pay graduate students who , working in an MIT lab on a June night in 2002 , suddenly shouted the battery developer ’s equivalent of eureka : “ Higher power ! ”
The team was testing nanoscale phosphate materials as a substitute for the cobalt that ’s used in conventional lithium - ion batteries .
The results surprised even Chiang .
“ Keep going , keep going , ” he told his students that night as they logged discharge rates five to 10 times those of other high - powered lithium - ion batteries .
The idea of applying the battery to electric vehicles was n’t far from Chiang ’s mind ; achieving rapid acceleration from a reasonably sized battery was crucial for hybrids .
“ Gee , what can you really enable if you can do this ? ” he thought to himself .
Yet going from lab results to commercial products and mass production looked daunting .
After all , rechargeable lithium - ion battery technologies were pioneered in the United States in the early 1990s , but their most lucrative application , for laptops and cellphones , gave companies in Asia a huge advantage because almost all electronics design and manufacturing had shifted to that part of the world .
Japanese firms such as Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. led early commercial developments in the field .
Then South Korea and China built up such scale and low - cost production capabilities that large U.S. battery makers such as Duracell and Eveready could n’t compete .
American manufacturing in the last three decades is replete with similar stories .
That came across when David Vieau , A123 ’s chief executive , made the rounds seeking capital in Silicon Valley and on Route 128 , Boston ’s version of California ’s high - tech hub .
“ A majority of the people liked the idea of letting someone else make things , ” said Vieau , sitting in his small office at A123 headquarters in Watertown , a Boston suburb .
“ In the software - oriented , Internet - age investment environment , ‘ they ’ suggested you do the thinking and let someone else put together the bricks and mortar . ”
With limited funds , the company went to Asia .
A123 has five plants in China , coincidentally located in Chiang ’s father ’s hometown of Changzhou , about two hours ’ drive west of Shanghai .
Bart Riley , an A123 co-founder and chief technology officer , figured it took about nine months to get a Chinese factory up and running , one - third the time typical for the U.S .
The quicker launch helped A123 make a name for itself through Black & Decker , which in early 2006 began putting A123 batteries in its DeWalt power tools .
Since then , A123 has been supplying batteries and battery systems for New York City buses built by Daimler , among other customers , and the company has agreements to develop products for Chrysler , Navistar and American green - car maker Fisker Automotive .
But in ramping up production in China , A123 paid an immeasurable price : loss of its intellectual property , the ideas and engineering that made its products better .
The company did what it could to slow the technology transfer by breaking down the manufacturing process into steps , Riley said , but “ we ended up having to teach these guys how to make our state - of - the - art , world - class batteries .
…
And some of them are now competing with us directly . ”
By the end of next year , A123 expects to have two plants in Michigan employing 400 people , with plans to go up to 2,000 workers able to produce about 30,000 battery systems a year .
The company ’s sales reached $ 91 million last year , and it has about 1,700 employees , two - thirds in Asia .
If experts are right , sales of hybrid and electric cars will begin to take off next year , putting at least 1 million such vehicles on American roads by 2015 .
“ If we win more [ orders ] , we get more jobs , ” said Sean Hendrix , a top program manager at Enerdel , a rival lithium - ion car battery maker based in Indianapolis .
U.S. officials see green cars as an opportunity to revive American automaking and , with other clean - energy manufacturing , reverse decades of declining factory employment .
In addition to backing battery makers , President Obama ’s stimulus package awarded millions of dollars to build domestic factories supplying separators and other crucial parts for advanced car cells .
For battery makers , the need to be close to vehicle - producing customers , hefty shipping costs and the high degree of automation also argue for substantial domestic production over the long haul .
Labor costs wo n’t be on their side .
Average wages for production workers at major suppliers to carmakers run about $ 13.50 an hour in Michigan , about five times the rate in Changzhou .
Chiang is betting that America ’s superior technological capabilities will not only help close cost gaps but also force foreign rivals to keep chasing American innovations .
He thinks that may be the only way , apart from government policies , to ensure his company and green - car manufacturing in the United States flourish .
“ It ’s going to be a fight , ” he said .

Palestinian Authority Economy Minister Hassan Abu Libdeh warned Palestinians on Thursday against shopping at Rami Levy supermarkets in the West Bank .
Thousands of Palestinians converge every day on the Rami Levy supermarkets at Sha’ar Binyamin and Mishor Adumim , the only two branches in the West Bank .
The two stores also employ dozens of Palestinians .
This was the first threat of its kind issued by the PA against Palestinians who visited the Israeli supermarkets , which are named after their founder .
Levy , who was born in a tin shack in Jerusalem ’s Nahlaot neighborhood in 1955 , founded the company in 1976 .
He has never lived in a settlement .
The supermarket chain has 16 branches all over the country .
Abu Libdeh said in an interview with the local Al - Watan TV station thatthe PA knew the names of individuals and families who shop in the RamiLevy stores .
He condemned the phenomenon of Palestinians buying goods at the Israeli supermarkets in the West Bank as a “ big disgrace . ” Abu Libdeh said the PA was serious in implementing the decision toboycott settlement - made goods .
Nevertheless , he denied that the boycottwas politically motivated or had anything to do with the resumption ofindirect negotiations between the PA and Israel .
The boycott was intended to “ cleanse ” the Palestinian market ofsettlement products and boost Palestinians ’ confidence in theirnational products , he said .
Democrats feel they have grabbed political momentum , but the party still faces several dangers that could wipe it out in November .
Democratic strategists and independent political experts identify roughly five stumbling blocks that the party must overcome to avert big losses : history , jobs and the economy , an apathetic base , ethics and anti-Washington sentiment .
Almost every Democratic strategist acknowledges the party will lose seats in Congress this fall .
The question is whether the loss will be moderate or severe , or even enough to give Republicans control of the House .

History
Since 1932 , the president ’s party has gained seats in the Senate and House only twice in midterm elections : in 1934 , during Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s first term , when Democrats picked up nine Senate seats and nine House seats ; and 2002 , during George W. Bush ’s first term , when Republicans captured two Senate seats and eight House seats .
In 1998 , at the height of impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton William ( Bill ) Jefferson ClintonNew poll finds Biden narrowly leading Trump in Georgia Changing the climate of presidential debates Davis :
My advice to Joe Biden on eve of the debate — be Joe Biden MORE , Democrats picked up five House seats and the Senate ratios did n’t change .
The president ’s party has seen some spectacular wipeouts in the first midterm election of a new administration .
Clinton saw Democrats lose 52 House seats and eight Senate seats in 1994 .
President Ronald Reagan ’s ( R ) party lost 26 House seats in 1982 , although it picked up a seat in the Senate .
Over the past 19 midterm elections , the president ’s party has lost an average of 25.8 seats in the House and 3.4 seats in the Senate .
Obama ’s job approval is not significantly higher than his predecessors ’ .
A recent Gallup poll showed the president with a 48 percent approval rating .

Clinton had a 48 percent rating and Reagan had a 42 percent rating shortly before the first midterm elections of their presidencies .
Jobs and the economy
“ Jobs , jobs , jobs and jobs , ” said Democratic strategist Chris Lehane when asked about the five biggest political dangers facing Democrats this year .
“ You could say jobs five times and that ’s really it . ”
Lehane , who worked for Al Gore Albert ( Al ) Arnold GoreUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing Mellman : Do debates matter ?
Compromise , yes — but how ?
A pre-debate suggestion MORE ’s 2000 presidential campaign , said Democrats need to convince voters they are fighting as hard as possible to create jobs and show results .
“ There has to be a singular focus and a plan to deal with job growth , ” he said .
“ There ’s enormous anxiety in the country and it all comes back to concern about our economy and jobs . ”
Lehane said that the economy does n’t need to show “ significant job growth ” but that people “ need to think we ’re on the right track . ”
The economy added 162,000 jobs in March , of which 48,000 were temporary workers hired by the Census Bureau .
Private economists such as Mark Zandi predict job growth could slow later this year when the bureau terminates those positions .
Tad Devine , a Democratic strategist who worked on Sen. John Kerry John Forbes KerryMellman :
Do debates matter ?
President Trump faces Herculean task in first debate Trump , Biden have one debate goal : Do n't lose MORE ’s ( D - Mass . ) 2004 presidential campaign , said the economy would need to create about 125,000 a month in the run-up to the election .
Other Democratic strategists have said any positive growth would be enough to show progress to voters .
They say candidates can make a strong case by comparing even modest growth to the months in late 2008 and early 2009 , when the economy was losing more than 650,000 jobs a month .
The apathetic liberal base
Ross K. Baker , a professor of political science at Rutgers University , notes that many liberal Democrats are disillusioned by Obama ’s policy positions .
“ There ’s a question of how fired up the base is , ” said Baker .
“ A lot of people of the Democratic base have issues with the president on a number of things . ”
Environmentalists , such as leaders of the Sierra Club , are not happy with Obama ’s proposal to open millions of acres off the mid- and south - Atlantic coasts to oil and gas drilling .
Hispanic voters have pushed for action on immigration reform , but there has been little progress made .
Gay - rights advocates have clashed with the administration over the “ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy that prohibits gays from serving openly in the military .
Liberal pacifists have expressed dismay over Obama ’s decision to boost troop levels in Afghanistan .
“ The one part of the base that is solidly in his corner is African - Americans , ” Baker said .
But he noted that African - American turnout would likely be reduced in a non-presidential election year .
Democratic strategists , however , note that passage of healthcare reform has started to coalesce the base , even though the new law lacks the government - run insurance plan that many liberals wanted .

Democrats captured Congress in 2006 by claiming that a “ culture of corruption ” had flourished under Republicans .
They pledged to “ drain the swamp ” of Washington politics and were helped by the late - breaking sex scandal involving former Rep. Mark Foley ( R - Fla . ) and House pages .
Republicans will try to play the ethics card against Democrats this year , and Exhibit A will be Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y . ) .
Rangel stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee last month after the ethics committee admonished him for taking corporate - sponsored trips to the Caribbean .

Republicans will also attack Democratic leaders ’ handling of sexual harassment allegations against Rep. Eric Massa ( D - N.Y. ) , who resigned last month .
Republicans may also highlight ethics allegations against the late Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , the former chairman of the Appropriations Defense subcommittee , who was accused of steering earmarks to campaign contributors .
To pre-empt allegations of corruption in the appropriations process , House Democrats last month decided to ban earmarks to private corporations .
Senate Democrats have shown little inclination to follow suit , which Craig Holman , legislative representative for Public Citizen , a left - leaning public interest group , said could turn out to be a mistake .
“ That ’s a big mistake , ” said Holman .
“ Money and politics will be a big issue in 2010 . ”
Democrats have a powerful counterargument to make by raising the alleged misconduct of lawmakers such as Sens. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) and David Vitter David Bruce VitterLysol , Charmin keep new consumer brand group lobbyist busy during pandemic Bottom line Bottom line MORE ( R - La . ) .
Ensign admitted to an affair with a former aide who was married to his chief of staff .
Ensign later found a job for the chief of staff and his parents paid the couple $ 96,000 .
Vitter , who is up for reelection , was connected to a prostitution ring in 2007 .
Anti-Washington sentiment

When he accepted the Democratic nomination in August 2008 , Obama pledged to fix the “ broken politics of Washington . ”
Nearly two years later , Washington has become , by most accounts , more partisan .
Routine legislative measures , such as an extension of unemployment benefits and a freeze in cuts to doctors ’
Medicare reimbursements , have become heavy lifts .
An estimated 200,000 Americans are expected to lose unemployment insurance this week because of failure to reach compromise on a one - week extension .
Democratic strategists note that Republicans are n’t faring any better than Democrats in generic public opinion surveys .
But they admit the national mood is more of a problem for Democrats because they control more seats in Congress .
“ It ’s an anti-incumbent year and we have more incumbents than [ Republicans ] do , ” said Erik Smith , who served as a senior aide to former House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt ( Mo. ) .
Smith contrasted this year to 2006 , which he called an anti-Republican year , and 1994 , which he called an anti-Democratic year — two election years when control of Congress flipped .
Smith said a lot of “ marginal ” Democrats survived in 2006 and 2008 because those were good years for the election cycle .
He said the environment is significantly different and vulnerable lawmakers ’ toughest job will be convincing voters that the economy is improving .
“ It will be a hard sell to folks who do n’t have jobs that the economy is getting better , ” he said .
“ Get Literate . ”
There is no such thing as a magic number .
When browsing through game review websites , most decisions made on video games come down to the “ magic ” numerical grade , or the review score , that appear beside a detailed hand - written review .
For some reason everyone uses this number - public relations professionals base their careers on it , while gaming junkies sculpt their GameFly queues to it .
However , no one needs it .
Only the so - called “ truly superior ” games get high scores , while other games fall off the radar if they approach a demeaning score of six or less .
Do gamers place too much of our stock in review scores ?
I think so .
It ’s easy to see numeric scores and grade systems rule the wallets of the gaming world .
Hardcore gamers would never go out and buy a game rated 7 out of 10 , or even a B - .
If a highly anticipated game release lands an 8.25 , expect an uproar from fanboys and PR alike .
But is an 8.25 really that bad ?
A big issue with the scoring system is that it ’s not properly understood .
A saying going around is “ 7 is the new 5 . ” Look at the game ‘ Dante ’s Inferno ’ , which received a 73 according to Metacritic.com .
A “ mixed or average review ” on Metacritic is represented by a score of 50 - 74 .
Would n’t it make more sense for the average to be represented by a score of 40 - 59 ?
All math aside , the average means the middle - not 73 .
How then does a game get a fair chance to be understood for what it is ?
Simple - read the review .
Take a step back and see how a particular reviewer rates their games .
Some reviewers give an average game like ‘ Dante ’s Inferno ’ a 5 rather than a 7 like some other publication .
In essence , the scores are the same - they are just rated differently .
So why was there a shift in mediocre games previously scoring a 5 now landing a 7 ?
To a development team , a score of 7 looks much better than a 5 .
This matters because PR reps rely on Metacritic scores to judge the success of a game .
Anyone experienced in the game reviewing world will point out that the relationship between a game journalist and a PR rep is a funny one .
When a game is released , PR will do almost anything they can to help the game get a high review score .
They might even leverage the privilege of reviewing their games as a plea for a favorable score .
This is n’t the case for all companies , but it will occasionally pop up as a pimple on the face of video game journalism .
At its ugliest , a company might sever ties to a journalist because the company feels like the inferior score they were given came from a writer who was n’t “ experienced enough . ”
These fears loom over the heads of game reviewers - they walk a fine line between expressing their opinion of a game and harming a relationship with a company .
It may seem like I ’m bashing the idea of scoring games , when in fact I think it ’s a great tool to measure a game .
Recently , there has been an outpouring of terrible games that have terrific sales ( despite how good or bad the review score was ) , all because of a new demographic in customers .
Since the Wii has been released , parents and grandparents everywhere have made it their duty to buy some of the worst games imaginable on Nintendo ’s “ Next - Gen ” console .
Review scores may have helped this new gaming crowd out had they known where to find them .
The scoring system appropriately caters to a demographic who is new or uninformed to the world of gaming - but not for core gamers .
Most review sites do seem to judge games based on the quality of the game the majority of the time .
But occasionally , outside influences come into play - someone might rate a game high because they had a really awesome interview with the developers and do n’t want that networking experience to go to waste .
Either way , they are quickly overshadowed by the masses .
The gamer has to learn how to compare scores and relate them to the written reviews they accompany .
Score systems are popular on sites like GameInformer and IGN , but you wo n’t find scores when you find reviews at Joystiq.com .
They follow a strict , no - score policy that causes the reader to shift their focus from the number to the content .
In theory , this system works great .
Unfortunately , it turns gamers away to other sites where they can rely on a scoring system .
My guess is most people avoid reading the reviews and prefer to just browse the scores .
This is a terrible idea , and it ’s completely ignorant for any so - called “ gamer ” to do .
( Turns up nose . )
Do n’t bank on a score to tell you how good a game is going to be - read the review and see what the experience was like for the writer .
Reviews without scores are probably the best method to help gamers find the games they will enjoy the most .
If every video game review were stripped of its score , then more people would be forced to read the reviews and base their choices on more than just a number .
Within each review is a personal experience that only the writer , who has played the game , can describe .
Learning to trust this experience should be the entire purpose of a review .
A writer ’s score of 7 may be a 9 for you , but you would n’t know that without reading the review .
Did I mention you should read the review ?
You should probably read the review .
Will websites start posting scoreless reviews anytime soon ?
No… scores will always be a part of video game reviews .
It ’s what gamers want and it ’s a reviewer ’s job to make sure it ’s what they get .
It just seems that too much faith is put in those scores .
Even though it ’s a necessity , scoring systems should not replace familiarizing yourself with a game before making a purchase .
The more money the gamers invest in high review - scoring games , the more likely the companies are to produce more products just like what ’s already on the shelf .
It ’s the hardcore gamer ’s responsibility to read the reviews journalists are taking the time to write .
Still want a score ?
Fine , just wait to look at it after you have read the review .
Do n’t abandon sites that rate games - just remember that the scores are relative , but the written review is the best tool available to decide if you will enjoy a game .
Do publishers , developers , and the gaming community a favor - ditch the numbers , and GET LITERATE !!!!

Here is how Ryan Grim from the HuffPo describes the latest attempt to curb the thieves in charge of this country , or at least make their endless robbery a little more transparent .
As unusual a coalition as can be crafted in the Senate plans to fight for an amendment to the Wall Street reform bill that would open the Federal Reserve to a serious audit by the Government Accountability Office .
Sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) , the language is modeled after an amendment that passed the House , sponsored by Reps .
Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
Sanders is joined by four Republicans of varying politics : John McCain ( Ariz . ) , Jim DeMint ( S.C. ) , David Vitter ( La. ) and Sam Brownback ( Kan . ) .
If Democrats in the Senate back the measure , it would have at least 63 votes , but Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) is opposed and has argued against a broad audit .
The chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Sen. Pat Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , is also a cosponsor , as is Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - Wisc . ) .
The group is actively gathering cosponsors as the Senate continues to vote to break a GOP filibuster which is preventing debate from beginning .
Needless to say , Zero Hedge fully endorses anything that will make the destruction of America at least a moderately more prolonged affair .
Full letter :
Support the Sanders - Feingold - DeMint - Leahy - McCain-Vitter - Brownback Federal Reserve Transparency Amendment to the Financial Reform Bill
The American people have a right to know who received over $ 2 Trillion in financial assistance from the Federal Reserve .
Since the beginning of the financial crisis , the Federal Reserve has provided over $ 2 trillion in taxpayer - backed loans and other financial assistance to some of the largest financial institutions and corporations in the world .
Unfortunately , the Fed is still refusing to tell the American people or the Congress who received most of this assistance , how much they received or what they are doing with this money .
This money does not belong to the Federal Reserve , it belongs to the American people , and the American people have a right to know where their taxpayer dollars are going .
Therefore , during the consideration of the financial reform bill , we will offer an amendment to increase transparency at the Federal Reserve .
Specifically , our amendment :
* Requires the non-partisan Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to conduct an independent and comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve within one year after the date of enactment of the financial reform bill ;
* Requires the GAO to submit a report to Congress detailing its findings and conclusion of their independent audit of the Fed within 3 months ; and
* Requires the Federal Reserve within one month after the date of enactment to disclose the names of the financial institutions and foreign central banks that received financial assistance from the Fed since the start of the recession , how much they received , and the exact terms of this taxpayer assistance .
* Does not interfere with or dictate the monetary policies or decisions of the Federal Reserve .
59 Senators , 320 Members of Congress , and two federal courts have called on the Federal Reserve to become more transparent .
Our amendment is similar to an amendment that was offered to last year 's Budget Resolution that passed the Senate on a bi-partisan vote of 59 - 39 on April 1 , 2009 ; S.604 , the Federal Reserve Sunshine
Act that now has 33 bi-partisan co-sponsors ; and the Federal Reserve Transparency Act ( H.R. 1207 ) that has 320 bi-partisan co-sponsors ( a version of which passed the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 43 - 28 and was incorporated into the financial reform bill that passed the House last December ) .
In August of 2009 , the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York also ordered the Fed to disclose the recipients of this taxpayer assistance as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bloomberg News .
This decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan on March 19 , 2010 .
The Senate Financial Reform Bill does not do enough to make the Fed more transparent .
While the Senate financial reform bill attempts to address the lack of transparency at the Fed , as currently drafted , much of the information regarding the details of who received this financial assistance could be kept secret forever .
As long as the Federal Reserve is allowed to keep the information on their loans secret , we may never know the true financial condition of the banking system .
The lack of transparency at the Fed could lead to an even bigger crisis in the future .
We now know that the lack of transparency in credit default swaps led to the $ 182 billion taxpayer bailout of AIG ; the collapse of Lehman Brothers and precipitated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
We know who received TARP funding .
Anyone with access to the internet can go onto the Treasury Department 's website and find out exactly who received a bail - out from the $ 700 billion TARP program .
The American people have a right to know the same information from the Fed .
The Sanders Amendment does not undermine the Fed 's independence .
This amendment does not take away the " independence " of the Fed and it does not put monetary policy into the hands of Congress .
This amendment does not tell the Federal Reserve when to cut short - term interest rates or when to raise them .
It does not tell the Federal Reserve what banks to lend money to and what banks not to lend money to .
It does not tell the Federal Reserve what foreign central banks they can do business with and which ones it cannot do business with .
It does not impose any new regulations on the Federal Reserve nor does it take any regulatory authority away from the Fed .
This amendment simply requires the GAO to conduct an independent audit of the Fed and requires the Fed to release the names of the recipients of more than $ 2 trillion in taxpayer - backed assistance .
For nearly nine decades , the GAO has a proven track record of conducting objective , fact - based , nonpartisan , non-ideological , fair , and balanced audits .
Through these audits , the GAO helped save the American taxpayers $ 50 billion last year alone by rooting out waste , fraud , and abuse in the federal government .
Let 's not equate independence with secrecy .
We cannot let the Fed operate in secrecy any longer .
There is simply too much money at stake .
1 . Why is Dick from Richard ?
The name Richard is very old and was popular during the Middle Ages .
In the 12th and 13th centuries everything was written by hand and Richard nicknames like Rich and Rick were common just to save time .
Rhyming nicknames were also common and eventually Rick gave way to Dick and Hick , while Rich became Hitch .
Dick , of course , is the only rhyming nickname that stuck over time .
And boy did it stick .
At one point in England , the name Dick was so popular that the phrase " every Tom , Dick , or Harry "  was used to describe Everyman .
2 . Why is Bill from William ?
There are many theories on why Bill became a nickname for William ; the most obvious is that it was part of the Middle Ages trend of letter swapping .
Much how Dick is a rhyming nickname for Rick , the same is true of Bill and Will .
Because hard consonants are easier to pronounce than soft ones , some believe Will morphed into Bill for phonetic reasons .
Interestingly , when William III ruled over in England in the late 17th century , his subjects mockingly referred to him as " King Billy . " 
3 . Why is Hank from Henry ?
The name Henry dates back to medieval England .
( Curiously , at that time , Hank was a diminutive for John . )
So how do we get Hank from Henry ?
Well , one theory says that Hendrick is the Dutch form of the English name Henry .
Henk is the diminutive form of Hendrick , ergo , Hank from Henk .
Hanks were hugely popular here in the States for many decades , though by the early 90s it no longer appeared in the top 1,000 names for baby boys .
But Hank is making a comeback !
In 2010 , it cracked the top 1,000 , settling at 806 .
By 2013 it was up to 626 .
4 . Why is Jack from John ?
The name Jack dates back to about 1,200 and was originally used as a generic name for peasants .
Over time , Jack worked his way into words such as lumberjack and steeplejack .
Even jackass , the commonly used term for a donkey , retains its generic essence in the word Jack .
Of course , John was once used as a generic name for English commoners and peasants , ( John Doe ) which could be why Jack came became his nickname .
But the more likely explanation is that Normans added - kin when they wanted to make a diminutive .
And Jen was their way of saying John .
So little John became Jenkin and time turned that into Jakin , which ultimately became Jack .
5 . Why is Chuck from Charles ?
" Dear Chuck "  was an English term of endearment and Shakespeare , in Macbeth , used the phrase to refer to Lady Macbeth .
What 's this have to do with Charles ?
Not much , but it 's interesting .
However , Charles in Middle English was Chukken and that 's probably where the nickname was born .
6 . Why is Peggy from Margaret ?
The name Margaret has a variety of different nicknames .
Some are obvious , as in Meg , Mog and Maggie , while others are downright strange , like Daisy .
But it 's the Mog / Meg we want to concentrate on here as those nicknames later morphed into the rhymed forms Pog( gy ) and Peg ( gy ) .
7 . Why is Ted from Edward ?
The name Ted is yet another result of the Old English tradition of letter swapping .
Since there were a limited number of first names in the Middle Ages , letter swapping allowed people to differentiate between people with the same name .
It was common to replace the first letter of a name that began with a vowel , as in Edward , with an easier to pronounce consonant , such as T .
Of course , Ted was already a popular nickname for Theodore , which makes it one of the only nicknames derived from two different first names .
Can you name the others ?
8 . Why is Harry from Henry ?
Since Medieval times , Harry has been a consistently popular nickname for boys named Henry in England .
Henry was also very popular among British monarchs , most of whom preferred to be called Harry by their subjects .
This is a tradition that continues today as Prince Henry of Wales , as he was Christened , goes by Prince Harry .
Of course , Harry is now used as a given name for boys .
In 2006 , it was the 593rd most popular name for boys in the United States .
One reason for its upsurge in popularity is the huge success of those amazing Harry Potter books .
9 . Why is Jim from James ?
There are no definitive theories on how Jim became the commonly used nickname for James , but the name dates back to at least the 1820s .
For decades , Jims were pretty unpopular due to the " Jim Crow Law , "  which was attributed to an early 19th century song and dance called " Jump Jim Crow , "  performed by white actors in blackface .
The name " Jim Crow "  soon became associated with African Americans and by 1904 , Jim Crow aimed to promote segregation in the South .
Jim has since shed its racial past , and is once again a popular first name for boys all by itself , sans James .
10 . Why is Sally from Sarah ?
Sally was primarily used as a nickname for Sarah in England and France .
Like some English nicknames , Sally was derived by replacing the R in Sarah with an L .
Same is true for Molly , a common nickname for Mary .
Though Sally from the Peanuts never ages , the name itself does and has declined in popularity in recent years .
Today , most girls prefer the original Hebrew name Sarah .

Enlarge By Matthew Sharpe for The ( Jackson , Miss . ) Clarion - Ledger School authorities canceled the Itawamba Agricultural High School prom in Fulton , Miss. , after Constance McMillen petitioned to bring a same - sex date .
JACKSON , Miss .  A Mississippi county school board announced Wednesday it would cancel its upcoming prom after a gay student petitioned to bring a same - sex date to the event .
" Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events , the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year , " school board members said in a statement .
UPDATE : ACLU files suit against school Constance McMillen , an 18 - year - old senior at Itawamba , recently challenged a school policy prohibiting her from bringing her girlfriend as her date to the April 2 prom .
McMillen , who is a lesbian , and the Mississippi chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union urged school officials to reverse the policy both on McMillen 's choice of date and attire .
She also wanted to wear a tuxedo to the dance .
ACLU attorney Christine Sun said her organization receives requests for help every year from students facing anti-gay prom policies .
The complaints are especially prevalent in the South where attitudes toward sexuality are more conservative , she said .
In the announcement , the school board encouraged the community to organize a private prom .
" It is our hope that private citizens will organize an event for the juniors and seniors .
" We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this causes anyone , " the statement concluded .
School officials did not respond to calls seeking comment .
The announcement alarmed McMillen .
" Oh , my God .
That 's really messed up because the message they are sending is that if they have to let gay people go to prom that they are not going to have one , " she said .
" A bunch of kids at school are really going to hate me for this . "
School officials told McMillen last month that she could not bring her sophomore girlfriend to the prom and also told her she could not wear a tuxedo .
The school then circulated a memo that prohibited same - sex dates .
GIRL WEARS TUXEDO : Girl in tuxedo denied a place in school yearbook ' FOOTLOOSE ' REVISITED :
Ohio teen suspended for going to a prom ACLU of Mississippi issued a letter demanding the district change its policy .
The letter gave it until Wednesday to decide on a course of action .
The ban on same - sex dates is a violation of McMillen 's constitutional rights , said Sun , the ACLU 's senior attorney on gay rights .
" We believe the law is pretty clear , " Sun said .
" The school just can't arbitrarily say you have to bring an opposite date to the prom . "
A private prom would allow the district to get around the issue , McMillen said .
" If they set it up privately they probably are n't going to allow gay people to go and there is nothing that you can do about it , " she said .
Other school systems have managed gay prom issues in varying ways : • In Alabama , the Russellville school system changed its policy prohibiting a lesbian student from attending prom with her girlfriend after the ACLU got involved , Sun said .
• Salt Lake City - based Utah Pride Center hosts an annual " gay prom , " but executive director Valerie Larabee said districts have not enforced same - sex date prohibitions for years .
•
In Florida , Prideline Youth Services has hosted a gay prom for South Florida high school students for 15 years .
Executive Director Luigi Ferrer said all schools in the Miami - Dade County district allow same - sex couples to attend prom .
•
In California , schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District allow same - sex dates .
Students such as McMillen are " enormously courageous " for making their stands , said Virginia Uribe , founder of Project 10 , a gay student advocacy group in Los Angeles .

BIRD EARS
On a recent summer morning at dawn I was jogging along a country road when I came upon a dead , immature male Pine Warbler , Dendroica pinus , apparently run over by a car .
I carried him home , carefully parted some feathers on his head and , below , you can see the exposed ear - hole .
here are a bird 's ears ?
The vast majority of birds appear to have nothing even resembling ears .
One conspicuous exception is the owls , many of whom sport ear - like tufts of feathers atop their heads .
Of course , birds hear very well -- about as well as humans do .
It 's simply that in birds the external ear is inconspicuous .
Before I began parting the feathers , there was absolutely no indication of any ear - holes , but once the feathers were spread , the hole became obvious .
It 's nearly as large as his eye .
Why are bird ears so inconspicuous .
One reason becomes clear if you 've ever tried to carry on a conversation on a windy day , with wind thundering around your ears .
Since wind constantly streams around flying birds , if they had floppy ears like we do they'd hear a lot of ear - thunder .
Not having ear - flaps is just the price birds pay for being able to hear well as they fly .
Most birds have their ear holes covered with tiny feathers specially designed to cut down on wind noise while permitting sound waves to pass through .
These feathers behave like the foam covers you see on politicians ' microphones at outdoor rallies , where breezes cause uncovered mikes to thump .
Some diving birds , such as penguins , have strong feathers covering their ear - holes , to protect delicate inner ears from intense water pressure .
Some birds even locate food with their ears .
The Common Barn - owl can catch a mouse in total darkness , as the mouse scampers across a floor .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , centre , walks as he looks at monuments of lists of those killed in battle at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul on Monday .
( ( Lee Jae - Won / Reuters ) )
Canada and the United States offered their full support to South Korea as the country 's president cut trade to North Korea Monday in retaliation for a torpedo attack that killed 46 sailors .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement that Canada 's sanctions will include enhanced restrictions on trade , investment and other bilateral relations with North Korea .
The Canadian government will also suspend high - level visits to Canada by North Korean officials .
" Canada has condemned the reckless North Korean regime for this egregious violation of international law and its blatant disregard of its international obligations , " Harper said in the statement .
He also pledged Canada 's support for South Korean President Lee Myung - bak 's decision to respond decisively to the " act of aggression . "
Lee said his country has " always tolerated North Korea 's brutality , time and again . "
" We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean peninsula , " he said in a solemn speech to the nation from the halls of the country 's War Memorial .
" But now things are different .
North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts , " he said .
Three experts from the Canadian Navy joined the multinational team that investigated the incident , and concluded the warship Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo on March 26 near the Koreas ' western maritime border .
Harper 's statement adds that Canada is committed to a co-ordinated international response , including through the United Nations Security Council .
' Highly precarious ' situation
Meanwhile , the White House offered its full support for South Korea 's moves , and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed how best to handle the situation with China , a veto - wielding permanent seat holder on the Security Council .
Clinton warned of a " highly precarious " security situation in the region , and said North Korea 's neighbours , including Pyongyang ally China , understood the seriousness of the matter .
Clinton would not say whether such action would include new international sanctions against the North , and said she was engaged in intense consultations with China and other nations about the next step .
" We are working hard to avoid an escalation of belligerence and provocation , " Clinton said .
So far , China has refrained from criticizing the North , which it supplied with troops during the Korean War .
Earlier , Lee promised to haul its impoverished neighbour before the UN Security Council .
He also pledged to prohibit North Korea 's cargo ships from passing through South Korean waters , calling it a " critical turning point " on the tense Korean peninsula , still technically in a state of war because the fighting ended with a truce , not a peace treaty .
CENSUS ID : CENSUS -2010-0001 CVE ID : CVE -2010 - 2020 Affected Products : FreeBSD 8.0- RELEASE , 7.3-RELEASE , 7.2-RELEASE
Class : Improper Input Validation ( CWE - 20 ) Remote : No Discovered by : Patroklos Argyroudis
We have discovered two improper input validation vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD kernel ’s NFS client - side implementation ( FreeBSD 8.0- RELEASE , 7.3-RELEASE and 7.2-RELEASE ) that allow local unprivileged users to escalate their privileges , or to crash the system by performing a denial of service attack .
Details
FreeBSD is an advanced operating system which focuses on reliability and performance .
More information about its features can be found here .
FreeBSD 8.0- RELEASE , 7.3-RELEASE and 7.2- RELEASE employ an improper input validation method in the kernel ’s NFS client - side implementation .
Specifically , the first vulnerability is in function nfs_mount ( ) ( file src/sys/nfsclient/nfs_vfsops.c ) which is reachable from the mount ( 2 ) and nmount ( 2 ) system calls .
In order for them to be enabled for unprivileged users the sysctl ( 8 ) variable vfs.usermount must be set to a non -zero value .
The function nfs_mount ( ) employs an insufficient input validation method for copying data passed in a structure of type nfs_args from userspace to kernel .
Specifically , the file handle buffer to be mounted ( args.fh ) and its size ( args . fhsize ) are completely user - controllable .
The unbounded copy operation is in file src/sys / nfsclient/nfs_vfsops.c ( the excerpts are from 8.0 - RELEASE ) :
1094 : if ( !has_fh_opt ) { 1095 : error = copyin(( caddr_t)args.fh , ( caddr_t ) nfh , 1096 : args.fhsize ) ; 1097 : if ( error ) { 1098 : goto out ; 1099 : }
The declaration of the variables args and nfh is at :
786 : static int 787 : nfs_mount ( struct mount * mp ) 788 : { 789 : struct nfs_args args = { 790 : .version = NFS_ARGSVERSION , 791 : .addr = NULL , 792 : .addrlen = sizeof ( struct sockaddr_in ) , 793 : . sotype = SOCK_STREAM , 794 : .proto = 0 , 795 : .fh = NULL , 796 : . fhsize = 0 , 797 : . flags = NFSMNT_RESVPORT , 798 : .wsize = NFS_WSIZE , 799 : .rsize = NFS_RSIZE , 800 : .readdirsize = NFS_READDIRSIZE , 801 : .timeo = 10 , 802 : .retrans = NFS_RETRANS , 803 : .maxgrouplist = NFS_MAXGRPS , 804 : .readahead = NFS_DEFRAHEAD , 805 : .wcommitsize = 0 , /* was : NQ_DEFLEASE */ 806 : .deadthresh = NFS_MAXDEADTHRESH , /* was : NQ_DEADTHRESH */ 807 : .hostname = NULL , 808 : /* args version 4 */ 809 : .acregmin = NFS_MINATTRTIMO , 810 : .acregmax = NFS_MAXATTRTIMO , 811 : .acdirmin = NFS_MINDIRATTRTIMO , 812 : .acdirmax = NFS_MAXDIRATTRTIMO , 813 : } ; 814 : int error , ret , has_nfs_args_opt ; 815 : int has_addr_opt , has_fh_opt , has_hostname_opt ; 816 : struct sockaddr * nam ; 817 : struct vnode * vp ; 818 : char hst [ MNAMELEN ] ; 819 : size_t len ; 820 : u_char nfh [ NFSX_V3FHMAX ] ;
This vulnerability can cause a kernel stack overflow which leads to privilege escalation on FreeBSD 7.3- RELEASE and 7.2- RELEASE .
On FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE
the result is a kernel crash / denial of service due to the SSP / ProPolice kernel stack - smashing protection which is enabled by default .
Versions 7.1- RELEASE
and earlier do not appear to be vulnerable since the bug was introduced in 7.2 - RELEASE .
In order to demonstrate the impact of the vulnerability we have developed a proof - of - concept privilege escalation exploit .
A sample run of the exploit follows :
[ argp@julius ~ ] $ uname -rsi FreeBSD 7.3- RELEASE GENERIC [ argp@julius ~ ] $ sysctl vfs.usermount vfs.usermount : 1 [ argp@julius ~ ] $ id uid=1001 ( argp ) gid=1001 ( argp ) groups =1001 ( argp ) [ argp@julius ~ ] $ gcc - Wall nfs_mount_ex .c - o nfs_mount_ex [ argp@julius ~ ] $ ./nfs_mount_ex [ *] calling nmount ( ) [!] nmount error : -1030740736 nmount : Unknown error : - 1030740736 [ argp@julius ~ ] $ id uid=0 ( root ) gid=0 ( wheel ) egid=1001 ( argp ) groups =1001 ( argp )
The second vulnerability exists in the function mountnfs ( ) that is called from function nfs_mount ( ) :
1119 : error = mountnfs ( &args , mp , nam , args .
hostname , &vp , 1120 : curthread -> td_ucred ) ;
The function mountnfs ( ) is reachable from the mount ( 2 ) and nmount ( 2 ) system calls by unprivileged users .
As with the nfs_mount ( ) case above , this requires the sysctl ( 8 ) variable vfs.usermount to be set to a non -zero value .
The file handle to be mounted ( argp - > fh ) and its size ( argp - > fhsize ) are passed to function mountnfs ( ) from function nfs_mount ( ) and are user - controllable .
These are subsequently used in an unbounded bcopy ( ) call ( file src/sys/nfsclient/nfs_vfsops.c ) :
1219 : bcopy (( caddr_t ) argp ->fh , ( caddr_t ) nmp ->nm_fh , argp - > fhsize ) ;
The above can cause a kernel heap overflow when argp -> fh is bigger than 128 bytes ( the size of nmp - > nm_fh ) since nmp is an allocated item on the Universal Memory Allocator ( UMA , the FreeBSD kernel ’s heap allocator ) zone nfsmount_zone ( again from src/sys/nfsclient/nfs_vfsops.c ) :
1160 : static int 1161 : mountnfs ( struct nfs_args * argp , struct mount * mp , struct sockaddr * nam , 1162 : char *hst , struct vnode ** vpp , struct ucred * cred ) 1163 : { 1164 : struct nfsmount * nmp ; 1165 : struct nfsnode * np ; 1166 : int error ; 1167 : struct vattr attrs ; 1168 : 1169 : if ( mp->mnt_flag &MNT_UPDATE ) { 1170 : nmp = VFSTONFS ( mp ) ; 1171 : printf ( " %s : MNT_UPDATE is no longer handled here
" , __func__ ) ; 1172 : free ( nam , M_SONAME ) ; 1173 : return ( 0 ) ; 1174 : } else { 1175 : nmp = uma_zalloc( nfsmount_zone , M_WAITOK ) ;
This kernel heap overflow can lead on FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE , 7.3-RELEASE and 7.2- RELEASE to privilege escalation and / or a kernel crash / denial of service attack .
Similarly to the first vulnerability , FreeBSD 7.1 - RELEASE and earlier versions do not appear to be vulnerable .
We have developed a proof - of - concept DoS exploit to demonstrate the vulnerability .
Furthermore , we have also developed a privilege escalation exploit for this second vulnerability which will not be released at this point .
FreeBSD has released an official advisory and a patch to address both vulnerabilities .
All affected parties are advised to follow the upgrade instructions included in the advisory and patch their systems .
A major transportation artery into Capitol Hill will be reopened Thursday morning marking the end of a year - long project to prepare Interstate 5 for the light rail tunnels connecting downtown to Capitol Hill .
In a media tour of the end point in the Seattle transit tunnel that will eventually connect to the light rail route , Sound Transit officials said that the Olive Way exit from northbound I - 5 will be re-opened at 5 AM Thursday .
The opening comes almost exactly a year after the offramp was closed as Sound Transit contractors began digging massive pits below the I - 5 roadway to remove support pilings and poor soil that would hinder the light rail tunnel boring machine when it makes its journey beneath this area of the city as early as the end of next year .
The $ 19.7 million project also involved cutting “ windows ” into the I - 5 retaining walls beneath the Olive Way Exit for the tunnel boring machine to pass through as it completes the 3.15 - mile route between downtown and the University of Washington .
Meanwhile , the Cherry St. onramp to north I - 5 should also be reopened now that the Olive Way Exit work is complete .
During the Olive Way closure , most drivers used the Madison or James offramps as alternate routes to the Hill and many pedestrians enjoyed the easy crossing in front of the closed ramp as they made their way up or downhill on Olive Way .
Contractors on the $ 1.9 billion University Link light rail project are currently preparing the construction area on Broadway between Thomas and John for around - the - clock tunneling that will begin in 2011 .
Sound Transit was recently approved for a large project noise variance that will allow nighttime work on the project .
The agency says the 24 - hour schedule is necessary because it ’s not safe to start and re-start the tunnel boring machine and that the project would take longer and subsequently cost more without the nighttime work .
The 10 to 20 - foot plywood construction noise walls around the Broadway site were recently painted a deep red as part of Sound Transit ’s community art program .
As Wednesday morning ’s tour , Sound Transit ’s Rick Capka said the re-opening of the Olive Way exit was a milestone worthy of celebration .
Capka , a resident engineer for Sound Transit , said the project was completed on time and under budget — and is a big step toward the start of tunneling and completing the University Link project on time .
Service is expected to begin in 2016 .
Sound Transit took me and a camera person from every TV station in town underground to see this wall at the end of the transit tunnel .
A married same - sex couple is suing the Iowa Department of Public Health for refusing to list both parents on their child ’s birth certificate .
Heather and Melissa Gartner were married after the Iowa Supreme Court struck down the state ’s ban on same sex unions .
When their daughter was born , they assumed they would both be listed on the birth certificate .
But state officials said they would not list the non-birth mother until she adopts the child .
An attorney with Lambda Legal , Camilla Taylor , says the state would not make the same request of a heterosexual couple who uses a sperm donor .
“ Many married different sex couples use anonymous donor insemination to conceive or in some cases , a woman may have an affair and in every case when a married different sex couple requests a birth certificate for their child – that birth certificate is issued automatically naming the husband as a parent , ” Taylor said .
According to Taylor , requiring the non-birth mother to adopt is expensive , intrusive , and insulting .
She ’s hoping the matter is resolved before going to court .
“ Iowa is the only state of all of those states who permit same sex couples to marry or to enter into civil unions that has refused to place the name of both spouses in a same sex couple on a child ’s birth certificate , ” Taylor said .
“ I expect this is just a mistake and I expect we ’ll clear it up shortly but Iowa is certainly standing alone here . ”
“ I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort , ” Mr. Obama said in his address at Cooper Union in Manhattan .
“ I ’m here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of the financial sector . ”

The regulation battle has become the president ’s top legislative priority since he signed his health care program into law last month , and both parties are jockeying for position six months before midterm elections .
Mr. Obama and his allies have eagerly portrayed Republicans as handmaidens of Wall Street while Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to strangle the market and institutionalize bailouts .
While Mr. Obama avoided directly criticizing Republicans in his address , the partisan tension in the capital heated up again when Senate Republicans blocked an effort by Democrats to start debate on their regulation bill .
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , said Democrats were pre-empting negotiations , while Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada , the Democratic leader , said Republicans were simply stalling .
Business interests and their allies used Mr. Obama ’s visit to New York to trumpet their opposition to his plans .
The New York Post ran a front - page editorial under the banner headline , “ Dear Mr. President , Do n’t Kill the Golden Goose : City Economy Imperiled in the Name of ‘ Reform . ’ ” The United States Chamber of Commerce took out full - page ads in New York newspapers echoing the concerns of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , saying that “ beating up on Wall Street may be good short - term politics — but not if it gets in the way of the right solutions . ”
Republicans argued that Mr. Obama ’s plan would encourage risky behavior and empower regulators who failed to use the authority they already have .
“ President Obama says he believes in the power of free markets but his policies prove otherwise , ” said Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama , the senior Republican on the House Financial Services Committee .
“ Under the Democrat plan , certain financial institutions have no freedom to fail , and are instead propped up by taxpayer bailouts and government loan guarantees . ”
While the film world is busy squabbling about whether a gimmick like 3D can revolutionize the industry , iPad comic readers are attempting their own revolution .
Sure , techniques like panel - by - panel reading are amusing enough , but what if you could feel explosions from your comic ?
Madcap Studios ’s Digital Comics app aims to enrich your comic - reading experience in just this way .
Released on Tuesday , the comic reader provides a unique “ Automated Reading ” option , adding pre-timed action animations and device vibration to your reading experience .
Comics can also be read manually or “ panel - by - panel , ” similar to Marvel ’s paced walkthroughs .
Digital Comics ’ initial offerings can be bought through its in - app book store ; Madcap currently has deals in place with the likes of Top Cow , Antarctic Press , and Joe Phillips , with more artists and studios coming soon .
In addition , if you ’ve bought any stand - alone comic books from Madcap , you can consolidate them into the app at no extra cost .
Most comics will be priced at $ 1 , according to the developers , with one or two free comics to lure viewers in .
The app also provides a few nice UI touches like background wallpaper and icons letting readers know when they ’ve started , are in the middle , or are done reading a particular title .
Digital Comics is a free universal download from the iTunes Store for the iPhone and iPad iPod touch and requires iPhone OS 3.0 or later .
Update : Madcap tells us Digital Comics is n't Universal yet , but an update is expected in 2 - 3 weeks .
However , if you run the iPhone app on your iPad and blow it up to double size , the content should scale even if the UI does n't .
Now before you leap to conclusions , the glass was open and there was n't a screen , so he did n't hit his head , he just flew right on through the window , and landed SAFELY , on the grass in the back yard .
Yes , he was crying hysterically and traumatized and shaken up , but he was n't physically hurt , so everything is okay .
I 'm not an irresponsible parent ; I know that in order to raise a good child who will be a productive member of society that you have to punish them with humiliation and fear .
I probably should have checked to make sure that the window was open before I threw him , but we got lucky since it turned out to be open , and my son is safe , so everything is fine here .
But I just hope that my wife and my mother in law wo n't get mad at me .
They do n't agree with my parenting style ( they are a bit liberal in the fact that they believe in talking to children and treating them with respect and decency ) but I do care about what they think of me and i hope that they do n't freak out when they find out what happened when they get home .
If you were the mom or the grandma of my kid , would you be mad at me ?
Well , this is awesome .

Zu Guttenberg im Kunduz - Untersuchungsausschuss schwer belastet Silvio Duwe
Opposition spricht bereits vom möglichen Rücktritt des Ministers
Der ehemalige Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr , Wolfgang Schneiderhan und Ex-Verteidigungsstaatssekretär Peter Wichert , haben Verteidigungminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg vor dem Untersuchungsausschuss zum Bombardement von Kunduz schwer belastet .
Schneiderhan sagte vor dem Ausschuss , er habe den amtierenden Verteidigungsminister und seinen Vorgänger Franz Josef Jung umfassend informiert .
Zudem bestätigte Schneiderhan die Existenz der " Gruppe 85 " , die nach Informationen von Spiegel online " ein positives Bild auch des Erfolgs " vermitteln und Kritik an der Bundeswehr möglichst verhindern sollte .
Staatssekretär Wichert relativierte die Bedeutung der Gruppe 85 .
Diese habe lediglich darauf
Acht geben sollen , dass es keine " einseitige Untersuchung " gebe und im NATO - Bericht auch " entlastende Momente für Oberst Klein " Berücksichtigung finden .
Beobachter vermuten , dass die Gruppe 85 Informationen zum Angriff auf die zwei von den Taliban gestohlenen Tanklastzüge vertuschen sollte .
Diese Ansicht teilt der verteidigungspolitische Sprecher der SPD , Rainer Arnold nicht .
Die Existenz der Gruppe 85 sei " kein Aufreger " , so Arnold .
Allerdings sei der Bombenangriff " auf höchster Ebene schön geredet " worden , so Arnold weiter .
Der ehemalige Verteidigungsminister Jung hatte die Existenz von zivilen Opfern lange Zeit geleugnet .
Schneiderhan sagte vor dem Ausschuss , er hätte Jung vor solchen Aussagen gewarnt .
Doch Jung konnte sich damals nicht vorstellen , dass mitten in der Nacht während des Ramadan in einem von Taliban kontrollierten Gebiet Zivilisten zu den Tanklastwagen gingen , so Schneiderhan weiter .
Aus Loyalität zum Minister wollte er jedoch Jung nicht in der Öffentlichkeit korrigieren .
Daher habe er lieber geschwiegen .
Jungs Nachfolger zu Guttenberg hatte in einer Presseerklärung am 6 .
November 2009 gesagt , dass " die Militärschläge und die Luftschläge vor dem Gesamtbedrohungshintergrund als militärisch angemessen zu sehen sind " .
Diese Einschätzung musste zu Guttenberg später revidieren .
Seine Meinungsänderung erklärt der Verteidigungsminister damit , dass ihm wichtige Informationen vorenthalten worden seien .
Gegen diese Behauptung wehren sich Wichert und Schneiderhan .
" Die Frage , ob ich die Minister so beraten habe , dass sie entscheidungsfähig waren , ja , diese Frage beantworte ich eindeutig mit ja " , so Schneiderhan .
Minister zu Guttenberg sei auf die Pressekonferenz vom 6 .
November gut vorbereitet gewesen .
Mit dem ISAF - Bericht hätten zu Guttenberg " alle für die Beurteilung des Geschehens irgendwie relevanten Fakten " vorgelegen , ergänzte der ehemalige Staatssekretär Wichert .
Ähnlich sieht dies auch die Opposition .
Für Arnold steht fest , dass zu Guttenberg für seine Fehleinschätzung Schuldige gesucht habe .
Von Aken , der die Linke im Untersuchungsausschuss vertritt , ergänzt , zu Guttenberg habe seine Meinung geändert , obwohl er " keine neuen Informationen hatte " .
Am 22 .
April wird zu Guttenberg selbst zu den Vorwürfen von Schneiderhan und Wichert vor dem Untersuchungsausschuss Stellung nehmen .
Von diesem Auftritt wird das Schicksal des Verteidigungsministers abhängen .
" Es kann sein , dass er uns noch eine glaubhafte Erklärung gibt " , sagte Omid Nouripour , Obmann der Grünen im Untersuchungsausschuss .
Allerdings werde das " nicht einfach " .
Sollte der Minister allerdings der Lüge überführt werden , dann müsse er zurücktreten .
Dies würde den dritten Wechsel an der Spitze eines Ministeriums der schwarz - gelben Bundesregierung bedeuten .
A team from The Donkey Sanctuary and GAWF was on the island from 19 to 25 August assessing the welfare , working conditions and socio-economic value of the donkeys and mules on Santorini .
The data collected is currently being analysed : in general , the body and hoof condition of the equines was found to be largely good but all parties acknowledged there are areas requiring improvement .
At the meeting , Mr Zorzos confirmed his commitment to improving the key areas of concern around the working conditions of the donkeys and mules on the island identified by the two charities .
The improvements include to :
1. Extend the shelter at the top of Fira Port steps to protect equine taxis from the sun
2. Install a permanent , free - flowing water trough at the top of Fira Port steps to hydrate working animals
3. Repair and extend the shelter , and install a permanent water trough at the bottom of Fira Port steps
4. Revise and simplify the code of practice for working equines on the island and to harmonise it with new European directives within the framework of Greek law
5. Support training sessions organised by The Donkey Sanctuary later in 2018 .
The Mayor pledged that all of these improvements will be implemented in time for the next tourism season on the island .
The Donkey Sanctuary and GAWF will monitor progress in follow - up visits .
Barbara Massa , regional director of Europe at The Donkey Sanctuary , said : " We are all extremely pleased with the willingness of Mr Zorzos to take this time - bound action , his positive response to our future collaboration and for giving us the opportunity to offer our expert equine welfare advice . "
Kleopatra Triantafyllou , equine veterinarian at GAWF , said : “ During our visit we spent time with many equine owners , all of whom were very supportive of our work and are looking to the Mayor to follow through on these commitments and increase the level of regulation enforcement . ”
The Donkey Sanctuary and GAWF recognise that donkeys and mules form an important part of the social , cultural heritage and economic foundations in Santorini and are keen to encourage visitors to make an informed decision about their suitability to ride an animal as well as the suitability of the animal to be ridden .
CAIVP , May 10 , 2010
By Ryan Jaroncyk
While the Afghanistan and Iraq wars have cost the United States over $ 1 trillion , 5,000 deaths , and 30,000 maimings , there is yet another painful cost that is rarely discussed by the American public .
" ... the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are being treated as PTSD patients by the VA has increased from 134,000 in June last year to 143,530 reported in January this year ... " " ... the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are being treated as PTSD patients by the VA has increased from 134,000 in June last year to 143,530 reported in January this year ... "
Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is plaguing both active and retired members of the Armed Forces .
Multiple , repeated deployments to intense war theaters are taking a serious psychological toll on soldiers ( and their families ) , and the statistical trend continues to worsen .
Just last week , I received a thoughtful email from Chad Cavanaugh , a veteran of the US Army Infantry , who served as a Sentinel at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .
Mr. Cavanaugh , who was kind enough to allow me to use his name , wrote that he wanted to see a decompression program for retiring soldiers , a sort of psychological " basic training " to enable them to make the difficult transition to civilian life .
In addition , he believes that psychologically compromised veterans who have committed crimes should be placed in rehabilitation centers , instead of wasting away in federal prisons where they will never receive the treatment they so desperately need and deserve .
He pointed to the unfortunate story of California Marine , Nathan Damigo , whose PTSD almost certainly contributed to his criminal actions which sent him to prison recently .
While not excusing Mr. Damigo 's gun-related crime , Cavanaugh believed his psychological ailments had served as a catalyst for the breakdown .
The following statistics * appear to justify Mr. Cavanaugh 's grave concerns over the debilitating effects of PTSD in a battle - weary military :
" More than 2 million men and women have been deployed to serve in both conflicts , and more than 40 percent of them have served at least two tours , according to military records ... Nearly 300,000 troops have served three , four or more times .
And , records show , more than half of those currently at war are at least on their second tour ... "
" ... the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who are being treated as PTSD patients by the VA has increased from 134,000 in June last year to 143,530 reported in January this year ... "
" ... the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans ' claims against the VA that were approved for PTSD claims increased from 59,000 in June last year to 67,052 reported in November ... "
" VCS has estimated that the country may see a total of one million patients from the two wars at a total price tag of $ 1 trillion and rising . "
" A 2009 report of Army troops in Afghanistan found that the rate of psychological problems rose significantly with the number of deployments : 31 percent for three tours , more than double the rate of those with just one .
In Iraq , the survey found that nearly 15 percent of Army troops who served two tours suffered from depression , anxiety or traumatic stress , more than double that of a single tour .
When it came to PTSD alone , the rate was 2.5 times higher for two deployments compared with one . "
" Psychiatrists estimate that one in three US soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan may develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . "
" A study by the RAND Corporation revealed that 20 % of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will suffer from PTSD or severe depression ; sadly , only about 50 % of these veterans will get the treatment they need . "
These grim statistics reveal the damaging psychological toll of open - ended , overseas wars .
But , they do n't even reveal the full extent of the damage .
Many of these soldiers succumb to alcoholism , drug addiction , crime , and domestic violence when they return home to civilian life .
Suicide rates ( which I will cover in my next installment ) are at record highs .
And while the VA is receiving more funding , and the Pentagon and scientific community are working hard to develop better neurological and psychiatric treatment methods , the reality is that the rising number of patients is overwhelming the system .
In the best case scenario , more advanced and more effective scientific methodology will continue to be developed to treat the physical and psychiatric symptoms of PTSD , maybe even to predict it in certain individual profiles , but the root cause of the problem will remain .
As long as our troops are repeatedly deployed to dangerous , high - intensity , open - ended wars in foreign nations , conditions will always be ripe for a persistent and pervasive PTSD dilemma .
Winnipeg ’s ghastly downtown :
Time to think the unthinkable
May 3 , 2010
[ Updated May 30 — Further information from the American Planning Association on the effects of skywalks on downtown areas . ]
I happened to be at a downtown cafe the other day when I overheard the barista having a chat with a visitor from Saskatchewan .
The visitor ’s stay in Winnipeg sounded as though it would be a memorable one , but not in a good way .
In her frank opinion , in spite of her home town ( Regina ? Saskatoon ? ) being a “ murder capital ” by her own admission , Winnipeg ’s downtown was just plain awful — and she was n’t impressed with the sight of “ some guy passed out right in the middle of the street ” , even if Downtown Watch was tending to him .
Welcome to Winnipeg , ma’am .
As Winnipeggers , many of us are well aware that downtown is n’t necessarily representative of the entire city .
Life can be pretty nice in Charleswood , South Tuxedo , Lindenwoods , Whyte Ridge , River Heights , posher parts of Crescentwood , River Park South , areas of St. Vital west of Dunkirk and St. Mary ’s , or the Canterbury Park area of Transcona .
Visitors seldom spend much time in those parts of the city , however .
Their lasting impression of Winnipeg — all of it — is often based on what they see downtown .
Winnipeg certainly is n’t the only city to have problems with panhandlers and petty criminals in its downtown area .
I was nearly knocked down in Dublin by a shoplifter fleeing a grocery store with a security guard in hot pursuit ; and watched in amusement in Sydney ’s seedy Kings Cross area as a vagrant wandered into an internet cafe , banged his fists on a keyboard , and stomped back out without the attendant on duty so much as raising an eyebrow .
Even though tourists are advised to avoid walking through parts of Dublin ’s city centre or down the less - patrolled side streets of Kings Cross at night , it would be considered a miracle if downtown Winnipeg were as bustling with activity as those two places are .
Why are people drawn to central areas of Dublin and Sydney in spite of their seedy reputations , but not to downtown Winnipeg ?
A 2004 study published in the Journal of the American Planning Association might just shed some light on that .
As part of their research , four researchers — three from the University of Waterloo in Ontario and one from Wayne State University in Michigan — sought out the opinions of more than 300 academics , urban planners and professionals with an interest in urban development .
These respondents were asked how important they considered each of 19 factors in making a successful downtown in a medium - sized city of 100,000 to 500,000 residents .
Six factors stood out as being crucial to a successful downtown , having been considered “ very important ” by more than 50 percent of respondents :
– An active retail scene
– Pedestrian environment
– Cultural activities
– Street - oriented retail
– People on sidewalks ( i.e. , walking around and doing things — not passed out ! )
– Employment
What ’s remarkable about this list is that Winnipeg has stomped all over four of those items with both feet clad in steel - toed work boots since the ’ 80s .
By constructing a skywalk system so that it ’s possible to walk all the way from the Grain Exchange Building to The Bay without going outdoors — and by continuing to expand that system to the present day — we ’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that the rest of downtown Winnipeg is a pedestrian - unfriendly environment with as few people as possible on the streets and , thus , too little foot traffic to support street - level retail .
( Indoor business is n’t what it used to be at Portage Place or The Bay , either , which weakens our standing on point # 1 above . )
We have , however , put great effort into five of the six things that respondents considered least useful — each considered “ very important ” by fewer than 25 percent of respondents — to creating an attractive downtown :
– Public sector presence
– Historical character
– Presence of educational establishments
– Abundant parking
– Presence of social services ; and at the bottom of the list ,
– Presence of a retail mall
It ’s time to think the unthinkable , bear the unbearable and say the unsayable about downtown :
If we are to be serious about pulling downtown Winnipeg out of its depressed state , we need to seriously look at the possibility of closing the skywalks , * converting the second floor of Portage Place to non-retail use and turning the first floor into an outside - oriented instead of inside - oriented mall ( or even taking the wrecker ’s ball to that architectural monstrosity as it approaches its 25th anniversary in 2012 ) ; and accelerating the conversion of what remains of Cityplace ’s retail space to other uses .
All to get Winnipeggers out shopping in the streets , which is the key to urban revitalization .
—
* – The American Planning Association had this to say about skywalks in their book , Planning and Urban Design Standards : “ A number of cities have developed second - level walkways , often claiming that climate generates the need for this solution .
Unfortunately , virtually no North American downtown has enough intensity to support retail on both the street level and the skywalk level …
In some selective instances , pedestrian overpasses are workable , such as between a department store and a parking structure , or between two parts of a civic building .
Such elements do not generally contribute positively to economic health and vitality of a downtown , however , and should be discouraged . ” ( p. 417 )

Note :
If you have n’t seen them already , Slurpees and Murder ‘s James Hope Howard has written a couple of posts on this subject , both well worth reading .
The first is his evening walking tour of downtown , followed by his retrospective on the 1987 opening of Portage Place as “ the saviour of downtown Winnipeg ” and the much different reality 23 years later .

Look up the word ludicrous in the dictionary and you may just get a picture of the Greek bond curve .
The 2
Year spread has exploded by over 400 bps just today , and is now back to 14 % - the market is now convinced that even with € 110 of additional money the country is done for in just over one year .
The problem , as we pointed out earlier , is that the IMF can not appeal for greater assistance without appearing totally clueless ( which it is ) , while any additional funding requests will may finally provoke the US taxpayers into recognizing they are being fleeced to save a country 5 thousand miles away .
As the attached curve indicates , the bond vigilantes still think that Greece could remain solvent for about 1 year , however with the rate of widening , we expect the 1 year point on the curve to defy gravity quite shortly .

Men and women who worked for the Machias Lumber Company before 1930 share their recollections of the logging industry in Maine when they cut trees by hand , hauled logs to the river with horses , and floated them down to the mill .
Remarkable documentary footage from the 1930's illustrates this dangerous and exhausting work .
The memoires include stories about death on the job and the ballad " The Jam on Gerry 's Rock " .

Strikeforce light heavyweight champion Gegard Mousasi has signed a four - fight minimum , two - year contract renewal , the promotion ’s CEO Scott Coker confirmed on Friday .
The 24 - year - old Armenian - Dutch fighter expressed his intention to re-sign with Strikeforce on Sirius satellite radio ’s “ The Fight Show ” on Thursday .
Mousasi , who left M - 1 Global ’s management last February , has declined to identify his new representation at this time .
Mousasi defends his title against undefeated Muhammed “ King Mo ” Lawal at Strikeforce “ Nashville ” at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville , Tenn .
The bout , and two others , will air live on CBS starting at 9:00 p.m. EST .
Mousasi won the Strikeforce light heavyweight title last August with a speedy one - minute technical knockout against Renato Sobral .
Mousasi earned a second - round TKO over Cameroon judoka Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou in a non-title bout last November , which was also broadcasted live on CBS .
He is undefeated in 15 fights .

What determines whether a scene is remembered or forgotten ?
According to a study published this week in the open access journal PLoS Biology , memory for visual scenes may not depend on attention level or what a scene contains , but when the scene is presented .
The study , presented by researchers at the University of Washington , shows how visual scenes are encoded into memory at behaviorally relevant points in time .
The ability to remember a briefly presented scene depends on a number of factors , such as its saliency , novelty , degree of threat , or behavioral relevance to a task .
Generally , attention is thought to be key , in that people can only remember part of a visual scene when paying attention to it at any given moment .
In this study , participants performed an attention - demanding " target detection task at fixation , " while also viewing a rapid sequence of full - field photographs of urban and natural scenes .
Participants were then tested on whether they recognized a specific scene from the sequence they had been shown or not .
" Usually , the addition of a secondary task decreases performance on the first task .
However , in this particular case , adding a second task ( letter identification ) actually enhanced performance in the first task ( scene memory ) when targets were accurately detected in the second letter identification task , " says Jeffrey Lin , the lead author of the study .
This study adds to our understanding of how selective attention can influence the ability to remember specific features of our environment .
The results point to a brain mechanism that automatically encodes certain visual features into memory at behaviorally relevant points in time , regardless of the spatial focus of attention .
Timing may not be everything , but it 's more important than you realize .

New desktop users can make plenty of mistakes ( as can anyone ) .
But knowing which mistakes to avoid , from the start , helps prevent a LOT of frustration .
I ’ve handled the topic of mistakes new Linux admins make , but never those of desktop users .
Here are some of the most common Linux desktop mistakes I see new users make .
Note :
This article is also available as a PDF download .
1 : Assuming they are using Windows
2 : Trying to make exe files work
3 : Choosing the wrong distribution
4 : Not finding software
5 : Sending OpenOffice documents to Microsoft Office users in the default format
6 : Avoiding the command line
7 : Giving up too quickly
8 : Thinking the Windows directory hierarchy translates to Linux
9 : Skipping updates
10 : Logging in as root
11 : Losing windows to the pager
12 : Ignoring security because it ’s Linux
Although this might seem way too obvious , it ’s not .
The average user has no idea there are even different operating systems to be had .
In fact , most average users could n’t discern Windows XP from Vista from 7 ( unless they are certain Windows 7 was “ their idea ” ) .
Because of this , new users might believe that everything works ( or does n’t work , as the case may be ) as it does in Windows .
Make your end users aware that they are using a different operating system — and that it works differently .
Unless you have done your homework and installed WINE , double - clicking those .exe files simply wo n’t do anything .
And when that happens , your end users are going to be upset .
I have seen many an end user download an app made for Windows assuming that it will work for Linux .
Make it clear to users that Linux , like Windows , will only run applications made for that operating system .
This , of course , is tossed out the window when WINE is involved .
But new users wo n’t be using WINE anyway .
One of the biggest problems for users is choosing the wrong distribution .
Imagine being a new user and selecting Gentoo or Slackware or Fedora !
Yes those are all good distributions , but any of them would send a new user running away in fear .
If you are in the initial stages of helping a new user out , do yourselves both a favor and choose the distribution carefully .
Consider the user ’s ability , needs , and hardware before you make that selection .
Do n’t just jump on board Ubuntu because everyone says you should .
A lot of distributions out there are made specifically for new users .
Give them all a close examination before making the choice .
Because so many new Linux users are migrating from Windows , they think software can be had from the same channels .
Most of the time , this is not the case .
The new user needs to become familiar with their package management tools right away - especially tools like Synaptic , Packagekit , and Ubuntu Software Center .
Each of those tools is a mecca of software where users can most likely find all the applications they need .
I see this so often .
New Linux users are proud of the strides they have made but dumbfounded ( and sometimes turned back to Windows ) because the people they share files with ca n’t read their formats .
Remember , Microsoft products are not good at getting along with other operating systems and other applications .
Make sure your new users are saving in file formats that are readable by the Microsoft equivalents .
I can’t , for the life of me , figure out why people completely avoid the command line as if it is the most complex tool there is .
I know people who can work absolute magic with Photoshop but ca n’t seem to type a simple rm command at the command line .
Why this is I will never know .
New users should n’t shy away from the command line .
Knowing the command line is n’t essential anymore , but it will make them more capable users .
Here ’s another issue I see all too often .
After a few hours ( or a couple of days ) working with Linux , new users will give up for one reason or another .
I understand giving up when they realize something simply does n’t work ( such as when they MUST use a proprietary application or file format ) .
But seeing Linux not work under average demands is rare these days .
If you see new Linux users getting frustrated , try to give them a little extra guidance .
Sometimes getting over that initial hump is the biggest challenge they will face .
There is no C:\ in Linux .
Nor do you use the “ \ ” character .
Nor should you use spaces in filenames .
These are common mistakes new users make .
Trying to map out Windows to Linux , directory for directory , is impossible .
You can get as far as C:\ = / and maybe Default User = ~/ , but beyond that you ’re out of luck .
Make sure new users understand that everything starts at / and their most important directory is their home directory ( aka ~/ aka / home / USERNAME / ) .
I have been burned with Windows updates many times .
Need I bother mentioning the update from Explorer 7 to Explorer 8 ?
Very rarely has a Linux update fubar ’d a system of mine .
In fact , I ca n’t remember the last time it has .
So I am always up to date on my systems … and with good reason .
Those updates bring new security patches and features to software and should be applied .
Having an installation with a security hole is not what your users need , especially on a machine that houses important information .
I really should n’t have to say this .
But just in case , be sure to tell your users DON ’T LOG IN AS ROOT !
But … just in case they must …
DON ’T LOG IN AS ROOT !
Instead , have them open up a terminal window and either “ su ” to root or use “ sudo ” .
And just in case you did n’t hear me the first time , DON ’T LOG IN AS ROOT !
The pager is one of the handiest features of the Linux desktops .
But over and over , I ’ve seen that new users do n’t quite understand what the pager is for and what it does .
Because of this , they will “ lose ” their windows from the desktop .
Where did it go ?
It was there a moment ago !
I guess it crashed .
No .
More than likely , they moved it to another desktop .
Another desktop ?
You see where this is going ?
Help the new user understand what the pager is and how useful it can be .
A big part of me still wants to boast and say , “ In the 12 years I have used Linux , I have never once had a virus or worm or been hacked . ”
Although that is true , it does n’t mean I should ignore security .
I have witnessed the effects of a rootkit on a Linux machine .
They are n’t pretty and data will be lost .
Tell your users that they can’t ignore security just because they ’re using Linux .
Security is crucial , regardless of the OS .

Where did you get the idea to build a duct tape bridge ?
ADAM SAVAGE :
The idea for the duct tape bridge came almost immediately after we were finished sailing the boat around the bay [ last season ] .
We were thinking , what 's next , what else could we do ?
And we had two or three ideas ; the bridge was the one we chose for the next bust .
We even have a better idea for the next duct tape special .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : We could just keep going on the duct tape thing .
It 'll never run out .
So is the stuff you used just a regular , standard - issue duct tape ?
ADAM SAVAGE : It is .
Nashua makes about ten different kinds and it's a middle grade that we keep on settling on as our favorite .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : And there is heavier stuff .
I think probably in any of the experiments that we 've done , we could 've put heavier stuff to use to our benefit , but we 're trying to show something that 's not unusual .
It 's a standard heavy - duty duct tape .
How much of what you learned about duct tape strength and capabilities for building the boat were you able to use again for the bridge ?
JAMIE HYNEMAN : I think we 've learned a lot about how to handle it .
The trick with that boat was putting the first layer with the adhesive side out and then the second layer with the adhesive layer in and precisely lining it up .
With the bridge it was similar .
We knew that over that length duct tape is kinda hard to control so we did n't even try .
Adam built this rig to pull out ten strands at a time and we did n't make em really messy but we did sort of let them go where they were gonna go and kind of bundled them up because the strength in this case was about the same .
Interesting .
I was going to ask about thatbecause when you guys were building the boat , there was a definite order to the way you laid out the tape .
And in this case you just sort of clumped it together .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : Yeah , this was all about tensile strength .
And so given the amount of tape that we had to usewhat was it ?
ADAM SAVAGE : Two hundred rolls of duct tape .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : Yeah , 200 rolls of duct tape over 108 feet .
Why fight it , you know ?
Let it do what it wants to do .
ADAM SAVAGE :
It 's indicative of how we work with a lot of the materials we end up working with on the show is that you can either go pretty or you can go crunchy .
Both have their utilities and both have their advantages and disadvantages .
And for the bridge , going crunchy and turning this stuff into basically glorified rope and stringing it together turned out to be really quite effective .
How long is a single roll of duct tape ?
ADAM SAVAGE : About 60 yards , 180 feet .
I was going to ask if you guys were worried at all about the structural weaknesses of attaching one roll to another , but I guess you did n't really have to think about that if the distance you had to span was 108 feet .
ADAM SAVAGE : Actually , one of the plans that I wanted to try and do was to find a span that was like 190 feet long so it would be clear we could n't use a single piece of duct tape for the span of the bridge .
But we ran into location limitations there and realized the difference was one that was more interesting to us intellectually than necessary for the narrative of the show .
When you finally figured out that you were going to do a bridge , how did you come up with a plan of attack in terms of what design to go with ?
ADAM SAVAGE :
We actually had two totally different viewpoints about how it would go .
In the beginning , Jamie and I often talk in the abstract , arguing back and forth for different approaches .
Often we do n't conclude something out of those conversations but we conclude a method of proceeding .
So we bandied back and forth for about a day and then we just went down to the shop and started mucking around with duct tape until something became clear .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : I recall specifically going through the exercise of thinking that what duct tape has is tensile strength and it does n't have any compressive strength or anylike if you were doing a keystone kind of a structure , for example , it would n't work .
It 's all effectively just rope .
Going on that premise leaves you with a suspension bridge .
There 's not a whole lot of other choices involved .
So that was the direction that we went .
Why did you opt to not do the weaving thing ?
You did that a little bit when you were first testing .
ADAM SAVAGE :
It did n't seem necessary for the overall construction of the bridge .
Again , it 's balancing all the elements of time and effectiveness .
And while it worked somewhat well in the shop 's limited space , I do n't think it would have added any necessary structure to the bridge .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : Yeah .
It was all about that simple thing again , the tensile strength of it .
ADAM SAVAGE :
It was an attempt to add some compressive strength to the floor we were going to walk on , you know ?
JAMIE HYNEMAN : What we did , as you can see in the design , is went with a walkway that was only as wide as it had to be to accommodate our feet .
You know , like even barely wide enough to even put our feet sideways on it .
So it was kind of like a flat rope .
And with it done that way , we did n't really have to worry about whether it drooped or became like a bag as we walked across it .
Was there any behind - the - scenes deliberation that viewers did n't get to see ?
JAMIE HYNEMAN :
We did tests that showed that just three strips of tape were capable of supporting one of us .
We used 200 rolls , and most of those rolls were in the walkway .
We could 've done it with much less .
The tighter that you pull a bridge like that , the straighter the line would be that 's going across the chasm and it becomes a significantly larger load on the tape the more that you pull on it .
You know , like the tauter it is .
It 's a question of leverage on the middle of the bridge .
And so while we did our experiment here across 30 feet with three strips of tape and that was sufficient , expecting three strips of tape to hold us going across a bridge that 's 100 feet would be unrealistic because the leverage is so much greater on it .
But dialing in on exactly how much it would hold as a part of that was hard for us .
We have a couple of engineers here on staff , and it's a more complex thing than it might seem to be able to estimate exactly how many strips of tape would be required to support a person across that span .
It changes as you put load on it , the leverage .
It 's not a static thing .
The less straight the thing becomes , the more the tensile strength changes .
So it was sort of a dynamic thing that we did n'tfrankly , in our sort of seat - of - the - pants engineering approach , we could n't find a straightforward way of really dialing in on that so we just overdid it a bit .
Since we had all these cases of tape , we figured , why not ?
How long do you think it would 've taken you to build it by hand ?
Obviously that rig helped speed up the process a lot .
ADAM SAVAGE : I 'd say that probably saved us a couple of days in the overall build , maybe a day .
JAMIE HYNEMAN : Yeah , at least a day .
I do n't think the thought actually ever crossed our minds that we would do it any other way .
We might have strung them out by putting them all on a single axle instead of having the ten axles suspended above each other , which was Adam 's idea ... and it turned out to be quite effective .
I had my hesitations about it because all those little rollers and everything are a little difficult to set up , but Adam cranked through it and it was clearly the best way to do it .
You had to make some last - minute modifications to the bridge too , once you got it on - site .
ADAM SAVAGE :
You know , in all of this there 's a lot of moving parts .
There 's the span itself , but then what order do you make the span in and attach it to where it 's going to go ?
The normal way you might make a rope bridge is to just start stringing rope across the span and then bind it together .
We did n't have that luxury , we wanted to build the thing in its entirety .
And this is kind of another indicative way that we solve problems .
Knowing that this was a tricky thing , we went out on - site , we took careful pictures and measurements of the stuff we were going to mount it to on - site and then the whole time we were working on the bridge and doing ideation on it , we were talking about ways of attaching .
And we went through probably about a dozen different ideas before coming across what was really the simplest possible way to do it .
The ideas were more like different orders of doing things .
A lot of times the order that you do things in is absolutely critical .
JAMIE HYNEMAN :
We could 've built the thing entirely out on - site but it would have been much slower because having to suspend ourselves with some other kind of means while we 're constructing it would 've been very tedious , it would have taken many times longer , in fact .
And so we opted to do it on the ground and then pull it into place .
Will Jamie and Adam make it across their duct tape bridge ?

Japanese Woman Blasts Into Space with Style
On Monday , April 5 , the US space shuttle Discovery blasted into space with seven crew members , including Naoko Yamazaki , 39 , an astronaut from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) .
She is the 54th woman to ever reach space , the 2nd Japanese woman to ever become an astronaut and , more importantly , the first woman to ever climb into the heavens with style and grace .
Prior to her departure , Yamazaki hired Japanese fashion designer Tae Ashida to prepare her wardrobe for the 13 - day mission .
According to the Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) news agency , Tae , who is in fact the daughter of Japanese fashion mogul Jun Ashida , weaved together “ a slim knit cardigan in light blue with navy blue shorts . ”
When interviewed by AFP , Tae said , “ As a female designer , I chose a design and color with a sense of grace , so that she [ Yamazaki ] can feel at ease as she carries out a tough mission in a male - dominated , bleak atmosphere . ”
Tae is somewhat incorrect , however , as two other astronauts onboard are also women .
Plus once they arrive at the International Space Station , they will join forces with NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson , bringing the number of women simultaneously in space to its highest ever :
4 . On the other hand , all 9 other astronauts currently also in space are men .
Ashida added , “ It ’s like a dream come true to see my clothes worn in space .
I ’m looking forward to seeing her [ Yamazaki ] wear my design . ”

We ’ve all done it .
You see a great new feature in DB2 and jump headlong into using it without fully appreciating all of the implications .
Here ’s a case in point :
One of our clients is a large SAP customer running on DB2 for z / OS V9 .
With a huge number of subsystems to support and over 35,000 tables in each , taking traditional image copies would be a bit of a nightmare .
Luckily , DB2 9 for z / OS contains the BACKUP / RESTORE SYSTEM function , which uses Flashcopy technology to rapidly backup and restore an entire system with a single utility .
That means no messing with the traditional tablespace - level COPY utility , except when it ’s needed for other reasons ( such as when taking an inline image copy during an online REORG , to avoid putting the tablespace into COPY PENDING ) .
So far , so good .
However , a couple of weeks ago the DBAs came in one morning to find a lot of SAP users complaining about database errors , and dozens of tablespaces unable to be updated due to being in a COPY PENDING state .
What the heck happened ?
After some investigation , it seems that a routine MODIFY RECOVERY job that ran the night before had removed the last image copies for these tablespaces from SYSIBM .
SYSCOPY ( ones taken during some REORGs a few months ago ) .
Despite the fact that several perfectly good system - level backups existed that included those tablespaces , DB2 still decided to put them in COPY PENDING mode once the last image copy was removed !
So , do n’t assume that BACKUP SYSTEM causes objects to be treated in the same way as traditional COPY , despite the fact that V9 allows you to recover individual tablespaces from a system copy .
As workaround , we used yet another new V9 feature – the ability to run MODIFY RECOVERY with the RETAIN option instead of the DELETE option we had been using .
RETAIN allows you to keep a certain number of image copies in SYSCOPY ( regardless of their age ) and deletes anything else , thereby ensuring you always keep at least one or two entries in SYSCOPY and avoid the COPY PENDING issue .
There are plenty more gotchas to talk about with BACKUP / RESTORE system , but we ’ll leave those for another time …

Council to ban the word ' obesity ' - so fat children do n't get offended
The word ' obese ' could be banned in case it offends fat children ( file photo )
Council chiefs may ban the word ' obese ' because it could offend fat children .
They want to replace it with the phrase ' unhealthy weight ' .
Parents and health experts condemned the proposal yesterday as ' preposterous ' .
The idea was dreamed up by 90 pupils in the Liverpool Schools ' Parliament , a scheme to help children become more interested in politics .
Now Liverpool City Council will formally consider their proposal to drop the word from all local authority schemes aimed at improving children 's health .
One Merseyside father of two said : ' Being an overweight child does have a stigma - but that is the whole point .
' Eating unhealthy food and not taking part in physical activity should be stigmatised so that children live a healthy , active life . '
A council spokesman said the pupils ' recommendations would be considered ' with a view ' to putting them into practice .
Tam Fry of the obesity prevention charity the Child Growth Foundation , said : ' If you ’re obese you ’re obese .
' I can see where the children are coming from and the word carries a stigmatisation but unfortunately some times schoolchildren have to be taught the realities of life .
Mr Fry , whose charity campaign for more measures to combat obesity in children , said : ' If you have a problem , particularly when it ’s as serious as this , it needs addressing . '
Banned ?
Liverpool Council are considering using ' unhealthy weight ' as an alternative phrase
A mother said : ' My 12 - year - old daughter is tackling her own slight weight problem by improving her diet , joining a gym and taking part in sports at school and her main motivation for her drive to be slimmer and healthier is that she is not seen as fat by her school friends . '
Liverpool Council will consider the plans as part of scheme to examine the key priorities and ways to improve the lives of young people over the next two years .
Explaining the group ’s recommendation , Jeff Dunn , co-ordinator of the Liverpool Schools ’ Parliament , said : ' The idea is that obesity has a negative connotation behind it .
' They felt unhealthy weight is more positive and a better way to promote it .
The term ‘ obese ’ would turn people off , particularly young people . '
A Liverpool council spokesman said : ' All the young people ’s recommendations will be considered by the council with a view to include them in the delivery of the Children and Yound People 's Plan . '
Other recommendations include appointing classmates and city sport stars as ' food heroes ' to promote healthy living within schools .
The guy was coming to shoot up Jack Rabbit 's house in the middle of the night .
He 'd already fired on other homes in the old east side neighborhood to scare residents he 'd suspected of calling the cops on him .
It turned out the gunman was a drug dealer , and when neighbors had called the cops on him , or had gotten in his way , he retaliated by shooting up their houses .
Earlier that day , James " Jack Rabbit " Jackson — a retired Detroit cop — parked his car in front of the dealer 's house and pointed a video camera at him in a blatant effort to disrupt his business .
It drove the guy away for the day .
Now he was coming back for Jackson .
And Jackson was waiting for him .
A car turned from Jefferson onto Chalmers .
It drew closer , then slowed when it reached Jackson 's house .
The headlights panned the front of the home until they revealed the ex-cop sitting there on the otherwise dark porch , staring back .
He had a shotgun in his lap .
Jackson knows that , in Michigan , the law says that if your life 's in danger , you have a right to use deadly force to defend yourself .
That 's why he keeps a baseball bat stashed on his porch .
That 's why he sat there late one night , waiting with that shotgun .
He had seen the old Chevy before , and knew the drug - dealing gunman was inside it .
The car belonged to a guy in the dealer 's posse .
But it did n't stay long .
Between the armed ex-cop and the video camera mounted above the porch , the dealer had few options .
The Chevy backed out of the driveway and left the same way it came .
Jackson is the de facto leader of the neighborhood , like an unofficial sheriff .
He 's 63 , burly and slower - moving in his retirement .
Everyone here knows him , and everyone here calls him Jack Rabbit , a nickname he has had for years .
He 's president of the Jefferson - Chalmers Homeowners Association , president of the Jefferson - Chalmers Citizens District Council , and he's on the Jefferson East Business Association 's board of directors .
He plows snow from the wintertime streets and sidewalks with his truck .
He 's the neighborhood lookout , and , through his homeowners association , he offers a monthly reward for local crime tips .
He 's the one who urges everyone in his neighborhood to stay vigilant , the one who confronts criminals on the street and videotapes them .
" These guys are cowards , " Jackson says .
" They 're not going to fight anyone that 's going to go toe - to - toe with them . "
The people who live here , like residents in dozens of similar Detroit neighborhoods with block clubs and associations , are battling to keep theirs from falling like so many others in the city .
And guys like Jack Rabbit lead the charge .
The Jefferson - Chalmers neighborhood lies by the Detroit River , on several long streets south of the intersection it 's named after .
Its 1920s - era shopping district is on the National Register of Historic Places .
Its eclectic bungalows and Arts and Crafts houses , built early last century , still have beauty and character despite weathering over the years .
Vacant lots have appeared on side streets , and some foreclosed houses have boards on their windows , but most blocks are still dense with owner - occupied homes where lawns are kept mowed and the houses are kept up .
" It 's a great neighborhood .
Lots of good people live around here , been around here for years , " Jackson says .
" Where else can you get this close to the water ?
Just five blocks down the road it costs half a million , three - quarters of a million to live , " he says , pointing toward Grosse Pointe .
By contrast , many homes on this side of Alter Road , the border of Detroit , sell for less than $ 10,000 nowadays .
But there 's a war going on here .
On one side are longtime residents trying to maintain a safe , desirable neighborhood .
On the other side is their enemy : the drug dealers , the burglars , the petty thieves , the lifelong criminals who prey on the regular folks here .
Some invade from bordering neighborhoods ; a few live right within it .
Though they 've always been a problem , there appears to be more of them since the economy tanked .
It 's a war of little battles .
The residents fight by lighting their yards , videotaping drug deals , harassing scrappers and chasing off thieves .
Their enemy attacks in shocking ways .
Like taking over the homes of bedridden old people .
Like recruiting kids as dope - house spotters and runners .
Like killing people 's dogs .
" There 's one old lady , she lives on Manistique , and she 's had problems where the guys have come and poisoned the dogs so they would n't be able to bark when they heard them coming to break in , " Jackson says .
" They poisoned several of them down there .
She said they 've killed dogs up and down her street . "
The same thing happened to B.J. Lewis , a 30 - year resident of Ashland Street .
She once had two German shepherds for protection .
" Several years ago I went to open up my kitchen door and there 's a guy in my yard , and you know what he told me ?
' What are you gonna do , bitch ? ' remembers the 71 - year - old .
" I just opened the door and let the dogs out and I called 911 . "
The dogs chased him off .
" What would have happened to me if I did n't have the dogs ? "
She did n't have them much longer .
Someone came and killed them .
The usual method around here is lacing hot dogs or chicken with antifreeze .
The dogs like its sweet taste .
They die pretty quickly after eating it .
" We seem to be under siege , " Lewis says .
She 's got one dog left , a pet she wo n't let out in the yard alone anymore .
" My dog is about the only dog that 's living at this end of the street .
There used to be dogs on both sides , all the way down .
These criminals are terrorists . "
In this war , the enemy infiltrates neighborhoods and ruins them from within .
Jackson recounts the ways .
Some move into an elderly relative 's home and take it over , selling drugs in the living room as the homeowner lies helpless in bed , he says .
" She 's not aware of what 's going on , she 's got some young people there running the house , maybe her kids , she 's upstairs in her bed , ca n't get out of the bed , those kids let somebody come in there , make a little money . "
Some buy silence or space from a stranger .
" They 'll pay a little something to use the house and they kind of blend in with the family that lives in the home , " he says .
" They 're only getting Social Security or SSI or whatever it is , and the guy wants to sell drugs out of there .
A little bit of money ensures that adults wo n't call the police on them . "
Some hire middle - school kids as drug couriers , training them for a life of crime .
" These guys have literally taken over these neighborhoods , and they 're the only ones hiring in the neighborhood , " Jackson says .
" They 'll hire your kids to run back and forth between the house and the cars .
They give them commission . "
Some hoist the smaller kids into the milk chutes still in the walls of the old homes here , where they climb into the house , steal what they can and pass things outside through the narrow opening .
Some steal the infrastructure , the very skeleton of the neighborhood .
" It was a Saturday , and Jack called me in the morning , said he 's following two guys with a fire hydrant over here , heading to the junkyard , " says 55 - year - old Keith Hines , Jackson 's neighbor and partner in crime fighting .
" These two drug addicts had taken that hydrant and put it in their car . "
He and Jackson accosted the scrappers at the junkyard , had the yard owner block their car from leaving , even interrogated them on video until police arrived .
Next to their car was a pile of street signs someone else had sawed off and brought in .
" It 's a constant battle , " Hines says .
He bought a three - story house on Chalmers 13 years ago .
" We do n't have it as bad as a lot of other people do , but it 's a constant battle . "
Things like these , small compared to more violent crimes , are nonetheless what slowly bring down a neighborhood , driving people to move away , launching a cycle of abandonment and blight .
That 's why , residents here say , it 's important to confront the criminals every time , to stop the cancer before it spreads .
" This stuff goes unnoticed by the average person , " Jackson says .
" We 're fighting .
That 's literally what it is .
We 're fighting to save our neighborhood . "
A new Wendy 's restaurant might not mean much in other neighborhoods .
But out here it's an important symbol , helpful in attracting other businesses .
" Wendy 's has come down here before and they left , " Jackson says .
He 's convinced all the break - ins and robberies they suffered drove them out .
" They were only here a while , so we wanted to make sure they did n't leave us again . "
So when the burglaries started , Jackson and Hines hid one night in the bushes bordering the restaurant , armed with their video cameras , waiting for the suspects to come back .
After a couple long , dark nights laying there in the dirt , they saw them return .
" Nobody could seem to get them , " Jackson says .
" But in just a couple days we got them , at about 2 , 3 o'clock in the morning . "
They gave the tapes to the police , who used them to find and arrest them .
Jackson is Wendy 's biggest booster .
He eats there often , takes breaks from his towing work there , holds some neighborhood meetings there .
" It 's important to support them , to spend money at local businesses like this , " he says .
Since retiring from the police department 's gang squad a decade ago , Jackson has operated a towing and snow plowing business .
He 's often seen patrolling his neighborhood 's streets in his tow truck , crawling along at near idling speed , peering into yards , looking around corners , seeing what 's what .
He knows who lives where , who 's on vacation , who 's a stranger .
He waves to just about everyone he sees .
They all know him and wave back .
His habits are those of an old policeman .
Jackson takes pride in the neighborhood , and he 'll take you on a tour to point out little successes , like new housing that 's rising across Jefferson , the corner party store that burned down but was rebuilt even bigger , and the old houses that have new siding or a fresh coat of paint .
They 're welcome signs of life , of continuity .
" This lets you know the city 's not dead , " he insists .
" It 's alive , man .
It 's alive . "
A dirty , haggard little man named Roy walks into Wendy 's and sits just two tables over from Jackson .
His wool hat has holes and his beard is tangled and bushy .
He orders nothing .
He just sits and loiters .
Jackson knows him well : " He 's one of our bad guys .
He 's got strict orders not to come on Chalmers . "
Roy is a lifelong criminal , Jackson says , one of several around here who plague the neighborhood .
A few months back , Roy and a crackhead in a wheelchair pushed a lawnmower past Jackson 's house .
From experience , he knew right away it was stolen , probably from the shed of the crackhead 's own elderly mother , he figured .
Jackson phoned her family .
" I said , ' Does Mrs. Hall 's son have permission to let somebody take a lawnmower from her house ? ' and the guy says , ' Hell no .
She does n't even want him over there .
They stole it if they got it . ' "
So Jackson and a neighbor caught up with the two men down the street .
They grabbed Roy and started shoving him around , grilling him about the stolen mower .
" It was funny as hell , because once we grabbed Roy and collared him , jacked him up a little bit , the guy in the wheelchair 's like , ' You 're on your own ! ' to Roy .
And Mrs.
Hall was in the house , did n't even know the lawnmower was stolen . "
Another time , they caught Roy trying to break into someone 's house while the homeowner was away .
" He comes up out of the driveway all big -eyed and everything .
You know you got him .
I said , ' What are you doing ? ' "
Roy stammered .
Jackson punched him in the face .
Roy pleaded innocence .
But a prybar poked out of his waistband .
" So we jacked his ass up right out there in the street , " Jackson says . "
People are laughing and shit — ' Go !
Beat the shit out of that guy ! ' "
Yet Roy sat inside Wendy's , unconcerned , just feet away from the man who 's the bane of his criminal existence .
" He knows he 's all right as long as he's not on Chalmers , " Jackson explains .
" He knows he 's gonna get his ass whipped on Chalmers .
I 'm harmless anywhere else , but if I catch him on Chalmers , or anywhere breaking in , that 's it . "
Their cat - and - mouse game would be amusing if guys like Roy did n't make life so miserable for people here , did n't give them another reason to give up on the neighborhood .
" Police response is abominable , " says 78 - year - old Ann Johnson .
Someone tried to shoot up her neighbor 's house one night , she says .
But they were apparently inexperienced at holding an automatic weapon and it fired wildly , spraying her house too .
She found eight bullet holes inside .
" I was in bed , and a bullet went though my pillow , about 4 inches from my head .
If I had been laying on my left side I would n't be here today . "
It took three visits , she says , to get police to take a report .
Many residents say they do n't bother calling 911 anymore because police response is slow for all but the most serious crimes .
It 's as if they 're on their own out here .
" We feel like old pioneers sometimes , " Johnson says .
Budget cuts over the years and the move from 13 city police precincts to six consolidated " districts " five years ago made things worse , residents say , a failure the police have acknowledged and now plan to reverse .
" When they closed the precinct down over here , right away there was a difference , " Hines says .
" Now , if someone is breaking into your house and you call the police maybe they 'll show up today , but there 's a 75 to 80 percent chance they wo n't .
If you 're lucky , they might show up .
And the bad guys know it .
The criminals can pretty much do what they want . "
A burglar was rampaging one day on Ashland , going from house to house , trying to get inside , Lewis says .
" Three of us called 911 all day long , ' cause this guy took his time , he knocked on doors , jumped over fences .
We called 911 , they never showed up .
You always think to call 911 , but it does n't always work out . "
Police spokesman John Roach , second deputy chief of DPD , does n't offer excuses .
" We make no bones that response time in some categories of our runs is not where anybody wants it to be right now , " Roach says .
" The chief has said that openly . "
" We have to look at ourselves as the emergency room triage from time to time , " he continues .
" We 'd like to treat sprained ankles when they happen , but if there 's a gunshot wound , for example , then we have to take care of that first .
Things like a breaking and entering , after the fact , where a suspect is long gone , those typically take us longer to get to .
But it 's because we 're dealing with something more immediate at the time . "
The city has neighborhood crime statistics online , but even Roach admits they 're not entirely accurate because so many people do n't file police reports .
So the citywide figures of 17,428 violent crimes and 53,095 property crimes — numbers for 2008 , the latest year with available FBI stats — most likely fall short of the true mark .
" The most important thing is making sure crimes get reported .
People have stopped reporting a lot of property crimes because there has been a conditioned response that DPD is n't going to respond anyway .
It makes everyone 's job a little harder .
But you can understand why people feel that way because it 's something born out of past experience . "
Residents such as Jackson and Hines blame a lack of police presence and slow response time for the prevalence of nuisance crimes in the area , but most do n't fault the officers themselves .
" I can't blame it on the police , " Hines says .
" They 're shorthanded now .
They 're going from one call to another .
The old days of them sitting in a restaurant with a donut and a coffee are gone .
But those days were when they were able to keep crime under control . "
Tigh Croff 's home on Manistique was broken into three times in one week just before the holidays .
Then he came home three days after Christmas and found two men in his backyard in what looked to be the fourth burglary .
That 's when he lost it .
Police say a furious Croff chased one of the unarmed men out of the yard and down the street about a block before the suspect got winded and stopped running .
Croff is accused of then shooting him in the chest , killing him right there on the street .
He 's now charged with second - degree murder .
It happened just outside Jackson 's neighborhood , but it was close enough , and familiar enough , for him to understand Croff 's anger .
" We want to support that guy as much as we can , " Jackson says .
" Everybody in Detroit should support him .
You go out in the neighborhood , talk to the neighbors , they say he takes care of the neighborhood . "
The same is said about Alvin Davis .
During Memorial
Day weekend last year , after someone broke into his elderly mother 's house on Marlborough , a couple streets over from Jackson , Davis , a federal agent with the Department of Homeland Security , spent the weekend allegedly combing the neighborhood , interrogating several residents , even forcing one into his car at gunpoint .
He 's currently awaiting trial on several charges .
The state law says deadly force is acceptable as self defense , only if your life is threatened .
The law does n't say you can shoot an unarmed man who 's running away , or chase down neighbors and hold them for interrogation sessions .
The law sets a fairly clear line between self - defense and vigilantism .
Despite their alleged actions , Croff and Davis are heroes in the Jefferson - Chalmers area .
" When they broke in her house he lost it , " Lewis says .
" Can you imagine someone breaking into your house three times in a week and you have to go to work and wonder what 's going on at your house ?
It 's been a battle .
So we empathize with Mr. Croff and Mr. Davis , and a lot of us are going to show up , if this man goes to court to support him . "
Police spokesman Roach has heard the neighbors justify such alleged actions by citing slow police response , but he says that , of the three times Croff says his property was burglarized , he reported only one incident .
" We had a B&E that was discovered on the 19th of December , " on Croff 's property , he notes .
" That 's the only one we got a call on .
So there were others that were not brought to our attention .
And it was dispatched two minutes after the call came in . "
He acknowledges , though , that sometimes , when faced with a situation in which they feel preyed on over and over , some people will react violently .
" I do n't know if there 's anything short of catching every suspect that would prevent somebody from taking drastic steps , " he says .
One thing the neighbors note , though , is that Davis ' alleged rampage had an effect .
" When he did that , all the crime around here dropped down to zero for awhile , " Hines says .
Lewis stands on her porch with her shaggy dog , Bossman , and offers reasons why she stays here :
Her good neighbors , their urban garden in the summer , how her dog waits out front for the schoolchildren to pass by every day , the diversity of people on her street .
She 's got a nice arrangement of gardens behind her house , which she puts a lot of effort into .
But they 're penned in by two fences , one erected within the other , with a zone in between , to make it harder for someone to hop into her yard .
It reflects how life is in many Detroit neighborhoods — people hope for the best but brace for the worst .
Then an unkempt man wanders up and stands in front of Lewis ' house , in the cold .
" Do you have anything I can have ?
Anything ? " he asks .
" No , love , " she replies softly .
She does n't know him , she says ; he just wandered onto her street .
" He 's a troubled soul . "
Normally the elderly woman will give street people her recyclable bottles , but she 's got none right now .
He remains standing there , staring , as she steps inside .
The episode is a metaphor for what 's happening here , where residents in a once - grand neighborhood find their streets raided by addicts and criminals who destroy the quality of life for those living here .
" The neighborhood 's changed drastically around us , " Jackson says .
" Yet you look at Chalmers , we 've had our share of lost houses but it 's still pretty good . "
Go a few streets in either direction though , and the vacent lots and burned - out houses grow in number .
It 's from out there , beyond the still - nice neighborhood 's borders , that the criminals are invading Jefferson - Chalmers .
And when they show up here , Jack Rabbit 's waiting .
" If we 're gonna move this city forward , man , the guys that live in the neighborhoods are gonna have to circle the wagons and do what we can , you know what I 'm saying ?
You do what you gotta do to keep the neighborhood afloat .
We 've got to keep this city afloat . "

WASHINGTON – According to a report today in the Los Angeles Times , some Obama administration officials are in the process of drafting classified guidelines that would allow the government to indefinitely hold terrorism suspects outside of the United States without charge or trial .
The policy , if adopted , would apply to future terrorism captures , and is reportedly still being debated within the administration with some officials voicing objections .
The ACLU continues to call on the Obama administration to adhere to the rule of law in its handling of terrorism suspects .
The following can be attributed to Laura W. Murphy , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ The Obama administration already has a set of guidelines on how to handle terrorism suspects : it ’s called the Constitution , and it is deeply discouraging that the administration is having a debate on how to circumvent it .
The rule of law is not optional , and we do not need an elaborate set of guidelines – especially a secret one – that has the function of creating loopholes to it .
It is time to put an end to the assumption that the only way to keep us safe is to violate our most fundamental laws and values . ”
The following can be attributed to Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project :
“ After eight years of an administration that frequently and flagrantly flouted the law in secret , we should be turning the page , not adding paragraphs to it .
While enemy belligerents captured on a battlefield can be held by the military until hostilities have ceased , civilian terror suspects captured far from any battlefield must be charged as criminals .
If the evidence is too flimsy or unreliable to justify a prosecution , it is certainly too flimsy and unreliable to justify detention without charge and trial . ”

I ’m a big fan of having music in the background when I GM ( and when I play , too ) , and have really gotten into it over the past four years .
In that time , I ’ve learned a few things that I find useful ; they ’re all based on having a digital media library ( in my case , on my iPod ) :
No vocals .
When the primary activity of the evening is sitting around and talking , having an extra “ person ” singing in the background is incredibly distracting .
The only exception is chanting and the like — if it does n’t make you pause and try and catch the words , it ’s all good .
This is a pretty basic tip , but it ’s a good starting point if you ’ve never used background music when you GM before .

Soundtracks are your friends .
Movie , TV , and video game soundtracks are generally the best source of RPG background music .
They ’re already geared to being played in the background , they usually contain a mix of ambient and action -y tracks , and you can probably identify different types of tracks pretty easily without having to listen to every moment of every song .
Midnight Syndicate also makes some great gaming - specific soundtracks ( I particularly like their D&D and Eberron discs ) .

Create playlists .
Think about a typical session :
What are the two things you likely spend the most time doing ?
In most games I ’ve run or played , that ’d be “ stuff ” and action scenes .
“ Stuff ” is more or less everything that happens that is n’t action , and is well - matched with a nice big ambient playlist .
Action needs it ’s own pump - you - up playlist , suitable for both combat and other fast - paced scenes .

Action needs it ’s own pump - you - up playlist , suitable for both combat and other fast - paced scenes .
… But not too many playlists .
As the GM , you have a lot on your plate — you do n’t need to be juggling 20 playlists on top of that .
For the most part , your players will just enjoy the music without paying too much attention to it , so you do n’t need a playlist for every emotion or every agonizingly specific scene .
I currently have four RPG background music playlists : Ambient , Action , Foreboding , and Triumphant .
The Foreboding playlist is for sinister , suspenseful scenes ; Triumphant is for when my players win or accomplish something major .

Make them deep .
You do n’t want to hear the same five songs over and over for the entire night — if you have the library to do it , add as many songs as you can to each playlist .
Mine clock in like this : ambient , 11 hours ; action , four hours ; Foreboding , five hours ; Triumphant , 45 minutes .
Ambient sees the most play time , so it needs to be the longest ; Action needs to get you through at least one long combat with no repetition .

Avoid major geek touchstones .
If the Star Wars Imperial march comes on during your game — and you ’re not playing a Star Wars campaign — chances are it ’s going to take your players out of the moment and make them think of Star Wars instead .
I find this distracting as a GM and as a player , so I usually steer clear of music along those lines .
That does n’t mean the Star Wars soundtrack is off - limits , just that avoiding the biggest , best - known songs is probably a good idea .

Avoid overly quiet tracks , too .
Some soundtracks work great in the theater but suck for gaming , generally because they ’re too quiet .
Casino Royale ( the new one ) is a good example :
It ’s a fantastic soundtrack , but large chunks of it are so quiet that you ’ll never hear them in the background at the gaming table .
I build my playlists by skimming each song for just this reason : to weed out the duds .

Include some surprises .
Especially with soundtracks , a single track will often contain ambient , sinister , and action -y elements .
With the exception of my Foreboding playlist , I do n’t mind if there are occasional quiet , ambient elements in my Action playlist , or vice versa — because they make nice surprises .
Sometimes an oddball track will sync up perfectly with what ’s happening in the game ; and if not , it ’s easy enough to skip to the next track .

Next time you sync your iPod , take those tracks out .
Here are the mainstays of my playlists :
Movies / TV : Wanted , Casino Royale , Akira , Iron Man , LotR : Fellowship of the Ring , The Fountain , Dexter , Braveheart , the Indiana Jones trilogy , Sunshine , Halloween
Wanted , Casino Royale , Akira , Iron Man , LotR : Fellowship of the Ring , The Fountain , Dexter , Braveheart , the Indiana Jones trilogy , Sunshine , Halloween Video games : Mass Effect , Tenchu , Silent Hill , Metal Gear Solid , Metal Gear : Solid Snake , WoW : The Burning Crusade , Castlevania : SotN , Halo 2 , Diablo II , Gears of War
Mass Effect , Tenchu , Silent Hill , Metal Gear Solid , Metal Gear : Solid Snake , WoW : The Burning Crusade , Castlevania : SotN , Halo 2 , Diablo II , Gears of War Other : Adam Hurst , Midnight Syndicate , NIN : Ghosts I - IV
I first tried this approach with my recently - completed Mage chronicle , and it served me very well .
After spending a year running that game , I went back in and re-tooled my playlists a bit ; the tips in this article represent my current approach .
I hope they work as well for you as they have for me .
How do you tackle RPG background music in your own games ?
In the 15 years since a truck bomb blew apart the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building here , the determined people of Oklahoma City have remodeled the local airport and opened a new “ Bricktown ” area of shops and restaurants .
They lured a professional basketball team , and they crowned the state Capitol with a new dome and a bronze statue called “ The Guardian . ”
The Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum now occupies the site of the Murrah building , and it honors the 168 people killed that April 19 and the many others injured .
Very little is mentioned there about the bomber , Timothy J. McVeigh , and his distrust of the federal government .
But last week , fear of federal power was a noisy side note as the city prepared to mark Monday ’s anniversary .
For two days , thousands of “ tea party ” members gathered on the Statehouse grounds shouting anti-government slogans and waving flags with slogans such as “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” and “ End the Fed ! ”
A proposal expected to be introduced soon in the Legislature to create a new state militia , out of the control of federal authorities and staffed by armed and uniformed volunteers , drew praise .
“ That is how we can protect ourselves , ” said John Slocum , in the crowd at a Thursday rally .
“ We ’re real big on states ’ rights .
We want to bring back the balance of power . ”
Most tea party members have no love for McVeigh .
“ McVeigh , that guy was insane .
He was a monster , ” said Al Gerhart , a local cabinetmaker and head of the 2,000 - member Sooner Tea Party , one of more than 40 tea party organizations around the state .
But Gerhart supports the creation of the militia , which he said would be a counterweight to federal authority .
“ We do think it ’s a scary thing that the federal government has done nothing to check its power , ” he said .
He said he and others are deeply concerned that President Obama and a liberal Washington administration will toughen gun laws , so they have been stocking up .
“ I had an old shotgun , ” Gerhart said .
“ Now I ’ve got a rifle , a shotgun and a pistol .
Everybody did that .
We had to have enough arms in private hands in America since it was obvious Obama was going to be elected . ”
“ We ’ve got to get enough people to fight and stand up to the federal government , ” he said .
Some local officials point out that there are about 20 other states with limited volunteer militias that back up National Guard units , but many of the families of bombing victims are angry that the militia idea has surfaced now -- in advance of the anniversary and with Oklahoma City back in the national spotlight .
“ That idea is awful .
All they are doing is triggering more hatred , ” said Jannie Coverdale , who lost two grandsons in the Murrah building ’s day - care center .
Joseph Thai , a professor at the University of Oklahoma law school , said that the increased hype and anger could be enough to prompt someone to act in a dangerous way .
“ Most tea party people are peaceful , ” Thai said .
“ But it only takes one person to choose violence , just one person to be another Timothy McVeigh . ”
Politicians are split on the idea of establishing a militia outside federal control .
Republican state Sen. Randy Brogdon , who is running for governor , initially endorsed the idea .
Then he said it would work only if its focus was to back up the National Guard .
His GOP opponent , U.S. Rep. Mary Fallin , said that if volunteers want to get involved they should join the Guard .
State Sen. Steve Russell , a Republican and former Army lieutenant colonel , said a militia was not needed .
“ We ’ve already got the best National Guard in the country , ” he said .
Paul Sund , spokesman for Democratic Gov. Brad Henry , said , “ I have no idea why there is a sudden interest in a state militia . ”
Frank Keating , a former top federal law enforcement official in Washington who was the GOP governor of Oklahoma when the bomb went off , said : “ We can always use a second pair of hands filling sandbags , ” but said that the militia would have to be tightly controlled by the governor ’s office .
One of the deepest anti-federal sentiments was expressed at a news conference inside the Capitol building .
A group of conspiracy theorists charged that McVeigh had been acting on behalf of the U.S. government , and that Washington had sent secret federal agents here to help him destroy the Murrah building .
V.Z. Lawton , a federal housing employee who was injured in the blast , said that as many as four federal agents had been on hand to assist McVeigh .
“ The building was already coming down before McVeigh ’s truck bomb went off , ” Lawton said .
Bud Welch lost his daughter in the bombing .
He does not believe that McVeigh had help igniting the truck bomb .
“ Those people are all nuts , ” Welch said .

Singer and activist engages in finger - pointing row with the BNP 's London assembly member in east London
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Billy Bragg was engaged in a finger - pointing row with a senior member of the British National party during a day of action in London , telling him his " racist fascist " politics offered no help to voters .
Bragg was leafleting in Barking and Dagenham , one of the BNP 's top target areas in next month 's elections , when he bumped into the BNP 's London assembly member , Richard Barnbrook , who has attacked the singer on his blog .
Bragg , who was born and raised in Barking , told Barnbrook : " You do not represent the people of Barking and Dagenham , " as the pair became embroiled in a heated argument .
" You are exploiting the genuine concerns of people here and you are making the problems worse . "
Barnbrook , who was elected to the London assembly in 2008 , accused Bragg of " mouthing away " and said the " ballot box will determine what happens " .
The exchange came during a day of action against the BNP which saw 541 volunteers deliver 91,000 Hope Not Hate newspapers .
The BNP is due to launch its manifesto this week and has claimed it is on the verge of causing a " political earthquake " .
It claims it has a chance of taking control of Barking and Dagenham council and of gaining two MPs – in Stoke Central and Barking .
However , the far - right party 's campaign has been beset by problems , and it appears to be floundering in the polls .
Internal criticism over Nick Griffin 's leadership came to a head earlier this month when publicity director Mark Collett was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill him .
In Stoke , the party 's number two target , Alby Walker , who led the BNP on the local council for four years , is standing as an independent in the general election .
Walker said he was leaving the BNP because of a " vein of Holocaust denying within the BNP that I cannot identify myself with . "
Meanwhile Griffin , who is standing in Barking , has been forced to change the BNP 's whites - only membership policy following a legal battle with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission .
Last week the Electoral Commission announced it was launching a formal investigation into the party 's 2008 accounts .
These difficulties appear to have hit the party 's ability to stand candidates in next month 's local elections .
Scientists in the US claim to have used a bone marrow transplant to cure mental illness in a study that could have profound implications for patients with psychiatric problems .
Bone marrow transplants are routinely used to treat leukaemia and other life - threatening diseases , but have never been used to treat mental health problems .
The team , led by a Nobel prizewinning geneticist , found that experimental transplants in mice cured them of a disorder in which they groom themselves so excessively they develop bare patches of skin .
The condition is similar to a disorder in which people pull their hair out , called trichotillomania .
" A lot of people are going to find it amazing , " said Mario Capecchi at the University of Utah , who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 2007 for his work on mouse genetics .
" That 's the surprise : bone marrow can correct a behavioural defect . "
The team said their work is the first to reveal a direct link between a psychiatric disorder and faulty immune cells , which grow in bone marrow before moving to the brain to protect nerve cells from damage .
Capecchi said the condition the animals develop is comparable to obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , and could shed fresh light on the roots of the disorder .
Other illnesses including depression , schizophrenia and autism might also be linked to problems with the immune system , he added .
" The recognition that many neuropsychiatric diseases have a direct connection to the immune system emphasises that we should be taking immune deficiencies associated with neuropsychiatric disease much more seriously , " Capecchi told the Guardian " We know a lot more about the immune system and how to treat immune deficiencies than we know about how our brain works and what the drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders are doing , " he added .
The cost and health risks associated with bone marrow transplants are such that they would never be used to treat mental health problems in people , but the findings will inspire research into immune - based therapies for psychiatric disorders , according to scientists who were not involved with the work .
Naomi Fineberg , a consultant psychiatrist at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Welwyn Garden City , said the work was a major development .
" This finding is clearly important in directing research in new directions for OCD and OCD - spectrum disorder treatments .
Given the intransigence of OCD symptoms , and the fact that roughly one third of treated OCD patients fail to make a good recovery , new treatment directions in this field are sorely needed . "
In the study , Capecchi's team bred mice that carried a mutation in a gene called Hoxb8 that causes faulty immune cells to grow in the bone marrow .
Mice that carry the defective gene groom themselves too often and for too long , leaving them with bare patches and skin wounds .
Writing in the US journal Cell , the team describe how transplanting healthy bone marrow into the mice cured them of the grooming disorder .
In later operations , the scientists induced the disorder in healthy mice by giving them bone marrow from affected mice .
" We 're showing there is a direct relationship between a psychiatric disorder and the immune system , specifically cells named microglia that are derived from bone marrow , " Capecchi said .
There are two kinds of microglial cells in the brain .
Around 60 % form in the brain in the earliest stages of human development , while the remaining 40 % originate in bone marrow and then move to the brain .
" This is immensely important and incredibly exciting .
It 's definitely something people will want to follow up , " said Douglas Blackwood , professor of psychiatric genetics at Edinburgh University .
" Current treatments for these kinds of conditions are not incredibly effective and there 's a massive need for alternatives . "
Other researchers were more cautious about the work .
Paul Salkovskis , clinical director of the Maudsley Hospital Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma in London , said it was impossible to draw strong conclusions about the role of the immune system in human mental illnesses from the study .
" Excessive grooming in mice is not a good model for obsessive - compulsive disorder in humans , a condition that can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioural therapy , " he said .

The numbers are in for Sarah Palin ’s first Real American Stories special on Fox News , and they are n’t good .
Palin ’s special was expected to pull in big numbers for Fox News , but instead did worse that the regular occupant of the 10 PM slot , On The Record with Greta Van Susteren .
The viewers that did tune in did n’t stay long as the show lost viewers in every quarter hour .
Sarah Palin delivered yet another bomb .
Real American Stories was the vehicle that was supposed to deliver big numbers for Fox News while helping to further the Palin brand .
The show did win its time slot with about 2 million viewers and 472,000 viewers in the 25 - 54 demographic , but she was not able to beat the numbers of Greta Van Susteren who also averaged over 2 million viewers the night before , but had more viewers in the 25 - 54 demo , 503,000 , than Palin did .
Palin ’s performance was even worse when compared to Greta ’s Tuesday numbers , where she had over 2.4 million total viewers , and 587,000 in the demo .
This is bad news for Fox , but even worse news for Sarah Palin herself .
Fox News is the one network where Palin should deliver big numbers , but even on a conservative network , she under performs .
Palin and the show itself were both called boring by media critics .
Perhaps the worst possible criticism came from Time blogger Steven James Snyder who wrote , ” Playing the part of host , Palin was gracious , poised , present – and supremely uninteresting .
The same could go for the rest of the show , which postures itself as a gaggle of feel - good American tales but then runs at a pace and rhythm so brisk that we are unable to dive into any single story .
It ’s less Real American Stories than A Collection of Real American Short Stories , and it ’s because of this superficiality that my indifference turns to frustration . ”
Advertisements
Apparently , many of those brave souls who did tune in agreed with Mr. Snyder , as Palin ’s show registered double digit decreases in viewers over each quarter hour .
The people who should be most nervous right now reside at the Discovery networks , because they just gave Palin a deal for her own reality shown on TLC .
If Palin ca n’t deliver even average numbers on Fox News , how is she going to carry a reality show on TLC ?
Networks keep paying Sarah Palin , in order to chase the mythic brass ring that she is some sort of magic ratings draw , when the reality is that she is far too polarizing ever to be a mainstream ratings draw .
Sarah Palin is a niche attraction , but most in the media have been too slow to realize that the bloom has long since fallen of Palin ’s 2008 media rose .
Fox News tried to play it safe with Sarah Palin ’s limited skill set , and they produced a piece of really boring Morning In America television that does n’t connect with the hard times and reality of many Americans current daily lives .
Fox News managed to protect Palin ’s image , but they did so at the cost of produce yawn inducing television .
The biggest problem with Real American Stories is that it does n’t tell the story about what is really going on in America today .
Sarah Palin is n’t Ronald Reagan and this is n’t 1984 .
I ’m pleased to share some exciting news involving our crafty , stitched - together character we all know and love – that ’s right , I ’m talking about the one and only Sackboy .

The paper of record fell for two blogs ' April Fools ' jokes — one required a retraction and one went so far over their heads , the Times sent a publicist to quell an " inaccurate " story .
Update : Prankster tells all .
The joke they fell for hook , line , and sinker came from New York Personal Injury Attorney Blog.com .
Eric Turkewitz — the titular Personal Injury Attorney — claimed he had been appointed " official White House law blogger . "
NYT 's City Room reported it in a post entitled " When Lawyers Blog " :
After all , as Mr. Turkewitz , a Manhattan lawyer , writes on his New York Personal Injury Law Blog , he is about to be sounding off on all manner of legal issues as the Obama administration 's new White House law blogger .
" Excited about new blogging gig as White House law blogger , " he tweeted this morning .
" But hope I do n't have to spend too much time in D.C. "
Spoken like a true New Yorker .
But Turkewitz was pulling their leg .
At least , they think he was pulling their leg , when they called to ask he dodged their fact - checking department 's sledgehammer of truth .
City Room 's befuddled retraction :
Note : an earlier version of this column had an item about a blog post by a personal - injury lawyer , Eric Turkewitz , announcing that he had been appointed the White House law blogger .
Blogospheric chatter indicates a high likelihood that this post was an April Fool hoax .
Mr. Turkewitz declined to give us a straight answer on this score , so , pending callback from the White House , we 've taken the item down .
When the White House press office denied Turkewitz 's appointment to the Wall Street Journal , he expressed outrage at the power - hungry press office 's manipulation : " I 'm not surprised that the press office gave that comment to the WSJ .
Before I even start , they are already trying to squeeze me out . "
Update : Turkewitz has published a detailed post - mortem on the prank , originally conceived of as " a bunch of law bloggers would try to punk the political bloggers , whose reputation is to grab any old rumor and run with it . "
The people who ran with it , though , were WSJ and NYT .
On the other end of the spectrum , TechCrunch ran a subtle joke about the Times ' resistance to new media by reprinting a 1996 NYT article announcing the paper 's arrival on the " World Wide Web " : " The only changes we made were to replace ' Web Site ' with ' iPad App ' and ' World Wide Web ' with ' iPad . ' "
A NYTimes communications person emailed to ask us to correct or take down our post earlier today about the debut of their new iPad application , which they 're calling " The New York Times on the iPad . "
The post , they say , contains " extremely old information that is inaccurate " and requests that we correct or take down the post .
Darn you , World Wide Web .
Will the entropy of misinformation , rumor , and hyperbole will never end ?
Well , BP has released the video of that oil wellhead pouring crude into the Gulf of Mexico , and brother , does it give you pause .
Someone at YouTube even obtained the deep - sea audio that goes with it .
How much is it ?
Joel Achenbach at the Washington Post reports :
It 's clearly a lot -- anyone can see that .
But experts say that , without a meter , it 's impossible to estimate the flow , particularly since it's a mixture of oil , gas and water .
" Anybody who can tell you how much oil is coming out of that thing is likely lying to you , " Bruce Bullock , director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University , said after reviewing the video .
But BP could use established scientific methods to measure the flow if it chose to do so , said Rich Camilli , an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution .
One technique , for example , would use sonar in a manner quite similar to sonograms used in medical diagnostics , he said .
Or BP could use the containment dome that was lowered to the sea bottom as a kind of measuring device .
The " official " estimates -- which have been ridiculously low from the start -- now are that the leak is spilling " just " 5,000 barrels a day into the Gulf .
However , as Achenbach notes :
Two weeks ago , an outside researcher , oceanographer Ian MacDonald of Florida State University , used satellite images gathered by the organization SkyTruth to produce an estimate of 26,000 barrels of oil a day .
But MacDonald has made clear that it's a rough estimate and has n't been subjected to scientific peer review .
Oddly enough , the story is raising little concern so far among the public -- mainly , we 'd guess , because the oil has n't hit the beaches yet .
Frank Newport at Gallup reports :
No sign of any major uptick in concern about the environment , energy , or gas prices as a result of the Gulf oil spill .
Yet .
Our May update on most important problem facing the country , in the field last week , shows no change in the small number of people mentioning any of these issues .
Laura Parker at AOL
News outlines three likely scenarios .
I 'm guessing we 're looking at No. 3 , but that 's just me .
These images , taken with the 2.1 - meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona , show galaxy shapes that are either physically intertwined or distorted by the gravity of nearby neighbors .
These AGN were known prior to the Swift survey , but Swift has found dozens of new ones in more distant galaxies .
This story was updated at 9:50 a.m. ET .
Supermassive black holes appear to light up with hard X - rayswhen their parent galaxies decide to merge , according to a survey by NASA 'speeping Swift satellite .
The new findings solve a mystery that has keptastronomers in the dark for decades .
Just 1 percent of supermassiveblack holes currently put on such exhibitionist behavior by giving off asmuch as 10 billion times the sun 's energy , as so - called active galactic nuclei( AGN ) .
The supermassive black holes themselves hold anywhere from a million toa billion times the sun 's mass , while the Milky Way galaxy 's black hole isabout 3 or 4 million solar masses .
Researchers had scratched their heads over why suchhigh - energy displays occurred , until now .
The findings announced today confirm pasttheories that suggested that violence from galacticmergers can fuel the growth of central black holes .
" We find that about 25 percent of black holes found by Swift are in the process of merging , " said team member Michael Koss of the University of Maryland in College Park , during a NASA teleconference .
About 60 percent of such active galaxies will mergecompletely within the next billion years to create giant black holes .
Hard X -ray action
Swift used its Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ) to detect anytelltale signs of hard X - rays , which rank between gamma-rays and X - rays on theelectromagnetic spectrum of light .
Such hard X - rays can pass through interstellar gas or dustwhich otherwise blocks ultraviolet , optical and soft - X - ray light .
Infraredradiation can also pass through the material , but may represent emissions froma galaxy 's star nurseries rather than the central black holes .
The hard X - ray survey allowed astronomers to feel confidentthat they had spotted the majority of AGN within Swift 's survey range of about650 million light - years away .
( A light - year is the distance that light cantravel in one year ?
about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion km ) . )
Koss and his colleagues then followed up by spending 20 nights peering at the AGN with a 2 - meter telescope at Kitt Peak NationalObservatory near Tucson , Ariz .
" Many of these galaxies are very close to us , so we seethe severe distortion of the galaxy shapes , " Koss explained .
" Inaddition , we see that the galaxies are very close to each other and thereforewill merge and interact very strongly . "
Feeding on mergers
The galactic mergers represent a way in which supermassiveblack holes can feed as they grow , according to Joel Bregman , an astrophysicistat the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who was not involved with the study .
Astronomers had previously known that black holes could grow by either mergingwith other black holes , or by sucking down nearby gaseous material .
" What this work does is it shows us the [ black holes ] feeding on gas channeled into the center [ of the galaxies ] at a fairly earlystage , " Bregman said .
In other words , supermassive black holes can kickinto high gear early on before their host galaxies have even begun to merge .
Past findings have also show that both merging galaxies and AGN are both much more common in the earlier universe , which had many moresmall galaxies than now .
That indirectly supports the idea of galactic mergerstriggering the growth of black holes .
But unlike the merger galaxies that spew plenty of hardX - rays , our Milky Way galaxy has afairly quiet black hole at its center .
The black hole likely goes throughperiods of outbursts and relative quiet , Bregman noted .
About 10 percent of similar - size galaxies are much moreactive than the Milky Way , said Meg Urry , an astrophysicist at Yale Universityin New Haven , Conn. , who was not a member of the Swift team .
" It 's kind of lucky that we 're in the 90 percent that are n't very active , so there are not a lot of hard X - rays being produced andcoming our way and disturbing [ Earth 's ] atmosphere , " Urry said .
Peeking into the past
Swift 's eyes could get a complementary boost from NASA 'supcoming NuStarmission , which is slated for launch in 2012 .
NuStar would use two sets of mirror arrays that focus hard X - rays to study even more distant galaxies from 7 or 8 billionyears ago .
" It will find more distant black hole growth and AGN , so the question is whether those are triggered the same way as the [ Swift ] sample , " Urry said in response to a SPACE.com question .
" Wethink they are , but you 'd like to observe them and see if that 's the case . "
For now , the Swift satellite continues its main mission ofwatching for gamma-ray bursts , which represent the most powerful form of energyin the universe since the Big Bang .
" We just detected our 508th gamma - ray burst about 30 minutes ago , " said Neil Gehrels , principal investigator for Swift at theNASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , during the NASAteleconference .
NASA celebrated Swift 's 500thdiscovery of gamma ray bursts back in April .
The Swift study will appear in the June 20 issue of TheAstrophysical Journal Letters .
Welcome to Agora
Agora is a nomic , a game in which the rules can be changed as part of the gameplay itself .
The concept of Nomic , and an initial ruleset , was invented by Peter Suber and published in an appendix to his book The Paradox of Self - Amendment in 1982 .
Agora started with a very similar ruleset ( adapted for play via email ) on 30 June 1993 , and since then has become one of the world ’s longest - lasting nomics .
Over its history of over 27 years , Agora has seen over 8000 proposals , and over 2500 rules enacted ; but rules are amended frequently and repealed at much the same rate they are enacted , meaning that the ruleset is often fresh and interesting for new and experienced players alike , rather than continuously accreting rules until the game becomes unplayable .
Although the game has been won on over 60 occasions , it can continue on after a win , giving everyone a chance to succeed ( not that winning is easy ; most months , nobody accomplishes it ) .
The course of the game is charted by its over 3800 judicial cases , via which disputes are resolved .
Why Agora ?
Agora is a relatively serious nomic ; many of its players see it as an experiment in philosophy , political science , and group dynamics , rather than just a game ; sometimes it acts more like a country .
It tends to be relatively conservative as nomics go , in that major rules changes often take a while to happen and are commonly debated in advance .
Unlike some other nomics , much of Agora ’s gameplay is concerned with the proposals system and the rules themselves , with many wins having been via exploiting loopholes in even long - standing rules , just as other players prefer to win in the “ intended ” fashion .
However , it is not uncommon for substantial subgames to be proposed , played for a while , and then repealed when players bore with them .
On the other hand , Agorans tend not to be above silliness and having fun ; some players will do things just to see what will happen , or to create unusual situations merely to observe the resulting chaos .
Agora occasionally experiments with mechanics designed only to shake things up a bit ( such as randomized rule changes , or offices whose only job is to try to repeal rules ) ; and once went to war over an insult that Agorans were “ a generally boring lot ” .

Reisman 's Self - Portrait
NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman takes a self - portrait visor while participating in the first of three spacewalks scheduled for the Atlantis crew and their Expedition 23 hosts .
Though three spacewalks will involve only three astronauts ( two on each occasion ) who actually leave the shirt - sleave environments of the two docked spacecraft , all twelve astronauts and cosmonauts have roles in supporting the work .
Part of the space station and the blue and white Earth are among the objects seen in his visor .
Fellow spacewalker Steve Bowen , mission specialist , is out of frame .

Personal Quote :
... all my movies are created because I 'm fascinated by a subject .
Sometimes I think there 's just a certain obsession about it all - when you want to do something just for the sake of it .
A lot of directors are like that .
I 'm just very fortunate that most of my movies get made .
Ubuntu offers a lot of fonts , in addition to the defaults installed , and the MicroSoft msttcorefonts package , in its repositories .
All these fonts mentioned here are provided as packages , which can easily installed using command line tools like apt - get or using Synaptic .
These fonts will come in handy for designing flyers , or for designing headers and graphics for the web using the Gimp .
Also , some of these fonts are pretty commonly used to render pages , like Lucida .
I will save the packages with the biggest collection of fonts for the end here .
Since I have included screenshots of most of the fonts , and this article is sorta long , please read on by clicking the “ More ” link below .
Gentium
This is one of my favorite fonts .
Gentium calls itself a “ Typeface for the Nations ” , and looks beautiful .
You can install Gentium by doing a :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - gentium
The design is intended to be highly readable , reasonably compact , and visually attractive .
The additional â€ ˜extendedâ€ ™ Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones .
Diacritics are treated with careful thought and attention to their use .
Gentium also supports both polytonic and monotonic Greek , including a number of alternate forms .
These fonts were originally the product of two years of research and study by the designer at the University of Reading , England , as part of an MA program in Typeface Design .
Fonts from Dustismo
These designer fonts were designed by Dustin Norlander of Dustismo .
Here ’s some sample of the fonts :
You can install all of Dustin ’s fonts using :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - dustin
George Williams ’ Fonts
George Williams is a font developer ( with his own Wikipedia page , no less ! ) who provided the fonts Monospace , Caslon , Caliban and Cupola .
Check out the samples below :
You can install these fonts using :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - georgewilliams
Some Juicy Fonts
The ttf - sjfonts package provides the two fonts , Delphine and Steve Hand which are also available from sourceforge .
These are two handwriting fonts , as seen below :
You can install these two fonts using :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - sjfonts
Sun Java6 Fonts - Lucida
Installing the sun - java6 - fonts package installs the Lucida fonts and also installs the java6 binary package - so if you install the font package you get Java6 for free !
This seems to be weird , but this post is about fonts .
The package install Lucida Sans , Lucida Bright and Lucida Typewriter :
You can install these three fonts using :
$ sudo apt - get install sun-java6 - fonts
Caution :
This will also install sun - java6 - bin etc - so you will have a working Sun Java 6 if you choose to install this .
This is not a “ bad ” thing , but it can take some time to download and install .
Larabie Fonts
Ray Larabie has been “ making fonts and giving them away since 1996 ″ on the popular font destination LarabieFonts.com .
We have three packages in Ubuntu that provide the Larabie fonts , or at least the ones that are free .
These three packages provide the “ Deco ” , “ Straight ” and “ Uncommon ” Larabie fonts .
Since there are way too many of these fonts , 300 + ?
I lost count after a hundred :-) , I will link you to a pdf file with samples of all the fonts .
Click on the preview below to see the Larabie Fonts Catalogue ( Size : 2.5 MB ) :
You can install all of the Larabie fonts using :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - larabie - deco ttf - larabie - straight ttf - larabie - uncommon
Of course , you could just install one of these packs by removing the names of the other two packages .
Summary
If you want to get all the fonts in one go , use the following command :
$ sudo apt - get install ttf - gentium ttf - dustin ttf - georgewilliams ttf - sjfonts sun-java6- fonts ttf-larabie -deco ttf-larabie - straight ttf-larabie-uncommon
These fonts should together provide enough gunpowder for the novice graphic designer in Ubuntu .
If you are wondering how I took the sample screenshots , the answer is gnome - specimen , which provides an easy way to preview the fonts installed on your system .
It can be installed using :
$ sudo apt - get install gnome - specimen
To see more free fonts that are available for Linux systems , visit the Free Font Resources for Open Source OSes Page - it seems to be current since I can already find the Red Hat Liberation Font listed there .
If I missed any TrueType font packages in Ubuntu here , please let me know in the comments .
Update : If you add Seveas ’ feisty - extras repository , you can get your hands on the ttf - fossfonts package .
Slavery vs Child Porn
Slavery Still Exists !
We all like to think of slavery as a problem from the 19th century , but it still exists and is a significant problem !
Kevin Bales gave an interesting TED talk about how to combat modern slavery [ 1 ] .
Currently there are an estimated 27,000,000 slaves in the world , it ’s a lot but it ’s a smaller proportion of the world population in slavery than at any time in history .
Also the price of slaves is lower than ever before , instead of being a capital asset a slave is a disposable item ( this is really bad for the slaves ) .
The estimated average cost to liberate a slave is $ US400 , this involves rescuing them from slavery and teaching them the skills that they need to have a sustainable life – there ’s no point rescuing them only to have them get captured again !
Kevin notes that the US is still paying the price of the botched emancipation of 1865 , so the liberation of slaves really needs to be done properly .
The estimated total cost to liberate all the slaves in the world is $ US10.8 billion .
Think about the trillions of dollars that have been spent on wars to supposedly liberate people , when a mere $ US10.8 billion would liberate all slaves .
That ’s a fraction of the cost of the proposed National Broadband Network – which would you rather have , fast net access for cable TV services or a world without slavery ?
Censorship of Child - Porn ( and other things ) vs Liberating Slaves
It is often claimed that child porn needs to be stopped to prevent there being economic incentives to molest children in other countries , to achieve this goal the Australian government wants to filter all net access to prevent access to child - porn , other prohibited porn , documentation about euthanasia , and the occasional dental practice ( seriously , they just ca n’t get their filters right ) .
Methods that are proven to prevent children being molested should be given a much higher priority than censoring the Internet in the hope of removing economic incentives for child abuse .
It seems reasonable to assume that a significant portion of child - slaves are molested ( because we know that slave owners are really bad people and there ’s nothing to stop them from molesting children ) .
Let ’s assume for the sake of discussion that 1 /4 of child slaves are molested .
So that would give an average cost of $ US1600 to free one child from sexual slavery and three other children from physically abusive environments .
Currently the Australian government plans to spend $ 44,000,000 in Internet censorship with the supposed aim of protecting the children .
The fact that the majority of child - porn is believed to be transferred via protocols other than HTTP has not deterred the government from pushing forward a HTTP - only filter for censorship .
Also the fact that anyone could use a VPN , tor , or other services to trivially bypass a HTTP filter has not deterred them .
Let ’s assume for the sake of discussion that $ US400 equates to $ 500 Australian , the exchange rate is lower than that but it varies and it ’s best to be conservative .
Therefore the $ 44,000,000 the government wants to spent on censorship could be used to liberate 88,000 child slaves .
If my estimates are correct that would save 22,000 children from being molested .
In the unlikely event that slavers happen to be nice people who do n’t do nasty things like molest children ( which really is n’t credible ) then freeing 88,000 children from slavery and all the physical abuse that it involves is still a really good thing !
If a plan to prevent child sexual abuse by liberating slaves fails to actually prevent any sexual abuse then at least you end up with some freed slaves ( which is a really good thing ) .
But if a plan to prevent child sexual abuse by censoring the Internet fails then all you end up with is slower Internet access and censorship of totally unrelated things that the government does n’t like .
The first real success in fluid breathing came in 1966 , with Dr. Leland Clark 's " liquid - breathing - mouse " experiment .
Dr. Clark ( inventor of the Clark electrode ) realized that oxygen and carbon dioxide were very soluble in fluorocarbon liquids ( like freon ) .
Assuming that the alveoli of the lungs should be capable of drawing oxygen out of the fluid and replacing it with carbon dioxide , Clark suggested that these fluorocarbons should support respiration of animals .
Performing the first tests on anaesthetized mice , Dr. Clark temporarily paralyzed each intubated animal , inflating a cuff inside the trachea to provide a seal and ensure that no air entered the lungs , and no solution leaked out .
After bubbling oxygen through the fluorocarbon , the oxygenated fluid was pumped into the animals ' lungs , and recirculated ( about 6 cycles of inhalation and exhalation per minute ) .
Most of the animals who were kept in the fluid for up to an hour survived for several weeks after their removal , before eventually succumbing to pulmonary damage .
Autopsies uniformly revealed that the lungs appeared congested when collapsed but normal when inflated .
Some of the early problems Clark encountered seemed to be due to the size of the animals ' airway .
The tiny size physically limited the amount of fluid that could get into the lungs .
For that and other reasons , carbon dioxide tended to build up in the system : it simply could n't be removed fast enough .
This photograph demonstrates a living mouse breathing in the liquid , while a goldfish inhabits the water floating on top .
Dr. Clark discovered that the length of time the mice could survive in the fluid was directly related to the fluorocarbon 's temperature : the colder the fluid , the lower the respiration rate which in turn prevented carbon dioxide buildup .
He therefore induced hypothermia in the animals .
This technique seemed to give the most success , as one animal survived over 20 hours breathing fluid at 18 oC .
Purified haemoglobin
This is produced from expired red blood cells , for example diaspirin cross - linked haemoglobin .
Recombinant haemoglobin
This is a modified human haemoglobin tetramer cross-linked with a glycine bridge between the alpha subunits .
It is produced from Escherichia Coli or yeast .
The cross - links prevent renal excretion .
The haemoglobin solutions must be free of red cell debris to avoid renal damage .
Other effects include impairment of macrophage activity .
These products are hyperosmotic and are quickly broken down in the blood .
The oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left with use of these products .
Bovine haemoglobin has also been used .
Perfluorocarbons
These are inert chemicals with oxygen solubility 20X that of plasma .
They exist as a 10 % solution .
These solutions carry dissolved oxygen in an amount directly proportional to its partial pressure .
its accumulation in the reticulo - endothelial system is at present , of unknown significance .

‘ capture the rain ’ skyscraper by ryszard rychlicki and agnieszka nowak
polish architectural students ryszard rychlicki and agnieszka nowak of H3 AR received a special mention for their proposal in the 2010 skyscraper competition .
‘ capture the rain ’ skyscraper is a building whose roof and external shell , which consists systems of gutters , are aimed at capturing as much rainfall as possible to meet the daily needs of its inhabitants .
average daily consumption of water per person is 150 liters , out of which 85 liters may be replaced by rain water .
within the last thirty years water consumption has significantly increased .
there are lots of factors that contribute to such an increase such as increasing number washing machines and dish washers , increasing popularity of garden showering devices and flushing toilets .
a third of water being used in households in western countries is flushed in toilets .
since 1900 the total water consumption in the US has increased by 1000 % .
at present , an average american uses five times more water that a citizen of developing countries .
such an increase is related to among others improved living standards .
on the other hand , a national hobby of the danes is collecting rain water for washing and watering plants .
within the last ten years average use of pure water in denmark dropped by 40 % and inhabitants of the so called eco-villages use a third part of the national average .
in view of this data , they decided to design a tower , whose structure will allow for capturing and processing as much rainfall as possible to provide with water for its inhabitants .
millennia plants have been developing systems of capturing and processing rainfall .
such systems helped them to deal with water deficits or surpluses .
similarly , they wanted to copy their simple mechanisms of rainfall capturing and processing .
initially , in designing the tower , we focused at shaping and modeling the surface of the roof to capture as much rainfall as possible .
under a roof ’s surface , there are water reservoirs in the form of a large funnel and reed fields , which serve as a hydro botanic water treatment unit .
the unit processes water into usable water that is further transmitted to apartments .
a network of gutters on the external surfaces of the building is designed to capture rainfall flowing down the building .
such flowing rainfall is transmitted to floors and its surplus is stored in a reservoir under the building .
water captured and processed by the building may be used for flushing toilets , feeding washing machines , watering plants , cleaning floors and other domestic applications .
having analyzed rainfall in several large cities in developed countries , we obtained a formula that shows what percentage of daily pure water consumption may be replaced with rainfall thanks to the technology applied in their building .

President Obama said steps should be taken to prevent similar accidents
US President Barack Obama has called for an investigation into a mining disaster in West Virginia that killed 29 people .
Mr Obama said the cause of the blast at the Upper Big Branch mine should be determined , to prevent similar accidents from occurring .
The bodies of four missing workers were found on Saturday , ending hopes that any missing miners had survived .
The disaster was the deadliest US coal mining accident in 40 years .
The cause of the blast has not yet been confirmed but officials believe it could be related to high levels of methane in the mine .
Mr Obama called for federal mine safety investigators to look into the cause of the accident .
" We can not bring back the men we lost , " he said in a statement .
" What we can do , in their memory , is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability . "
Rescue workers are recovering the last bodies from the mine and funerals of the victims have begun to take place .
It is the worst coal mine disaster in the US since 38 people were killed in a Kentucky mine in 1970 .

lie this big is n't just a belch out of someone 's mouth , it 's years in the making .
A lie this melancholy is n't mean - spirited , it 's a flabby high school misfit stopping at nothing to fit in .
A lie this loud is n't humble , it 's a 300 - pound lineman telling teammates , " Division I , son .
I 'm going D - I . "
A lie this complex is n't a one - man show , it 's mom , pop , grandpa , grandma , buddies , coaches and principals believing in the unbelievable .
A lie this perfect is n't premeditated , it 's a teenager watching Pac - 10 football on TV every Saturday , wishing wishing wishing
So that 's how a fantasy , a whopper , saw the light of day .
It was a million things .
What began as teenage insecurity ended up morphing into one of the tallest tales in college football history .
One calendar year ago , Kevin Hart , a no-name offensive lineman from Fernley , Nev. , staged a farcical news conference , fibbing through his teeth and announcing he'd be playing football for UC Berkeley -- even though Cal did n't recruit him , eyeball him or talk to him .
But the most curious part , and the reason the anniversary resonates , is how hundreds of people in that packed high school gym bought in .
The mercurial head coach who emceed the event the proud offensive line coach who groomed him as a player the hardworking father and mother who trusted him the retired grandfather who rarely missed a practice the teachers who were close to flunking him the buddies on his MySpace page .
They all stood up to roar and clap .
To every one of them , it was a seminal moment .
Someone from the dusty town of Fernley , going D - I ?
Not in their wildest dreams .
But , yes , in Kevin Hart 's dreams .
And never discount someone 's dream .
Tim Dunn / Reno Gazette - Journal
The crowd at Fernley High roared its approval after Kevin Hart 's big announcement ... but the story would quickly unravel .
Alone and afraid in Nevada
At least he grew up near Cal Berkeley .
Until he was 14 , Kevin Hart lived in Oakley , Calif. , about 48 miles from campus , cheering for the Bay Area 's teams .
He rather enjoyed baseball , but in almost all of his childhood photographs , Kevin is posing with a football , clutching it tightly .
Courtesy of George Hart
In his childhood photos , Kevin always displayed a love for football .
He wanted to play Pop Warner , but the weight limit always disqualified him .
He was big - boned and too heavy to be eligible , so it was flag football or nothing at all .
His choice was a flag league at the YMCA .
He was no spectacular athlete , but he was a sports encyclopedia and knew the difference between a zone blitz and a strongside blitz .
Coaches were thrilled to have him .
He 'd crack one - liners and would have teammates over to watch Cal , Stanford , Oregon or the Pac - 10 game du jour .
But soon , his parents , Rick and Marlene , were looking to get out of Oakley .
Rick was an estimator for an auto repair shop , with a junior college education , and the money was n't pouring in .
Marlene , a grammar school teacher , had a nominal salary and could help only so much .
They heard about a place on the outskirts of Reno , a rural community named Fernley , where the cost of living was lower and the jobs seemed secure .
So that 's where Rick , Marlene and their four kids headed -- to a two - stoplight town of 13,000 .
Their oldest , Kevin , seemed distracted .
His favorite aunt , Paula Wakeman -- who used to take him to Oakland A's games -- had suddenly died of cancer at the age of 45 .
The loss , coupled with the move , seemed to send Kevin into a shell .
He was a high school freshman , which can be overwhelming socially and academically , and the sheer size of his body did n't help his self - esteem .
The only upside was there was no weight limit in high school football -- a good thing , considering he weighed more than 300 pounds .
" I saw him in football practice the first day , " says Zack Betts , a feisty little linebacker who is the same age , " and I was like , ' Geez , who 's this big kid ?
He ca n't be a freshman . ' "
The worst part was the big kid was getting shoved around .
Betts remembers him being slow -- " a slug " is his exact phrase -- and Kevin 's grandfather , George Hart , says Kevin could n't even come close to lifting his own weight .
" I do n't know what his bench [ press ] was , " George says , " but I 'm going to say less than 100 pounds .
He was just a big ol ' marshmallow . "
Fernley 's popular varsity football coach , Dave Hart ( no relation ) , barely knew the kid existed .
In 25 seasons at Fernley , Dave Hart had seen big linemen come and go , and he was n't about to order every pudgy kid to a weight room .
In fact , the coach did n't have a mandatory weight - training program at all , much less a temper , which was why he was beloved and also perhaps why Fernley had become a perennial loser .
The other problem was he seemed hell - bent against the forward pass .
The coach 's license plate read , " Veer 38 , " which told people , including opponents , everything they needed to know .
It was an offense from the Dark Ages -- run the ball or bust -- and , because coach Hart did n't have Barry Sanders , usually it was bust .
Not one Fernley player had ever earned a Division I football scholarship .
So , if Kevin was ever going to amount to much , football wise , Dave Hart was n't going to be the guy to push him .
Kevin needed to lose his love handles , or at least find out whether he had pectoral muscles , and it helped when the school made a coaching change following Kevin 's freshman year .
Courtesy of George Hart Unable to meet the weight limit for Pop Warner , Kevin took his pigskin passion to a YMCA flag football league .
Dave Hart 's replacement was Mark Hodges , a ball of fire who was n't fond of losing .
After a prep career in Riverside , Calif. , Hodges had been a graduate assistant at Southern Oregon University before spending 12 years as a head and assistant coach at South Medford and North Medford ( Ore. ) high schools .
As an assistant at North Medford , he'd been to two state title games and had mentored two future college quarterbacks , plus a defensive tackle who wound up playing at Oregon .
This was n't some neophyte ; this was a no - nonsense , 21st century coach who knew all the nuances of building a program .
There 'd be mandatory weightlifting , offseason workouts and maybe seven - on - seven passing drills , if someone at Fernley could be taught to throw a spiral .
What Hodges needed most , though , was bulk and talent and , in the summer before his debut season of 2005 , his eyes bugged out at the sight of Kevin Hart .
At the time , Kevin was playing first base for the Fernley summer baseball team , having eschewed the football workouts altogether .
As much as Kevin loved football , and wished he could dominate , no one had mentored him on line play or even encouraged him , and he was too new to Fernley and too shy to beg for help .
But Hodges was n't shy .
He saw 6 - foot - 4 and 325 sloppy pounds of potential pass protection and remembers telling a staff member , " That guy over there looks like he could play a little football .
He looks intent on what he 's doing and focused .
Let 's have a chat with him . "
The chat consisted of : " I want you ; I hope you want us . "
Kevin was grateful to be noticed , grateful not to be an outcast at school anymore .
Hodges gave him a detailed weightlifting plan , and , weeks later , when a bicep appeared , Kevin was sold .
It was that way with most of the players .
The once - moribund varsity began to chalk up victories -- five , to be exact -- although trouble was brewing .
Five of Fernley 's new players apparently had transferred in from Oregon , along with Hodges , and -- although Hodges reportedly thought they 'd been cleared by the school -- the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association ruled them ineligible .
The coach also was investigated for holding illegal full - squad Sunday practices , and the NIAA ended up forcing the school to forfeit its entire season .
The chaos had the Fernley fan base yearning for the good ol ' days -- uncomplicated 3 - 7 seasons -- and many took out their anger on Hodges .
A local grandmother told him , " Do n't settle down here because you 're going to go . "
People close to the coach say someone shot the window out of his car .
But he also had his share of supporters , including Kevin 's grandfather .
George Hart , a retired welder and crane operator , had moved to Fernley to watch his grandkids grow up .
And he marveled at what Hodges had done for Kevin .
" Before , he could n't get up out of a squat with his own weight , " George says .
" But now he was squatting 500 pounds . "
It had taken just one season , a sophomore year on the junior varsity , for Kevin to be transformed , body and mind .
The once introverted teenager was back to his Oakley self : loud , wisecracking and reciting college football statistics .
" It was n't so much quiet Kevin anymore , it was obnoxious Kevin , " says his teammate and friend , Betts .
And it was n't just Hodges directing this transformation ; it was also Hodges ' right - hand man , offensive line coach Chris Kribs .
Kribs was everything a Fernley kid could aspire to be .
He was a massive 300 - pounder , a former starting right guard at Western Oregon University who could dead - lift 700 pounds and dunk a basketball from a standing start .
He 'd also had a cup of coffee in NFL Europe , giving him instant credibility .
But , more than that , he was genuinely invested in his players .
He took them to restaurants , had them over to his home and demanded maximum effort .
He told his linemen that his college jersey number was 77 and that none of them was near - qualified to wear it .
It was his way of challenging the group , and one day , before the 2006 season , a brazen Kevin Hart tapped Kribs on the shoulder .
Courtesy of George Hart Inspired by offensive line coach Chris Kribs , left , and head coach Mark Hodges , Kevin developed into an all - state offensive lineman .
" I 'm going to show you I am qualified , '' Kevin said .
Before long , a No. 77 jersey was folded neatly in Kevin 's locker .
And it was n't charity , either .
Kribs and Hodges were impressed by how Kevin had changed his diet , dropped to less than 300 pounds , lifted weights after hours and even practiced with significant injuries .
" Very coachable , " Hodges says of Kevin .
" A very good teammate .
Good leader .
Never missed a practice , never missed a workout , was encouraging to other people , players , younger players and good in the locker room , funny .
" His mobility for a guy his size was real good .
I mean , real good .
Paid attention to detail , really got down the footwork . "
Kevin thanked Kribs profusely for No. 77 -- " Coach Kribs is like a second father to me , " he told friends -- and wound up having an admirable junior season , his first as a varsity player .
He was named all - state , largely on Hodges ' recommendation , and his name filtered out to some recruiting services .
So that 's how it started .
That 's how , in April 2007 , Kevin began receiving mail from D - I colleges .
These were basic , nondescript recruiting letters , but they were novel to Kevin just the same .
They arrived from the universities of Washington , Oregon and Nevada , to name three , and there were even a few from Ivy League schools .
Ivy League ?
If they only knew .
Pervasive peer pressure
The truth was , Kevin could name the 10 head coaches in the Pac - 10 , but likely not the last 10 presidents of the United States .
School had never been his passion , which is common and understandable , but you need to mix in a few Bs and Cs if you want to play on Saturdays .
Tim Dunn / Reno Gazette - Journal According to Kevin , Hodges never saw Kevin 's academic transcripts , only the eligibility list .
The problem was n't necessarily his smarts .
Kevin just would n't or could n't apply himself , for whatever reason , and no one was holding him accountable -- not his distracted parents , not his oblivious coaches and certainly not the high school administration at Fernley .
Kevin , in his early stages of high school , found out that Fernley students were eligible for athletics as long as they earned passing grades .
In other words , a lowly 1.5 grade - point average could still land you on the field .
" Most of the football guys simply shoot for Ds , " says a Fernley student who wishes to remain anonymous .
" They do n't care about school . "
The administration was n't exactly raising the academic bar this way , but someone forgot to tell the parents , or , at least , did n't tell all the parents .
Kevin 's mother and father worked full time , attended church daily , had four kids to raise and trusted Kevin implicitly .
So much so they did n't ask to see his report card -- not even his mom , who was a third - grade teacher .
" And they should 've checked , " George says .
" I blame his parents .
But when you start pointing fingers , you 've got three pointing back at you .
So blame me , too . "
Hodges ' staff , according to Kevin , was just as hands - off .
He says they would see updated eligibility lists but never actual transcripts .
They seemed to have no idea Kevin had ripped open his report card to find a ghastly 1.8 GPA .
The kid was skating though high school with a D average , and either the coaches did n't want to know or did n't want to ask .
" Well , he tried in my [ weightlifting ] class , I know that , " Hodges says .
" On the rest of it , I ca n't comment on . "
It probably did n't help that the school had two interim principals in Kevin 's time at Fernley and three athletic directors , as well .
Continuity in leadership appears to have been an issue , because everywhere else in the state students were forced to earn a 2.0 GPA to remain eligible for sports .
Fernley 's explanation , according to Eddie Bonine , executive director of the NIAA , was that the school went by a statute in the NIAA handbook that says student - athletes must pass every class or have at least a 2.0 to be eligible .
But there 's another statute , No. 386.806 , which states an athlete must have both passing grades and a 2.0 -- a statute to which the rest of the schools in the state adhered .
Courtesy of George Hart Kevin definitely enjoyed the status of being a star football player on his high school campus .
" Fernley chose the ' or ' statute , and nobody else did , " says Bonine , who was the principal at Fernley seven years ago .
" They read it differently and that has been rectified .
With a 1.8 , Kevin Hart [ should have ] been ineligible to participate . "
If the authority figures were in the dark , Kevin 's classmates had long been dubious about his academic prowess .
One student , who asked to remain anonymous , told his parents , " That Kevin Hart kid , he 's always got an ' F , ' and he 's always on the grade check list every Friday . "
Kevin just seemed ill - prepared and disinterested , a cut - up who often arrived to class casually late .
That 's not uncommon in any high school , where blasé can be cool , but Kevin certainly did n't have the vibe of a serious student headed for college .
What he did have , though , were recruiting letters , more and more every day .
Hodges would sometimes pass them out to him after meetings , and his teammates could n't help but stop and stare .
Kevin was in no way deliberately flashing them , but jocks will be jocks , and he began showing some bravado in offseason workouts , calling himself " D - I " and telling the guys about all his upcoming campus visits .
These were Kevin 's halcyon days , and you had to cut him a break -- he had n't had too many up until then .
Two years before , he was a creampuff who'd never played a down of organized football , unless you counted his YMCA flag football career as a 10 - year - old .
He had been the new kid in school , nearly twice everybody 's size and looking for acceptance .
If he could n't contain his unbridled joy , so be it .
Being recruited , being someone , was intoxicating .
But his peers were n't about to let him revel in it forever .
They 'd hear him boast , " I 'm going D - I , " and , being teenagers , they did n't mind tearing him down , straight to his face .
" They would just tell Kevin , ' Hey , you can't do it , you 'll never do it , you 're too stupid , ' " Betts says .
" Just a lot of rude things .
They would call him an idiot .
He 's not stupid by any means ; he just was n't the smartest one in the classroom .
And a lot of kids would really pin him on that . "
In some ways , this was the genesis of the upcoming scandal : pure pubescent peer pressure .
At home , Kevin kept his beloved letters in a shoe box , but it might as well have been his self - esteem in there .
How dare these kids at his school steal that away ?
" A lot of kids doubted him , " Betts says .
" I 'm not gonna lie .
I 'm his friend and I care for him , but I did doubt him .
I mean , a Fernley kid , the first one ever getting recruited by a D - I school .
I mean , that 's huge for a small town like this .
I would say more kids doubted him [ than believed him ] , and that I guess drove him even more to try to become a D - I athlete . "
Meanwhile , Kevin , for as much as he watched ESPNU , was still naive about the world of college football .
These recruiting mailers he was getting were essentially form letters , impersonal and mailed out in bulk , yet he let his imagination run wild .
Washington seemed to be the most aggressive suitor , sending him its literature about once a week , and he asked his parents whether he could take a day trip to Seattle , by himself , for an unofficial visit in spring of his junior year .
His parents were somewhat strapped financially , but George Hart was n't going to disappoint his eldest grandson .
He says he paid for the flight and the taxi service , under the impression Kevin had a meeting set up with the Huskies offensive line coach .
Kevin says he stayed a day , took in a Mariners baseball game and flew back that night .
He told his grandpa he'd watched a spring practice and kibitzed with the coaches .
But it did n't quite go down that way .
Courtesy of George Hart Marlene and Rick Hart were hopeful that their oldest child could land a college scholarship .
" I went up there , I liked it , " Kevin says , " but I did n't really think they knew who I was very much .
So I sent them a tape and my transcripts , and that 's probably why I never heard back from them again .
I 'm pretty sure it was the transcripts . "
It finally dawned on Kevin that , academically , he was n't D - I - ready .
But that was his secret and his secret alone .
He was n't going to rush back to Fernley and validate all the stooges who had questioned his IQ .
He was now the BMOC , walking the halls of the school with a swagger .
He was all - state !
He could n't come clean now , could he ?
He could n't say , Oh well , it looks like junior college for me .
His parents were already thrilled at the prospect of Kevin getting a free education .
His grandpa was already envisioning game days .
His coaches , Hodges and Kribs , were already using Kevin 's imminent ascension to motivate their underachievers .
He could n't possibly turn back now .
So he began to lie .
The legend grows
The con grew incrementally , like Pinocchio 's nose .
Where it would all end , Kevin could n't predict .
But , in the summer of ' 07 , after his junior season , his imagination was just getting revved up .
He asked to attend the University of Oregon football camp , to see how he stacked up against other D - I recruits , and his grandpa again laid out the cash -- and flew up with him this time .
The coaches , by and large , noticed how gung - ho Kevin was and how he kept teammates in stitches , but there was no clear physical evidence Kevin was a D - I player .
Contrary to what Hodges was saying , Kevin 's balance , footwork and upper - body strength were middle - of - the - road .
He was at best a borderline prospect , a walk - on candidate .
But enthusiasm and love of the game do count for something , and George says he witnessed the Ducks offensive line coach , Steve Greatwood , toss Kevin a bone .
" Coach handed him some questionnaires , " George says , " and told Kevin , ' Fill 'em out , and we 'll see what we can do about getting you up here in a year . '
And that was a quote . "
Of course , what George did n't know was Kevin threw the questionnaires in the trash .
" It would 've been a waste to send it in , " Kevin says , " because I knew I did n't have the grades .
And because I did n't have the grades , I figured there 's no point taking the SATs .
" I kept it to myself .
I was embarrassed because , like , I wanted to live up to everyone 's expectations and could n't deal with people at the time knowing that I failed .
I just wanted to be someone , and when I could n't be that person , it was tough , and I did n't know how to really explain that to people or tell people that . "
On the plus side , Greatwood had fed the lie , fed it big time .
George relayed Greatwood 's comments to Kevin 's dad , Rick , who told Hodges , who told Kribs , who told God knows who else .
Oregon was intrigued !
That was the word all over town -- and , mind you , this was no metropolis .
Kevin simply shut his mouth and enrolled in another camp , at the University of Nevada in Reno , 32 miles down the road .
This time , there seemed to be legitimate interest .
The last thing Nevada could afford to do was overlook an in - state prospect , particularly an all - state lineman from normally inept Fernley .
It just would 've looked bad if they did n't evaluate Kevin , and , honestly , Hodges would n't have let them ignore the kid , anyway .
" I know his coach liked him and thought he was a heck of a player , " says a Nevada staff member who wants to remain anonymous .
" He was really pushing him . "
Courtesy of George Hart Buoyed by a box of recruiting letters , Kevin told everyone that he was " going D - I . "
But Nevada was ultimately underwhelmed by Kevin .
First of all , under head coach Chris Ault and O - line coach Cameron Norcross , the Wolf Pack preferred fleet , athletic linemen ; Kevin was a plodding heavyweight .
They rated him as a potential walk - on they would revisit down the road , during his upcoming senior season .
" He would 've been a marginal player for us , " the Nevada staffer says .
" Having had him in our camp , up close and personal , gave us more insight , as opposed to just seeing him on film , against other small Nevada schools . "
At least Kevin finally knew where he stood -- on thin ice .
Nevada had n't asked for his transcripts and Oregon had left it up to him to send them in .
These schools obviously were n't going to be banging down his door .
But why did anyone else have to know that ?
" I already had a bucket full of letters , " Kevin says , " and that 's pretty much what put people 's minds at ease that it was n't a fabrication .
And [ the lie ] just kept going and going .
There 's not really one point that you could sit there and say , ' That 's the whole story . '
Just ' cause it kept going and going . "
He hammed it up the minute he returned to school for his senior season .
He told his pals how he hung out with current Nevada players in the dorms , how they promised to leave game tickets for him .
It was bogus , but it sounded grand , so grand that the Fernley school newspaper , the Vaquero Voice , did a Q&A with him in its September 2007 edition .
And Kevin was on fire :
Q : How many schools have recruited you ?
Names and details .
A : Well , right now , there are a number of colleges recruiting me to play football : Nevada , Boise State , Washington , Oregon , California and Oregon State .
But the schools that I am in contact with are Nevada , Oregon and Washington .
Oregon and Washington have offered me full - ride scholarships .
Right then , he was officially in too deep .
The lie was public now , in print , and the gaudy photograph accompanying the article showed Kevin in a Heisman pose .
But had Oregon and Washington ever contacted his parents for an in - home visit ?
No .
Had they asked Hodges to send film ?
No .
Had they called a school administrator asking for a transcript ?
No. Had Kevin registered with the NCAA Initial - Eligibility Clearinghouse ?
No .
All this should 've raised the reddest of flags , but Hodges and Kribs and George and Rick and Marlene read the story and did n't bat an eye .
Says Rick : " We thought the coaches were handling it , and the coaches thought we were talking to the recruiters . "
Says Hodges : " Yeah , colleges will contact a high school coach .
But it depends on the situation .
They can contact him a lot ; they can contact him a little bit .
They can contact parents ; they can contact the school .
It depends .
Each individual situation is different . "
Says Kevin : " That 's the thing that bothers me -- when they blame my coaches , my parents about , ' Aw , why did n't they stop this ?
This could have been stopped . '
Sure , it could 've been stopped -- by me .
I could 've put an end to the whole thing in September by saying , ' I do n't have the grades , so I 'm going to go to a JC . '
But I did n't do that .
" You have to understand , they put a lot of trust in me .
I just told [ Hodges ]
I was taking care of it myself , as far as sending tapes out , talking to coaches , my grades .
I was n't popping up on ineligible lists , so he thought my grades were fine .

Hart says he thought the Fernley coaches were handling the details of his son's recruitment .
" I thought it would be too hard on them to find out it was n't going to happen , so I kept it to myself .
When people look up to you in the school and you 're kind of big man on campus , it 's hard just to tell them that , no , I can't do this , and you go back to being a person in school .
Because for me , I was big man on campus for a while . "
But not everyone was fooled .
Not completely anyway .
Several of Kevin 's teachers , some of whom had issued him failing grades , gasped at the article in the school paper and then e-mailed Bonine , the former Fernley pricipal who runs the NIAA .
" I have friends that still work out there at Fernley , " Bonine says , " and they 'd go , ' Eddie , this kid 's got 4 F 's right now .
How the hell is he maybe going to Cal ? '
The staff was talking amongst themselves because they knew that Kevin , first of all , was not a 2.0 or 3.0 student or even better , and anyone on the West Coast knows that to get into Cal , you have to have a pretty good GPA .
It was a red flag for me , and I brought that to the attention of the superintendent , who in turn passed it to the interim principal and interim AD at the time , and the bottom line is that the student - athlete was calling the shots .
It was a mess .
...
" If I 'd been principal -- and I 'm not bragging -- as soon as they told me Kevin Hart was being recruited , I 'd have said , ' Let 's go to your counselor and get you enrolled in the NCAA clearinghouse .
Because I 'll tell you right now , Cal wo n't be able to get you .
You wo n't qualify to go to Cal .
They will give you a list of schools you qualify to go to , and Cal 's not going to be one of them , pal .
You 're struggling with senior English .
Cal is n't going to happen . '
But his coach everyone bought into it . "
Kevin 's senior season only furthered the charade .
He was named the state 's top lineman , and Hodges finally had moribund Fernley in the state semifinals .
The team blew a late 34 - 20 lead and lost 35 - 34 , but , from the outside looking in , it appeared the players had ridden Kevin 's backside to one of the most special Fernley seasons ever .
George claims Nevada coaches twice visited the school to take a final look at Kevin -- the first time , Ault and Norcross showed up together and the second time Norcross came alone .
The two coaches , who declined to comment , never seemed sold on Kevin .
But just their presence in Fernley gave the lie helium .
By January 2008 , with national signing day only a month away , Kevin had to decide whether to finally to tell the truth .
He says he'd lay in bed " just about every night , " playing out scenarios , and he came to an absolutely ludicrous decision : hold a news conference .
He 'd seen it himself a hundred times , on ESPNU , Fox and CSTV : a local football stud calling his whole school together pulling out two hats finally picking a school .
In Kevin 's head , that 's what the first D - I player in Fernley history needed to do .
Had to do !
Every Monday after the football season , classmates would ask him , " Which coaches you talk to this weekend ?
Get any more offers ? "
In other words , he could n't just slink away , hoping the student body would forget .
He had to pick a school , and to complete his masquerade , he needed to do it publicly , at a packed news conference .
He asked Hodges whether it was OK to stage one , and the coach thought it was a brilliant idea .
But , to be fair , the coach was pretty distracted by this point .
Because of the ineligible players he'd brought with him from Oregon , Hodges had been under fire from the moment he took the job three years earlier , and later there 'd been accusations that he spent an unauthorized $ 26,000 from the athletic budget on new uniforms .
He began looking for a way out , and in the 2007 season , he heard that one of his former principals in Medford , Ore. , was now at Hermiston ( Ore . )
High School and was searching for a new head coach .
There was contact between them , and by season 's end , Hodges was hoping , almost expecting , to land there .
So , what better way to go out -- sending a kid to big - time college football for the first time in Fernley history ?
Hodges was n't questioning anything ; he just set the wheels in motion for a Feb. 1 announcement .
He called TV stations in Reno and arranged for the entire student body to be there .
He'd get the pep band , he'd get streamers .
It 'd be an all - out event .
Kribs could n't contain his excitement , either .
He and Kevin had grown closer during the season , with Kribs often using Kevin as a teaching tool .
The coach , who'd last played college football in 1999 , would put on a helmet during practice and go one - on - one with Kevin to prove points to his other linemen .
The coach would whip Kevin , but they would laugh about it afterward -- the two 77s .
They also would talk about Kevin 's college choices , and Kevin -- with an absolute straight face -- told him the decision was down to Cal and Oregon because both schools ran offensive systems similar to Fernley's .
Kevin had an answer for everything .
He eventually told Kribs he was going to pick Cal because , among other things , he had grown up in Northern California and wanted to play back home .
Kribs was so proud that -- three days before the news conference -- he e-mailed the Cal offensive line coach , Jim Michalczik , and thanked him for offering Kevin the scholarship .
But then Kribs received a response that blew his mind :
Chris , I think there is some misunderstanding here .
We have not offered Kevin a full - ride .
Are you sure he 's not going to Oregon ?
Let me know .
You have me wondering .
A confused Kribs called Kevin for an explanation .
The kid was busted !
It was over !
Or it should 've been .
But Kevin tap - danced and told Kribs that Cal had to tell him that .
He told Kribs that schools are n't allowed to comment on recruits , which is why Michalczik had denied it .
Kribs believed Kevin .
Why would n't he ?
The kid was his protégé , had eaten cereal at his kitchen table .
So all systems were still go .
The night before the news conference , Jan. 31 , Kevin posted a bulletin on his MySpace page , saying , " Tomorrow is the big day . "
Zack Betts , his teammate since freshman year , was online to see it and asked Kevin to give him the scoop : Cal or Oregon ?
Kevin was reluctant to say , but eventually told Zack , " I 'm going to Cal . "
Betts promised not to tell a soul .
" It all made sense , " Betts says , " and I did n't 100 percent believe him until that point . "
There was just one other tiny detail left :
What would Cal say ?
What the hell would Cal say ?
But , as he stepped to the podium Feb. 1 , 2008 , in front of roughly 900 people , Kevin Hart was n't of sound mind .
He admits it .
He 'll tell you he was " out of control . "
He 'll tell you " Mentally , I was n't there . "
He 'll tell you he was delusional , that everyone had believed him up to that point and he figured it would stay that way .
He 'll tell you , " I did n't see any consequences to any of it because I was not in the state of mind to realize what was wrong or right , really . "
He 'll tell you he thought Cal might let him slide .
Busted and bereft
He could have been Terrelle Pryor , choosing between Ohio State and Michigan , because Kevin had the room eating out of his hand .
Hodges , wearing a suit and tie , grabbed a microphone , walked to the middle of the gym and announced : " He kept believing and he worked very hard to get to this point , and now Kevin is ready to make an announcement of where he 's going to go to college . "
There was bedlam , and Kevin , in strong , commanding tones , said , " I just want to say thank you to my family over there and everyone at the school 's been so supportive of what I 've been doing , and I appreciate all you guys , and I 'll never forget where I came from . "

Hart referred to the recruiting day hoax as a " skit . "
On a desk in front of him was a Cal cap and an Oregon cap , and , never straying out of character , Kevin said , " After sitting down with my family , I came down to two choices .
It was Oregon and Cal .
And I decided that , uh , I 'm gonna be playing football at the University of California . "
He swiftly put on Cal cap , pulling it snug .
Then he stood and waved to each side of the gym , particularly to Betts and some of his other buddies who were wearing colored wigs .
A music teacher cued the band .
Grandpa George slipped on a Cal hat himself .
Then Kevin was ushered out to meet with the local media , where he continued to bluff his way into people 's hearts :
Q : What was the deciding factor ?
Kevin : Coach [ Jeff ]
Tedford and I talked a lot , and the fact that the head coach did most of the recruiting of me kind of gave me a real personal experience with that coach .
And we had like a really good relationship .
( Truth : Tedford had never laid eyes on Kevin in his life . )
Q : When did you make your visit there ?
Kevin : I did n't .
Well , I 've been up there a few times , but , you know , it really was n't even the visit ;
It was the tradition there .
( Truth : He nearly blew it and said he did n't visit .
But he made the save . )
Q : How nice is it to finally have this over with ?
You can finally be a senior in high school .
Kevin : I did n't really have a bad recruiting experience , but like every other guy , I 'm glad it 's over .
I 'm glad it 'll just go back to normal .
( Truth : Nothing would ever be normal again . )
Later that night came the inevitable phone call .
Cal , having caught word of the masquerade , contacted Kribs to tell him there 'd never been a scholarship , a recruitment or a chance .
Kribs called Hodges , who called Rick , who called Kevin in from his bedroom .
They all drove to Hodges ' home , where Kevin played possum still .
He told the group he'd been duped by a middleman , a promoter he'd hired to contact schools and deal with coaches .
He claimed this impostor had set him up and taken his money .
They asked him who this person was , and Kevin had to think up a name out of thin air .
He said , " Kevin Riley " -- which just so happened to be the name of the Cal quarterback .
" That was probably the worst of it , I think , " Kevin says .
" I made up a story to make it sound better , I guess .
I just told another lie . "
The next day , the police were called in to investigate this Riley person , but of course Kevin could n't produce a phone number or address for him .
His imagination was running on empty , and he finally confessed .
" I could n't take it anymore , " he says .
Days later , he released a public apology , admitting to a 10 - month hoax , and was told to stay home from school for a week .
Fingers were being pointed every which way .
Nationally and locally , people blamed his parents for being naive about college recruiting , for being utterly out of touch , for being too detached .
" I wish Kevin would 've came to us , talked to us , " Rick says , " and told us that he did n't have his grades or GPA up high enough .
We could 've worked with him somehow to get that .
We could 've hired a tutor .
It was degrading to both my wife and myself .
We 're not disappointed in him , we 're just disappointed in the actions that led up to all that .
We wish he'd handled it a different way and not lied .
Tim Dunn / Reno Gazette - Journal Kevin still has trouble with the fact that he deceived his coaches , especially Kribs , right .
" I 've heard a lot of comments about , ' Aw , this guy , the parent , he should have known what the process was for recruiting . '
Well , I did n't . "
But the person getting blistered most was Hodges .
" Listen , " says a college coach , after requesting anonymity , " I can't believe he did n't know the process .
A college coach who 's recruiting a kid is going to be in the school or the home at some point .
Jeff Tedford and Mike Bellotti ?
They 're in the school and in the home .
I can see the parents being naive , but I do n't know how you can be a high school coach and have a Pac - 10 recruit and expect they 're not going to call you .
They 're spending over 100 grand over a five - year period on a kid .
There 's no way they 're not calling the high school coach .
They 've got to be thorough .
Their job is on the line . "
The Lyon County School District , where Fernley is located , seemed to agree with that premise , and on Feb .
8 , Hodges was informed his contract would not be renewed following the school year .
According to reports , the district was citing him for " unprofessional conduct and fiscal irresponsibility , " and Hodges responded by filing a defamation of character lawsuit claiming he'd been made a scapegoat for the Hart affair , a lawsuit that he would later lose .
They were firing him just as he was about to quit , but either way , he was out at the end of the school year , thrilled to be taking the Hermiston job .
" There 's no one who was more of a sucker than me , " Hodges says of Kevin 's lies .
" But it was a perfect storm .
There were letters and phone calls from coaches .
He 's all - state , the best lineman in the state , things I can't even tell you .
Plus , I 'm teaching and getting ready for the next season .
I missed it , because , like I said , it was a perfect storm . "
Fernley High School administrators will not comment on Hodges or the eligibility issue and instead referred all phone calls to Lyon County associate superintendent Terri White .
White also has refused comment .
Still , changes were looming , and Fernley 's interim principal and interim athletic director from the 2007 - 08 school year were soon replaced .
But lost amid the lawsuits and the blame games was an 18 - year - old kid weeping at home .
Kevin , the minute his lie blew up , lowered the shades of his house and assumed the fetal position .
" I thought I 'd be in the gutter somewhere , " he says .
Betts and several of his friends called to ask whether he wanted to meet for breakfast one morning , and Betts considered Kevin over - the - top depressed .
" I mean , it was an almost suicidal kind of down , " Betts says .
" I was scared he might do something to hurt himself . "
By Friday , Feb. 8 , one week after the news conference , Kevin was in therapy .
It was George 's idea , because , George says , " I love my grandson , and I did n't have the vocabulary or background to lead Kevin out of this . "
Devastated , George was already referring to the news conference as a " skit " and " baloney , " and , after Kevin 's first appointment , he half expected the therapist to say his grandson was beyond repair .
But the doctor , according to George , said , " He 's opening up to me .
I can see a light at the end of the tunnel already .
I can help him . "
George booked five more appointments .
By that Sunday night , the night before Kevin 's first day back at school , Kevin and some players huddled at Hodges ' house .
Hodges told him he could still play college football , and he whipped out several junior college brochures .
But Kevin was n't thinking about football ; he was thinking about getting pelted with apples the next day in school .
It was a long first walk through the hallways that day .
The big man on campus was now the big embarrassment on campus , and , that first week back , witnesses say Kevin heard caustic comments such as , " Where you going to school now ? " and " Hey , I choose Cal . "
During a Fernley basketball game in Sparks , Nev. , the opposing fans even wore T - shirts that said , " I'm Going to Cal . "
It was demeaning and predictable , but , by and large , most of the Fernley students were patting Kevin on the back and encouraging him to graduate .
He apologized to anyone who stopped to talk , apologized to Hodges , his teammates , to Kribs .
But only Kribs ' response really mattered to him .
He had considered Kribs " my other father , " and it was clear , right away , that their relationship was severed , understandably so .
Kevin had lied straight to Kribs ' face about the e-mail from the Cal offensive line coach , and he sensed an obvious iciness now from Kribs .
It made Kevin sob , and , worse , it made him reprioritize the sport of football .
" I knew I was n't going to play , and I honestly did n't want to play , I was so down on myself , " Kevin says .
" I mean , it 's a game of egos , and when you have one sky - high and then you have one at absolutely zero , it 's tough to play .
" When your whole life gets flipped upside down because of something you do , you do n't know where to go .
So college football was not on the list of places I 'd go from here .
I figured , ' Why would anyone take a chance on me ? ' "
So Kevin stopped working out , stopped counting calories , stopped checking the Pac - 10 Web site , stopped dreaming .

Tom Simi , right , coach at Feather River College in Quincy , Calif. , felt Kevin deserved a second chance .
" This kid could use a friend "
The truth shall set you free or at least get you on TV .
About two hours northwest of Fernley , across the border in Quincy , Calif. , an athletic director from a tree - lined junior college watched a recap of the scandal on the local news -- and got an idea .
" This kid could use a friend , " Merle Trueblood thought to himself .
So that 's how , after Kevin Hart tried to get out , he got dragged back in .
That 's how Hart improbably began getting recruited again .
The school was Feather River College , and Trueblood was soon in touch with his football coach , a bright , congenial up - and - comer named Tom Simi .
Long before Kevin 's news conference , Simi had heard about a supposedly sturdy offensive lineman from Fernley , although he did n't know his name or his measurements .
He had called the school at one point for information , but not even Hodges responded , and Simi assumed the kid was n't interested .
But when he was alerted of Kevin 's hoax , by a local newspaper , Simi put two and two together -- Oh , that 's the Fernley kid .
Interesting .
Simi and Trueblood decided to reach out to Fernley High again , curious whether Kevin was an evil kid who had staged a premeditated scam or simply a lost soul .
A non -football coach told them it was the latter , that he was a good person who got caught up in a fantasy and " did n't know how to pull the plug . "
Simi began calling Kevin 's home , in March of ' 08 , but the family was screening calls and would n't pick up .
Simi left upbeat voice messages , but it did n't matter because Kevin was through with football .
" To me , it was over , " Kevin says .
" I was like , ' Maybe I should focus on other things instead of football . '
Because that 's kind of where I lost myself -- football got me into this mess .
I had n't been doing things the right way and maybe I was kind of afraid of playing again , and that 's the reason I did n't answer the coach 's calls .
Because I was afraid of being around new people who had heard about me . "
But Hodges , who was n't leaving for Hermiston until after the school year , kept handing Kevin junior - college brochures , kept bellowing , " You can still do this ; you can still prove what we all thought of you . "
Betts ' pep talk was : " Life should n't be over at 18 .
You have your whole life ahead of you . "
He was getting double - teamed by his coach and teammates , but nothing kicked in until Kevin began receiving stacks of out - of - town mail .
They were post - marked from everywhere -- as far away as the East Coast -- and Kevin was half - afraid to open them .
" I thought it was hate mail , " he says .
But he took a peek , and most of them were better than recruiting letters .
These people were writing , " Keep your head up , " or " You can still achieve your dream , " or " Good luck to your family , " or " Everybody makes mistakes . "
The notes had him in tears .
He even received a benevolent letter from a local Reno judge , and he pinned all the notes on his bedroom wall and began reconsidering something near and dear -- college football .
He went online and filled out the Feather River football questionnaire , and , in May , when Simi happened to be casually checking his e-mail , there was Kevin Hart 's name , address , height , weight and grade point average .
Simi called right away , because you can never have too many linemen , and he spoke first to Kevin 's mom , giving her insight into Feather River .
It was a community college , meaning , in the purest sense , the community was welcome there .
The student body included 40 - year - old single parents , people with disabilities , war vets ; a scorned football player was certainly no stretch .
" It 's a pretty forgiving place , " Simi says .
Eventually , Simi contacted Kevin and filled him in on his background .
He was a former offensive lineman himself , from Eastern Oregon , who preferred smashmouth football .
" When I was playing , I 'd be ticked when we'd throw , " Simi says .
" I love sticking it up people 's tailpipe .
Maybe that 's why I 'm such a run-oriented coach . "
Kevin got a kick out of that .
He also liked that Simi had sent six offensive linemen in the previous two seasons to D - I or D - IAA programs .
It meant Kevin could actually allow himself to dream about D - I again .
And never discount someone 's dream .
Kevin Clifford for ESPN.com
At Feather River , Kevin can bask in the promise of a fresh start .
Back on the roller coaster
So he committed to Feather River over the telephone .
When he reported to training camp , he asked for No. 77 -- you - know - who 's number .
But , other than that , Chris Kribs never would 've recognized Kevin .
Because the kid was 30 pounds overweight .
All that inactivity after quitting football had hurt Kevin 's physique , and he came into Feather River a chubby 325 pounds .
Inevitably , he tweaked his knee , which only set him back further .
But Kevin 's larger concern was his teammates , and whether they were gossiping behind his back .
He had worried he would be ostracized , especially because 40 percent of Feather River 's players came from Nevada .
But other than a few " Go Cal ! " jabs , no one said much of anything .
" We 've got so many damn knuckleheads -- and I mean that in a good way -- that he just fits right in , " Simi says .
Simi deserves much of the credit , because on Day 1 , he called the team together and asked everyone to name his hometown area code .
There were a bunch of 702s ( Las Vegas ) and 843s ( South Carolina ) , but then the coach asked , " What 's the area code here ? "
" 530 , " the group said .
" So , guess what , we 're all 530 now , " Simi said .
It was his way of saying they were a team , that everyone was on equal footing -- and Kevin quickly assimilated .
Whenever the South Carolina kids would start bragging about the SEC , Kevin would chime in and say not to sleep on the Pac - 10 , Cal 's and Oregon 's conference .
It made for a great debate , and several kids suggested Kevin host his own college football show , call it " Hart to Hart . "
They considered him one of the guys , but more than that , the lie seemed to be in the rearview mirror .
Simi kept an eye on the kid , and when Kevin ended up on the second team and did n't play in the season opener , Simi was worried how he 'd react .
But Kevin kept telling the coach not to sweat it , that he was just grateful to have his 77 .
" Every day I walk onto the football field , I say , ' Second chance , ' and ' Time to have a good practice -- because you probably should n't be here , ' " Kevin says .
" Practices are still hard , but I still love every one of them because I know how fortunate I am to be here .
I was just looking for a chance to play somewhere , and they gave me a chance .
Kevin Clifford for ESPN.com
" I 'm not OK .
I think it 'll be tough forever .
I mean , it 's just always there , " Kevin tells ESPN in his first in - depth interview since the incident in February 2008 .
" Every day is a struggle for me .
I 'm not OK .
I think it 'll be tough forever .
I mean , it 's just always there .
It might not be 10 years until I 'm finally , like , OK .
Maybe I can put this at ease , and maybe it 'll never be .
But maybe that 's a good thing .
Maybe knowing that what I did was totally wrong and a horrible thing is a good thing to be reminded of every day .
I think it 's helped me become a better person now . "
He remembered what Hodges told him -- " You can still prove what we all thought of you " -- so Kevin wrote Prove Them Right on his cleats .
He brought some of his fan letters to school and posted them on his dorm - room wall .
He seemed focused and began impressing Simi more and more .
" Blackballing the kid -- what was that going to accomplish ? "
Simi kept saying .
" I 'm glad he 's here . "
From a football standpoint , Kevin still had a way to go .
His first step was slow ; his body needed tightening ; and he was more advanced in pass - blocking than run-blocking .
He also held his hands a little too wide in pass protection , and , one day , Simi told him he does n't teach his players to block that way .
" But Bill Callahan , the old coach at Nebraska , does , " Kevin said .
Simi's jaw dropped .
What junior college kids knew that ?
Kevin also pontificated on the techniques of Alex Gibbs , the former Broncos O - line coach .
This was no dumb kid , the coach thought .
" I can have a pretty high - level conversation about football with the kid , " Simi says .
" He 's coachable .
He 's yes sir , no sir .
He has to do a better job of gaining leverage on defenders , being more physical at the point of attack in the running game .
But he loves the game , and he 's got a mean streak .
He cares about becoming a good player . "
Kevin made his season debut in Week 2 , off the bench .
And in Week 5 , he came off the bench again , springing a halfback for a long touchdown run but then pulling a hamstring chasing the play .
" Kevin , you 're not fast enough to pull a hamstring , " Simi said on the sideline , making the kid crack up .
Everything seemed perfect .
Trueblood saw Kevin smiling on campus one afternoon -- " One of the best days of my life , " Trueblood says .
" That 's what we 're here for , to help kids " -- and Kevin was feeling brave enough to reach out to his old Fernley coaches . "
He reconnected with Hodges , who was in the process of taking Hermiston to the Oregon state quarterfinals , and Kevin also was hoping Kribs was ready to forgive him .
The answer : maybe .
Kribs , who was still coaching at Fernley , was told by the school to not comment .
But he did say , pleasantly , " I wish Kevin all the luck in the world . "
So the kid was on his way until Simi got a surprise call from a guidance counselor .
It turns out Kevin had been skipping two of his classes .
He 'd never been interested in school -- not as a 7 - year - old and not now -- and still had n't learned how to make class a priority .
It was an old habit by now , years in the making .
Plenty of freshmen struggle with school , especially JC kids .
They 're away from home for the first time and can't handle the freedom .
But Kevin could n't afford to be careless , not after the lie .
The teachers at Feather River would 've helped him .
They almost never fail a kid who shows up every day , a kid who tries .
But they 'll drop the repeated no - shows if they do n't pay heed to the warnings .
So by the time Kevin 's hamstring healed -- in Week 8 , with two games left in the season -- he suddenly did n't have enough credits to be eligible .
He could n't play .
At Fernley , maybe they would 've looked the other way , but at Feather River they were doing him a favor , by actually looking at his report card .
" I told him , ' There 's no shame in not starting , but there is shame in not making it in school , ' " Simi says .
Kevin told Simi he understood , and ever since , he has been a model student .
If he stays eligible for next season , it 's all in front of him .
The starting right guard position , Kribs ' old spot , is up for grabs , and Kevin -- finally off the powdered doughnuts , finally in shape -- will get a shot at it .
If he starts , D - I scouts will undoubtedly see him play , and even if he 's a backup , there are NAIA and D - III schools that love junior college transfers , that are dying to have a 300 - pound lineman with a high football IQ .
He just has to work on his sociology and English IQ .
Because if he does n't , the wish is over .
And the only person Kevin Hart would have been lying to all this time was himself .

How did Juliet know " it worked " ?
When Juliet was near death , she was able to see a vision of the afterlife , wherein Oceanic 815 never crashed .
She may have incorrectly assumed that they had been successful in preventing the Incident , resulting in Oceanic 815 's safe landing in Los Angeles .
However , she also said to Sawyer as she was dying , " We should get coffee sometime .
We can go Dutch . "
Later , when she met him at the vending machine in the flash sideways , she said the exact same thing about going Dutch for coffee , followed by " It worked , " referring to the trick she suggested for getting Sawyer 's stuck candy bar out of the machine .
So it is possible that those last thoughts , " It worked , " that Miles detected from her grave , were actually her seeing her afterlife , and repeating what she said to Sawyer at the machine .

Since exposure to large amounts of electromagnetism can cause characters to see visions of their past and future , Widmore 's experiment forced Desmond to see so far into his own future that he was looking at his own afterlife .
( " Happily Ever After " ) ( " The End " )
How are the flashsideways characters able to see the events from the original timeline ?
Since the timelines were not actually separate , and the flashsideways timeline was the characters ' afterlife , these visions occurred when characters were able to make some sort of connection with their previous lives , granting them awareness of the events they had previously lived out .

... or something like that .
Truth is , I suck at foreign languages .
Always have .
Always will .
That can be a real drawback for a fantasist working in the tradition of J.R.R .
Tolkien , who set the bar very high where imaginary languages are concerned .
JRRT was a linguist of rare talent who invented not one but two Elvish tongues , not to mention dwarvish , Numenorean , the Black Tongue of Mordor , etc. etc .
An astonishing feat of linguistic worldbuilding , and one that is never likely to be duplicated .
Certainly not by me .
A few years ago , I got a very nice email from a reader who wanted to know more about the vocabulary and syntax of High Valyrian .
I blush to admit that I had to reply , " Uh ... well ... all I know about High Valyrian is the seven words I 've made up to date .
When I need an eighth , I 'll make that up too ... but I do n't have a whole imaginary language in my desk here , the way Tolkien did .
"
The same was true of Dothraki .
Lots of characters speak the language of the horselords in my novels , and I did pepper the text with a few Dothraki words like khal and arakh ... but for the most part I was content just to say , " They were speaking Dothraki , " and give the sense of what was said , playing with the syntax and sentence rhythms a bit to convey a flavor .
That would obviously not work for television , however , where you actally have to HEAR what the characters are saying , even if you do n't necessarily understand the words .
So when the pilot was filmed , HBO brought in a world - class expert to create a Dothraki tongue that went well beyond my " khaleesi " and " khalasar .
" His name is David J. Peterson , and here 's some more about him and the language he 's devising , straight from the good folks at Home Box Office: =====================================================================David J. Peterson , an expert language creator from the Language Creation Society ( LCS ) , has been chosen to create the Dothraki language for HBO ’s upcoming fantasy series GAME OF THRONES , based on the book series “ A Song of Ice and Fire , ” by George R.R. Martin .
When GAME OF THRONES executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss needed a language for the Dothraki , Martin ’s race of nomadic warriors , they turned to the Language Creation Society .
The LCS solicited and vetted a number of proposals for the Dothraki language from its pool of experts , with Peterson ’s proposal ultimately being selected by the GAME OF THRONES production team .
Peterson drew inspiration from George R.R. Martin ’s description of the language , as well as from such languages as Russian , Turkish , Estonian , Inuktitut and Swahili .
However , the Dothraki language is no mere hodgepodge , babble or pidgin .
It has its own unique sound , extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and complex grammatical structure .
“ In designing Dothraki , I wanted to remain as faithful as possible to the extant material in George R.R. Martin ’s series , ” says Peterson .
“ Though there is n’t a lot of data , there is evidence of a dominant word order [ subject - verb - object ] , of adjectives appearing after nouns , and of the lack of a copula [ ‘ to be ’ ] .
I ’ve remained faithful to these elements , creating a sound aesthetic that will be familiar to readers , while giving the language depth and authenticity .
My fondest desire is for fans of the series to look at a word from the Dothraki language and be unable to tell if it came from the books or from me — and for viewers not even to realize it ’s a constructed language .
”
“ We ’re tremendously excited to be working with David and the LCS , ” says producer D.B. Weiss .
“ The language he ’s devised is phenomenal .
It captures the essence of the Dothraki , and brings another level of richness to their world .
We look forward to his first collection of Dothraki love sonnets .
” Did you know ?
( Hash yer ray nesi ? )
The name for the Dothraki people — and their language — derives from the verb “ dothralat ” ( “ to ride ” ) .
The Dothraki have four different words for “ carry , ” three for “ push , ” three for “ pull ” and at least eight for “ horse , ” but no word that means “ please ” or “ follow .
” The longest word in Dothraki is “ athastokhdeveshizaroon , ” which means “ from nonsense .
” The words for “ related , ” “ weighted net , ” “ eclipse , ” “ dispute , ” “ redhead , ” “ oath , ” “ funeral pyre , ” “ evidence , ” “ omen , ” “ fang ” and “ harvest moon ” all have one element in common : “ qoy , ” the Dothraki word for “ blood .
” Dothraki for “ to dream ” – “ thirat atthiraride ” – literally means “ to live a wooden life ” ; in Dothraki , “ wooden ” ( “ ido ” ) is synonymous with “ fake .
” The word for “ pride ” – “ athjahakar ” – is derived from “ jahak , ” the traditional long braid worn by Dothraki warriors ( “ lajaki ” ) .
More information about the Dothraki language ( and their love poems ) will be released over the course of the series .=======================================================================I look forward to the day when someone translates Shakespeare into Dothraki .
They 've already done a Klingon translation , and probably an Elvish one as well , so what the hell .
Meanwhile , I need to find out the proper Dothraki for " it is known . "
The precise origin of The Game is not known at this point .
However , the branch of The Game in my area seems to have come from Camp OSRUI in Oconomowoc , Wisconsin a few years back .
Another reliable source believes a professor at the University of Chicago invented The Game at some time .
In terms of how old The Game is , no one knows for sure .
However I have recently been provided with an informative story : Recently a girl out to dinner lost The Game and declared it aloud ( as one should ) .
Then , a man tapped on her shoulder and told her that he had not lost The Game in twelve years until that moment .
If any one has any more info , please use the contact form to let me know !
Michele Bachmann 's paranoia knows no bounds .
Now she 's claiming that Bill Clinton wants to " take her out " ( and not in the dating kinda way , either ) .
Why ?
Because Clinton criticized her choice of language in calling the government " gangsters , " as part of his weeklong observations that the rhetoric from people like Bachmann is what produced unhinged and violent acts like Oklahoma City .
Talk like this upsets the right - wing talkers very much , and of course it then all becomes about how the mean left - wingers are saying nasty things about poor meek conservatives , who have never said a mean things about anyone in their lives .
That was Bachmann 's schtick last night on Sean Hannity 's Fox show .
And as proof that liberals are evilly trying to silence right - wingers , Bachmann trotted out ... net neutrality .
Bachmann :
Oh sure , that 's all they have left now , is they use pejorative terms , hateful terms , against those who are carrying the message .
So whether they 're attacking conservative talk radio , or conservative TV , or whether it 's Internet sites -- I mean , let 's face it , what 's the Obama administration doing ?
They 're advocating net neutrality , which is essentially censorship of the Internet !
This is the Obama administration advocating censorship of the Internet .
Why ?
They want to silence the voices that are opposing them .
Net neutrality ?
Censorship ?
Really ?
Well , not really .
How about more like the precise opposite ?
Somebody 's been watching too much Glenn Beck .
Bachmann is a prime example of what happens when you let Beck do your thinking for you .
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . —
Many of the jobs lost during the recession are not coming back .
Period .
For the last two years , the weak economy has provided an opportunity for employers to do what they would have done anyway : dismiss millions of people — like file clerks , ticket agents and autoworkers — who were displaced by technological advances and international trade .
The phasing out of these positions might have been accomplished through less painful means like attrition , buyouts or more incremental layoffs .
But because of the recession , winter came early .
The tough environment has been especially disorienting for older and more experienced workers like Cynthia Norton , 52 , an unemployed administrative assistant in Jacksonville .
“ I know I ’m good at this , ” says Ms. Norton .
“ So how the hell did I end up here ? ”
Administrative work has always been Ms. Norton ’s “ calling , ” she says , ever since she started work as an assistant for her aunt at 16 , back when the uniform was a light blue polyester suit and a neckerchief .
In the ensuing decades she has filed , typed and answered phones for just about every breed of business , from a law firm to a strip club .
As a secretary at the RAND Corporation , she once even had the honor of escorting Henry Kissinger around the building .

So far this year , at least two teenage girls have committed suicide after repeatedly being attacked and insulted by a group of classmates .
Being the target of a clique , or having a string of enemies , is especially treacherous , researchers say .
And while suicide remains rare , antagonism is pervasive : studies have found that 15 to 40 percent of elementary schoolchildren have been involved in at least one such relationship — and that the rate in middle school and high school , where exclusion and gossip run highest , ranges from 48 to 70 percent .
Yet psychologists have found shortcomings in this early work .
For one thing , most children ( and adults ) who have had rivals , antagonists or enemies are doing fine , thanks .
For another , the results have been warped by a phenomenon called peer rejection : a small group of children are so different from their peers that they suffer far more than their share of bullying .
In a review of these types of studies in the current issue of the journal Developmental Psychology , Noel A. Card , a psychologist at the University of Arizona , corrected the combined results for peer rejection .
“ Once you factor out peer rejection , ” ” he said in an interview , , “ the effects of antipathetic relationships on adjustment are pretty slight . ”
This will come as small comfort to children and adolescents in the trenches , who may be swimming in foul text messages , threats or humiliating gossip .
The sting is especially deep when good friends turn against one another .
In an earlier study , titled “ We Were Friends , but ... , ” Dr. Card found that soured friendships were a common , and particularly intense , form of mutual antagonism .
One participant described what happened after a friend left her at a party , going home with someone else without saying anything : “ The next day I confronted her , and we got into a fight and suspended from school .
That ’s when she started spreading rumors . ”
Ms. Shapiro ’s fight with her former friend was partly for show .
The stronger girl pretended to hit her — and told her to run away holding her face , for the benefit of the other tough kids watching .
It was terrifying nonetheless .
“ I ran all the way home , ” she said .
“ All through high school I was scared of her , and we did n’t talk .
I just avoided her . ”
Most hostile ex-friends do the same , Dr. Card found , and the hostility does not escalate .
Moreover , the weak link between negative relationships and development represents an average : for every person with a profoundly bitter rival or enemy , there are others with milder antagonisms , which may provide opportunities for social and emotional development .
Australia comes in at number 10 on a list of countries that have asked the search engine Google to hand over user data or to censor information .
Google has for the first time released information about the number of such requests that it gets from countries around the world .
Top of the list is Brazil , followed by Germany , the United States and India .
Google says the release of the information is the first step towards increased transparency and will give people an insight into government actions and web freedom .
Australia made 17 data removal requests and 155 requests for user information .
Electronic Frontiers Australia 's Geordie Guy , who lobbies for internet freedom , says the figure is smaller than expected .
" It does seem quite small .
If I had have taken a guess not long ago I probably would have guessed a higher number , particularly in terms of requests to remove content , " he said .
" As it stands at the moment though , companies like Google and obviously their service YouTube are fairly good at regulating .
" They do n't regulate to quite the extent the Australian Government would like ; they tend to only ever regulate material that 's illegal or patently offensive , whereas our classification guidelines tend to try and cast a wider net . "
Brazil and the United States made the most requests for user data , with Germany and Brazil topping the list for removing online material .
Last year between June and December , Google collected data which showed how often countries asked it to give up personal information and to remove content from its servers .
One possible reason for Brazil being first is the widespread use of Google 's social networking site , which throws up many of the same issues that are confronted by Facebook .
Australia 's Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis has welcomed the list .
" It actually adds to the transparency of how and when people 's personal information may be disclosed , " she said .
" And while it 's perfectly legal for those requests to be made of Google , it is useful for us to know that those requests are actually being made by law enforcement agencies and also for removal of child pornography as well . "
A Google spokesperson was unavailable to discuss the figures , but in a statement the company said it hoped the list will be helpful in discussions about the appropriate scope and authority of government requests and that other companies will make similar disclosures .
The published information is light on detail and Google will not confirm whether these requests were made by government or law enforcement agencies .
According to Mr Guy , that makes sense .
" These types of requests can come in a variety of formats - some of them can be information pertinent to criminal investigations , some of them might be requirements to remove information under Australia 's content classification and censorship systems , " he said .
" In the case of law enforcement , it may be that Google does n't wish to prejudice ongoing criminal investigations and in terms of our censorship system , what Australia attempts to censor through its classification framework are government secrets , so they may be obligated to keep that information private . "
Google under pressure
The publication of the list comes at a time when Google itself is under fire for privacy breaches .
Canada 's privacy commissioner sent an open letter to Google 's CEO , Eric Schmidt , signed by the privacy heads of nine other countries , including New Zealand and the United Kingdom .
The letter urged the internet giant to consider the privacy of individuals as it rolls out new products .
It referred to the recent launch of Google 's social networking application Buzz and Streetview .
Google was forced to apologise and make changes to Buzz after it allowed personal material stored on its email service to be shared with contacts in a user 's box without their consent .
Australia 's Privacy Commissioner Karen Curtis says she was approached to sign the letter .
" Our approach always is to work constructively with businesses and governments who have obligations under the privacy acts and we have more of a one - on - one dialogue with Google .
We 're in regular contact with Google Australia and we discuss things like Streetview and Google Buzz with them , " Ms Curtis said .
" We decided that we have a more constructive relationship with Google Australia that we could pursue more on a one - on - one basis .
" We live in a digitised world and of course personal information is out there in the digitised world , so of course I 'm very concerned about how all of us and all the businesses and all individuals interact in this online world . "

When we at Riot Games set about building PC online multiplayer - centric title League of Legends , we did so with the lofty goal of creating a high - quality competitive experience with a rich , evolving metagame and low barrier to entry .
We believe these features are essential for a free - to - play game aimed at core gamers to be successful .
Multiplayer Online Battle Arena ( MOBA ) games like League of Legends have their roots in the modding community .
And while players are more than willing to accept a single map from a modder , they tend to be more demanding when it comes to virtual real estate in a full - fledged product .
As a result , before League of Legends officially released , we set about working on our next battlefield .
It is our belief that in order to maximize the success of a multiplayer map , the new maps would need to be available to everyone .
Therefore , they 're not something that can be explicitly sold to players in our virtual store .
They do , however , still play an extremely important role in a game that is operated as a live service .
First , and most importantly , they provide new , fun , competitive options for players by providing an alternative to the core experience .
A new battleground can also revitalize the interest of players who had previously moved on , motivate players to purchase new items better suited to this new battlefield , draw in new players with the promise of unique gameplay , and just generally increase the fervor of competition .
So , while content that is n't offered in the store does n't directly drive sales , new maps are certainly important and can play a role in the game 's growth .
A champion doing battle on Summoner 's Rift , the first map released for League of Legends .
Releasing a new map , however , can be a more daunting task than it sounds ; particularly if you want it to be balanced and ready for competitive play .
From the time a new battlefield is just a twinkle in a designer 's eye , to the time players are poised in a pitched , online battle with one another , there 's a lot of work that needs to get done .
So what goes into making a balanced and innovative MOBA map ?
Well , to start with , let 's talk about what makes a MOBA game tick .
What is a MOBA ?
MOBA games harken all the way back to the days of the original StarCraft , when the custom map Aeon of Strife was created .
This map streamlined the traditional real time strategy paradigm by placing the opposing bases under the control of the AI -- each base spawned minions to attack the other down predictable , preset paths called " lanes " .
Allied with each of these two AI - controlled bases were two opposing teams of players , with each player in command of a single , powerful hero unit ( or " champion " ) .
Without the intercession of the players , the two bases would fight to a standstill , neither making any headway towards the other .
Aeon of Strife , however , was subject to the limitations of the StarCraft map editor , and as a result , did n't possess enough intricacy to hold the lasting attention of a hardcore playerbase .
As a result , the MOBA genre did n't truly begin to blossom until the birth of Defense of the Ancients , a community mod built using the more powerful Warcraft III world editor , which allowed for the creation of much more robust champion units .
Players could now earn money and experience for their champions by killing enemies , gaining levels and acquiring equipment to help them wage war .
It was here that the standard paradigms that would define the genre would begin to take shape .
A game of Aeon of Strife , the forefather of the MOBA genre , in progress .
FCC Commissioner Michael Copps on Thursday stressed the debate over whether the government should regulate broadband providers will not be " solved without a fight . "
Copps , one of the committee 's members who supports net neutrality , said in an interview with Bill Moyers to air Friday that the dispute between the FCC and broadband providers over the commission 's powers contains populist undertones .
He suggested the FCC would thus have no choice but to push the issue aggressively , especially because it was in the " public interest " for the commission to implement net neutrality .
" This is a tough question for America right now , " Copps said .
" Here you 've got this dynamic technology that thrives on openness , that thrives on innovation ... and you do n't want to regulate or artificially limit it . "
" But at the end of the day , if that 's where everything is moving , if that 's where our national dialogue , if that 's where our civic dialogue is moving , there is a public interest component to that , " he added .
Much of the FCC 's newly released National Broadband Plan remains mired in uncertainty , following a federal court decision that essentially stripped the commission of its powers to regulate broadband providers .
Three options , however , remain :
The FCC could reclassify broadband so that it falls under their congressional mandate , they could ask lawmakers for a fix or they could simply choose to accept the court 's call .
That latter option is unlikely , seeing as Copps and the commission 's two other Democrats have hinted in the weeks after the court decision that they would fight it .
But the first two routes could nonetheless pit the FCC against telecommunications companies , some of which have signaled they will fight net neutrality regulations in court .
Copps , though , seemed to suggest on Thursday that his agency would be wrong to back down against those political or legal threats .
" I think at the end of the day , you have to come to that conclusion : we have a public interest in how this is used to inform and serve the American people . "
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan — Americans may think that the failed Times Square bomb was planted by a man named Faisal Shahzad .
But the view in the Supreme Court Bar Association here in Pakistan ’s capital is that the culprit was an American “ think tank . ”
No one seems to know its name , but everyone has an opinion about it .
It is powerful and shadowy , and seems to control just about everything in the American government , including President Obama .
“ They have planted this character Faisal Shahzad to implement their script , ” said Hashmat Ali Habib , a lawyer and a member of the bar association .
Who are they ?
“ You must know , you are from America , ” he said smiling .
“ My advice for the American nation is , get free of these think tanks . ”

Refusing to Wait : Anarchism and Intersectionality
" Without justice there can be no love . " -- bell hooks
Deric Shannon ( WSA / NEFAC ) and J. Rogue ( WSA / Common Action )
Anarchism can learn a lot from the feminist movement .
In many respects it already has .
Anarcha - feminists have developed analyses of patriarchy that link it to the state form .
We have learned from the slogan that " the personal is political " ( e.g. men who espouse equality between all genders should treat the women in their lives with dignity and respect ) .
We have learned that no revolutionary project can be complete while men systematically dominate and exploit women ; that socialism is a rather empty goal -- even if it is " stateless " -- if men 's domination of women is left intact .
This essay argues that anarchists can likewise learn from the theory of " intersectionality " that emerged from the feminist movement .
Indeed , anarchist conceptions of class struggle have widened as a result of the rise of feminist movements , civil rights movements , gay and lesbian liberation movements ( and , perhaps more contemporarily , the queer movements ) , disability rights movements , etc .
But how do we position ourselves regarding those struggles ?
What is their relationship to the class struggle that undergirds the fight for socialism ?
Do we dismiss them as " mere identity politics " that obscure rather than clarify the historic task of the working class ?
If not , how might anarchists include their concerns in our political theory and work ?
Why Intersectionality ?
How We Got here Many people locate the beginning of the feminist movement in the U.S. with the struggle of women to gain the vote .
This focus on electoralism was criticized for its narrowness by many turn - of - the - century radical women .
After all , what did the vote provide for working class women ?
How could voting for a new set of rulers put food in their mouths and the mouths of their families ?
In fact , many radical women of this time period refused to identify as feminists , as they viewed feminism as a bourgeois women 's movement unconcerned with the class struggle ( for an interesting discussion of this in the context of early 1900s Spanish anarcho - syndicalism , see Ackelsberg 2005 : 118-119 and 123-124 ) .
Indeed , many working class women saw their " feminist " contemporaries as being in alliance " with all the forces that have been the most determined enemies of the working people , of the poor and disinherited " -- that is , they saw the early feminist movement as a purely bourgeois women 's movement that had no solutions to the pervasive poverty and exploitation inherent in the working class experience in a classed society ( Parker 2001 : 125 ) .
Anarchists of this time period , on the other hand , at times anticipated some of the arguments to come out of the feminist movement regarding intersectionality .
We argued against the class reductionism that often occurred within the broader socialist milieu .
Early anarchists were writing about issues such as prostitution and sex trafficking ( Goldman 2001 ) , forced sterilizations ( Kropotkin 2001 ) , and marriage ( de Cleyre 2004 and 2001 ) to widen the anarchist critique of hierarchy to give critical concern to women 's issues in their own right , while also articulating a socialist vision of a future cooperative and classless society .
Much of this early work demonstrated connections between the oppression of women and the exploitation of the working class .
The refusal of many working class women to join their feminist contemporaries likewise demonstrated some of the problems of a universalized identity - based feminism that saw womens oppression as a hierarchy that can be fought without also fighting capitalism .
This is not to suggest that anarchists werent at times reductionist .
Unfortunately , many anarchist men were dismissive of womens concerns .
Part of the reason that the Mujeres Libres saw a need for a separate womens organization around the time of the Spanish Civil War was because " many anarchists treated the issue of women 's subordination as , at best , secondary to the emancipation of workers , a problem that would be resolved ' on the morrow of the revolution ' " ( Ackelsberg 2005 : 38 ) .
Unfortunately , in some contexts , this attitude is n't just a historical oddity , though it should be .
And it was these kinds of assumptions that became an important theoretical backdrop for feminism 's " Second Wave " .
Competing Visions in the " Second Wave " During the late 60s through the early 80s , new forms of feminism began to emerge .
Many feminists seemed to gravitate to four competing theories with very different explanations for the oppression of women .
Like their historical bourgeois predecessors , liberal feminists saw no need for a revolutionary break with existing society .
Rather , their focus was on breaking the " glass ceiling " , getting more women into positions of political and economic power .
Liberal feminists assumed that the existing institutional arrangements were fundamentally unproblematic .
Their task was to see to women 's equality accommodated under capitalism .
Another theory , sometimes referred to as radical feminism , argued for abandoning the " male Left " , as it was seen as hopelessly reductionist .
Indeed , many women coming out of the Civil Rights movement and anti-war movements complained of pervasive sexism within the movements , being relegated to secretarial tasks , philandering male leaders , and a generalized alienation from Left politics .
According to many radical feminists of the time , this was due to the primacy of the system of patriarchy -- or men 's systematic and institutionalized domination of women .
To these feminists , the battle against patriarchy was the primary struggle to create a free society , as gender was our most entrenched and oldest hierarchy ( see especially Firestone 1970 ) .
Marxist feminists , on the other hand , tended to locate women 's oppression within the economic sphere .
The fight against capitalism was seen as the " primary " battle , as " The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles " -- that is , human history could be reduced to class ( Marx and Engels 1967 ) .
Further , Marxist feminists tended to believe that the economic " base " of society had a determining effect on its cultural " superstructures " .
Thus , the only way to achieve equality between women and men would be to smash capitalism -- as new , egalitarian economic arrangements would give rise to new , egalitarian superstructures .
Such was the determining nature of the economic base .
Out of the conversations between Marxist feminism and radical feminism another approach emerged called " dual systems theory " ( see e.g. Hartmann 1981 ; Young 1981 ) .
A product of what came to be dubbed socialist feminism , dual systems theory argued that feminists needed to develop " a theoretical account which gives as much weight to the system of patriarchy as to the system of capitalism " ( Young 1981 : 44 ) .
While this approach did much to resolve some of the arguments about which fight should be " primary " ( i.e. the struggle against capitalism or the struggle against patriarchy ) , it still left much to be desired .
For example , black feminists argued that this perspective left out a structural analysis of race ( Joseph 1981 ) .
Further , where was oppression based on sexuality , ability , age , etc. in this analysis ?
Were all of these things reducible to capitalist patriarchy ?
It is within this theoretical backdrop that intersectionality emerged .
But it was n't just abstraction and theory that led to these insights .
As mentioned before , part of the reason feminists saw a need for a separate analysis of patriarchy as a systemic form of oppression was due to their experiences with the broader Left .
Without an analysis of patriarchy that put it on equal footing with capitalism as an organizing system in our lives , there was no adequate response to male leaders who suggested that we deal with women 's oppression after we deal with the " primary " or " more important " class struggle .
But these tensions were not limited to the Left , they also existed within the feminist movement .
Perhaps one of the best examples of this on the ground was in the pro-choice movement in the United States .
Before Roe vs. Wade in 1973 , abortion law was considered an issue to be dealt with on a state - by - state basis .
Feminists mobilized around Roe Vs. Wade to see that legal abortion would be guaranteed throughout the country .
The ruling eventually did give legal guarantees to abortion through the second trimester , but the " choice " and " legalization " rhetoric left too much unaddressed for many feminists .
And this experience set the stage for re-thinking the idea of a universalized , monolithic experience of " womanhood " as it is often expressed in traditional identity politics .
Black feminists and womanists , for example , argued that focusing solely on legalized abortion obscured the ways that black women in the United States underwent forced sterilizations and were often denied the right to have children ( see Roberts 1997 ) .
Further , working class women argued that legalized " choice " is pretty meaningless without socialism , as having abortion legal , but unaffordable , did n't exactly constitute a " choice " .
True reproductive freedom meant something more than just legal abortion for working class women .
Many wanted to have kids but simply could n't afford raising them ; some wanted a change in the cultural norms and mores of a society that judged the decisions women made about their bodies ; others wanted proximity to clinics for reproductive health -- in short , a " reproductive freedom " framework would take into account the interests of all women , not just be structured around white , heterosexual , middle - class women 's concerns ( the seeming default position of the " pro-choice " movement ) .
Intersections
These experiences within the feminist movement and the broader Left raised many questions for feminists .
How do we create a movement that is n't focused around the interests of its most privileged elements ?
How do we retain our commitment to socialism without being subsumed into a politic that sees women 's issues as " secondary " ?
What might political organization look like based on a common commitment to ending domination rather than an assumed common experience based on some single identity ?
These questions began to be answered largely by feminists of color , queers , and sex radicals with the theory of intersectionality - - a theory that was critical of traditional class and identity politics ( see especially e.g. hooks 2000 ; Collins 2000 ) .
Intersectionality posits that our social locations in terms of race , class , gender , sexuality , nation of origin , ability , age , etc. are not easily parsed out one from the other .
To speak of a universal experience as a " woman " , for example , is problematic because " womanhood " is experienced quite differently based on race , class , sexuality -- any number of factors .
As such , a non-reflective feminist movement centered ostensibly on the concerns of " women " tended to reflect the interests of the most privileged members of that social category .
As well , our various social locations and the hierarchies they inform intersect in complex ways and are not easily separable .
People do n't exist as " women " , " men " , " white " , " working class " , etc. in a vacuum devoid of other patterned social relationships .
Further , these systems of exploitation and oppression function in unique ways .
To name two rather obvious examples , class is a social relationship based on the exploitation of one 's labor .
As socialists , we seek the abolition of classes , not the end of class elitism under capitalism .
This makes class unique .
Similarly , the idea of " sexual orientation " developed in the 1800s with the invention of " the homosexual " as a species of a person .
This effectively created an identity out of preferred gender choices in sexual partners , more or less ignoring the myriad other ways that people organize their sexuality ( i.e. number of partners , preferred sexual acts , etc. ) .
It also effectively limited sexual identity to three categories : hetero , homo , and bi--as if there could not be a large range of attractions and variety within humanity .
Part of liberation based on sexuality is troubling these categories to provide a viable sexual / social existence for everyone .
This makes sexuality , likewise , unique .
These structured inequalities and hierarchies inform and support one another .
For example , the labor of women in child - bearing and rearing provides new bodies for the larger social factory to allow capitalism to continue .
White supremacy and racism allow capitalists control over a segment of the labor market that can serve as stocks of cheap labor .
Compulsory heterosexuality allows the policing of the patriarchal family form , strengthening patriarchy and male dominance .
And all structured forms of inequality add to the nihilistic belief that institutionalized hierarchy is inevitable and that liberatory movements are based on utopian dreams .
Proponents of intersectionality , then , argue that all struggles against domination are necessary components for the creation of a liberatory society .
It is unnecessary to create a totem pole of importance out of social struggles and suggest that some are " primary " while others are " secondary " or " peripheral " because of the complete ways that they intersect and inform one another .
Further , history has shown us that this method of ranking oppressions is divisive and unnecessary -- and worse , it undermines solidarity .
As well , when organizing and developing political practice , we can self - reflexively move the margins to the center of our analyses to avoid the biases of privilege that has historically led to so many divisions in feminism and the Left .
A good contemporary example of intersectionality in the context of social movement practice is Incite !
Women of Color Against Violence .
Incite !
is a national activist organization of radical feminists of color advancing a movement to end violence against women of color and our communities through direct action , critical dialogue and grassroots organizing  ( Incite ! 2009 ) .
One reason Incite !
stands out against other anti-violence organizations is their systemic analysis .
They see women of color who have experienced violence as living in the dangerous intersections  of white supremacy , patriarchy , capitalism , and other oppressive structures and institutions .
Rather than simply reducing the experiences to the individual , they recognize the systems that oppress and exploit people and have structured their approach in such a way that calls for the recentering  of marginalized folks , as opposed to a method of " inclusiveness " based on one single identity or social location .
Incite ! argues that inclusiveness  simply adds a multicultural component to individualistic white - dominated organizing so common in the United States .
Instead , they call for recentering the framework around the most marginalized peoples .
This push is to ensure that their organizing addresses the needs of those historically overlooked by feminism , with the understanding that all people benefit from the liberation of their more marginalized peers -- while focusing on the more privileged elements within a given social category leaves others behind ( as in the examples we gave in the struggle for the vote and the legalization of abortion ) .
Incite ! makes a point to focus on the needs of the working class who have generally been neglected ( i.e. sex workers , the incarcerated , trans folks and injection drug users ) .
By centering these people in their organizing , they are focusing on the people standing at more dangerous intersections of oppression and exploitation , therefore tackling the entirety of the system and not just the more visible or advantaged aspects .
Additionally , Incite !
views the state as a major perpetrator of violence against women of color and seeks to build grassroots organizations independent of and against it .
Anarchists could learn a lot from Incite !
about the importance of addressing the needs of ALL sections of the working class and their attempt to check the tendency of the Left to ignore or dismiss the concerns , needs , ideas and leadership of people living in the dangerous intersections of capitalism , white supremacy , patriarchy , etc .
And What Can Anarchism Provide the Theory of Intersectionality ?
We firmly believe that this learning process is a two - way street .
That is , when synthesizing our practice to include these concerns raised by feminists , feminism could stand to benefit from learning from anarchism as well .
We see the contributions of anarchists to intersectionality in two major areas .
First , anarchism can provide a radical base from which to critique liberal interpretations of intersectionality .
Secondly , anarchists can offer a critical analysis of the state .
Too often people using an intersectional analysis ignore the uniqueness of various systems of domination .
One way this is done is by articulating a general opposition to classism .
While we believe that class elitism exists , often this opposition to " classism " does not recognize the unique qualities of capitalism and can lead to a position that essentially argues for an end to class elitism under capitalism .
As anarchists , we do not just oppose class elitism , we oppose class society itself .
We do not want the ruling class to treat us nicer under a system based on inequality and exploitation ( i.e. capitalism ) .
We want to smash capitalism to pieces and build a new society in which classes no longer exist -- that is , we fight for socialism .
Anarchists , as part of the socialist movement , are well - placed to critique this liberal interpretation of intersectionality ( see especially Schmidt and van der Walt 2009 ) .
Likewise , as anarchists , we are well - placed to put forward our critiques of the state .
The state , in addition to being a set of specific institutions ( such as the courts , police , political bodies like senates , presidents , etc. ) , is a social relationship .
And the state has an influence over our lives in myriad ways .
For example , former prisoners are often unemployable , particularly if they have committed felonies .
One only needs to take a cursory glance at the racial and class make - up of US prisons to see how intersectionality can be put to use here .
Former prisoners , workers who are targeted for striking or engaging in direct actions and / or civil disobedience , etc. all have specific needs as subjects in a society that assumes political rulers and passive , ruled subjects .
And the state tends to target specific sets of workers based on their existence within the dangerous intersections we mentioned above .
Anarchists can offer to the theory of intersectionality an analysis of the ways that the state has come to rule our lives just as much as any other institutionalized system of domination .
And we can , of course , argue for smashing such a social arrangement and replacing it with non-hierarchical social forms .
Refusing to Wait
In many ways , anarchists have historically anticipated some of the ideas in intersectionality .
Further , anarchism as a political philosophy -- and as a movement against all forms of structured domination , coercion , and control - - seems well - suited for an intersectional practice .
Unfortunately , we still have debilitating arguments about what hierarchy is " primary " and should be prioritized above others .
Like in times past , this leads to easy division and a lack of solidarity ( imagine being told to give up some struggle that directly involves YOU for the " correct " or " primary " fight ! ) .
Further , the smashing of any structured hierarchy can have a destabilizing effect on the rest , as the simple existence of any of these social divisions serves to naturalize the existence of all other hierarchies .
We 've tried here to explain the rise of the theory of intersectionality within feminism and describe its contours .
Perhaps more importantly , we 've attempted to relate it throughout this piece to political practice and social movement struggles so as to avoid complete abstraction and theorization apart from practice .
We hope that more anarchists become acquainted with intersectionality and put it to positive use in our political work .
Finally , it is our hope that more people from marginalized groups refuse to wait , that we recognize the value of all fights against injustice and hierarchy in the here and now -- and that we build a reflexive practice based on solidarity and mutual aid instead of divisive prescriptions about what struggles are " primary " and which ones , by extension , are " secondary " or " peripheral " .
Rather , they are all linked and we have good reason to refuse to wait until after " the revolution " to address them !

" Beyond the Unhappy Marriage : A Critique of the Dual Systems Theory . " in Women and Revolution , by Lydia Sargent ( ed. ) .

Anarchism can learn a lot from the feminist movement .
In many respects it already has .
Anarcha - feminists have developed analyses of patriarchy that link it to the state form .
We have learned from the slogan that " the personal is political " ( e.g. men who espouse equality between all genders should treat the women in their lives with dignity and respect ) .
We have learned that no revolutionary project can be complete while men systematically dominate and exploit women ; that socialism is a rather empty goal -- even if it is " stateless " -- if men 's domination of women is left intact .
This essay argues that anarchists can likewise learn from the theory of " intersectionality " that emerged from the feminist movement .
Indeed , anarchist conceptions of class struggle have widened as a result of the rise of feminist movements , civil rights movements , gay and lesbian liberation movements ( and , perhaps more contemporarily , the queer movements ) , disability rights movements , etc .
But how do we position ourselves regarding those struggles ?
What is their relationship to the class struggle that undergirds the fight for socialism ?
Do we dismiss them as " mere identity politics " that obscure rather than clarify the historic task of the working class ?
If not , how might anarchists include their concerns in our political theory and work ?
Many people locate the beginning of the feminist movement in the U.S. with the struggle of women to gain the vote .
This focus on electoralism was criticized for its narrowness by many turn - of - the - century radical women .
After all , what did the vote provide for working class women ?
How could voting for a new set of rulers put food in their mouths and the mouths of their families ?
In fact , many radical women of this time period refused to identify as feminists , as they viewed feminism as a bourgeois women 's movement unconcerned with the class struggle ( for an interesting discussion of this in the context of early 1900s Spanish anarcho - syndicalism , see Ackelsberg 2005 : 118-119 and 123-124 ) .
Indeed , many working class women saw their " feminist " contemporaries as being in alliance " with all the forces that have been the most determined enemies of the working people , of the poor and disinherited " -- that is , they saw the early feminist movement as a purely bourgeois women 's movement that had no solutions to the pervasive poverty and exploitation inherent in the working class experience in a classed society ( Parker 2001 : 125 ) .
Anarchists of this time period , on the other hand , at times anticipated some of the arguments to come out of the feminist movement regarding intersectionality .
We argued against the class reductionism that often occurred within the broader socialist milieu .
Early anarchists were writing about issues such as prostitution and sex trafficking ( Goldman 2001 ) , forced sterilizations ( Kropotkin 2001 ) , and marriage ( de Cleyre 2004 and 2001 ) to widen the anarchist critique of hierarchy to give critical concern to women 's issues in their own right , while also articulating a socialist vision of a future cooperative and classless society .
Much of this early work demonstrated connections between the oppression of women and the exploitation of the working class .
The refusal of many working class women to join their feminist contemporaries likewise demonstrated some of the problems of a universalized identity - based feminism that saw womens oppression as a hierarchy that can be fought without also fighting capitalism .
This is not to suggest that anarchists werent at times reductionist .
Unfortunately , many anarchist men were dismissive of womens concerns .
Part of the reason that the Mujeres Libres saw a need for a separate womens organization around the time of the Spanish Civil War was because " many anarchists treated the issue of women 's subordination as , at best , secondary to the emancipation of workers , a problem that would be resolved ' on the morrow of the revolution ' " ( Ackelsberg 2005 : 38 ) .
Unfortunately , in some contexts , this attitude is n't just a historical oddity , though it should be .
And it was these kinds of assumptions that became an important theoretical backdrop for feminism 's " Second Wave " .
During the late 60s through the early 80s , new forms of feminism began to emerge .
Many feminists seemed to gravitate to four competing theories with very different explanations for the oppression of women .
Like their historical bourgeois predecessors , liberal feminists saw no need for a revolutionary break with existing society .
Rather , their focus was on breaking the " glass ceiling " , getting more women into positions of political and economic power .
Liberal feminists assumed that the existing institutional arrangements were fundamentally unproblematic .
Their task was to see to women 's equality accommodated under capitalism .
Another theory , sometimes referred to as radical feminism , argued for abandoning the " male Left " , as it was seen as hopelessly reductionist .
Indeed , many women coming out of the Civil Rights movement and anti-war movements complained of pervasive sexism within the movements , being relegated to secretarial tasks , philandering male leaders , and a generalized alienation from Left politics .
According to many radical feminists of the time , this was due to the primacy of the system of patriarchy -- or men 's systematic and institutionalized domination of women .
To these feminists , the battle against patriarchy was the primary struggle to create a free society , as gender was our most entrenched and oldest hierarchy ( see especially Firestone 1970 ) .
Marxist feminists , on the other hand , tended to locate women 's oppression within the economic sphere .
The fight against capitalism was seen as the " primary " battle , as " The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles " -- that is , human history could be reduced to class ( Marx and Engels 1967 ) .
Further , Marxist feminists tended to believe that the economic " base " of society had a determining effect on its cultural " superstructures " .
Thus , the only way to achieve equality between women and men would be to smash capitalism -- as new , egalitarian economic arrangements would give rise to new , egalitarian superstructures .
Such was the determining nature of the economic base .
Out of the conversations between Marxist feminism and radical feminism another approach emerged called " dual systems theory " ( see e.g. Hartmann 1981 ; Young 1981 ) .
A product of what came to be dubbed socialist feminism , dual systems theory argued that feminists needed to develop " a theoretical account which gives as much weight to the system of patriarchy as to the system of capitalism " ( Young 1981 : 44 ) .
While this approach did much to resolve some of the arguments about which fight should be " primary " ( i.e. the struggle against capitalism or the struggle against patriarchy ) , it still left much to be desired .
For example , black feminists argued that this perspective left out a structural analysis of race ( Joseph 1981 ) .
Further , where was oppression based on sexuality , ability , age , etc. in this analysis ?
Were all of these things reducible to capitalist patriarchy ?
It is within this theoretical backdrop that intersectionality emerged .
But it was n't just abstraction and theory that led to these insights .
As mentioned before , part of the reason feminists saw a need for a separate analysis of patriarchy as a systemic form of oppression was due to their experiences with the broader Left .
Without an analysis of patriarchy that put it on equal footing with capitalism as an organizing system in our lives , there was no adequate response to male leaders who suggested that we deal with women 's oppression after we deal with the " primary " or " more important " class struggle .
But these tensions were not limited to the Left , they also existed within the feminist movement .
Perhaps one of the best examples of this on the ground was in the pro-choice movement in the United States .
Before Roe vs. Wade in 1973 , abortion law was considered an issue to be dealt with on a state - by - state basis .
Feminists mobilized around Roe Vs. Wade to see that legal abortion would be guaranteed throughout the country .
The ruling eventually did give legal guarantees to abortion through the second trimester , but the " choice " and " legalization " rhetoric left too much unaddressed for many feminists .
And this experience set the stage for re-thinking the idea of a universalized , monolithic experience of " womanhood " as it is often expressed in traditional identity politics .
Black feminists and womanists , for example , argued that focusing solely on legalized abortion obscured the ways that black women in the United States underwent forced sterilizations and were often denied the right to have children ( see Roberts 1997 ) .
Further , working class women argued that legalized " choice " is pretty meaningless without socialism , as having abortion legal , but unaffordable , did n't exactly constitute a " choice " .
True reproductive freedom meant something more than just legal abortion for working class women .

These experiences within the feminist movement and the broader Left raised many questions for feminists .
How do we create a movement that is n't focused around the interests of its most privileged elements ?
How do we retain our commitment to socialism without being subsumed into a politic that sees women 's issues as " secondary " ?

about the importance of addressing the needs of ALL sections of the working class and their attempt to check the tendency of the Left to ignore or dismiss the concerns , needs , ideas and leadership of people living in the dangerous intersections of capitalism , white supremacy , patriarchy , etc .
We firmly believe that this learning process is a two - way street .
That is , when synthesizing our practice to include these concerns raised by feminists , feminism could stand to benefit from learning from anarchism as well .

Government not allowed to use secret evidence to defend itself against claims by detainees it was complicit in their torture
The court of appeal has dismissed an attempt by MI5 and MI6 to suppress evidence of their alleged complicity in the torture and secret transfer of British residents to Guantánamo Bay .
In a devastating judgment , it ruled that the unprecedented attempt by the security and intelligence agencies , backed by the attorney general and senior Whitehall officials , to suppress evidence in a civil trial undermined deep - seated principles of common law and open justice .
MI5 and MI6 said evidence in the case , in which the Guardian , the Times and the BBC intervened , should be kept secret from everyone except the judges and specially appointed and vetted counsel .
The former detainees – Binyam Mohamed , Bisher al - Rawi , Jamil el - Banna , Richard Belmar , Omar Deghayes and Martin Mubanga – have denied any involvement in terrorism and allege that MI5 and MI6 aided and abetted their unlawful imprisonment and extraordinary rendition to various locations around the world , including Guantánamo .
They are seeking compensation for abuse and wrongful imprisonment .
In their ruling , Lord Neuberger , master of the rolls , Lord Justice Maurice Kay , and Lord Justice Sullivan said that accepting the case of the security and intelligence agencies would amount to " undermining one of [ the common law's ] most fundamental principles " .
" A further fundamental common law principle is that trials should be conducted in public , and the judgments should be given in public .
" In our view the principle that a litigant should be able to see and hear all the evidence which is seen and heard by a court determining his case is so fundamental , so embedded in the common law that , in the absence of parliamentary authority , no judge should override it , at any rate in relation to an ordinary civil claim ... "
Moreover , the judges said , if a party was to win a case where the evidence was heard in secret , there was a " substantial risk " that it " would not be vindicated and that justice would not be seen to have been done .
The outcome would be likely to be a pyrrhic victory for the defendants whose reputation would be damaged by such a process , but the damage to the reputation of the court would in all probability , be even greater . "
Corinna Ferguson , legal officer at the civil rights group Liberty , said : " Yet again , the court of appeal has sent the strongest signal to the security establishment that it cannot play fast and loose with the rule of law .
Fair and open justice belongs to people , not governments .
Whoever governs us from Friday would be wise to bear this in mind . "

Ich halte staatliche Hilfen nur dort für geboten , wo es sich um gesellschaftsrelevante Versorgung handelt .
Sportartikelhersteller und die Textilbranche haben jahrzehntelang von steigenden Umsätzen profitiert , jetzt geht es halt mal in die andere Richtung .
Ich finde Mitleid mit Wirtschaftsunternehmen generell unangebracht .
Es gehört einfach zum wirtschaftlichen Handeln dazu , für schlechtere Zeiten etwas in der Hinterhand zu haben und ggf. auch neue Wirtschaftszweige zu erschließen .
Wenn Unternehmen nur deshalb existieren , weil die Politik sie für gut befinden , dann sind sie fehl am Platz .
Letztlich soll der Kunde entscheiden , ob ein Unternehmen gebraucht wird oder nicht .
Wenn also ADIDAS - Produkte nachgefragt werden , hat das Unternehmen seine Berechtigung , wenn nicht , dann sollte der Staat nicht eingreifen .
ADIDAS muss sich dann eben überlegen , ob es andere Produkte platzieren kann , die tatsächlich gebraucht werden .
Im Übrigen gilt das für JEDES Unternehmen gleichermaßen , denn es gilt nach unserem Grundgesetz der Gleichheitsgrundsatz .
Wenn der Staat also einzelne Unternehmen stützt , egal ob politisch gewollt oder nicht , dann ist das erst einmal VERFASSUNGSWIDRIG .
Außer er stützt alle Unternehmen im gleichen , d.h. angemessenen Rahmen .
Das ist aber schwierig zu realisieren .
Und dann hätten wir den sogenannten Staatskapitalismus ( oder Planwirtschaft ) , was wir vor 30 Jahren gerade abgeschafft haben , aus gutem Grund , weil solches Wirtschaften eben alles ist , nur nicht wirtschaftlich .
Bikes , cars and people — the war heats up in Toronto
Coming to work during Wednesday ’s morning ’s rush hour , I drove across Wellesley St. , then went south on Sherbourne all the way to the waterfront , then headed west along Queens Quay to Yonge St .
I saw only 15 bicyclists during the entire commute , even though all these roads have bike lanes and the weather was perfect for riding .
At work , I counted a total of just 17 bicycles locked up in the bike racks in our building ’s parking garage , despite the fact that nearly 2,000 people work in the 24 - storey office tower that houses the Toronto Star , a Canada Post sorting facility , LCBO finance offices and other companies .
I decided to count the cyclists after reading that the city plans to install “ protected ” bike lanes this summer along University Avenue , one of the busiest streets in Toronto .
Given how few cyclists I saw and how few are actually using the existing bikes lanes , it seems that mayoral candidate Rocco Rossi may be right when he calls the University Ave. plan “ sheer madness . ”
Indeed , the move to convert two lanes of University Ave. , a major arterial street travelled by thousands of motorists every day , to bike lanes is the latest sign that the small , but highly vocal , pro-bike lobby in the city and at city hall is stepping up — and winning — the city ’s “ war on cars . ”
If anything , the pro-bike crowd at city hall is being deliberately mischievous and provocative by pushing for the controversial bike lanes in the midst of the current mayoral election .
Rossi , who opposes bike lanes on major streets such as Jarvis , Bloor and University , has made the issue a hot campaign topic , winning huge applause from motorists and infuriating cycling activists .
Under the plan , two lanes of University Ave. and Queen ’s Park Crescent would be replaced for a three - month period from July through September by protected bike lanes from Richmond St. north to Wellesley .
The road now has four lanes in each direction .
Cyclists would ride in the lane adjacent to the median and be separated from cars and trucks by a metre - wide buffer and solid dividing posts .
City council would study the results of the three - month test and decide whether to make the bike lanes permanent .
Other bike lanes will be tested this summer on parts of Bay St. , Landsdowne Ave. , Rathburn Rd. , York Mills Rd. , and several other streets .
While more bike lanes are a good idea , putting them on major roads is ridiculous .
They should be placed on less - busy routes .
The city staff report claims the impact on University Ave. traffic would be negligible .
“ Traffic capacity analysis indicates that University Ave. could operate with three travel lanes in each direction in the peak periods with little impact on the current levels of service , ” the report says .
That ’s just nuts !
Anyone who has been stuck in rush - hour traffic on University Ave. knows that ’s not true .
University Ave. is meant to carry lots of cars and truck and removing one lane will likely make it more dangerous by pushing cars into fewer lanes and creating even more congestion , thus producing even more air pollution .
The city ’s public works and infrastructure committee is expected to rubber - stamp the plan at its meeting next Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. , in committee room 1 at city hall .
The plan will then go to the full city council for final approval .

Like it or not , the University Ave. bike lane trial will go ahead .
There ’s no way the current council will oppose it .
That ’s why it will be critical that the pilot project be conducted openly and honestly .
The evidence ca n’t just be anecdotal , with cyclists yelling “ Yippee , this is great ” and producing highly questionable statistics about the number of bikers actually using the lanes .
Before this pilot project is put in place , everyone needs to know how it will be evaluated , what does the city hope to achieve , what will be involved in the evaluation , how will the city know if it is a success or failure , and who will be involved in the evaluation .
All of this must be determined in advance , otherwise it wo n’t be a true scientific study .
The staff report claims “ key stakeholders ” along University Ave. , including hospitals , the fire department “ and the cycling community ” will be consulted about the plan and how it is evaluated .
I did n’t see any reference to consulting drivers .
Clearly , they are the losers once again .

Update , 5/18 : Read early reviews of R U There here .
A movie about Second Life and gaming is screening at this year 's prestigious Cannes Film Festival , which opens today .
The name of the film is R U There , a Dutch / French production partly shot in Taipei , and partly in Second Life .
It 's about a professional gamer who falls in love with a beautiful Taiwanese girl , who invites him to deepen their relationship in the metaverse .
Check out the immensely stylish trailer , which sort of suggests Wong Kar - Wai meets CounterStrike :
RU
There is screening in Cannes ' Un Certain Regard selection , which is reserved for international movies that are " original and different " in a noteworthy way .
Previous entries include last year 's acclaimed hit Precious , Hou Hsiao Hsien 's Flight of the Red Balloon , and Richard Linklater 's A Scanner Darkly .
( Which as it happens , was promoted in Second Life . )
Competitively , R U
There is up against movies like Socialisme , by Jean - Luc Godard , who 's one of the world 's greatest living directors .
In other words , this is a very big damn deal .
RU
There was directed by David Verbeek , who occasionally visits SL as the avatars " LilyRukai Camino " and " Cameraman Haiku " .
I tried to get in touch with him , but being in Cannes at the moment , he 's somewhat tied up .
Fortunately I was able to interview the film 's editor , Sander Vos , who introduced Verbeek to Second Life in the first place .
" David is fascinated by the contradictions of modern life versus the needs of the human soul , " as Sander put it to me .
" While we were editing his previous film , I was in SL on a daily basis and I showed him around . "
( Vos ' SL avatar is " RL Karkassus " . )
What he saw there and what Sander told him inspired Verbeek to include Second Life in his next project :
“ I do n’t care who you are , … this is funny . ”
Thus began an e-mail that Walt Baker , CEO of the Tennessee Hospitality Association , sent to to a few friends , the president of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau , and several members of the press .
It continues by comparing First Lady Michelle Obama to Tarzan ’s chimpanzee sidekick Cheeta .
There are two photos at the bottom — one of Obama with an awkward pursing of her lips and another of a chimp .

Unsurprisingly , Baker has already begun apologizing for the outrage created by the e-mail .
“ I am sorry for my actions .
I am sorry for the offensive contents of the email , ” Baker said .
“ I can only hope those that know me can find it in their hearts to forgive me . ”
Many of Tennessee ’s leaders are angry that their state is once again front and center of a negative media spotlight .
“ Who wants to come to a state where people think like that ?
This is far reaching and it ’s damaging , ” said District 3 Metro Council Member Walter Hunt .
This is n’t the first e-mail sent by a Tennessee official since President Obama took office that smacks of racism .

In October , a state trooper sent a “ white pride ” e-mail to nearly 800 state employees .
Several months before , an aide in the state Senate sent out an e-mail depicting Obama as two cartoonish white eyes peering from a black background .
The Nashville Convention & Visitors Bureau has decided to drop its contract with Baker ’s marketing firm Saturday , but many are calling for Baker ’s resignation from the Tennessee Hospitality Association .
America ’s future math teachers , on average , earned a C on a new test comparing their skills with their counterparts in 15 other countries , significantly outscoring college students in the Philippines and Chile but placing far below those in educationally advanced nations like Singapore and Taiwan .
The researchers who led the math study in this country , to be released in Washington on Thursday , judged the results acceptable if not encouraging for America ’s future elementary teachers .
But they called them disturbing for American students heading to careers in middle schools , who were outscored by students in Germany , Poland , the Russian Federation , Singapore , Switzerland and Taiwan .
On average , 80 percent to 100 percent of the future middle school teachers from the highest - achieving countries took advanced courses like linear algebra and calculus , while only 50 percent to 60 percent of their counterparts in the United States took those courses , the study said .
“ The study reveals that America ’s middle school mathematics teacher preparation is not up to the task , ” said William H. Schmidt , the Michigan State University professor who was its lead author .
To improve its competitiveness , Dr. Schmidt said , the nation should recruit stronger candidates into careers teaching math and require them to take more advanced courses .

No you 're not in an 80s timewarp ...
Pac - Man really is all the rage again .
The world 's most successful arcade game is celebrating its 30th birthday by taking the world by storm for a second time .
More than one billion people are thought to have played Pac - Man in the past three days after Google turned its logo into an online version of the game to mark the milestone .
The internet giant said the launch of Pac - Man marked " a significant moment in popular culture " .
Landmark
Its official blog read : " Pac - Man seems like a natural fit for the Google homepage .
" They 're both deceptively straightforward , carefully hiding their complexity under the hood .
There 's a light - hearted , human touch to both .
" We can only hope you find using Google at least a quarter as enjoyable as eating dots and chasing ghosts . "
Pac - Man - or Puck Man as it was originally called - was released as an arcade game in Japan on May 22 , 1980 .
The game features small yellow Pac - Men travelling around a maze , gobbling up dots while trying to avoid the ghosts .
It quickly became the most popular computer game on the market and led to a string of copycat releases .
Maker Namco changed the name to Pac - Man when it was released in the US the same year .
Since then there have been more than 50 versions and industry experts reckons over 10 billion games of it have been played .
The game was the brainchild of Toru Iwatani , who is now a professor at Tokyo Polytechnic University .
The 55 - year - old came up with the idea in 1979 as he ate his lunch .
His goal was to make video games appealing to women rather than just computer geeks .
He revealed : " I was quite hungry and ordered a whole pizza .
" I helped myself to a wedge and what was left was the idea for the Pac - Man shape .
Around the time that we launched it , video arcades were filled with games where you shoot aliens .
It seemed very dark .
It was for men , it was n't fashionable at all .
" I realised that if women and couples were going to come to game centres , they had to be cheerful places .
" When you think about things women like , you think about fashion , or fortune - telling , or food or dating boyfriends .
" So I decided to theme the game around eating - after eating dinner , women like to have dessert . "
The game was not officially launched on May 22 - only put into a public arcade to gauge reaction .
Mr Iwatani added : " Since it was the first time the machine was shown to the general public , we consider May 22 to be Pac - Man 's birthday .
After that , we made revisions and improvements based on the results of the location test and it was released in July .
" The women and couples were very happy about the machine .
" They played it , and they were more or less satisfied - they figured out how to play it .
But we did n't think it would be a major hit .
Success " I did n't think that the US and Europe would take it up , because it 's a rather slow relaxing game . "
American fans spent more than $ 1 billion on Pac - Man games in the first 15 months after its release .
It went on to spawn its own family including Ms Pac - Man and Jr. Pac - Man .
Only one person - celebrated player Billy Mitchell - has played a perfect game of Pac - Man .
The Google version of the game was removed from the company 's home page last night .
But you can continue to play the game by adding the Pac - Man Gadget on to your iGoogle .
A woman claims falling from a Wii Fit board turned her into a nymphomaniac .
Amanda Flowers told the Daily Star she now needs up to 10 sex sessions a day after damaging a nerve in the fall .
She has been diagnosed with persistent genital arousal disorder , a condition which gained global attention when it featured in an episode of Grey ’s Anatomy in 2008 .
Ms Flowers , who lives in Manchester , said the urge to have sex was irresistible .
She said small vibrations from her mobile phone or food processor were enough to turn her on .
" It began as a twinge down below , before surging through my body , " Ms Flowers told the Daily Star .
" Sometimes it built up into a trembling orgasm . "
The single Ms Flowers said all she could do was try to control it with deep breathing , or " find a superstud who can satisfy me " .
PGAD was first defined as " intense feelings of genital congestion and sensations that are typically unaccompanied by any conscious awareness of sexual desire " by US doctor Sandra Leiblum .
The former director of the Centre for Sexual and Relationship Health in New Jersey told FoxNews.com that sensations can last hours or even days , and they truly are unwanted and intrusive .
She said sexual activity can actually reinforce the sensations or provide only temporary relief .
[ This started out as an ordinary blog posting , but it grew to monstrous length ( nearly 10,000 words ) , even as took much more time to write than I had originally anticipated .
I apologize for the length , but I still think it is best to post it in full .
I am groping here towards something that I have been trying to work out , and articulate , for a while .
I do n’t think I have found it all yet , but I am getting closer , whatever the awkwardness of expression here ] .
I finally caught up with Gamer , by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor .
I came to this movie with admittedly high expectations , based on my love for Neveldine and Taylor ’s previous two Crankfilms .
But Gamer far exceeded anything I anticipated .
It is brilliant , in the way that only a sleazy exploitation film , made by directors who describe themselves as “ pretty A.D.D. ” could ever be .
Indeed , Gamer is absolutely contemporary ; no film since at least Southland Tales has said anywhere near as much about the world we actually live in today .
Gamer is one of those rare films that truly dares to be ( in the Lenin phrase I like to quote ) “ as radical as reality itself . ”
It remains a few steps ahead of any possible critical reflection that one might try to apply to it — including , of course , my own .
And yet it seems as if almost nobody noticed the film ’s brilliance .
Gamer got mostly unfavorable reviews , and it did n’t do as well as hoped at the box office .
Indeed , Ignatiy Vishnevetsky ’s brilliant review , Annalee Newitz ’ quick recommendation , and Kim Dot Dammit ’s blog posting on the movie , are the only commentaries I have found that do justice to what is more commonly described ( as The New York Times put it ) as “ a futuristic vomitorium of bosoms and bullets . ”
As I will try to show , such a description is not in itself inaccurate — but it needs to be read as praise rather than opprobrium .
Gamer is science fiction .
This means , not just that the movie is set in the near future , in a world whose technology is extrapolated from our own , but also that it explores the futurity that is very much a part of our actual present — the potential for change that is inherent within our presentness .
Literally speaking , the movie takes place “ some years from this exact moment ” ( as an opening title tells us ) .
The world of the film is one in which the media — and especially the computer gaming environment — that we know today are taken to the next level .
In the movie ’s near - future extrapolation , spectacle , virtualization , and “ entertainment ” in general have been pushed to their logical extremes .
Everyone in the world , it seems , is addicted to MMORPGs ( massively multi- player online role - playing games ) .
But these games are themselves viscerally “ real , ” in a way that is not yet the case today .
The basic science - fictional ploy of the movie is to envision a form of gaming in which gamers control the actions , not of virtual avatars on a screen , but of real , physical , flesh - and - blood bodies : human “ actors . ”
In this way , Gamer combines , and updates , the two most prominent popular entertainment forms of the current decade : massively multiplayer online gaming , and reality television .
Conceptually , Gamer explores these forms of entertainment in order to think about freedom and enslavement in what Deleuze called the control society , or in a world that — as McKenzie Wark describes it — has become indistinguishable from gamespace .
There are two games that dominate the world of Gamer : Society and Slayer .
In both of these games , the human actors who actually perform the physical actions of the game have no free will .
Thanks to nano - implants , they no longer control their own bodies and motor actions .
Rather , they are forced to take orders from the gamers “ playing ” them .
Artificial nanocells are introduced into their brains ; these cells reproduce , replacing the original , organic nerve cells with synthetic ones .
Once you have undergone this procedure , you have an IP address in your head , and your body obeys whatever commands are transmitted to that address by the player who controls you .
You say what they say , and move the way that they want you to move .
Of course , this only works one way : actors ca n’t see or hear their controllers , but the controllers are able to live vicariously through them .
Society is a hilariously sleazy live version of Second Life or The Sims , with gamers guiding their actors through scenarios of drug consumption , partying and clubbing , and ( most of all ) down ‘ n ’ dirty sex .
Actors rollerskate through crowded plazas , crashing into one another ; or they grope one another in crowded dance clubs ; or they accost one another with corny pickup lines in bars .
The gamespace of Society is visually garish , with hypersaturated colors , and with raunchy costumes and lurid , tacky interior decorations that egregiously shriek out their own “ bad taste . ”
Our first view of Society ’s gamespace is hilariously set to the satirical song “ The Bad Touch ” by Bloodhound Gang ( “ You and me baby ai n’t nothin ’ but mammals /
So let ’s do it like they do on the Discovery Channel ” ) .
Gamer illustrates the relation between player and actor directly , by cutting back and forth between the “ actor ” Angie ( Amber Valletta ) and her controller ( Ramsey Moore ) .
Angie is ridiculously dressed in a white fur wrap , blue hot pants , pink platform boots , and an orange wig ; she is reduced , basically , to being a sexbot in the world of Society .
Her controller is a morbidly obese , wheelchair - bound man ; we usually see him in extreme facial closeup , sweating profusely , consuming munchies , and licking his slobbering lips as he moves her into one degrading situation after another .
Society is all about sex as spectacle ; but in reality , sex is subordinated to economics .
The financial structure of Society is simple , and brilliantly capitalist : you can either be a consumer by paying to play , or be a worker by being paid to be played .
As Vishnevetsky observes , Gamer is “ the sort of movie that imagines what the working class would have to do in its fantasy scenario ” — something that is left out of most transhumanist and “ exodus - to - the - virtual - world ” visions .
On the one hand , consumers get a pornographic experience that is still vicarious ( and therefore safe ) for them , but more “ real ” than any mere simulation could be .
On the other hand , the “ actors ” receive wages for what is the ne plus ultra of affective labor : the production , not of physical objects , but directly of moods , feelings , and experiences .
The sim - actor is not just selling the use of his or her “ labor - power ” for a certain number of hours ( as is the case in classical capitalism as described by Marx ) ; more than this , he or she is actually selling his or her “ life ” itself as a commodity .
Of course , such a “ biopolitical ” mode of exploitation ( which would seem to combine the worst aspects of slavery and of wage labor ) is increasingly the norm — as Hardt and Negri argue — in our contemporary world of post - Fordism , “ real subsumption , ” and immaterial or affective production .
Today , profits are extracted from the whole texture of our lives , not just from the labor we perform during specific hours in a factory or an office .
Behind both the consumer / player and the actor / slave , there is the billionaire software genius who created , and who owns , Society ( more about him below ) .
He not only makes immense profits from user fees , but also acquires massive amounts of economically - valuable data through the technology ’s surveillance of everything that streams over the network , or that happens in the minds of the nano - implanted actors .
[ Just in passing : it is precisely because Gamer is an action - oriented exploitation flick , rather than one that expresses the psychological interiority of its characters , that it is able to provide us with something like a cognitive mapping of the contemporary world system .
The movie is somewhere between an allegory , and a concrete exemplification , of the way that , today , value is extracted from circulation ( especially media circulation ) as well as from direct production .
Indeed , we might say that value is even extracted , as well , from the moment of consumption itself .
In classical capitalism , consumption is the moment when value is destroyed , or when the object is extracted from the commodity chain because it is no longer being exchanged , but is instead actually put into use , and used up .
But in the world according to Gamer , this is no longer the case .
Even the player ’s most private and solitary jouissance — as he gets off on his living avatar ’s being penetrated , or as he is turned on as a result of witnessing a bloody murder right in front of her — is equivalent to a capture of energy , and of attention , that is monetizable by the company running the game .
When Hardt and Negri speak of “ immaterial labor , ” they mean that the commodity produced is immaterial , because it is a process , or an attribute of existence , a quality or an atmosphere , rather than a thing or a physical object .
But this is not to deny the materiality of the production process itself ; which is to say , the physical and mental labor ( the expense of time and energy ) that produces this immaterial result .
The material labor expended in immaterial production is aptly figured by that labor ( sexual and otherwise ) of the actors or bodies that are physically present in the world of the game , and compelled to perform the actions from which their players derive enjoyment . ]
For its part , Slayer is a real - time combat game .
Players decide where to move and when to shoot ; but the actors whom they control are physically present in the gamespace .
These actors use live weapons ; they really kill and get killed .
The gamespace of Slayer is rarely presented to us directly .
We see it , most often , as a video feed , in grimy , desaturated colors , shot with handheld cameras , with lots of vertiginous motion , odd , canted angles , swish pans , and jump cuts , often overlaid iwth a heads - up display .
From time to time , glitches disrupt the image , or interference patterns run across the screen .
This kind of camerawork emulates the overall look and feel of combat computer games , although the visual field is much more fragmented than is the case in such games , and there is no literal use of the first - person POV that one finds in many shooter games .
[ I am thinking here of Alexander Galloway ’s discussion of first - person shooters , which I commented upon here .
Galloway says that the first - person subjective shot works to increase involvement in games , whereas it is generally alienating in the cinema , because ( my paraphrase , repeating my blog entry on Galloway ) computer games involve active movement through space , whereas films are more about the passive contemplation of space .
According to Galloway , gamespace must be “ fully rendered , actionable space ” ( 63 ) ; the operator / player must be able to roam through this space at will ( as is never the case in film , where the camera angles and shots are all determined in advance ) .
This gamic sense of active space makes montage superfluous ( 64 ) , and instead demands full freedom of movement .
Now , it seems to me that Neveldine and Taylor complicate this opposition between games and movies , in the course of making a movie that directly emulates the experience of gaming .
The movie spectator has no first - person control of the action , so it would n’t work to emulate the first - person - POV computer graphics of a shooter game literally on the movie screen .
Games feel visceral because the player is directly involved in the action ; that is why games have to offer something like an organized Cartesian space for the player to move around in , and this space needs to be presented as continuous , rather than being cut up by montage .
But it is precisely by means of hyperbolic , hyperactive A.D.D - style montage that a film like Gamer avoids being contemplative , and instead communicate a sense of visceral involvement that is analogous to what games provide simply by virtue of the player ’s involvement .
That being said , it still seems to me ( though this would have to be verified by a more careful analysis ) that Neveldine / Taylor ’s combat sequences are far more coherent spatially than are , say , the action sequences in the films of Michael “ Fuck Continuity ” Bay .
But see my further comments on the cinematography and editing of Gamer , below ] .
Slayer is even more advanced than Society , as an exemplification of neoliberal logic .
The “ actors ” in Slayer are convicts on death row ; they are given the “ free choice ” of entering into combat as meat puppets controlled by gamers , instead of being immediately executed for their crimes .
If a Slayer character survives thirty rounds of combat , then he ( it is usually a “ he ” ) will be pardoned and freed .
Those convicted of lesser crimes may similarly “ choose ” to enter the combat zone as , in effect , NPCs ( non-player characters ) .
They are controlled , not by a gamer , but by simple computer routines ; they only need to survive one round of combat in order to be pardoned and freed .
Of course , no one ever actually manages to get their freedom this way .
NPCs are always picked off pretty quickly in the course of a round : John Leguizamo ’s character for instance , is programmed to be a janitor , so he keeps on sweeping the floor regardless of all the mayhem around him , until he is hit by a stray bullet .
But even the most skillful players / actors cannot really expect to survive a full thirty rounds .
The game is rigged .
( Its logic is somewhat reminiscent of that in Peter Watkins ’ prescient and chilling 1971 movie Punishment Park , where people convicted of political crimes are offered the opportunity to engage in a survivalist game in the desert , instead of doing hard time .
The difference is that , in Gamer , the convict ’s “ choice ” to take his / her chances in a game , instead of being punished directly , is revised in the direction of neoliberal management of life via privatized “ incentives ” , whereas it is linked directly to the repressive state apparatus in the earlier film .
The victims in Punishment Park do n‘t get to appear on TV ) .
The economic logic of Slayer also brilliantly exemplifies neoliberal governance .
Money is generated not just from the gamers who pay to control the killers , but also from the millions of pay - per- view subscribers who watch the combat live on TV or on the Web .
The film revels in its reaction shots of enormous crowds of yuppies , in cities around the world , watching Slayer unfold on enormous screens .
They cheer each spectacular display of violence , and react with baffled anger whenever something goes wrong with the feed .
( They feel entitled .
How dare mess with my enjoyment ? ) .
The money stream from Slayer not only leads to enormous profits for the billionaire software genius , but also subsidizes the entire , spiraling - out - of - control cost of the American prison system .
In an age of increasing prison privatization , this is more than satire .
America spends more on prisons than it does on universities ; the cost is financed by using prisoners as an “ industrial reserve army ” of virtual slave labor .
In the world of Gamer , incarceration with enforced labor and a high mortality rate seems to be the one alternative , for the working class , to selling their bodies on Society .
It makes perfect sense , ideologically as well as economically .
Punishment is submitted to the “ invisible hand ” of the market , just as neoliberal dogma demands , by combining harsh punishment with media spectacle .
Convicted criminals are deprived of all volition , and turned into meat puppets , precisely because they are held to be personally accountable for their crimes .
Society and Slayer are surrounded and reinforced by other forms of media ; in the world of Gamer , nothing is direct or “ unmediated , ” and nothing exists outside of the mediasphere .
For one thing , advertisements for the two games are everywhere in the “ real environment ” of the movie .
The movie begins — after the opening company credits , some video signal - zapping and the title text “ some years from this exact moment … ” — with computer - simulated images of urban scenes .
There are postmodern downtowns with skyscrapers , but also favelas and even ancient ruins .
Vehicular and foot traffic whizzes by in accelerated motion .
Quite wittily , these scenes are apparently cribbed from the movie Baraka ( Ron Fricke , 1992 ) , which drew contrasts between the peaceful rhythms of indigenous peoples at ostensibly home with the natural world , with the violent accelerations of life in the overdeveloped world .
[ Baraka is a film , according to its director , about “ humanity ’s relationship to the eternal ” ; it ’s a brilliant move by Neveldine and Taylor to hijack Fricke ’s hippie - new - age footage in order to depict a social order in which any supposed “ balance of life ” has been obliterated by consumerism , and nothing remains stable for more than a second ] .
The only constants in these opening shots are the things added to the source material by Neveldine and Taylor : enormous billboards and electronic signs advertising Society and Slayer ( or containing the names of Castle , the creator of the games , or Kable , their biggest star — I discuss both of these figures below ) .
The signage first appears , dreamily , reflected in a puddle of water ; then , hard - edged , aggressively pasted over every possible urban surface .
All the while , Marilyn Manson ’s cover of the Eurythmics song “ Sweet Dreams ( Are Made of This ) ” plays on the soundtrack ( “ Some of them want to abuse you / Some of them want to be abused … ” ) , reminding us of our status as either predators or prey in this updated - for - the - new - millennium version of Social Darwinism .
We have been warned .
In the world of Gamer , Society and Slayer are also the primary focus of television news broadcasts , which are ubiquitous in the film and which seem to have no other subject of interest .
In this way , the film ’s exposition is handled largely by infographics flashing across media screens .
The talkshow host Gina Parker Smith ( Kyra Sedgwick ) , who will apparently do anything in order to get a story , scores by arranging an exclusive interview with the billionaire software genius Ken Castle , inventor of the brain nanotechnology that makes the games work .
Castle , despite ( or rather because of ) his teasing reclusiveness , is a pure creature of media : the world ’s greatest celebrity as well as its richest man ( Society and Slayer have made him wealthier than Bill Gates ) .
Castle is played by Michael C. Hall , best known as the star of the Showtime TV series Dexter .
But whereas
Hall is introverted and tormented in Dexter , here he is extroverted and slimy .
A condescending , self - congratulatory smirk never leaves his face , not even when he is sucking on his trademark lollipop .
Castle clearly thinks that he is smarter than everybody else — and he revels in this fact .
He is slickly mediagenic and “ charming ” ( in a way that can only be described as if “ in quotation marks ” ) , like a sleazy lounge lizard who has suddenly realized all his most extravagant , megalomaniacal dreams , and can make anybody do whatever he wants ( both because of his money ; and literally , because of his technology ) .
His insinuating voice , with a slight , just - folks “ hillbilly ” twang , is a pure media manipulation effect — a performance with nothing whatsoever present behind it .
Castle ’s “ just - folks ” populism , and his steely contempt for his inferiors ( which pretty much means everybody apart from himself ) are two sides of the same coin .
In embodying the character of Castle , Hall pretty much steals every scene he ’s in — as the actors playing bad guys in genre pictures tend to do .
Castle is an extrapolation , if not directly of Bill Gates or Steve Jobs , then certainly of the nerd - turned - entrepreneur , control - freak billionaire type that they exemplify .
Indeed , Castle might well be described as the living personification of “ the new spirit of capitalism ” , with its emphasis upon flexibility , innovation , and entrepreneurial initiative , and upon networking rather than vertical command .
This new spirit places a hipster veneer upon what still ultimately remains a form of authoritarian management , in which networked manipulation works more effectively than a hierarchical chain of command ever did .
In other words , Castle is the “ human face ” of software - based capital , or of affective capital , in the society of control .
For this is precisely a form of governance , a regime of accumulation , that requires a “ human face , ” in order to exemplify its new managerial style .
In the 1960s , IBM was seen as the ultimate soulless corporation ; its bureaucratic computers were the negation of everything human .
Today , to the contrary , it ’s impossible to imagine Apple without Steve Jobs — his minimalist , perfectionist aesthetic , and his showmanship , are essential components of the personal computing , communicating , and entertainment devices that Apple sells .
Castle plays a similar role , as the face behind Society and Slayer .
Castle is the human face of the new capitalism , therefore .
Except for one thing : Castle himself is not quite human any longer .
We learn near the end of the film that he has turned himself into a cyborg , replacing 98 % of his own brain with his synthetic nanocells .
The difference between Castle and the “ actors ” in Society and Slayer , however , is that Castle ’s artificial nerve cells are able to transmit orders and exert control , whereas everyone else ’s nanocells are engineered only to receive orders and to compel obedience .
“ I think it , you do it , ” Castle says .
With his nanotech , he is able to make people “ buy what I want them to buy , vote how I tell them to vote , do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do ” — without their even being aware of it .
The control of other peoples ’ minds and bodies in gamespace is only a prelude to , or a test run fo , r the control of other peoples ’ minds and bodies in all other areas of life as well .
Gaming — like other media forms and aesthetic forms before it — is a kind of cutting - edge space in which to experimentally implement , and to explore in advance , the social arrangements ( of power and resistance , or of capital accumulation and of the friction that interferes with that accumulation ) that are subsequently deployed throughout all of society .
[ Today we can say of gaming what Jacques Attali said of music : “ its styles and economic organization are ahead of the rest of society because it explores , much faster than material reality can , the entire range of possibilities in a given code .
It makes audible the new world that will gradually become visible , that will impose itself and regulate the order of things . ” ]
Gamer has been criticized by some reviewers and bloggers because — in quintessential genre fashion — it shifts attention away from the system and to just one evil individual ; thus implying that taking that individual down is enough to liberate everyone .
I this way , the movie would be guilty of leaving the system itself intact .
But I think that such a reading is itself too simple : it ignores the way that the figure of Castle precisely embodies and condenses the “ system itself ” , that is to say , the whole regime of flexible accumulation ( or of what I might prefer to call expropriation with a smirk , or a smile ) .
One way that today ’s media “ personalities ” differ from nineteenth - century fictional characters , or from twentieth - century selves with interiority , is that media personalities today function so directly as personifications , or embodiments , of impersonal , impalpable , and unrepresentable forces .
Indeed , this is not anything really new .
It is what Marx already said about capitalists in his own time : that they were not real individuals , but personifications of capital .
But such a situation of possessionand personificationis far more widespread today than it was in Marx ’s own time .
Where the nineteenth century , in both its fictions and its social life , generally presented characters with Lukacsian typicality ( and this is the form of fictional character that most Marxist cultural critics , trapped in their own nostalgia , still tend to prefer ) , and the twentieth century emphasized depth psychology and interiority , the twenty - first century rather presents “ personalities ” as shells within which social forces are ( temporarily ) contained , or as screens and interfaces through which these forces exert themselves upon , and affect , the world .
Castle ’s brain interface is a way of embedding commodity relations directly in the flesh ; and he himself isthe cybernetic , neoliberal regime of control and accumulation , embedded directly in the flesh .
Just as , according to Deleuze and Guattari , philosophers must develop “ conceptual personae ” in order to dramatize , and thereby fully work out , their ideas , so capital today must generate entrepreneurial personae in order to fully realize the accumulation of capital at which it aims .
In this sense , the genre tendency to personify social forces in individual figures is a necessary procedure ; and a genre film like Gamer is accurate to condense its social commentary into such figures . ]
In terms of its narrative , Gamer is entirely a genre film : everything that happens in the course of the plot is something that we have seen before , and that we have come to expect from other movies .
Specifically , Gamer could be described as a combination of Running Man , Escape From New York , and The Matrix .
The movie presents an oppressive virtual reality , within which an ultra-macho protagonist has to fight his way out of a situation in which everything has been rigged against him .
The working - out of this plot is entirely formulaic and as - expected , up to and including the requisite happy ending and triumph of the macho figure .
However , the movie ’s adherence to these genre norms is so perfunctory as almost to be sarcastic .
The macho action protagonist , Kable , is played by action star Gerard Butler ( best known for his starring role as Leonidas in 300 ) .
But in Gamer , Kable is sketched out so minimally that Butler can barely be bothered to go through the motions required for the part ; he is so inexpressive as to make Clint Eastwood look like a wild overactor in comparison .
( Or perhaps I should say , to make Jean - Claude Van Damme look like a miracle of thespian subtlety in comparison ; except that we now know that Van Damme really is such a miracle ) .
Gamer ‘s adherence to genre norms , both in terms of the plot and in terms of the requisite displays of jiggling breasts , loud explosions , and hyped up macho insults ( such as those that one crazed killer — who of course is black — addresses to the white Kable at one point ) , seem to be little more than a framework upon which Neveldine and Taylor are able to hang their delirious inventions .
Or better , it is as if the film ’s genre normativity ( in terms of plot , character , gender , etc. ) expresses and exposes the way that neoliberal ideology explicitly forecloses any possibility of social change .
As the neoliberal mantra puts it , “ There Is No Alternative ” ; any alteration of social arrangements is literally unthinkable .
Gamer ’s strict adherence to genre norms is its way of deliberately figuring ( and thereby calling our attention to ) this foreclosure .
[ This is the reason why “ science fiction ” has today come to be pretty much the equivalent of social realism .
In one sense , the most intense aspect of our lives today is our sense of futurity , of continual innovation and continual product turnover ; and yet this futurity has no other content than “ more of the same ” ( or of what Ernst Bloch called “ sheer aimless infinity and incessant changeability … a merely endless , contentless zigzag “ ) .
Thus , we are always being urged to upgrade our computers , which fall quickly into obsolescence through the force of Moore ’s Law ; we are always looking for the next fad , the next cool thing , to such an extent that all fads and fashions seem to exist simultaneously .
This urgency without change , or novelty without difference , is an expression of the commercial product cycle that dominates all aspects of our lives ; it is the equivalent , on the level of content , of genre - conformity , as an expression of the claim that “ There Is No Alternative ” , on the level of form .
As with every other aspect of its production , the strategy of Gamer in this regard is not to offer a critique , but to embody the situation so enthusiastically , and absolutely , as to push it to the point of absurdity . ]
Kable has been framed for murder — actually , he was forced by Castle to kill his best friend , in an early test of the nano - powered mind control — and now he is imprisoned , and a player in Slayer .
He is n’t aware of this in his confinement , but he has become an international media star — almost as famous as Castle himself — because he has survived so many battles , coming closer than anybody else to “ winning ” the game and getting his pardon and release .
And so , of course , in traditional genre movie fashion , we the audience of the movie find ourselves rooting for him , and we even “ identify ” with him .
Â
But this attitude is itself figured within the movie , since it is the very condition of celebrity that the movie dramatizes .
If we are rooting for Kable , we are doing this together with just about everyone ( aside from Castle and his flunkies ) within the world of the movie .
However , what it means to “ identify ” with the protagonist of a movie is definitely in need of redefinition here .
After all , within the diegesis of Gamer , Kable is not an autonomous agent â€ “ - just as characters in fictional movies are not autonomous agents .
When Kable is fighting in Slayer , he is in fact being “ run ” by 17 - year - old Simon ( Logan Lerman ) , a narcissistically self - involved player whose every gesture expresses his affluent , privileged background .
Simon can pretty much do whatever he wants ; but evidently , this is only the case because his ( unseen ) father has paid for his high - tech gaming room , as well as for his Slayer account .
( So much for Oedipus ; the world of Gamer is one in which Deleuze and Guattari ’s anti-Oedipal vision has become the norm ) .
Simon himself has gotten a certain degree of Web celebrity , thanks to his skillful and successful “ playing ” of Kable ; even though it ’s Kable whose body is placed at risk , and whose charisma during videocasts of “ Slayer ” is what really appeals to the viewers .
In between Slayer sessions , Simon munches on peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwiches , as he lies around in his 360 - degree media room .
He casually enters into video - chat conversations with girls who flash their tits at him , or otherwise proposition him over the Web ; and he buys heavy - duty assault weaponry online ( rejecting anything that strikes him as too “ gay ” ) .
The film ’s portrait of Simon is counterpointed with its portrait of the unnamed gamer who plays Amber in Society .
But where that player is linked with Amber by means of cutting from one to the other , Simon ’s relation to Kable is expressed by shots in which Simon appears within the combat action right alongside Kable ; we see Kable ’s moves miming Simon ’s own gaming gestures .
This synchronization creates a sort of dance effect ( which is picked up later in the movie , as I discuss below ) .
In addition , as the film goes on , the relation between Kable and Simon is changed .
Rebel hackers make it possible for the conversation between Kable and Simon to work both ways , so that Kable can talk to Simon , and hear back from him , rather than just taking implicit orders from him .
Eventually , Simon is reluctantly persuaded to set Kable free from control , so that he can act in the game for himself ; at this point , Simon is reduced to the role of a passive spectator , somebody who ( like us ) is simply along for the ride .
All in all , the play of identification and distance in the film is immensely complicated .
We need to triangulate between our own attitude towards Kable , our own attitude towards Simon , the attitudes of audiences in the diegesis towards both Kable and Simon , and the changing relationship between Kable and Simon themselves .
In this way , Gamer negotiates between the cinematic media regime , and the post - cinematic one centered on computer games .
I have already mentioned that Gamer is set “ some years from this exact moment . ”
This phrase is apt , and indeed precise , because of the way it envisions futurity as a heightened present .
The movie ’s ever - so - slight extrapolation from the real world of 2009 is to posit the future as involving an even greater heightening of real - time immediacy , of the “ here and now ” , than we in fact experience today .
That is to say , Gamer is hyperbolically actualist , or presentist .
It takes place , not so much over a span of time , as in a series of “ exact moments , ” of hypermediated , heightened and intensified Nows .
Each sequence of the film is a thin sliver of pure present , without any thickness of duration .
Retentions and protensions are reduced to the bare minimum ; memories and desires only exist in an extremely compressed and foreshortened way .
Bergson would say that here the past subsists only in its most “ contracted ” form .
In the world of Gamer , memory is so flattened and reduced as to be drained of all emotional resonance .
It only exists as so much computer data , accessible more easily by security forces and large corporations than it is by ourselves .
This condition is literalized at one point in the film , when the rebel hackers hook up Kable to a computer , so that his blocked traumatic memories — of the murder Castle forced him to commit , and about which he explicitly affirms that he does n’t have anything to say — can be played back to onlookers in the form of a surveillance video .
Is there any better figuration for the ways in which the obsessive storing and cataloging of personal memories — through computer archives of photos and videos , lifeblogs , and other such prosthetic devices — is inseparable from a certain commodification ( or “ alienation , ” in the strict Marxist sense rather than the looser existential one ) of the past , and of our “ mental privacy ” itself ?
As for desire — or even simple anticipation of the future — it is entirely instrumentalized in Gamer , and reduced to a question of mere technique .
Kable ’s actual name is Tillman : but his name has been changed , against his will , to a flashy tag for media - publicity purposes .
Shut up in solitary most of the time , he is entirely unaware of being a worldwide media celebrity .
In the real - time combat game setting of Slayer , as he struggles to make it through a round of play , all he can afford to feel ( let alone think about ) is how to avoid the dangers of the next thirty seconds or so .
Where can I hide ?
In which direction should I shoot ?
Can I get my controller to turn me around when I need to ?
The only desire at work here is the one to survive ; the only anticipations are those required for immediate short - term planning .
Any further temporal horizon is unthinkable .
Tillman tries to remember his wife ( Angie , whom we have met in Society ) , and their daughter , from whom he has been separated as a result of his arrest .
We are reminded , again and again , that his hope of rejoining them is the only thing that keeps him going .
“ I am always there for you ” is even tattooed on his arm .
And yet he can barely call his wife ’s and daughter ’s images to mind .
He does n’t even have a picture of them , until one is surreptitiously passed to him .
Memory and anticipation are both exceedingly weak , when compared to his real - time situation of confinement and battle .
Either we see Kable fighting for his life ; or else he is sitting blankly adrift in the white - out of the dazzlingly sun-lit desert , or trapped in the confines of his dark and narrow cell .
In none of these situations is there any opportunity for wide - ranging reflection , or for expansion beyond the confines of the immediate present .
The “ presentism ” or “ actualism ” recorded and embodied by Gamer — together with its consequent instrumentalism — of course results from the media glut that we already experience on a daily basis .
Our social life is so overpacked and overstimulated and hypermediated , that we can only feel it in the immediate instant .
( Indeed â€ “ as Richard Grusin and Jay David Bolter argue — the spacetime parameters of our contemporary social life are defined by the play between hypermediation and immediacy ) .
The affective tone of the movie ( and indeed , of the “ real world ” ) is that of a society - wide attention deficit disorder ( the “ A.D.D. ” that Neveldine / Taylor attribute to themselves ) .
The past and future are hazy , because they seem utterly out of reach .
Futurity , no less than pastness , is brutally compressed and foreshortened .
As it is for Tillman , so it is for all of us .
Too much is going on Right Here , Right Now , for us to be able to focus on anything from Before or After .
However , it is important to notice that the system of “ communicative capitalism ” , which confines us today , is not totalizing or seamless .
There are always glitches , loopholes , and exceptions .
And Gamer takes particular account of these moments of incompletion and interruption .
Indeed , its genre plot would be impossible without them ( since then Tillman would not be capable of confronting Castle and overthrowing him ) .
Within the world of Gamer , people are always concerned about the “ ping ” â€ “ the delay of several hundred milliseconds , even under the best of circumstances , between the moment that a command is given by a player , and the moment that the command is actually executed by the actor .
Kable remarks that it is still his own hand which pulls the trigger , even if he has no say in the decision as to when to shoot , and in which direction .
In the context of real - time combat , such as occurs in Slayer , half a second might well make the difference between surviving and getting killed .
Indeed , Castle plans to eliminate Kable by introducing a player into the game who is faster than Kable because he is not controlled , but acts on his own initiative ( and who is sufficiently psychopathic that he will like nothing better than to kill Kable ) .
In addition to the ping , there is always also the possibility of network failure or interference .
This is what allows the Humanz , an underground hacker group ( whose leader is played by the rapper Ludacris ) , to intervene in network transmissions .
At various points throughout the movie , they interrupt news broadcasts , commandeer Â the screens on which Slayer is playing , or cause Society to crash and go offline for a while .
The Humanz try to spread the message that Castle ’s system is oppressive and a threat to freedom .
They also negotiate Kable ’s freedom from his controller Simon , and eventually engineer his escape from prison and from the world of Slayer .
But the most important thing about the Humanz is the way that their own technology is incomplete and ad hoc .
They cannot destroy Castle ’s control system , but only circumvent it temporarily by in effect parasitizing it , using its own techniques against it .
They have little influence upon Kable / Tillman ’s final encounter with Castle ; all they can do is broadcast this confrontation to a worldwide public , which still values Kable ’s media stardom .
That is to say , there is no going back on the network and its circuits of celebrity and control , and reverting to a supposedly clearer and more honest state of affairs .
The only way out is the way through .
The only possible oppositional strategy is one of embracing these control technologies , generalizing them , and opening them up .
This is the very strategy that Neveldine and Taylor adopt in Gamer , by fully embracing the very logic of entertainment and involvement that they are satirizing , and making an â€œexploitationâ€  film whose hope is to draw audiences in , rather than â€œalienatingâ€ them .
In the twenty - first century , cognitive estrangement does n’t work any more as a subversive strategy ( if it ever did ) ; what ’s needed is rather a strategy that ups the ante on our very complicity with the technologies and social arrangements that oppress us .
In all of this , I still have n’t mentioned what really makes Gamer work : which is how the “ look and feel ” of the movie resonates with its generic and technological content .
Gamer comes from a place where art film meets pornography - of - violence sleaze , and pretty much everything in between these extremes just drops out .
As an “ exploitation ” film , Gamer embraces the logic of control and of gamespace , which is also the dominant logic of entertainment programming today ( as Sebastian Franklin puts it , “ a composite of film editing and computer programming is the emblematic cultural mode of the present day ” ) .
Gamer embodies and instantiates this composite logic , and turns it against the audience .
The film is crass and satirical , and it disclaims any sort of high - minded critique ; in this way , Neveldine and Taylor are beyond cynicism .
Their exploitation strategy disables in advance any critical scrutiny — but by that very fact it also disables any sort of ideological appropriation .
That is to say , Gamer does n’t just describe the situation of neoliberalism ’s “ world of entertainment ” ; rather ( or in addition ) it fully embodies this situation , with a sort of gleeful reveling in its crass excesses .
There is something at work here , which all our theoretical language of critique , and negativity , and ideology , and so on , is utterly unable to describe .
I want to say that in some very deep sense , Gamer exposes what Adorno might call the “ truth ” of neoliberal society , or what Zizek might call the “ obscene underside ” of consumerist enjoyment ; and indeed , it also exposes the basic exploitation of labor , driven by the imperatives of capital accumulation , that orthodox Marxists would ( rightly ) say lies behind these ideological and affective processes .
But it does all this without “ estranging ” us from the spectacle it offers us in any way , and without establishing any sort of critique or moral condemnation .
Gamer , like many important works of recent years , is doing something that does not fit into the languages of critique and negativity that we have inherited from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries .
No recourse to Brecht , or the Dadaists and the Surrealists , or the Situationists , etc. , etc. , is of any use to us in understanding what ’s going on here .
And yet the gesture of a film like Gamer needs to be distinguished , in some sort of way , from the gestures of ( say ) Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen .
This has something to do with the way that Gamer takes the premises animating Transformers ( which are the dominant premises of the society we live in ) more seriously and more literally than Transformers itself does — and thereby it “ unmasks ” the hypocrisy and stupidity of Transformers .
But my language here ( or my recourse to Zizek ’s notion of “ overidentification ” ) is still too crude and imprecise .
It is inadequate to account for what is actually going on .
Let me try to put this another way .
Gamer certainly has all the explosions and gratuitous sex and gratuitous violence that any viewer might want — the “ bosoms and bullets ” that the reviewer for The New York Times so deplored .
Neveldine / Taylor ’s film is the bastard child of first - person shooters and Grand Theft Auto , as well as of the movies of Jerry Bruckheimer , Tony Scott , and Michael Bay .
It exists in the same moral universe that these games and films do ( which is to say , the moral universe that we are condemned to live in , like it or not ) .
Not only is there lots of violence and sex , but often the violence and sex are played for cheap laughs and sight gags .
For instance , at one point in a Slayer session , Kable rescues a woman in a hijab from certain death , by pushing her away from a spot where a bomb is about to land and detonate .
However , just a moment later , the woman wanders back into the street , and is immediately flattened by an oncoming truck .
Kable ( or rather , Simon playing Kable ) mutters something on the order of “ at least I tried ” , and then turns back to the combat at hand .
This is clearly played for lulz , as they say on the Internets ; and it arises out of the same cynicism that Bruckheimer , Bay , et al. always display in abundance .
But there is something about the purity and extremity of Neveldine and Taylor ’s cynicism that distinguishes it from the attitudes of Bruckheimer and Bay , who in contrast might be said to lack even the courage of their cynical ( non -) convictions .
The excessiveness of Neveldine / Taylor ’s attitude is what accounts , both for the way that I am claiming some sort of a “ critical ” ( though that is not the right word , and should probably be put , in the Derrida manner , “ under erasure ” ) edge for Gamer , and for Gamer ‘s aesthetic cogency in contrast to the bloat and tedium of , say , the Transformers movies .
Neveldine and Taylor gleefully emulate the worst excesses of Tony Scott and Michael Bay , except that they provide us with a brutally compressed , miniaturized version of everything that is overblown and grandiose in the work of such high - budget filmmakers .
Any ten minutes of Gamer is equivalent to an entire three hours of Transformers ( with the added bonus that we are spared the irritation of having to endure the screen presence of Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox , embodying straight white male teenagers ’ narcissistic and sexual fantasies respectively ) .
[ All this needs to be argued on the level of cinematic form — though I lack both the patience and the skill that would be needed to perform a David Bordwell - like quantitative analysis of how cinematography and editing work in Gamer .
But even a quick look shows how extreme Gamer is , in its embrace of ( and even excess over ) what Bordwell calls “ intensified continuity ” : the post -1960s visual style in American ( and some other ) films that involves “ more rapid editing … bipolar extremes of lens lengths … more close framings in dialogue scenes … [ and ] a free - ranging camera . ”
Bordwell claims that , with intensified continuity , “ we are still dealing with a variant of classical filmmaking ” in continuity with aesthetic practices codified by Hollywood in the 1920s at the latest .
In effect , Bordwell denies that the New Hollywood of the 1970s is really all that different , in its aesthetic values , from the Hollywood of the studio era .
And yet , when it comes to more recent ( post - 1990 ) filmmaking , Bordwell , like so many cineastes , has come toÂ deplore the way that “ the clarity and grace of motion seen in classic Westerns and comedies , in the work of Keaton and Lloyd and Ford and Don Siegel and Anthony Mann , gave way to spasmodic fights and geographically challenged chases .
At first , the chief perpetrators were Roger Spottiswoode and Michael Bay .
Now itâ€™s nearly everybody , and journalistic critics have recognized that this lumpy style has become the norm ” ( see also here ) .
I ’m inclined to think that we have recently passed a threshold .
At some point , “ intensified continuity ” jumped the shark , leading to a new stylistic norm in which “ Hollywood action scenes became ‘ impressionistic , ’ rendering a combat or pursuit as a blurred confusion .
We got a flurry of cuts calibrated not in relation to each other or to the action , but instead suggesting a vast busyness .
Here camerawork and editing didnâ€™t serve the specificity of the action but overwhelmed , even buried it ” ( Bordwell again ) .
What Bordwell implies , but ca n’t quite bring himself to say , is that — when it is pushed to this absurd point — the hyperbolic “ intensified continuity ” of the new century does indeed mark a radical change in aesthetic regimes , even if 1970s Hollywood did n’t .
Today , Michael Bay is the new D. W. Griffith ( or the anti-Griffith ) .
In adopting these new post - continuity stylistics , and pushing them to the max , Neveldine and Taylor are suggestive as to what the new aesthetic regime might mean . ]
In any case , Gamer offers us a continual cinematic barrage , with no respite .
It is filled with shots from handheld cameras , lurching camera movements , extreme angles , violent jump cuts , cutting so rapid as to induce vertigo , extreme closeups , a deliberately ugly color palette , video glitches , and so on .
The combat scenes in Slayer , in particular , are edited behavioristically more than spatially .
That is to say , the frequent cuts and jolting shifts of angle have less to do with orienting us towards action in space , than with setting off autonomic responses in the viewer .
But even in non-action sequences , Neveldine and Taylor usually avoid traditional continuity - based setups .
Consider , for instance , the scene , in an early part of the film , where Freek ( John Leguizamo ’s character ) talks to a silent Kable .
We do not see all of the actors ’ faces , but only extreme closeups in which portions of the actors ’ faces nearly fill the screen .
There ’s an alternation between shots concentrating on Freek , and those that show him talking , still in tight close - up , behind Kable ’s face in profile .
In these latter shots , there are even rack - focus shifts from Freek ’s face to Kable ’s , so that we end up with Kable ’s face focused but in shadow , while behind it Freek ’s face is front - facing but blurry .
All this is intercut with blurry , soft - focus flashbacks to Kable ’s memory of his wife and child , and then with a hard - edged flashback to the murder of Kable ’s friend ( played in reverse , and without Kable appearing in the image as the triggerman ) .
It is only at the end of this sequence that we get an establishing shot of Kable and Freek sitting at the base of an enormous concrete structure in the desert ( taken in such extreme long shot that the figures of Kable and Freek are quite tiny ) .
This kind of presentation , even in a non-action scene , makes it hard for us even to ground or locate the speakers can be located or grounded in relation to their spatial context .
[ I am looking forward to Sebastian Franklin ’s forthcoming publication of his work on what he calls “ executive editing ” , which should help to clarify what is going on here .
Bordwell is useful for explaining stylistic details , but he seems to me to be off the mark when he states that , in classical fight sequences , “ the stylistic orchestration of the fight trips off optical , auditory , and muscular responses in our bodies , while the pauses give the movement a chance to echo ” ; whereas , in action editing post - Michael Bay , we get instead “ a vague busyness , a sense that something really frantic but imprecise is happening . ”
Bordwell , as a cognitivist , insists on reading the beautiful orchestration of motion through space and time in classical fight sequences as something that stimulates the human sensori - motor system in a certain way .
But the real point is , that these classical scenes ’ articulations of time and space establish an ontological consistency which goes beyond mere sensori - motor stimulation .
( Deleuze is getting at something like this when he writes of the gap or suspension between stimulus and response that is the point of articulation in movement - image films , and that grows to encompass the entire cinematic universe in time - image films ) .
Whereas intensified continuity ( or what I would see , in films of the last decade or so as post - continuity ) is precisely that sort of filmmaking that abandons the ontology of time and space , and the articulation of bodies in relation to this , in order to instead set up rhythms of immediate stimulation and manipulation — the shots , and the way that they are edited , have only to do with their immediate visceral effect on the audience moment to moment , with no concern for any sort of pattern extending further in space and time .
In other words , it is Michael Bay ’s cinematic practice that really conforms to Bordwell ’s cognitivist view of the essence of cinema , despite the fact that Bordwell deplores this practice .
While the practice that Bordwell ( rightly ) celebrates for its cinematic mastery absolutely resists being understood in Bordwell ’s reductionistic terms ] .
In other words , Gamer exemplifies a regime of vision , and of narration , that is quite distant from older Hollywood norms .
This regime implies , in a certain sense , a heightened reflexivity : as Bordwell says of intensified continuity , “ gestures which earlier filmmakers would have considered flagrantly self - conscious … have become default values in ordinary scenes and minor movies ” ; and yet , even as “ stylistic tactics … come forward , ” nonetheless “ viewers remain in the grip of the action , ” instead of being “ alienated ” from it or made aware of its constructedness .
Or , to put the point a little more straightforwardly : as Bruce Reid puts it , Michael Bay ’s movies ” not only flaunt every reasonable expectation of believability and internal consistency , they make no sense .
Edits seem random , every rule of film grammar is tossed out the window , and the headlong rush of movement forward is all . ”
Such a sort of filmmaking should n’t work ; and yet it does , as Bay ’s high box office grosses prove .
But what Gamer gives us — as I was trying to suggest above with my comparison between it and the Transformers films — is a version of what I am calling post - continuity that is as expressive as it is compressed and foreshortened .
This is because Neveldine / Taylor directly envision ( as Bay does not ) the politico - economic regime of control to which this sort of aesthetics corresponds ( which it expresses , or resonates with ) .
Doubtless this can partly be attributed to Neveldine / Taylor ’s low budget and guerrilla - filmmaking tactics ( like their use of the RED digital camera system described here ) .
But it is also evident in the ways Neveldine / Taylor continually vary the stylistics of the film , depending on the expressive requirements of each scene .
For instance , there is one sequence in the film which ( in contrast to the scene I described above ) does adhere to an entirely classical shot - reverse shot pattern .
This is the scene in which Angie speaks to a male social - work bureaucrat , attempting to regain custody of her and Tillman ’s child .
The bureaucrat sits at a desk in the middle of an absurdly large and empty room .
There are long shots , at the beginning and end of the sequence , of Angie walking towards this desk , and then walking away ( with the click of her heels on the floor highly amplified ) .
In between , we get an alternation , following the rhythm of the conversation , of the two speakers ( each of whom is shot , by the textbook , either in head - and - shoulders medium closeups , or in head - and - torso shots over the shoulder of the other speaker ) .
Of course , the conversation goes nowhere ;
Angie is quite anguished ; while the bureaucrat wavers back and forth between maintaining a “ professional ” demeanor as he refuses Angie ’s request , and letting his obvious contempt for her ( as a Society stand - in , and as the wife of a convicted killer ) shine through .
At one point , he even bursts into “ inappropriate ” laughter , then quickly controls himself again .
Because of the way the sequence is shot , and how it differs from everything else in the movie , the futility of making a human appeal to a bureaucrat , or of appealing to the instituted power system for any sort of justice at all , is equated with the futility and emptiness of the shot - reverse shot convention itself .
Shot - reverse shot is nothing more than a formalist cliche ; it implies a human reciprocity that does not exist in the commodified , mediatized world of the movie ( and that also no longer exists in the world we live in ) .
This is just one example ; but throughout the movie , the use of both textbook cinematic techniques and forms , and of the more extreme ( and post - cinematic , video - inflected ) techniques and forms that more recently have gained commercial currency , is always calibrated with a reflection on ( or perhaps I should rather say , a demonstration of ) the ways that these forms and techniques express and embody and instantiate different types of social interactions and relations .
I could also mention the absurdist action sequence , where Kable / Tillman escapes from prison , and from the Slayer gamespace , by first drinking down an entire bottle of vodka , then puking and pissing into the gas tank of an “ ethanol only ” truck , in order literally to fuel his escape .
We see closeups of Kable , shots of Simon composited into the gamespace , and even a shot from the interior of the gas tank , as it receives Kable ’s alcohol - laden puke .
Embodiment , flow , the human - virtual interface , and the human - machine interface are all yoked violently together in the course of a short montage sequence .
In little more than a minute of screen time , Neveldine / Taylor demonstrate how and why all those discussions ( which we were all so engaged in , in the 1990s ) about cyberculture and disembodiment are obsolete — even as they also implicitly propose a scatalogical / micturitional psychokinetics to replace it .
Vomitorium indeed …
And this leads us into the concluding sequences of the movie , in which Kable / Tillman finally triumphs over Castle .
I ca n’t really describe these sequences any better than Vishnevetsky , who evokes “ the chiaroscuro of the mansion scene , which puts more or less everyone who ’s ever cited Jacques Tourneur as an influence to shame … the scene [ then ] transforms , over the course of a few minutes , into a song - and - dance number and then a fight ( but of course the musical is the ancestor of the action movie ) , then a bit of sci - fi special effects and finally a confrontation on a basketball court . ”
These sequences all take place in Castle ’s castle ( as it were ) , his mansion which is a cross between a high - tech wonderland ( that even Michael Jackson might have envied ) , and a fortified bunker .
The continually - changing chiaroscuro lighting , instead of concealing a woman - transformed - into - a - panther , prepares Tillman for , and sets off , a vision of his missing daughter , whom it turns out has been kidnapped by Castle : Tillman thinks that she is really there , but it ’s only a 3D laser projection ( of “ pornographic ” image quality , Castle says ) .
Tillman then fights off Castle ’s goons , and knocks them out one at a time , as they dance in lockstep to Sammy Davis Jr. ’s version of “ I ’ve Got You Under My Skin , ” lip - synced by Castle .
In the final confrontation , Castle tries to force Tillman , through nanocell control , to kill his own daughter with a knife .
Tillman resists , and asserts his freedom by finally turning the knife on Castle himself .
Only this is n’t really a victory for free will over conditioning , since we see via montage that Tillman is only able to do this because Simon has come online to control him as well .
Is “ freedom ” anything more than the decision between alternative , battling compulsions whose source is elsewhere ?
This is not the only moment in the film when Neveldine / Taylor ’s SF extrapolation touches on the dilemmas of contemporary neuroscience .
Gamer fulfills all genre expectations , even up to the defeat of the bad guys and ( apparent ) liberation of the world from post -Fordist mechanisms of control .
At the same time , Neveldine / Taylor do n’t exactly leave us with exalted hopes .
What they do accomplish , is to map out for us the system of audiovisual entertainment that one major facet of the control society within which we increasingly find ourselves enmeshed today .
They do n’t “ critique ” this control society — if anything , they gleefully embrace it .
But they offer us something that is arguably better than critique : they provide a kind of map ( both cognitive and affective ) of contemporary entertainment / gamespace , pointing up its extensiveness , its affordances , its limitations , and the degree of our unavoidable complicity within it .
[ Most serious film critics ( the ones I respect , at least ) tend to prefer “ small , modest , humane , novelistic movies ” that go against the entertainment and publicity tide ; or else , they cling to “ contemplative cinema ” , the long - take , long - shot , sparse - dialogue style that has become a staple of the international festival - and - art - house circuit .
Now , I admire the beautiful films of Bela Tarr and Tsai Ming - liang as much as anybody ; and I am moved by the humane , heartbreaking , neo- neorealist political vision of films like Kelly Reichardt ’s Wendy and Lucy and Ramin Bahrani ’s Chop Shop as well .
But I think that there also needs to be a space for critics and theorists to come to terms with films like Gamer , that are fast , cheap , out of control , and knowingly exploitative .
Such films are , in their own cheerfully perverse way , in touch with the urgencies of the moment , and with the social Real , in a way that contemplative cinema and modest , humanist cinema are not .
These films have their own aesthetic merits , which should not be overlooked out of cine - nostalgia . ]
In 2007 , outside Bangalore , India , an explosion decapitated an industrial worker , hurling his body through a brick wall .
In 2005 a routine procedure at a manufacturing plant in Taiwan caused a spontaneous explosion that killed a worker and ignited a blaze that ripped through the factory , shutting down production for three months .
Both incidents shared a common cause — silane , a gas made up of silicon and hydrogen that explodes on contact with air .
And both incidents occurred in the same industry — solar power .
Among other environmental black marks , the process of manufacturing photovoltaic ( PV ) cells from silicon relies on this dangerous pyrophoric gas .
As the industry gears up to meet growing demand — 6.4 gigawatts of new photovoltaic installations were built worldwide in 2009 according to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association , the bulk of it silicon solar cells — what are the human health and environmental concerns related to solar power ?
Of course , silane is hardly the only environmental hazard involved in solar cell production .
Others include : toxic by - products from polysilicon manufacture dumped indiscriminately in China ; air pollution spewed from coal - fired power plants that provide the electricity needed to produce photovoltaics ; and recovering cadmium , a known human carcinogen that is a primary ingredient in some thin - film solar cells , from mining slimes .
Still , only silane ( SiH4 ) has been linked directly to any deaths as a result of the solar industry .
" Of all the toxic or reactive molecules that [ solar ] industry uses , silane has been involved in 10 fatalities in the last 20 years .
All the others put together , it 's been zero , " says retired chemical engineer Eugene Ngai , president of a specialty gas safety consultancy and a silane expert .
" Where I have a concern is in the photovoltaic industry … .
PV could be in a light industry zone , it could be close to residential areas . "
Yet , the gas is essential — despite its dangers , silane remains the best way to deliver silicon molecules to a surface , because at high temperatures ( above 400 degrees Celsius ) it breaks into silicon and hydrogen .
" We just burn off the hydrogen , like a gas flare , " says Subhendu Guha , chairman of PV maker Uni-Solar .
That means it is ubiquitous , as well .
In addition to the photovoltaic industry , makers of flat - panel displays , semiconductors , even coated glass , all employ silane and all have struggled with the safety issues surrounding the compound .
But it is the rapidly growing manufacture of solar cells that is driving increased production these days ; hundreds of new facilities to manufacture photovoltaic cells have opened around the world in the past five years .
" Practically every silicon photovoltaic company has silane in some form or other , " notes Ajeet Rohatgi , director of photovoltaics research at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
" Without it , you would n't get high efficiency … .
It 's one of those things you can't live without . "
That 's because the gas can be used to make several of the layers in a silicon photovoltaic — from the top of the cell where it is used to deposit a layer of silicon nitride that ensures that all sunlight is absorbed , to the bottom where it can be used to deposit another layer that helps reflect back any missed photons of sunlight , boosting the efficiency of the cell at converting light into electricity .
" You 've found a mirror that reflects light back into the cell and gives light a second pass , " Rohatgi says .
" That back layer is very critical to get thinner wafers [ of silicon ] and better back surface reflectivity and , thus , lower cost and higher efficiency . "
That critical factor means tractor–trailers traverse U.S. highways transporting tanks of silane as well as cargo ships laden with canisters of the gas cross the Pacific to factories in Asia , particularly China .
It also means that a vast industrial structure in rural Washington State churns out solar - grade silicon , with silane as a by - product — plagued by shutdowns due to issues with the pyrophoric gas .
A few thousand tons of SiH4 are produced annually worldwide , a number that will swell in the future as more and more microelectronics , flat panels and silicon photovoltaics are produced .
Decreasing the thickness of the silicon layers — one answer to the cost challenge in photovoltaics — is not , however , a solution for the silane problem .
If anything , amorphous silicon solar cells , which rely on relatively thin layers of silicon , employ more silane as part of their process , using the gas to deposit the thin layer of semiconducting materials that manufacturers such as Sharp and Uni-Solar need .
But there is an alternative .
Quebec - based manufacturer SiXtron Advanced Materials has developed a way to make a more stable gas with similar properties via gasifying polymer pellets .
The idea is to hook the SiXtron " Sunbox " to existing silicon photovoltaic manufacturing lines to provide a methyl silane gaseous mixture via the same pipes that would normally deliver silane from a canister .
" The methyl silane gases are not pyrophoric , they are simply a flammable gas , " says Bates Marshall , SiXtron 's executive vice president of sales and marketing .
" But a leak does not mean an explosion . "
The key to the mixture 's stability is replacing some of the hydrogen in typical silane with other molecules , such as carbon , to make the resulting gas less explosive .
The silicon carbon nitride that this alternative deposits may even be better at helping reflect light back into a solar cell — and SiXtron 's silane - free coating has been shown to reduce the loss in efficiency endemic to solar cells when they are first introduced to sunlight .
Georgia Tech 's Rohatgi has been testing SiXtron 's machine versus conventional silane solar cell production and found that they produce similar quality cells .
" The cells we have made for SiXtron are just as good as what are being made in industry , " he says .
" It is great to have a technology which gives you gas without compromising efficiency .
It is taking the risk out of the product . "
Such an alternative may be vital , given that silane 's behavior under various conditions remains a mystery , even to scientific experts .
" Its behavior when released is unpredictable , " admits Ngai , who has advised SiXtron .
" As a result , silane has been involved in quite a number of significant incidents . "
Already , such issues have driven major companies such as General Electric to opt for competing technologies , investing in thin - film solar cells made from cadmium telluride by PrimeStar .
Amorphous silicon " is attractive because of the availability of silicon but you still have to have silane in high purity , " says electrical engineer Danielle Merfeld , director of solar technologies at GE Global Research .
Making solar cells from cadmium telluride " is a much more robust and forgiving process and material structure . "
Regardless , silicon in its many forms makes up more than 80 percent of the current mix of photovoltaic production .
It remains to be seen if the SiXtron alternative thrives , even though the company has partnered with solar manufacturing equipment provider Roth & Rau .
Other potential alternatives in the past , such as disilane , faltered when they proved too expensive to make .
" If industry sees it gives no performance loss and , if anything , it has potential for improving performance , then I see no real reason for industry not to embrace it , " Rohatgi says .
" It will take time . "
UPDATE : Evangelist Franklin Graham has confirmed that he has been disinvited by the US Army to serve as honorary chairman of a National Day of Prayer event , the Associated Press reports .
Earlier news reports had stated that this was the case , but confirmation only came Thursday afternoon when Graham , the son of famed evangelist Billy Graham , issued a statement saying he regretted the Army ’s decision .

ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS BELOW
Editor ’s Note : CNN ’s Roland Martin reports ,
“ The son of evangelist Billy Graham is removed as a speaker at a Pentagon event due to his remarks on Islam . ”
But the final decision seems to be an error since the CNN video contains no mention of one being made yet .
RAW STORY regrets running with the CNN headline initially .
Fox News notes ,
Army spokesman Gary Tallman told Fox News that Graham ’s “ presence at the event may be taken by some as inappropriate for a government agency . ”
“ As the executive agent of the Pentagon chaplain ’s office , Army leadership determined it needed further review , ” he said .
The Military Religious Freedom Foundation raised the objection to the appearance , citing Graham ’s past remarks about Islam , in a letter sent Monday to Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
Army mulls disinviting evangelist after attacks on Islam surface , but church leader is n’t backing down

The Christian evangelist invited to serve as honorary chairman of the Army ’s National Day of Prayer declined to walk back remarks accusing Islam of being a “ wicked and evil ” religion in an interview broadcast early Thursday .
Asked to clarify comments in which he called Islam “ evil ” after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , evangelist Franklin Graham said Thursday he still took issue with those adhering to the Muslim faith .
“ I love the people of Islam but their religion , I do not agree with their religion at all , ” he said .
He added that he was disturbed by the treatment of women under Islam .

“ I speak out for people that live under Islam , ” he said , “ that are enslaved by Islam and I want them to know that they can be free , free through faith in Jesus Christ and Christ alone . ”
Franklin Graham is the son of televangelist Billy Graham .
He was invited by the Army to serve as an honorary chairman for Prayer Day , but the invitation is facing scrutiny after a watchdog group drew attention to his 2001 remarks .
Following this pressure , Army Col .
Tom Collins told the Associated Press Wednesday that withdrawing Graham ’s invitation “ is on the table . ”

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation objected to the invitation , citing Graham ’s past comments about Islam .
Graham called Islam a “ very evil and wicked religion ” in the days after the 9/11 attacks .
Later , he tried to temper his remarks by saying that Americans should n’t “ paint [ Muslims ] in a broad brush ” since only a “ small group of people ” were responsible for flying airplanes into US sites .
On another occasion , the evangelist declared that “ true ” Islam involves abuse of women and labeled it a “ very violent religion . ”

“ We have many Muslims that live in this country , ” he said .
“ But true Islam can not be practiced in this country .
You ca n’t beat your wife .
You cannot murder your children if you think they ’ve committed adultery or something like that , which they do practice in these other countries …
I do n’t agree with the teachings of Islam and I find it to be a very violent religion . ”
This video is from Fox News Fox & Friends , broadcast April 22 , 2010 .
It did n't take long after this series ended for the Buffalo fans and media to jump all over the Sabres skill players for not showing up in the playoffs .
The fingers were pointed mostly at Tim Connolly , Derek Roy and Jason Pominville with Drew Stafford earning honorable mention despite playing in only three games .
While everyone is piling on these players , allow me to defend them a bit .
While all these players could have possibly been better they were not the reason the Sabres lost in six games to the Boston Bruins .
The Sabres scored 2.5 goals per game in this series which is more than the Bruins allowed during the regular season .
Only the Vancouver Canucks , Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals scored more even strength goals than the Sabres did in six playoff games .
The Sabres offense was n't the reason they lost the series , special teams were the reason the Sabres lost .
The Sabres scored zero power play goals while the Bruins scored six times with the man advantage .
All three of the players mentioned are part of the power play and deserve some blame for the teams power play failure but where were the coaches to change the strategy ?
When things were n't working in the first couple of games of the series Lindy Ruff publicly gave up on the team having power play success .
Instead of trying to adjust and come up with a new plan , they simply conceded having success with the man advantage .
How can we blame the players when the coaches did n't have an answer ?
While the Sabres gave up on the idea of power play success the Bruins took advantage of their power play chances .
Boston scored a total of six power play goals in six games against a Sabres penalty kill that finished second in the league during the regular season .
The Bruins power play struggled all season but they made adjustments and it helped them win this series and advance to the second round .
Despite the Bruins obvious advantage in special teams , people will still argue that if Derek Roy had done more or Tim Connolly had done more , the Sabres could have still overcome their special teams deficiencies .
There are plenty of reasons why these players had little success in the series .
Think back to game one and how good Derek Roy played with Thomas Vanek alongside him .
Roy set up Vanek with the first goal of the series and I would argue they were the best two forwards on the ice for either team in that game .
It looked like that success would continue when Roy sent Vanek away on a partial breakaway with the score already 2 - 0 in the first period of game two .
That is when Johnny Boychuk slashed the knee of Vanek and he crashed heavily into the boards .
Vanek was out of the lineup and Roy never seemed to recover wit his new linemates .
Lets talk a little about Roy 's new linemates .
Lindy Ruff decided to go top heavy on the Sabres top line with Jason Pominville and Tyler Ennis playing on either side of him .
This was either a terrible strategy because none of those players can compete physically with big Zdeno Chara or Boychuk or a very smart strategy .
I 'll give Lindy Ruff the benefit of the doubt and say it was a smart strategy to force the Bruins to play Chara and Boychuk against this line which would free up space for the other three lines .
If that was the strategy , it worked , because the Sabres scored 14 even strength goals in the series .
While it opened up space for the other three lines it put those guys in a position to take some heat for not producing offensively .
As for Tim Connolly there is no question he struggled throughout the series but that wo n't stop me from defending him a little bit .
He played with Pominville and Ennis the first two games and they were on the ice for four of the Bruins five goals in game two .
After the disappointing performance in game two , Pominville and Ennis played along with Roy and Connolly was stuck in offensive purgatory with Grier and Gaustad on his line .
Mike Grier was good all series but Connolly is known as a play - maker and not a finisher , playing him with two grinders seems like a waste of his talent .
I thought these players were put in a position to fail and they did .
Three small , skilled forwards are not the combination that compete with big , physical defensemen and playing a play - maker with grinders is not a recipe for success either .
In the end the criticism will continue and the only way to erase that criticism is to contribute in the future .
Only time will tell if any of these players can answer the bell .
Still there is plenty of blame to be thrown around but lets put the pressure on the coaches for their unwillingness to adjust when the special teams failed miserably in the six game series loss .

Meanwhile Sergey set up a business office , and the two began calling on potential partners wh o mi gh t wa nt t o li ce ns e a se ar ch t ec hn ol og y be tt er t han any then available .
Despite the dotcom fever of the day , they had li ttle i nt er est in building a company of their own around the technology they had developed .
Among those they calle d on w as f ri en d an d Ya ho o! found er D av id F il o .

One portal CEO told them , " As long as we'r e 80 per cent as good as our competitors , that 's good enough .
Our users do n't really care about search . "
Unab le t o in te re st t he m aj or p or ta l pl ay er s of t he d ay , Larry and Sergey decided to make a go of it on their own .
All they needed was a little cash to move out of the d orm — and to pay off the credit cards they had maxed out buying a terabyte of me mo ry .
So t he y wr ot e up a b us in es s pl an , pu t th eir Ph.D. plans on hold , and went looking for an angel inv estor .

But though his interest had been piqued , he was pressed for time .
As Sergey tells it , " We met him very early one morning on the porc h of a Sta nf or d fa cu lt y me mb er 's h om e in P al o Al to .
We g ave him a quick demo .
He had to run off somewhere , s o he said , ' Instead of us discussing all the details , why do n't I just write you a check ? '
It was made out to Google Inc. and was fo r $ 1 00,000 . "

S in ce t here was no legal entity known as " Google Inc. , " there was no way to deposit the check .
It sat in Larry 's desk drawer for a couple of weeks while he and Sergey scrambled to set up a co rporation an d lo ca te o th er f un de rs a mo ng f amily , friends , and acquaintances .
Ultimately they brought in a total initial investment of almost $ 1 million .
