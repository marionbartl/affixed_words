DALLAS --
The NBA fined Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban $ 100,000 Saturday for his recent comments about Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James .
Cuban confirmed the fine through his Twitter account shortly before the league announced its punishment for Cuban 's remarks which violated the league 's anti-tampering rules .
" For those of you who care about these things , NBA just fined me 100 k for comments regarding another teams ' players , " Cuban wrote .
NBA rules prohibit team officials from commenting on potential free agents until the market opens on July 1 .
Asked on Tuesday night before the draft lottery about what teams were allowed to do , NBA commissioner David Stern said : " Come July 1 , just about everything goes .
Before July 1 , nothing goes . "
Earlier this week in a CNNMoney.com interview , Cuban was asked he if is interested in signing James .
Cuban said he is hopeful that James will try to force a sign - and - trade , which would give the Mavericks an opportunity to acquire him .
" Come July 1st , yeah , of course , anybody would be interested in LeBron James , " Cuban said in the interview .
" And if he leaves via free agency , then it 's going to be tough .
If he does like I 'm guessing , hoping he will , which is say , ' I 'm not going to leave the Cavs high and dry , ' if he decides to leave -- there 's still a better chance he stays -- then he 'll try to force a sign - and - trade and that gives us a chance . "
The league more or less slapped Cuban on the wrist considering he and the club faced a maximum fine of $ 5 million and the possibility of not being able to pursue James in the case he does become a free agent .
The league sent a memo to all 30 teams in 2008 directing team officials to decline comment about potential free agents when asked by the media .
The league also fined Phoenix Suns president of basketball operations Steve Kerr $ 10,000 for comments he made regarding James on a radio show on May 14 .
Kerr joked that he would like to sign James for the mid-level exception , " About five - and - half million , I think he 'll take it .
Do n't you think ? "
Kerr said .
Kerr was then asked where he thought James would end up next season .
Kerr said , " I have no idea .
I want him to stay in Cleveland .
I think that 's good for sports when you 've got players you connect to over a long period of time , so I hope he stays . "
A Suns spokesperson said the team would have no further comment on the matter .

Presenter , Radio 4's Money Box
Nationwide said its plans will reduce queues Nationwide Building Society is to stop some customers taking out less than £ 100 over the counter at its branches .
From 7
June customers with cash cards who want smaller amounts will have to use a cash machine .
The change will not apply to people with debit cards , or those who still use a passbook .
Nationwide said the change was needed to reduce queues in its branches and that there were alternatives for those affected .
But Mike Ivatt , from Kent , told Radio 4's Money
Box his 83 - year - old father would not feel happy taking out cash in the street and probably could not remember his PIN .
' Sad indictment '
" The service my father has received at the counter has been excellent , " he said .
" Older people need that service . "
He said his father may have to stop doing his own financial transactions .
" Building societies were established to look after their members and it's a sad indictment when a large proportion of those members are going to have to hand over the running of their accounts to other people , " Mr Ivatt added .
Nationwide wants customers to make more use of cash machines Nationwide 's divisional director of the branch network , Graeme Hughes , told Money Box that the change was essential .
" About a third of all counter transactions are carried out by less than 8 % of our customer base , " he said .
" And the other 92 % say ' what can you do to speed up the queues ? '
So what we 're trying to do is to look at alternative ways of dealing with these customers . "
He said people could change accounts , or use cash machines .
" I do recognise that for some customers , what we 're asking them to do wo n't be particularly good for them , " he said .
" What we are looking to do is help them use the cash machines , so we are giving them two months ' notice so that we can talk to customers to help them . "
Cheque changes
However , Nationwide is telling another group of customers that they will have to queue up .
On principle , I thought the building societies might be different
Steve Harrison , Nationwide customer
It is withdrawing the use of FAST / Selfserve machines for the paying - in of cheques of more than £ 1,000 - the current limit is £ 10,000 .
The reason given is that larger cheques are more likely to be fraudulent and counter staff would be more likely to spot them .
But Steve Harrison , a Nationwide customer from Lancashire , thought there was another reason .
He said : " It seems like they 're trying to get rid of relatively poorer customers and the low value transactions , and trying to focus on selling products , which the banks have done for a long time .
" On principle , I thought the building societies might be different . "
The Nationwide leaflet which explains the change says it will " fight fraud as well as giving you the opportunity to talk to one of our consultants to try to help you get the most from your money " .
Mr Hughes denied that the change was to do with selling better - off customers other services .
" By reducing the amount to £ 1,000 we are trying to protect our members , " he said .
Nationwide is also introducing a £ 10 charge for drafts of less than £ 1,000 obtained at the counter , and the same charge for stopping a cheque .
What do you think of this new policy ?
Is it reasonable to turn customers away from the counter if they are withdrawing £ 100 , or less ?
How important is it that building societies offer a more personal service to customers than banks do ?
Do you think building societies are becoming more like banks in their approach to customers ?

Oil boom stretches along empty beaches , tar balls have washed ashore along the Alabama and Mississippi coasts , and a swirling , oily sheen covers at least 2,500 square miles of the sea surface in the Gulf of Mexico .
So far , currents , winds , and a plume of fresh water flowing into the Gulf from the Mississippi River have acted in concert to hold at bay the oil spewing from a damaged well head 5,000 feet below the sea surface some 40 miles off the Louisiana coast .
In anticipation of the oil 's arrival , some 13,000 people stand ready to combat the spill if it approaches shore , according to the Obama administration .
More than a million feet of boom has been deployed .
More than half a million gallons of dispersants has been applied .
IN PICTURES : Louisiana oil spill
For anyone using the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska 's Prince William Sound as a visual reference point , it might look as though the Gulf spill so far is a dodged bullet .
But the differences between the two events are significant , cautions Michelle Wood , a marine biologist who recently became head of the ocean chemistry division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic and Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami .
Not the least of those differences is the seascape into which the oil is flowing .
Gulf spill unlike Exxon Valdez
The Exxon Valdez spill involved a large , single , intense pulse of oil into Prince William Sound – " a shallow , near - shore environment with a rocky coast , " she explains .
The heavy crude had lots to cling to as it came ashore .
In the Gulf , " spill " is a so - far continuous infusion of a lighter grade oil , which at least initially forms a foamy mousse rather than tarry blobs .
And so far , the oil has remained far at sea .
The apparent gap between preparations for the oil 's arrival along the Gulf Coast and its behavior so far testify to the complex marine environment the oil enters as it spews from the broken well head , researchers say .
The system is chaotic enough that given enough time , say 90 days , oil in some form could wind up anywhere from the Mexican Coast to Palm Beach , research suggests .
" We call it a mini ocean , " says Steven DiMarco , an oceanographer at Texas A&M University in College Station , Texas .
" Many of the processes that occur in the Gulf of Mexico occur in the much larger basins like the Atlantic and the Pacific . "
Atlantic ' conveyer belt '
The main oceanic feature is the so - called loop current , essentially the Gulf 's section of a much longer current that forms the Atlantic Ocean 's so - called conveyor belt .
The belt , which drives warm tropical waters north toward Greenland , where it sinks and cools , begins in the equatorial Atlantic off Brazil .
The current snakes into the Caribbean and then north between Cuba and Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
The volume of water moving through the Yucatan Straight is so enormous and travels with such speed – essentially at the pace of a brisk walk – that it forms a loop that meanders north of Cuba , then makes a U - turn southward toward the island before heading out through the Florida Straights to form the Gulf Stream .
Below about 1,000 meters ( 3281 feet ) , however , the regime shifts .
Circulation runs counterclockwise as seawater spills over a sill spanning the Yucatan Straight .
In a kind of watch - your - step plunge , water flows over the sill and into the deepest reaches of the Gulf .
It travels east until it reaches the continental shelf off Florida 's west coast .
But the sill across the Florida Straight is far shallower , forcing the deep flow to ricochet back toward Texas and Mexico .
At these depths , the current moves more than 100 times slower than surface currents .
As oil from the Deepwater Horizon blow - out rises , it would encounter swirling eddies that spin off these broader flows , distributing some of the oil horizontally , says Arthur Mariano , an oceanographer at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science on Miami's Key Biscayne .
Once it reaches the surface , currents and ever - shifting winds can carry the oil just about anywhere , adds Peter Niiler , a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , who has conducted extensive studies of current patterns in the Gulf .
A five - year experiment
In a five - year experiment in the late 1990s , Dr. Niiler and a colleague dropped between 700 and 800 drifters – devices to help track currents – into the Gulf at locations where offshore drilling was taking place .
Within 90 days , the drifters could be anywhere in the Gulf , including Mexico or even as far away as Miami Beach , he says .
Of key concern is the loop current , which at the moment is brushing the southernmost reaches of the spill .
Oil can be swept up and carried along as the current moves through the Florida Straight and out into the Gulf Stream .
By that time , the oil is likely to have been highly diluted and dispersed , Mariano says .
Oil on the surface weathers , losing the lighter chemicals it contains to evaporation .
As it does , it grows denser , then sinks .
But periodically , the loop current 's loop stretches far enough north that it becomes vulnerable to a kind of self - pruning ; it pinches off to become a loop current eddy .
These eddies are roughly 60 miles across , and once they break free , they head west .
They can break off on average every three to 17 months .
Oil can become entrained in the eddy and travel toward Texas and the Mexican coast .
Loop currents and eddies
" Knowing were the loop current is , knowing whether a loop current eddy is going to break off , and knowing where that eddy is going to go " is vital to understanding where some of the oil may be headed , Dr. DiMarco says .
Indeed , Niiler points to a large eddy currently on the loop current 's eastern flank as a potential pruning tool that could trigger the formation of a loop - current eddy .
On Saturday , the Coast Guard and the EPA approved BP 's used of dispersants at depth to try to break up the oil as it leaves the well head .
But it 's unclear how well that works , researchers say .
The effort " in some sense is one big experiment , " Mariano says .
Over the short term , Mariano says he expected the oil to collect on the surface and at the bottom .
But as the surface oil weathers , it will sink to join oil at the bottom as well .
Given the circulation patterns at depth , remaining oil will be patchy .
But " a lot of that oil at the bottom is going to hang around for a long time , " he says .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
The output of scientific papers from Japanese researchers has stayed largely flat over the past decade while output from China has risen fourfold , according to a report released by Thomson Reuters .
The report points out how the share of mature economies like Japan , the United States and Britain in the world ’s scientific literature is falling while developing states like China are muscling onto the scene .
The report , which focuses on Japan ’s scientific research performance over the last 10 years , also urged the country ’s scientists to collaborate with colleagues in the region .
“ Now Japan must take advantage of the opportunities on its door - step .
The Asia - Pacific region is on course to be a powerful focus for the next phase of global research development ... Growth in China and India is on a massive upward trajectory , ” according to the report .
Japan produced 78,500 papers indexed by Thomson Reuters in 2009 , up modestly from 72,000 in 2000 , while China produced 125,000 papers in 2009 , nearly fourfold from 2000 .
Despite its world - class universities , laboratories and Nobel prize winners , Japan ’s share of the world ’s research production slipped to 6.75 percent in 2009 from 9.45 percent in 2000 .
The same was seen in the United States , whose share fell to 28.5 percent in 2009 from 33.5 percent in 2000 , while Britain ’s share fell to 7.68 percent from 9.43 percent within the same period .
“ A contributing factor to Japan ’s underperformance could be the low rate of international collaboration .
Research is driven by domestic activity instead of innovative opportunities with quickly developing neighbors , ” wrote Jonathan Adams , director of research evaluation at Thomson Reuters in a statement .
Japan ’s research is focused on physics and it produced around 54,800 papers between 2005 to 2009 , or just over 11 percent of the total produced around the world on the discipline .
The report added that regional collaboration with China and South Korea was likely to increase as their domestic research bases grow .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Supreme Court considered on Monday whether a university can legally deny recognition to a Christian student group that excludes gays and nonbelievers .
The high court appeared sharply split as it heard arguments in a case that pits anti-discrimination principles against religious freedom .
The case could have important implications for how public universities , colleges and schools must accommodate campus religious groups .
Liberal justices asked whether campus groups could legally exclude women , minorities or those with disabilities while conservatives asked how far universities could go to require that groups admit student members with opposing views .
Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia asked whether a campus Republican club must admit Democrats or whether a Christian group must allow atheists to join and even conduct Bible classes .
“ That ’s crazy , ” Scalia said as the courtroom erupted in laughter .
The case involved the Christian Legal Society , which requires members to sign a statement of faith that vows devotion to Jesus Christ .
It bars those with a “ sexually immoral lifestyle , ” including gays and lesbians .
Founded in 1961 , the Christian Legal Society maintained law student chapters across the country .
Its members hold Bible study meetings and discuss ways to apply their religious faith to the practice of law .
The University of California , Hastings College of the Law , denied recognition to the group because it does not conform to the school ’s policy that membership should be open to all , Washington lawyer Gregory Garre argued on behalf of the university .
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito said forcing the admission of someone who does not share the same religious beliefs could be a threat to the group .
Chief Justice John Roberts drew a distinction between policies against gender and race discrimination and religious beliefs , which are protected by the U.S. Constitution .
Stanford University Law professor Michael McConnell argued on behalf of the Christian Legal Society that the Constitution does not allow a school to deny recognition to a group because it required its members to agree with its core religious views .
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked McConnell what was wrong with a university adopting a policy that it does not want to recognize a group if it discriminates .
Justice Stephen Breyer also seemed to support the school .
He asked whether the Christian Legal Society would admit a gay student who does not believe in premarital sex .
McConnell answered that a student who believed in same - sex marriage would not be admitted to the group .
A decision in the case is expected by the end of June .

A man and woman of different castes commit suicide because their marriage " is impossible . " 24 year old girl throws herself from the 28th floor of a building after the torture suffered at the hands of her husbands and in - laws who demand the payment of a dowry .
New Delhi ( AsiaNews ) -
A young couple committed suicide yesterday in Samalkha , 50 km from Delhi , throwing themselves under a train .
According to police , it is yet another case of " honour killing " .
Deepak and Teena , 25 and 18 , were from the same village and wanted to get married , but belonged to different castes .
The young man was part of the Saini community while the girl belonged to the Luhar .
caste
The parents told police that they had repeatedly tried to convince young couple not to meet because their relationship " was impossible . "
It is only the latest of many honour killings that continue to unfold in India .
On June 20 , Mandeep Nagar , 23 , and Ankit Chaudhury , 22 , helped by a third man , killed their sisters because they were mixing with people of different caste , thus exposing them " to the insults of the whole village .
We could not bear the humiliation " .
" Honour killings " in India are traditionally the killing of a member of the family by relatives when they humiliate them , for example , marrying a person of a different caste .
According to the United Nations Population Fund 5 thousand honour killings take place each year worldwide , most of them in India .
Another cultural scourge that afflicts the country is the dowry system .
Nishi Jethwani , 24 , yesterday threw herself from 28th floor of a building in Mumbai after undergoing mental and physical torture at the hands of her husband and in - laws , who wanted the payment of a dowry .
Despite being abolished by law in 1961 , according to the Indian National Crime Records Bureau the dowry system caused 8172 deaths in 2008 alone .
Payment of dowry amounts to millions of rupees ( tens of thousands of Euros ) and often many families can not afford it , killing their daughters before the birth to avoid the risk of a marriage that they could not afford .
I created a list of 15 key strength training terms below to help you become a smart exerciser .
I have tons of strength training workouts I plan on adding to BuiltLean.com that use many of these terms , so this page can serve as a reference for you .
If you need further guidance , you can also refer to the National Strength and Conditioning Association textbook .
Repetition
A repetition , or “ rep ” is a complete motion of a particular exercise .
For example , a rep of a pushup starts with your arms straight holding yourself off the floor , lowering your body down , then pushing back up .
Repeating 10 pushups means you completed 10 reps .
Set
A set is the specific number of reps you perform before you rest .
Two sets of bench press performing 12 reps , means you completed 12 reps of bench press , two separate times .
Weight ( aka Resistance )
The weight is the amount of resistance that you are lifting , such as a 30 lbs dumbbell .
Lower reps generally require that you lift heavier weight and higher reps implies you lift lighter weight .
Rest Between Sets
This is the amount of time that you rest between each set .
Many times it can range from 20 seconds to as much as 4 minutes for powerlifters .
Volume
Can be measured in different ways , but is generally determined by how many exercises , sets , and reps you complete .
A workout that is comprised of 10 exercises , 3 sets of 12 reps each has much more volume than a workout with 3 exercises , 2 sets of 8 reps each .
Volume is one measure of the intensity of a workout .
Compound Exercises
These are multi- joint movements that require more than one joint to perform the exercise .
For example , in a bench press , your shoulder joint and elbow joints are involved in the exercise .
Isolation Exercises
These are single joint movements that require only one joint to perform the exercise .
For example , a biceps curl only requires the elbow joint .
Supersets
This means completing two exercises back to back with no rest between sets .
Supersets can use the ( 1 ) same muscle group , such as performing bench press immediately followed by pushups , ( 2 ) opposing muscle groups ( meaning push muscles vs. pull muscles ) like a chest exercise followed immediately by a back exercise , ( 3 ) unrelated , such as upper body then lower body .
Positive Phase
This is the lifting phase of the exercise , which for pull muscles means you are lifting the weight towards you and push muscles , means you are lifting the weight away from you .
So for bench press , the positive phase of the lift is pushing the weight off your chest and for a pull up , it ’s pulling your body up towards the bar .
It ’s generally the more strenuous portion of the lift and it ’s also referred to as the “ concentric ” phase .
Negative Phase
This is the opposite of the positive phase , so it means lowering the weight , or controlling its descent .
Examples include controlling the bench press bar as you bring it closer to your chest , or lowering yourself after pulling your chin above the bar in a pullup .
It ’s also referred to as the “ eccentric phase ” .
Sticking Point
This is the point during the positive phase where the weight lifted loses momentum and is at a standstill .
For example , trying to pullup yourself up on a pullup , but stalling midway , or when completing the bench press , the point at which the bar stops moving as you are pushing it .
A spotter can help you push past the sticking point .
Contraction
This means the muscle is engaged and contracted to apply force to pull , or push a weight .
Muscle cells are grouped into motor units , where if one cell in the unit is engaged , the entire group contracts , known as the “ all or none ” principle .
Tempo
This is how fast each rep is performed , including the positive and negative phase .
For example , the most common tempo I use is 1 - 2 seconds for the positive phase , and 2 - 3 seconds for the negative phase , which allows for full control of the weight with no momentum .
Body Part Split
This is how you split your body parts to train during the week .
For example , some people will train chest / biceps on one day , Back / Triceps on another day , then Shoulders / Legs on the third lift of the week .
Some programs are full body lifts each training session and some other programs are based on specific pull , or pushing motions ( i.e. vertical , horizontal etc. ) instead of body parts .
Spotter
This is someone who watches over you as you are performing a set to failure and is there to help you lift the weight back into starting position if you have trouble .
For example , if you are doing a barbell bench press to failure ( ca n’t complete any more reps ) , you should always have a spotter in case you fail and cannot lift the weight off your chest .

THE Anglican Church wants Australians to have fewer children and has urged the federal government to scrap the baby bonus and cut immigration .
Wading into the population debate , the General Synod of the Anglican Church has warned that current rates of population growth are unsustainable and potentially out of step with church doctrine - including the eighth commandment , '' Thou shall not steal ' ' .
In a significant intervention , the Anglican Public Affairs Commission has warned concerned Christians that remaining silent '' is little different from supporting further overpopulation and ecological degradation ' ' .
'' Out of care for the whole of creation , particularly the poorest of humanity and the life forms who cannot speak for themselves … it is not responsible to stand by and remain silent , '' a discussion paper by the commission warns .
'' Unless we take account of the needs of future life on Earth , there is a case that we break the eighth commandment - ' Thou shall not steal ' . ''
London , England ( CNN ) --
Gay rights groups have expressed outrage over comments made by a senior Vatican official linking homosexuality to child abuse .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , who also serves as the Vatican 's Secretary of State , made the comment during a news conference while on an official visit to Chile .
" Many psychologists , many psychiatrists have demonstrated that there is no relationship between celibacy and pedophilia but many others have demonstrated , I was told recently , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia , " he said .
Tony Green of the London - based Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement said Bertone 's comments came as no surprise given recent controversial statements by Church leaders .
" Of course we 're appalled by it but not shocked -- people like this are bound to say this .
It 's a bit like comparing attacks on the Catholic Church to the Holocaust and all that .
It is desperate people trying to come out with desperate answers , " he said .
High - profile gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell added his voice to the criticism .
" The Vatican is trying to deflect attention from the sex crimes of Catholic clergy by blaming gay people .
This is really sick , " Tatchell told the British Press Association .
" There is absolutely no connection whatsoever between pedophilia and loving , consenting adult gay relationships , " he added .
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry on Wednesday also denounced Bertone 's remarks connecting homosexuality to pedophilia .
" It is an unacceptable amalgam that we condemn , " said the spokesman , Bernard Valero .
" France assures its firm involvement in the struggle against discrimination and prejudice related to sexual orientation and gender identity . "
A Vatican spokesman said Wednesday that just 10 percent of the abuse cases against priests that were reviewed by the Vatican constituted " pedophilia in the strict sense . "
The rest were cases of abuse against teenagers , said the spokesman , Federico Lombardi .
Roughly 60 percent of those incidents were between priests and teenage boys , he said , while 30 percent were between priests and teenage girls .
The latest row over the Vatican 's response to the abuse scandal came amid calls for the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI on his impending visit to Britain .
James Cantor , the Head of the Law and Mental Health Research Section of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto , Canada , also rejected suggestions of a link between homosexuality and pedophilia .
" It 's quite solidly shown in the scientific literature that there is absolutely no association between being a gay man and being a pedophile , " Cantor , also Editor - in - Chief of " Sexual Abuse : A Journal of Research and Treatment , " told CNN .
A Vatican spokesman declined CNN 's request for comment on the Cardinal 's statement .
The Catholic Church has been under attack over a series of scandals exposing widespread abuse of children dating back decades .
An attempt by Pope Benedict XVI to calm the storm in March with an apology to victims of child abuse in Ireland has since been eclipsed by controversial statements by senior clergy .
During Easter Mass , Cardinal Angelo Sodano , a former Vatican secretary of state and the dean of the College of Cardinals , provoked criticism by appearing to downplay the seriousness of the abuse allegations .
He said the pope retained the support of Catholics around the world " who do not let themselves be influenced by the gossip . "
Days earlier , the pontiff 's personal preacher , Father Raniero Cantalamessa , compared the attacks on the church to anti-semitism .
He later apologized for any offence caused .
On Monday , the Vatican published a one - page document outlining the official steps dioceses should take if a priest is accused of abuse .
The document did not appear to contain new guidance -- only to consolidate existing practices into one document .
Father Ciro Benedettini of the Vatican press office told CNN it was designed primarily to help the media understand Church procedures .
The document roused further criticism from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests ( SNAP ) whose spokesman Mark Serrano said : " It 's sad when the Vatican has to make it clear to bishops that they must follow secular laws .
It 's fairly obvious that if you are saying you will now cooperate with the police then you are admitting that you have not been . "
On Tuesday high - profile atheist Richard Dawkins called for the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI on charges of crimes against humanity when the pontiff visits Britain later this year .
" One could make the case he was complicit in the covering up of the crimes after they had been committed , and we have it in his own words that he put the public relations ' interest of the church ahead of the interests of the children themselves , " Dawkins told CNN .
He said the idea of papal charges was first floated by author and journalist Christopher Hitchens and together they consulted lawyers in England to see whether charges could be brought .
" I 'm not sure if it 's really feasible that he will literally end up in the dock .
That 's what we 're aiming for .
But I think it 's good consciousness - raising to alert people to the fact that there 's no reason why the head of a large religious organization should be exempt from the same law that the rest of the world has to summit to .
" There is no get out of jail free card which should be offered to a religious leader anymore than to anyone else in the world , " he said .
The online game StarCraft is a televised national pastime in South Korea .
With hundreds of licensed pros divided into twelve teams ( each with a major sponsor such as Samsung ) , two major game channels Ongamenet and MBCGame each run a “ Starleague ” viewed by millions of fans .
In South Korea , this is bigger than the halfpipe at the Vancouver Winter Olympics .
While StarCraft involves individual team members constructing bases to protect against alien invaders , World of Warcraft ( WoW ) is highly collaborative with teams of elves , dwarves , gnomes , trolls , orcs , and other “ races ” competing in “ guilds ” of players from two warring factions , the Alliance and the Horde .
Creative communication and teamwork among avatars is critical to success in WoW .
“ Collaboration , creativity , local insight , courage … 10 missions , 10 weeks . ”
This could easily be a WoW quest .
But it ’s actually a tagline for the latest alternate reality game by Dr. Jane McGonigal of the Institute for the Future .
Called EVOKE , it ’s designed to be “ a crash course in changing the world . ”
While it entices you to help solve the world ’s problems , the EVOKE video looks like a trailer for the latest Hollywood blockbuster :
“ Each quest is a question only you can answer , ” the EVOKE narrator says .
Online games such as WoW enable large groups of people to pool their knowledge and skills to overcome obstacles .
Dr. McGonigal designs online games like WoW — except that the quest is to tackle a global social issue such as poverty , hunger , disease , and climate change rather than to defeat the Alliance or the Horde .
She takes threats to human existence — global food shortage , fuel wars , pandemic , refugee crisis , and upended democracy — and asks the gaming public to collaborate on how to avoid these all too possible futures .
Her AvantGame website asserts that “ reality is broken ” and that “ game designers can fix it . ”
Through online games on the global internet , game designers and gamers can intervene to solve impending problems .
And she has gathered more than 10,000 potential solutions to global problems from game participants including executives from P&G and Kraft .
Her latest game , EVOKE , was developed for the World Bank Institute .
By completing the 10 missions , you can become a World Bank Institute certified EVOKE social innovator .
In this video taken after a recent TED appearance ( not yet posted to TED as of this writing ) , Dr. McGonigal talks about EVOKE and shares her passion for the transformative power of online gaming :
“ People who spend a lot of time failing in game worlds are less put off by failure in the real world , ” says Dr. McGonigal .
“ They ’re more likely to stick at it and get to a successful conclusion whereas other people would quit .
Because games teach us that failure is n’t actually scary .
It ’s an opportunity to learn because , obviously , to do amazing things , we ca n’t just give up because we fail . ”
Games teach us that failure is n’t scary , it ’s an opportunity to learn .
To do amazing things , we ca n’t just give up because we fail .
With a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in performance studies , Dr. McGonigal has been working in the game industry and in games research since 2001 .
Her previous projects include The Lost Ring , World Without Oil , Cruel 2 B Kind , and I Love Bees .
She is an expert on applying game design and game theory to real work and real business , and has consulted and developed internal game workshops for leading technology companies in Asia , Europe , and the U.S. , as well as more than a dozen Fortune Global 500 Companies .
MIT Technology
Review named her one of the top 35 innovators changing the world through technology , for her role in pioneering the field of alternate reality gaming , and Harvard Business Review called her theory of alternate reality business one of the Top 20 Breakthrough Ideas of 2008 .
Her views are similar to Stanford ’s Dr. Brian Reeves or Google ’s Eric Schmidt , who suggest that multiplayer video games can provide good career training — workplace collaboration stimulates innovation ( see “ Turning Work Into Play with Online Games ” in Resources ) .
“ Everything in the future online is going to look like a multiplayer game , ” says Schmidt .
“ If I were 15 years old , that ’s what I would be doing right now . ”
A recent NPR piece asserts that video game jobs are on the rise , and asks why does n’t the real world work more like an online game ?
This is precisely what Dr. McGonigal asserts : instead of making games more like reality , let ’s make reality more like a game .
She walks her talk .
Dr. Jane McGonigal is an advisor to the 2010 Serious Games Summit in San Francisco and a keynote speaker at the upcoming Disruptive Effects Symposium at the University of Minnesota .
Her book “ Reality is Broken : Why Games Make Us Happy and How They Can Help Us Change the World ” will be published by Penguin Press in January 2011 .
Seven Reasons
Why a Scientist Believes in God
By
A. CRESSY MORRISON ,
Former President of the New York Academy of Sciences

WE ARE STILL IN THE DAWN of the scientific age , and every increase of light reveals more brightly the handiwork of an intelligent Creator .
We have made stupendous discoveries ; with a spirit of scientific humility and of faith grounded in knowledge we are approaching ever nearer to an awareness of God .
For myself , I count seven reasons for my faith :
First :
By unwavering mathematical law we can prove that our universe was designed and executed by a great engineering intelligence .
Suppose you put ten pennies , marked from one to ten , into your pocket and give them a good shuffle .
Now try to take them out in sequence from one to ten , putting back the coin each time and shaking them all again .
Mathematically we know that your chance of first drawing number one is one in ten ; of drawing one and two in succession , one in 100 ; of drawing one , two and three in succession , one in 1000 , and so on ; your chance of drawing them all , from number one to number ten in succession , would reach the unbelievable figure of one in ten billion .
By the same reasoning , so many exacting conditions are necessary for life on the earth that they could not possibly exist in proper relationship by chance .
The earth rotates on its axis 1000 miles an hour at the equator ; if it turned at 100 miles an hour , our days and nights would be ten times as long as now , and the hot sun would likely burn up our vegetation each long day while in the long night any surviving sprout might well freeze .
Again the sun , source of our life , has a surface temperature of 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit , and our earth is just far enough away so that this " eternal life " warms us just enough and not too much !
If the sun gave off only one half its present radiation , we would freeze , and if it gave as much more , we would roast .
The slant of the earth , tilted at an angle of 23 degrees , gives us our seasons ; if the earth had not been so tilted , vapors from the ocean would move north and south , piling up for us continents of ice .
If our moon were , say , only 50,000 miles away instead of its actual distance , our tides might be so enormous that twice a day all continents would be submerged ; even the mountains could soon be eroded away .
If the crust of the earth had only been ten feet thicker , there would be no oxygen , without which animal life must die .
Had the ocean been a few feet deeper , carbon dioxide and oxygen would have been absorbed and no vegetable life could exist .
It is apparent from these and a host of other examples that there is not one chance in billions that life on our planet is an accident .
Second :
The resourcefulness of life to accomplish its purpose is a manifestation of an all - pervading Intelligence .
What life itself is , no man has fathomed .
It has neither weight nor dimensions , but it does have force ; a growing root will crack a rock .
Life has conquered water , land and air , mastering the elements , compelling them to dissolve and reform their combinations .
Life , the sculptor , shapes all living things ; an artist , it designs every leaf of every tree , and colors every flower .
Life is a musician and has taught each bird to sing its love song , the insects to call one another in the music of their multitudinous sounds .
Life is a sublime chemist , giving taste to fruits and spices , and perfume to the rose , changing water and carbonic acid into sugar and wood , and , in so doing , releasing oxygen that animals may have the breath of life .
Behold an almost invisible drop of protoplasm , transparent , jellylike , capable of motion , drawing energy from the sun .
This single cell , this transparent mist - like droplet , holds within itself the germ of life , and has power to distribute this life to every living thing , great and small .
The powers of this droplet are greater than our vegetation and animals and people , for all life came from it .
Nature did not create life ; fire - blistered rocks and a saltless sea could not meet the necessary requirements .
Who , then , has put it here ?
Third : Animal wisdom speaks irresistibly of a good Creator who infused instinct into otherwise helpless little creatures .
The young salmon spends years at sea , then comes back to his own river , and travels up the very side of the river into which flows the tributary where he was born .
What brings him back so precisely ?
If you transfer him to another tributary he will know at once that he is off his course and he will fight his way down and back to the main stream and then turn up against the current to finish his destiny accurately .
Even more difficult to solve is the mystery of eels .
These amazing creatures migrate at maturity from ponds and rivers everywhere - those from Europe across thousands of miles of ocean - all bound for the same abysmal deeps near Bermuda .
There they breed and die .
The little ones , with no apparent means of knowing anything except that they are in a wilderness of water , nevertheless start back and find their way not only to the very shore from which their parents came but thence to the selfsame rivers , lakes or little ponds .
No American eel has ever been caught in Europe , no European eel in American waters .
Nature has even delayed the maturity of the European eel by a year or more to make up for its longer journey .
Where does the directional impulse originate ?
Fourth : Man has something more than animal instinct - the power of reason .
No other animal has ever left a record of its ability to count ten , or even to understand the meaning of ten .
Where instinct is like a single note of a flute , beautiful but limited , the human brain contains all the notes of all the instruments in the orchestra .
No need to belabor this fourth point ; thanks to human reason we can contemplate the possibility that we are what we are only because we have received a spark of Universal Intelligence .
Fifth : Provision for all living is revealed in such phenomena as the wonders of genes .
So tiny are these genes that , if all of them responsible for all living people in the world could be put in one place , there would be less than a thimbleful .
Yet these genes inhabit every living cell and are the keys to all human , animal and vegetable characteristics .
A thimble is a small place to hold all the individual characteristics of almost three billion human beings .
However , the facts are beyond question .
Here evolution really begins - at the cell , the entity which holds and carries the genes .
That the ultra - microscopic gene can absolutely rule all life on earth is an example of profound cunning and provision that could emanate only from a Creative Intelligence ; no other hypothesis will serve .
Sixth :
By the economy of nature , we are forced to realize that only infinite wisdom could have foreseen and prepared with such astute husbandry .
Many years ago a species of cactus was planted in Australia as a protective fence .
Having no insect enemies in Australia , the cactus soon began a prodigious growth ; the alarming abundance persisted until the plants covered an area as long and wide as England , crowding inhabitants out of the towns and villages , and destroying their farms .
Seeking a defense , entomologists scoured the world ; finally they turned up an insect which lived exclusively on cactus , and would eat nothing else .
It would breed freely , too ; and it had no enemies in Australia .
So animal soon conquered vegetable , and today the cactus pest has retreated - and with it all but a small protective residue of the insects , enough to hold the cactus in check forever .
Such checks and balances have been universally provided .
Why have not fast - breeding insects dominated the earth ?
Because they have no lungs such as man possesses ; they breathe through tubes .
But when insects grow large , their tubes do not grow in ratio to the increasing size of the body .
Hence there never has been an insect of great size ; this limitation on growth has held them all in check .
If this physical check had not been provided , man could not exist .
Imagine meeting a hornet as big as a lion !
Seventh :
The fact that man can conceive the idea of God is in itself a unique proof .
The conception of God rises from a divine faculty of man , unshared with the rest of our world - the faculty we call imagination .
By its power , man and man alone can find the evidence of things unseen .
The vista that power opens up is unbounded ; indeed , as man 's perfected imagination becomes a spiritual reality , he may discern in all the evidence of design and purpose the great truth that heaven is wherever and whatever ; that God is everywhere and in everything that nowhere so close as in our hearts .
It is scientifically as well as imaginatively true , as the Psalmist said :
The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth His handiwork .

Re :
Why does plucking my eyebrows make me sneeze ?

Me Message :
Dear Robin ,
Generally , when people think of sneezing , they think of someone who has a cold , or allergies , or has gotten something irritating in their nose , like pepper .
In fact , many , many stimuli can trigger a sneeze .
A list of these stimuli would include colds , allergies , cold air , humidity , irritants such as pepper or other smells , exposure to bright sunlight ( called the ACHOO syndrome no less ! ) , eating too much , cooling certain parts of the skin , sexual excitment , hair pulling , shivering , and yes , even eyebrow plucking .
And that 's only some of the triggers .
Quite a list , is n't it ?
So , why does this happen ?
I think the first step to answering this question is to briefly describe the sneeze reflex .
We know that for most people , sneezing happens in response to irritation of the nose .
( as an aside , have you ever noticed that babies sneeze through their nose , whereas most adults sneeze through their mouth ?
We seem to modify our sneezes as we get older )
In any event , irritation of the nasal passages excites your trigeminal nerve .
The impulses travel through the trigeminal ganglion to a set of neurons located in the brainstem which have collectively been termed the " sneezing center " .
The " sneezing center " sends impulses along the facial nerve back to the nasal passages and face , and causes your nasal passages to secrete fluid and become congested .
Sometimes your eyes will water also .
This nasal congestion is called the nasal phase of the sneeze .
The " sneezing center " also sends impulses to your respiratory muscles via the spinal cord .
These impulses cause the deep inspiration and forceful expiration of the sneeze .
This " act of sneezing " is called the repiratory phase .
To make a long story short , the reason all of the stimuli I listed can trigger a sneeze is because they all are able to excite the " sneezing center " .
Eyebrow plucking excites a branch of the nerve that supplies your nasal passages .
Some doctors speculate that even though the impulses are n't coming from the nose , the stimulation generated by eyebrow plucking makes the entire nerve more sensitive , and makes it very easy for enough impulses to reach the " sneezing center " to generate a sneeze .
In a similar manner , bright light , odors , and even sensations from your stomach are all able to excite the neurons of the " sneezing center " and so trigger a sneeze .
As a final point , I think I 'd like to share a couple of tidbits I came across while researching this .
You may have heard the story that we say " God Bless You " to a person after they sneeze because their heart briefly stops during the sneeze ( At least I 've heard this story before ) .
It is rubbish .
Originally , sneezing was considered good luck .
The Hebrew Talmud says that sneezing means that God will answer your prayers , and Hebrews called sneezing the " Pleasure sent from God " .
The Greeks and Romans likewise considered sneezing a good omen , and wished each other good health or long life when they heard a sneeze .
It was Pope Gregory VII who came up with the current custom of saying " God Bless You " .
This blessing was a response to the bubonic plague that was decimating Rome at the time .
You may have heard the rhyme
Ring around the rosy ,
Pocket full of posey ,
Ashes , Ashes ,
All fall down !
This rhyme started as a description of the plague .
" Ring around the rosy " refers to the appearance of the blackened swellings or " buboes " that appeared on the victims .
" Pocket full of posey " refers to the fresh flowers that people would carry around and hold near their face to ward off the horrid odor associated with the plague .
" Ashes , ashes " is a corruption of " Achoo , Achoo " and refered to the observation that people with the plague frequently sneezed .
I think we all can figure out " all fall down " for ourselves .
Anyway , the Pope proposed that people say " May God Bless You " when a person sneezed , in the hopes that this short prayer would protect the person from death .
Of course , neither the Pope nor anyone else understood that getting rid of the fleas which carried and spread the plague would have ended it immediately .
The plague ran its course , and we were left with a much different cultural view of the meaning of a sneeze .
Thanks for the interesting question !
If you have any questions or comments , or would like a list of the references I used to construct this answer , please send me an email .

AN impoverished father has tied his eight - year - old boy to a post and tried to auction him off to the highest bidder in China .
Yong Tsui attempted to entice passers - by into making an offer with assurances that his son , Fai , was a hard worker , The Daily Mail reports .
However , the auction came to a violent end after onlookers heard bidders asking how little they would have to feed the boy .
Several people attacked Mr Yong , with one putting him in a headlock until police arrived .
Mr Yong told officers in Wuhan , central China , that his wife had died three years ago and that he could no longer afford to take care of the boy .
" He has no job , no home and no money .
He says he was n't interested in the money , just finding a home for the boy , " said police , who have put boy into care .
Mr Yong was reportedly inspired to auction his boy after reading about a rickshaw driver who chained his two - year - old son to a lamppost while he went out to work because he could n't afford childcare .
Pictures of the toddler , Cheng Jingdan , were published around the world and led to nursery giving him a free place .
Child abduction and child slavery is rife in China .
Last week police in Wuhan freed two naked girls who had been locked in a basement for almost a year .
They were rescued after a repairman found a note they had managed to smuggle out in a broken television .
↬ A Simplistic View of the Stock Market
As can be seen in Figure 1 the GDP in the US has been on a very stable growth path for the last 50 or so years .
There is certainly deviation from steady growth but the variations are overwhelmed by the growth path .
Macroeconomics provides some convincing models for the long - term trend and the short - term variations , so this 2 % growth in real GDP ( 3.3 % nominal growth here ) does seem to be a reasonably supportable trend .
We would expect the value of the stock market to follow a similar stable path if what it reflects is the long - term discounted value of the firms generating the GDP .
This would be especially true if investors were planning on holding stock for a long - time and thus were mostly insensitive to the short - term variations .
Figure 2 shows the performance of the US stock market over the same 50 year period .
It seems to deviate much more sharply from the simple regression line .
However , when viewed in a log scale the regression still seems to make sense , and those deviations match quite nicely to times of market under or over - valuation , such as the 2001 and 2008 booms and the bear market of the 70s and 80s .
So if we believe that the fundamentals of the economy imply stable yearly growth the regression line in the graph should be a decent measure of the true value of the stock market .
Figure 3 shows the percentage difference between the value of the S&P500 and of its regression ( as shown in Figure 2 ) .
The first thing that jumped at me is that according to this the financial crisis was the best time to enter the stock market in 20 years , and that the market is still undervalued .
Another interesting result is that the dot - com boom was the largest by far , dwarfing both the 2008 boom and the valuations of the 60s .
As advertised , this is a very simplistic analysis .
Do n’t go buy stock based on this .
Off the top of my head here are some reasons why this is flawed :
2 % real growth in the US economy may not be sustainable going forward
Use of debt by companies has probably changed over these years , shifting the total value between stocks and bonds
The percentage of the economy represented in the stock market may have changed , with more or less private ownership
After all the caveats this still gave me a much more immediate feel for the risk involved in these markets .
The wild swings reported by hour - on - hour CNBC - style coverage are the microscopic features of the underlying growth ( 7 % in the regression line ) .
I scoured the internets in search of geeky pumpkin stencils .
These are some of my favorites .

A ship or aircraft is considered a pirate ship or aircraft if it is intended by the persons in dominant control to be used for the purpose of committing one of the acts referred to in article 101 .
The same applies if the ship or aircraft has been used to commit any such act , so long as it remains under the control of the persons guilty of that act .
Article104
Retention or loss of the nationality of a pirate ship or aircraft
A ship or aircraft may retain its nationality although it has become a pirate ship or aircraft .
The retention or loss of nationality is determined by the law of the State from which such nationality was derived .
Article105
Seizure of a pirate ship or aircraft
On the high seas , or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any State , every State may seize a pirate ship or aircraft , or a ship or aircraft taken by piracy and under the control of pirates , and arrest the persons and seize the property on board .
The courts of the State which carried out the seizure may decide upon the penalties to be imposed , and may also determine the action to be taken with regard to the ships , aircraft or property , subject to the rights of third parties acting in good faith .
Article106
Liability for seizure without adequate grounds
Where the seizure of a ship or aircraft on suspicion of piracy has been effected without adequate grounds , the State making the seizure shall be liable to the State the nationality of which is possessed by the ship or aircraft for any loss or damage caused by the seizure .
Article107
Ships and aircraft which are entitled to seize on account of piracy
A seizure on account of piracy may be carried out only by warships or military aircraft , or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect .
Article108
Illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances
1. All States shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions .
2 . Any State which has reasonable grounds for believing that a ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other States to suppress such traffic .
Article109
Unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas
1. All States shall cooperate in the suppression of unauthorized broadcasting from the high seas .
2 . For the purposes of this Convention , " unauthorized broadcasting " means the transmission of sound radio or television broadcasts from a ship or installation on the high seas intended for reception by the general public contrary to international regulations , but excluding the transmission of distress calls .
3 . Any person engaged in unauthorized broadcasting may be prosecuted before the court of :
( a ) the flag State of the ship ; ( b ) the State of registry of the installation ; ( c ) the State of which the person is a national ; ( d ) any State where the transmissions can be received ; or ( e ) any State where authorized radio communication is suffering interference .
4 . On the high seas , a State having jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 3 may , in conformity with article 110 , arrest any person or ship engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and seize the broadcasting apparatus .
Article110
Right of visit
1. Except where acts of interference derive from powers conferred by treaty , a warship which encounters on the high seas a foreign ship , other than a ship entitled to complete immunity in accordance with articles 95 and 96 , is not justified in boarding it unless there is reasonable ground for suspecting that :
( a ) the ship is engaged in piracy ; ( b ) the ship is engaged in the slave trade ; ( c ) the ship is engaged in unauthorized broadcasting and the flag State of the warship has jurisdiction under article 109 ; ( d ) the ship is without nationality ; or ( e ) though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show its flag , the ship is , in reality , of the same nationality as the warship .
2 . In the cases provided for in paragraph 1 , the warship may proceed to verify the ship 's right to fly its flag .
To this end , it may send a boat under the command of an officer to the suspected ship .
If suspicion remains after the documents have been checked , it may proceed to a further examination on board the ship , which must be carried out with all possible consideration .
3 . If the suspicions prove to be unfounded , and provided that the ship boarded has not committed any act justifying them , it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been sustained .
4 . These provisions apply mutatis mutandis to military aircraft .
5 . These provisions also apply to any other duly authorized ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service .
Article111
Right of hot pursuit
1 . The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the laws and regulations of that State .
Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters , the archipelagic waters , the territorial sea or the contiguous zone of the pursuing State , and may only be continued outside the territorial sea or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted .
It is not necessary that , at the time when the foreign ship within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone receives the order to stop , the ship giving the order should likewise be within the territorial sea or the contiguous zone .
If the foreign ship is within a contiguous zone , as defined in article 33 , the pursuit may only be undertaken if there has been a violation of the rights for the protection of which the zone was established .
2 . The right of hot pursuit shall apply mutatis mutandis to violations in the exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf , including safety zones around continental shelf installations , of the laws and regulations of the coastal State applicable in accordance with this Convention to the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf , including such safety zones .
3 . The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State .
4 . Hot pursuit is not deemed to have begun unless the pursuing ship has satisfied itself by such practicable means as may be available that the ship pursued or one of its boats or other craft working as a team and using the ship pursued as a mother ship is within the limits of the territorial sea , or , as the case may be , within the contiguous zone or the exclusive economic zone or above the continental shelf .
The pursuit may only be commenced after a visual or auditory signal to stop has been given at a distance which enables it to be seen or heard by the foreign ship .
5 . The right of hot pursuit may be exercised only by warships or military aircraft , or other ships or aircraft clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service and authorized to that effect .
6 . Where hot pursuit is effected by an aircraft :
( a ) the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis ;
( b ) the aircraft giving the order to stop must itself actively pursue the ship until a ship or another aircraft of the coastal State , summoned by the aircraft , arrives to take over the pursuit , unless the aircraft is itself able to arrest the ship .
It does not suffice to justify an arrest outside the territorial sea that the ship was merely sighted by the aircraft as an offender or suspected offender , if it was not both ordered to stop and pursued by the aircraft itself or other aircraft or ships which continue the pursuit without interruption .
7 . The release of a ship arrested within the jurisdiction of a State and escorted to a port of that State for the purposes of an inquiry before the competent authorities may not be claimed solely on the ground that the ship , in the course of its voyage , was escorted across a portion of the exclusive economic zone or the high seas , if the circumstances rendered this necessary .
8 . Where a ship has been stopped or arrested outside the territorial sea in circumstances which do not justify the exercise of the right of hot pursuit , it shall be compensated for any loss or damage that may have been thereby sustained .
Article112
Right to lay submarine cables and pipelines
1. All States are entitled to lay submarine cables and pipelines on the bed of the high seas beyond the continental shelf .
2. Article 79 , paragraph 5 , applies to such cables and pipelines .
Article113
Breaking or injury of a submarine cable or pipeline
Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that the breaking or injury by a ship flying its flag or by a person subject to its jurisdiction of a submarine cable beneath the high seas done wilfully or through culpable negligence , in such a manner as to be liable to interrupt or obstruct telegraphic or telephonic communications , and similarly the breaking or injury of a submarine pipeline or high - voltage power cable , shall be a punishable offence .
This provision shall apply also to conduct calculated or likely to result in such breaking or injury .
However , it shall not apply to any break or injury caused by persons who acted merely with the legitimate object of saving their lives or their ships , after having taken all necessary precautions to avoid such break or injury .
Article114
Breaking or injury by owners of a submarine cable or pipeline
of another submarine cable or pipeline
Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to provide that , if persons subject to its jurisdiction who are the owners of a submarine cable or pipeline beneath the high seas , in laying or repairing that cable or pipeline , cause a break in or injury to another cable or pipeline , they shall bear the cost of the repairs .
Article115
Indemnity for loss incurred in avoiding injury
to a submarine cable or pipeline
Every State shall adopt the laws and regulations necessary to ensure that the owners of ships who can prove that they have sacrificed an anchor , a net or any other fishing gear , in order to avoid injuring a submarine cable or pipeline , shall be indemnified by the owner of the cable or pipeline , provided that the owner of the ship has taken all reasonable precautionary measures beforehand .
SECTION 2 . CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE
LIVING RESOURCES OF THE HIGH SEAS
Article116
Right to fish on the high seas
All States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas subject to :
( a ) their treaty obligations ; ( b ) the rights and duties as well as the interests of coastal States provided for , inter alia , in article 63 , paragraph 2 , and articles 64 to 67 ; and ( c ) the provisions of this section .
Article117
Duty of States to adopt with respect to their nationals
measures for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas

Article118
Cooperation of States in the conservation and management
of living resources
States shall cooperate with each other in the conservation and management of living resources in the areas of the high seas .
States whose nationals exploit identical living resources , or different living resources in the same area , shall enter into negotiations with a view to taking the measures necessary for the conservation of the living resources concerned .
They shall , as appropriate , cooperate to establish subregional or regional fisheries organizations to this end .
Article119
Conservation of the living resources of the high seas
1 . In determining the allowable catch and establishing other conservation measures for the living resources in the high seas , States shall :
( a ) take measures which are designed , on the best scientific evidence available to the States concerned , to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ; ( b ) take into consideration the effects on species associated with or dependent upon harvested species with a view to maintaining or restoring populations of such associated or dependent species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened .
2. Available scientific information , catch and fishing effort statistics , and other data relevant to the conservation of fish stocks shall be contributed and exchanged on a regular basis through competent international organizations , whether subregional , regional or global , where appropriate and with participation by all States concerned .
3. States concerned shall ensure that conservation measures and their implementation do not discriminate in form or in fact against the fishermen of any State .
Article120
Marine mammals
Article 65 also applies to the conservation and management of marine mammals in the high seas .

Digital pinhole uses the same principles as a “ regular pinhole ” i.e. a small hole instead of lens , but as all digital cameras , it provides a way to instantly view your image and “ change film ” with less hustle .
Photographer Matt Devlin posted this awesome digital pinhole guide on DIYP flickr group .
I thought it is worth to repost it here ( with permission ) to help everyone see it .
Thanks Matt .
Step 1 – Get The Parts You Need
I used a Tobacco tin [ Altoids will work too , if you do n’t care about the squareness – ut ] ) , old body cap , double sided tape , nail , pin , hammer .
( now you could use different stuff that is what I had around the house , I am not going to list all the alternatives but a drink can would be fine and your nest best bet as your hole )
Step 2 – Put It All Together
Next I put the tape on the cap .
A few things here : I used tape because I do n’t have any spare caps at the moment I will pick some up next time I am in the city .
They are cheap and real handy for DIY , this big holed one is to fit my old film lenses to the canon !
And yes , a lot of the work was done for me with the hole already in the cap , but this is not hard to do yourself .
Just drill out a hole in the middle of a body cap .
It has to be big-ish , give yourself some room say a 10 mm - 15 mm drill .
Also you might need to pill the canon logo off it sits high I think that would get in the way .
And lastly I would glue the tin on if it was a long - term fix but I need the cap back that big hole was hard to do
Step 3 – The Hole
The next step is the hole , now a tin is too hard for a pin to go through so I taped it with a nail first .
Not all the way though , just till there was a dent on the other side of the tin .
You only want a small hole .
The smaller the better ; the rounder the better too but we will see how we go .
The pin was next I just pushed it through with my thumb and pointer finger touching the tin as support , so I only let the tip of the pin through .
If the hole is small : higher aperture , sharper photos , bigger depth of field .
A bigger hole will be faster but not as sharp .
The Hole
Stick the cap on the back of the tin as centered as you can .
You can do this by eye , and if you miss a bit it is not the end of the world
And this is it all ready to go !
Added benefit of the tobacco tin it comes with a free lens cap !!
First Shot & Results
An advantage with digital is that you can still use the light meter so a lot of the hard work ( or skill if you like ) is done .
The bottle is actually my DIY blower it ’s an old squeeze sauce bottle cleaned out and works a treat as a camera blower .
( Wow two DIY projects in the one thread good value if I ever seen it ! )
Well there you have it .
I hope you got something out of it , and if you have any ways to improve on , it or want to share your design I would love to see it .

The Jury Is In
The Ruling on McDowell 's " Evidence "
Jeffery Jay Lowder ( editor )
Introduction ( 1997 ) by Jeffery Jay Lowder
Josh McDowell 's Evidence That Demands a Verdict ( hereafter , " ETDAV " ) is arguably one of the most influential Christian apologetic books today .
The purpose of Jury shall be to evaluate how well it does .
Chapter 1 . The Uniqueness of the Bible ( 1997 ) by Farrell Till
In ETDAV , McDowell begins his defense of the Bible with the claim that it is unique .
He parades before us an array of " scholars " to testify to various features of the Bible that qualify it to be considered " different from all others " [ books ] , as if anyone would seriously try to deny that the Bible is unique , i.e. , different from all others .
At the very beginning of my analysis of this chapter of ETDAV , I will concede that the Bible is undeniably unique .
Certainly , there is no other book like it , but this fact , as we will see , becomes more of an embarrassment to the Bible than proof of its divine origin .
Chapter 3 . The Canon of the Bible ( 1999 ) by Larry Taylor
A critical reply to chapter three of Josh McDowell 's Evidence That Demands a Verdict .
Chapter 4 . Reliability and Belief ( 1999 ) by James Still
In this essay , the author reacts to Josh McDowell 's Chapter 4 entitled " Reliability of the Bible " in his book ETDAV .
He first distinguishes between Pauline faith and McDowell 's insistence that the Bible reveals historically true propositions , which the author calls the " reliability doctrine . "
McDowell 's reliability doctrine is then examined from three perspectives : biblical criticism , archaeology , and philosophy .
The author concludes that the gospel narratives are not to be understood as factually true propositions of history , but rather they communicate the theological meaning of faith in Christ .
Chapter 5 . Josh McDowell 's " Evidence " for Jesus : Is It Reliable ? ( 2000 ) by Jeffery Jay Lowder
In the fifth chapter of ETDAV entitled , " Jesus - - A Man of History , " Josh McDowell lists a series of " sources for the historicity of Jesus . "
According to the table of contents of ETDAV , this chapter lists " documented sources of the historical person of Jesus of Nazareth apart from the Bible . "
In this chapter I shall consider each of McDowell 's sources .
Although I agree with McDowell that there was a historical Jesus , I shall argue that most of McDowell 's sources do not provide independent confirmation of the historicity of Jesus .
Chapter 6 . A Rejoinder to " Jesus - God 's Son " ( 1997 ) by Robert M. Price
Virtually all the rest of McDowell 's sixth chapter is taken up with defending what no one challenges : that various New Testament writers believed Jesus Christ was a heavenly being come to earth .
That McDowell can for a moment imagine that such scripture prooftexting even begins to address the objections of nonbelievers shows once again that he really has no intention of engaging them .
He is simply a cheer - leader for fundamentalism , preaching to the choir .
Chapter 7 . The Trilemma - Lord , Liar , or Lunatic ? ( 1995 ) by Jim Perry
A critique of chapter seven of Josh McDowell 's Evidence That Demands a Verdict .
Chapter 8 . The Great Preposterous ( 1997 ) by Robert M. Price
If anyone needed further proof that apologetics as practiced by Josh McDowell is merely an exercise in after - the - fact rationalization of beliefs held on prior emotional grounds , I welcome him to Chapter 8 of ETDAV .
One can only say again that McDowell is the worst enemy of his own faith : with defenders like this , who needs attackers ?
The more seriously one takes him as a representative of his faith , the more seriously one will be tempted to thrust Christianity aside as a tissue of grotesque absurdities capable of commending itself only to fools and bigots .
Chapter 9 . Did " Top Psychics " Predict Jesus ? ( 1999 ) by Robert M. Price
As I will try to show in this article , defenders of the fundamentalist Christian faith , like Josh McDowell , have in fact lost the luxury of an easy appeal to fulfilled prophecy even if they remain stubbornly oblivious of the advances of modern biblical scholarship ; this is because biblical scholarship has thrown their appeals to the " proof from prophecy " so seriously into question that their task is now to defend it , no longer to use it as a powerful defense for something else , i.e. , the true messiahship of Jesus .
Any appeal to " proof from prophecy " today only lengthens the line of defense rather than shortening it .
Chapter 10 .
Why I Don't Buy the Resurrection Story ( 2004 ) by Richard Carrier [ Index ]
As a historian with a good knowledge of Greek , Richard Carrier is finally qualified to make a professional judgement in the matter .
Now the fifth edition of a project that began in 1998 , this essay explains why he finds the Resurrection to be an unconvincing argument for becoming a Christian .
Chapter 11 . Critique of Josh McDowell 's Non-Messianic Prophecies ( n.d. ) by Steven Carr
' Sceptics ' are not interested in bashing the Bible as such .
They use the Bible and contemporary documents which shed light on the Bible to try to find out what was really happening , what the Biblical writers really meant to say .
If it turns out that they were divinely inspired prophets , then that would be accepted .
It just so happens that they were n't and the archeological evidence discovered this century and the Biblical texts themselves show that they were n't .
Chapter 12 .
The Uniqueness of the Christian Experience ( 1999 ) by Edward T. Babinski
In his chapter on " The Uniqueness of the Christian Experience " ( a chapter that McDowell or his editorial staff chose to delete from the latest edition of ETDAV ) , he made a variety of sweeping claims about the " Christian Experience , " and also argued for the uniqueness of the Christian experience in history , but McDowell did not investigate history very deeply , nor the lives and writings of the Christians whom he cited , some of whom came to hold different views on a wide variety of theological subjects .
Lastly , McDowell seems to have only examined superficially his own youthful conversion experience ( any reasonable analysis of which would seem to confirm how young and emotionally unstable he was when he converted ) .

Canonical has unveiled a streamlined Ubuntu - Linux interface for those wanting almost instant web gratification .
The Unity desktop targets netbooks and touch - screen devices , re-orientating the Linux distro's interface so that the dock runs down the left - hand - side of the screen , while offering a finger - friendly launch menu for frequently - accessed applications .
The idea is to reduce on - screen clutter .
Canonical also unveiled Ubuntu Light , which is based on Unity .
It features chat , IM , a browser , and a media player .
Canonical claimed it 'll get you surfing , Facebooking , and checking photos within seven seconds of hitting the start button on a Dell Mini 10 v .
Both were detailed at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in La Hulpe , Belgium .
The re-oriented Ubuntu Unity interface , on paper
" It 's not about how fast you appear to boot , " Ubuntu creator Mark Shuttleworth blogged .
" It 's about how fast you actually deliver a working web browser and Internet connection . "
The secret to fast - boot seems to be that Unity does n't support what Shuttleworth called " traditional file management . "
Ubuntu Light is built for PCs running Windows .
It 's designed for dual - boot environments , which Shuttleworth called a new frontier for Canonical .
" Traditionally , it 's been an ' either / or ' proposition - either Windows in markets that prefer it , or Ubuntu in markets that do n't .
The dual - boot opportunity gives us the chance to put a free software foot forward even in markets where people use Windows as a matter of course , " Shuttleworth blogged .
" Ubuntu Netbook Light , or Ubuntu Desktop Light , will give OEM's the ability to differentiate themselves with fast - booting Linux offerings that are familiar to Ubuntu users and easy to use for new users , safe for web browsing in unprotected environments like airports and hotels . "
Unity is planned for Ubuntu Netbook 10.10 , due in October , and it 's available today as a PPA supporting minimalist , stateless configurations that suit dual - boot environments , Shuttleworth said .
But Canonical wants input on how to add support for more applications to Unity and update that speedy file management system to make a device running Unity capable of becoming a primary working space rather than just something that 's used for occasional web use .
For all their hype , Netbooks are often purchased as a second machine , meant to accompany the user 's beefier work or home PC . ®
Erik Schelzig :
Who does he think he is ?
You know it 's time for state lawmakers to go home when they start fainting during their sessions .
House Speaker Kent Williams , who is diabetic , collapsed this morning as he presided from the podium .
Lawmakers crowded around the fallen Williams , and he hopped up a few minutes later and drank a little orange juice .
On his way to the Legislative Plaza cafeteria , he smiled and said he was OK .
Just a case of low blood sugar , he said .
He returned to the House podium this afternoon .
" Like a dummy , I did n't eat breakfast this morning , " Williams said .
" I 've been diabetic for 20 years and that 's only the second time that 's happened , that my blood sugar got that low .
But I 'm fine . "
In other news , state troopers dragged the AP's Erik Schelzig out of the chamber as he was using his cell phone to take pictures of the collapsed Williams .
Taking pictures is n't against House rules , but the troopers apparently got a little carried away in the excitement .
A few legislators were in Schelzig 's face about it , too .
One of them called him " a piece of shit . "
Another one threatened to " whup his ass . "
" They stormed in with the troopers and everything and dragged him out , " Rep. Gerald McCormick , R - Chattanooga , told us .
" The speaker was passed out on the floor and I guess some people thought it was disrespectful " to take pictures of it .
Something tells
Pith these lawmakers might live to regret starting this little fight with the press .
Update :
The press corps is in a tizzy over all this and threatening reprisals .
" These are the tactics of Afghan opium warlords when they do n't like shit , " one writer says .
Pith is n't sure we can control this volatile situation .
Lately , I ’ve been thinking about phishing .
Again .
If we want users to take our sensible advice and use different passwords everywhere , then they ’ve got to be able to remember those passwords and move them from machine to machine .
In order to do that with any ease , we ’ve got to store them in the cloud .
But the question is , how to do that securely ?
So , that ’s what I ’ve been working on for a while , and the result is Nigori , a protocol and open source implementation for storing secrets in the cloud .
It does n’t require you to trust anyone ( other than your completely insecure client , of course … I ’m working on that , too ) .
The storage server(s ) are incapable of getting hold of the keying material , and if you want you can use splits to ensure that individual servers can’t even attack the encrypted secrets .
Of course , Nigori is n’t just for passwords , you could also use it to store private keys and the like .
For example , Salmon can use it to store signing keys .
The source is in a bit of a state right now , following some hack ’n ’slay related to appspot ’s crypto … oddities , but I ’ll post about that soon .
For now , in case you missed it above , here ’s an overview document .

The burning question : a blu or not a blu ?
Reading the tale end of the COTLD thread it looks like a no at the mo , but we can but hope .
I have the EC , AWE and Grindhouse release of this , it is my favourite Fulci flick , and I 'm still looking forward to seeing what this release will be like as it could have massive potential , especially when considering what is already available .
Edit by Nosferatu@Cult Labs :
Unfortunately something has cropped up which means that the proposed release date of February 14 has had to be put back four weeks to March 14 .
I thought as it was now ' official ' , we should have a thread .

Soon , keeping your head down wo n't be enough to stump high - tech security cameras , thanks to Pentagon - funded researchers developing mini-cameras that can nab threats by hunting down – and scanning – their eyeballs .
A team of electrical engineers at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) , led by Professor Marc Christensen , first created the cameras with funding from Darpa , the Pentagon 's research agency .
Called Panoptes , the devices use low - resolution sensors to create a high - res image that can be captured using a lightweight , ultra - slim camera .
Because they do n't use a lens , the cameras were originally designed for miniature drone sensors and troop helmet - cams .
Only a year later , the Pentagon is giving SMU another $ 1.6 million , to merge the cameras with active illumination and handheld Pico projection devices .
This allows photos captured on small devices to be transformed for large - format viewing .
Whereas the first goal of the program was to create slim cameras with the power of a lens , the latest technology " lets us do even more than what a lens could do , " Christensen told Danger Room .
" This platform is really just the base , upon which we 'll focus on different applications , " Christensen said .
" Now , we 're enhancing resolution even more , so the images are a 3 - D map with even better , more accurate details . "
The new devices will yield a robust 3 - D image that 'll be useful for seeing in caves and dark urban areas , and for the creation of versatile " non-cooperative " iris-detection security cameras .
Smart - Iris , the name of the new Panoptes innovation , is being developed in conjunction with SMU Professor Delores Etter , who specializes in biometric identification .
It 'll eliminate problems like glare , eyelashes , dim lighting – and an unwillingness to stop and stare directly into a dedicated iris-detection camera .
Instead , Panoptes devices will zero in on a face , no matter angle or movement , then narrow right into the iris .
A long line of people , moving through a line , could be scanned by wall - mounted cameras and they would n't even notice it was happening .
And new algorithms are being developed by Etter and colleagues to identify individuals based on segments of their iris , rather than a full frontal scan .
" Ideally , when you walk down a hallway , no matter where your head is looking , the device can grab your eyeball and detect what it needs to , " Christensen said .
And where possible security and defense applications are concerned ?
" You can let your imagination fly with that one . "
And with this latest development , Christensen also sees widespread civilian application , as part of " the cell phone of the future . "
He 'd like to see the camera - projection device incorporated into phones , and says they'd be able to photograph the page of a book " down to the smallest lettering , " or detect counterfeit cash by " picking up the texture of a $ 20 bill . "

Rowan Atkinson wore the black leather codpiece throughout the series
A codpiece worn by Rowan Atkinson in the 1986 TV series Blackadder , set in medieval times , is being auctioned in Berkshire .
The codpiece was a covering at the front of the crotch and formed an essential part of the well - dressed Elizabethan man 's wardrobe .
It accentuated the genital area and was held closed by string ties or buttons .
The garment is expected to sell for £ 1,000 at the TV and Film Costumes auction at Cameo in Midgham on Sunday .
Jon King , from Cameo , said : " This is possibly the most iconic costume item in the series .
" There is a lot of interest world - wide in this auction , as we are live on the computer as well as selling in the room . "
Other lots being auctioned include the khaki ski suit used by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in The World is Not Enough in 1999 .
It is expected to fetch up to £ 1,500 .

“ The great weight of empirical studies discounts the role of three strikes in reducing crime , ” states a 2004 report signed by six criminal - law professors , including Franklin Zimring at U.C. Berkeley .
Still , Prop 66 fell short , with 47 percent of the vote .
Now California is in the midst of fiscal calamity .
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy , who had been a judge in California , recently bemoaned state sentencing and spending on prisons .
In an address at Pepperdine University , he said that “ the three - strikes law sponsor is the correctional officers ’ union , and that is sick ! ”
And yet Schwarzenegger has vowed not to touch the law .
Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown , the leading Republican and Democratic contenders to succeed him in November , are just as unbending .
IF THERE ’S A WAY to reform three strikes , it may follow Norman Williams ’s route out of prison .
Michael Romano , who is 38 , got his client released without opposition from the L.A. district attorney by forging a working relationship with Cooley ’s office .
The 63 - year - old Republican prosecutor seems an unlikely ally for a young defense lawyer .
He joined the D.A. ’s office straight out of law school .
His office notched more death sentences last year than the state of Texas , and his lunchmates include Pete Wilson , the former governor who signed three strikes into law .
Yet despite his conservative bona fides , Cooley shares the conviction that some number of third - strike offenders like Norman Williams do n’t belong in prison for life .
After three strikes became law , Cooley watched one of his colleagues in the D.A. ’s office prosecute Gregory Taylor , a homeless man who at dawn one morning in 1997 went to a church where he ’d often gotten meals and pried open the door to its food pantry .
The priest later testified on his behalf .
Taylor ’s first crime was a purse - snatching ; his second was attempting to steal a wallet .
He did n’t hurt anyone .
Taylor was sentenced to life .
“ It was almost one - upmanship , almost a game — bye - bye for life , ” Cooley says , remembering the attitude in the office .
Three years later , Cooley ran for D.A. on a platform of restrained three - strikes enforcement , calling the law “ a necessary weapon , one that must be used with precision and not in a scatter - gun fashion . ”
In office , he turned his critique into policy .
The L.A. district attorney ’s office no longer seeks life sentences for offenders like Norman Williams or Gregory Taylor .
The presumption is that prosecutors ask for a life sentence only if a third - strike crime is violent or serious .
Petty thieves and most drug offenders are presumed to merit a double sentence , the penalty for a second strike , unless their previous record includes a hard - core crime like murder , armed robbery , sexual assault or possession of large quantities of drugs .
During Cooley ’s first year in office , three - strikes convictions in Los Angeles County triggering life sentences dropped 39 percent .
No other prosecutor ’s office in California has a written policy like Cooley ’s , though a couple of D.A. ’s informally exercise similar discretion .
It ’s a mistake , though , to cast Cooley as a full - tilt reformer .
He opposed Prop 66 for ignoring a defendant ’s criminal history .
Instead , in 2006 , he offered up his own bill , which tracked his policy as D.A. , taking minor drug crimes and petty theft off the list of three - strikes offenses unless one of the first two strikes involved a crime that Cooley considers hard - core .
For staking out even this middle ground , Cooley became prosecutor non grata among his fellow D.A. ’s .
No district attorney , not even the most liberal , supported his bill , and it died in Senate committee .
Cooley could once again pay a price for his three - strikes record .
This spring , he announced his candidacy for California attorney general .
His Republican rivals have hammered him for his moderate stance .
“ He ’s acting as an enabler for habitual offenders , ” State Senator Tom Harman told me .
“ I think that ’s wrong .
I want to put them in prison . ”
The race has developed into a litmus test : for 15 years , no serious candidate for major statewide office has dared to criticize three strikes .
If Cooley makes it through his party ’s primary on June 8 — and especially if he goes on to win in November — the law will no longer seem untouchable .
If he loses , three strikes will be all the more difficult to dislodge .
ONLY a few months ago Kevin Rudd , Australia ’s prime minister , was painting a dark picture about looming storm surges , rising sea-levels , a fall of over 90 % in irrigated farming and a drop of nearly 2.5 % in GNP over this century unless Australia took action against climate change .
“ Action now , ” he declared .
“ Not action delayed . ”
But this week Mr Rudd climbed down from what seemed a defining pledge of his leadership .
Instead of using this year to get parliament to adopt an emissions - trading scheme that would put a price on carbon pollution , action will now be delayed until 2013 at least .
Some wonder if it will ever happen at all .
Few leaders have staked more than Mr Rudd on tackling climate change .
The issue helped him lead the Labor Party to power in late 2007 , after the former conservative coalition government had largely ignored it .
Relying on coal for most of its electricity , Australia is one of the world ’s highest carbon - emitters per person .
Mr Rudd hoped that forcing it to change how it uses energy would give the country clout in forging a global consensus .
All that unravelled late last year .
His government ’s planned cap - and - trade scheme set targets to cut carbon emissions by 5 % of 2000 levels by 2020 , or 25 % as part of concerted global action .
Having initially supported the scheme , the main opposition Liberal Party used its controlling numbers in parliament ’s upper house in early December to block it for a second time .
The failure of the Copenhagen climate summit that month took more shine off the vision .
With an election due this year , Mr Rudd always held a constitutional trump card : the power to dissolve both houses of parliament together , and resubmit the bill to the new parliament .
Instead , looking somewhat sheepish , he announced in Sydney on April 27th that the government would now do nothing until the period covered by the Kyoto protocol ends in late 2012 .
He offered two excuses : the need for more time to judge any global actions on climate change before Australia goes ahead itself ; and the opposition ’s “ backflip ” in parliament .
The backflip may be just as much Mr Rudd’s .
In a speech in November to the Lowy Institute , a think - tank , he dismissed as parochial and “ absolute political cowardice ” the notion that Australia should not act until others do .
Citing government figures , he warned that a delay would end up costing Australia 15 % more to adapt to climate change later .
A Lowy poll this week found that 72 % of those questioned thought Australia should take action to reduce carbon emissions before a global deal is reached .
But the share who were not prepared to pay higher electricity bills had risen by about half in two years .
Another poll by the Climate Institute , a lobby group , found support for Mr Rudd in dealing with climate change had dropped by ten points from February last year , to 36 % this month .
John Connor , the institute ’s head , reckons both polls reflect Australians ’ frustration at the failure to get a scheme started , rather than any wavering in faith in the scientific evidence for climate change .
Mr Rudd ’s own wavering suggests reluctance to let an issue that has turned messy spoil his re-election chances .
He has recently promised to spend A$ 5.4 billion ( $ 4.9 billion ) to buy the support of Australia ’s states for his planned takeover of the country ’s health system by the federal government .
This seems a surer vote - winner than an emissions - trading scheme that opposition scare tactics portray as a “ great big new tax on everything ” .
But “ political cowardice ” may cost votes , too .
Do n’t Vote , It Only Encourages
Them !
We oppose the idea of forming a ‘ new workers ’ party ’ or tagging along with the latest left - wing electoral coalition .
The main aim of a political party is to acquire power , and power is a corrupting force , as our political elite have demonstrated .
In the words of the political theorist Anton Pannekoek …
“ … a party is an organization that aims to lead and control the working class …
The workers should not blindly accept the slogans of others , nor of our own groups but must think , act , and decide for themselves . ”
We believe that the working - class can and must assert itself politically without having to participate in elections and vote for the least worst option on the ballot paper .
At our disposal we have :
DIRECT ACTION – when people fight for their interests or against an injustice by taking matters into their own hands , rather than going through the ‘ official ’ political / bureaucratic channels .
Examples include : wildcat strikes , boycotts , workplace occupations , mass pickets , autonomous protests .
SOLIDARITY – this is a not a just a word , it ’s a weapon .
By sticking together and actively supporting others , our chances of achieving victory in struggles are multiplied .
DIY DEMOCRACY – we do n’t need political bosses or bureaucrats controlling us , calling the shots and using power on our behalf .
Obviously there needs to be people who are delegated the responsibility of organising and administering things , but they should be constantly accountable to the rank - and - file and decision - making power must remain at the grassroots .
DON’T LEAVE POLITICS TO THE POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS !
US President Barack Obama is preparing to make a statement on the position of the embattled US forces chief in Afghanistan .
It follows a meeting at which Gen Stanley McChrystal was asked to explain his criticism of US officials .
US media reports say Mr Obama will announce that Gen McChrystal is to be replaced .
Mr Obama had said the statements in Rolling Stone magazine showed " poor judgement " .
He is due to speak at 1330 Washington time ( 1730 GMT ) .
Gen McChrystal had been due to attend Wednesday 's monthly meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan and face some of those he - and his aides - criticised so publicly .
But it appears that he did not do so after meeting President Obama .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai has indicated that he does not want Gen McChrystal replaced .
' Enormous mistake '
Gen McChrystal arrived back in Washington in the early hours local time after being summoned from Afghanistan .
MARDELL'S AMERICA McChrystal 's disappointment with the president was established at their first meeting .
The general apparently felt Obama was n't very interested Mark Mardell , BBC North America editor Read Mark 's blog
Gen McChrystal quickly apologised for the magazine article , The Runaway General , written by Michael Hastings and due out on Friday , extending his " sincerest apology " and saying it showed a lack of integrity .
" It was a mistake reflecting poor judgement and should never have happened , " he said .
US media reports said Gen McChrystal had submitted his resignation , but it was up to the president to decide whether to accept it .
There has been no official comment on the reports .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Tuesday that the president was " angry " and that Gen McChrystal had made " an enormous mistake " .
Mr Gibbs said " all options were on the table " regarding the fate of the general and wondered " what in the world was he thinking ? "
Some experts suggest Mr Gibbs 's harsh words were to make the president look tough and give him the option of keeping the general on after a warning .
However , some lawmakers have called for Gen McChrystal to quit .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says President Obama has had to choose between continuity in leadership in Afghanistan at a crucial time , and a unified leadership which shows him respect as commander - in - chief .
At the White House meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan , Gen McChrystal was due to face :
Joe Biden .
Gen McChrystal had mocked the vice - president when asked a question about him .
" Are you asking about Vice - President Biden ?
Who 's that ? "
Karl Eikenberry .
Gen McChrystal said he felt " betrayed " by the US ambassador to Kabul during the long 2009 White House debate on troop requests for Afghanistan
James Jones .
One of Gen McChrystal 's aides says the national security adviser is a " clown ... stuck in 1985 "
Richard Holbrooke .
Gen McChrystal says of an e-mail from the US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan : " Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke ... I do n't even want to open it "
The article also appeared to be critical of the president himself .
Referring to a key Oval Office meeting with Mr Obama a year ago , an aide of Gen McChrystal says it was " a 10 - minute photo - op " .
" Obama clearly did n't know anything about him , who he was ... he did n't seem very engaged .
The boss was pretty disappointed , " the aide says .
In his first comments on the issue on Tuesday , President Obama said : " I think it 's clear that the article in which he and his team appeared showed ... poor judgement . "
Reduced casualties
Duncan Boothby , a special assistant to Gen McChrystal who organised the Rolling Stone journalist 's access to the commander , has resigned as a result of the article .
A spokesman for the Taliban said Gen McChrystal 's recall was another sign of the start of the " political defeat " for US policies in Afghanistan .
But a spokesman for Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai said on Wednesday that the Afghan leader believed replacing Gen McChrystal " would not be helpful " for peace and stability .
The spokesman , Waheed Omar , said : " We hope there is not a change of leadership of the international forces here in Afghanistan and that we continue to partner with Gen McChrystal . "
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Afghanistan says there is a belief among Afghan officials that Gen McChrystal has brought real improvement on reducing civilian casualties caused by the coalition - they are down 44 % so far this year .
There will be a special BBC programme on the implications of General McCrystal 's meeting with President Obama on BBC World News TV and BBC World Service Radio at 1930 GMT .
The top kill has failed .
Now BP is so desperate that they put a hotline on their website where you can call in and offer ideas .
We called it and a nice woman answered .
We gave her some ideas .
Listen !
So yeah , the number is right on BP 's website under " Do you have any ideas to help us ? "
So , go wild .
( Also , BP , you should give that woman a raise . )

This is so odd I just had to feature it .
When BMW launched the K1200R in 2006 , it was the world ’s most powerful naked bike .
But even with 163 hp on tap and immaculate handling , there ’s always someone , somewhere , who wants more .
To satisfy such folks , the German tuner Wunderlich hired the Dutch designer Bart van den Bogaard , and let him loose on the K1200R .
The result is the Wunderlich Caranguejeira , named after a large Brazilian spider .
And it looks … um … interesting .
( A UK bike magazine describes it as “ a savage nuclear - winter - surviving urban attack vehicle . ” )
The basic Caranguejeira conversion includes a new top yoke , tapered aluminum bars , triple headlights and a carbon fiber rear seat cowl .
The instruments are relocated to the top of the tank .
Power junkies can also fit a double air intake kit to boost output by 5 + hp , plus a Zard PowerGun silencer that might add a little more .
Interessant , nicht wahr ?
Notes : this data is not seasonally adjusted .
There is a very distinct seasonal pattern for imports , but not for exports .
LA area ports handle about 40 % of the nation 's container port traffic .
Sometimes port traffic gives us an early hint of changes in the trade deficit .
The following graph shows the loaded inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs ( TEUs : 20 - foot equivalent units or 20 - foot - long cargo container ) .
Although containers tell us nothing about value , container traffic does give us an idea of the volume of goods being exported and imported .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Loaded inbound traffic was up 13.6 % compared to April 2009 .
( up 15 % compared to last year using three month average ) .
Inbound traffic was still down 11 % vs. two years ago ( Apr 08 ) .
Loaded outbound traffic was up 13.7 % from April 2009 .
( +19 % using three months average ) Just as with imports , exports are still off from 2 years ago ( off 7 % ) .
Exports were off slightly in April after the increase in March .
For imports there is usually a significant dip in either February or March , depending on the timing of the Chinese New Year , and that did n't happen this year .
Then usually imports increase until late summer or early fall as retailers build inventory for the holiday season .
So this increase in April imports is part of the normal seasonal pattern .
Still , based on this data , it appears the trade deficit with Asia increased in April .
The old global imbalances continue ...

Just 9 percent of Jewish Israelis think US President Barack Obama ’s administration is more pro-Israel than pro-Palestinian , according to a Smith Research poll taken this week on behalf of Forty - eight percent said that the Obama presidency favored the Palestinian side , 30 % said his administration was neutral and 13 % chose not to express an opinion for the survey , which has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points .
The poll of a representative sample of 500 Israelis was conducted on Sunday and Monday after weeks of heightened tensions between Obama and Israel , but before the crisis intensified during Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu ’s visit to the White House .
Respondents who consider themselves right - wing were more likely than the rest of the population to characterize the Obama administration as more pro-Palestinian ( 72 % ) .
Those who define themselves as left - wing were more likely to call the administration in Washington more pro-Israel ( 16 % ) .
The number of Israelis who see Obama ’s policies as pro-Israel has risen from 4 % in the last Smith Research poll taken on behalf of thein August .
In that poll , 51 % of Jewish Israelis said Obama ’s administration was more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israel , while 35 % considered it neutral and 10 % declined to express an opinion .
A widely reportedpoll published on June 19 that put the first figure at 6 % had been cited by top officials in both the White House and the Prime Minister ’s Office as a catalyst for American efforts to improve the American - Israeli relationship .
Taken shortly after Obama reached out to the Muslim world in a landmark address in Cairo on June 14 , that poll found that 50 % of those sampled considered the administration ’s policies more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israeli , and 36 % said the policies were neutral .
The remaining 8 % did not express an opinion .
Obama fared better among Israelis in a May 17 poll , on the eve of the first White House meeting between Netanyahu and Obama .
Then , 31 % labeled Obama pro-Israel , 14 % considered him pro-Palestinian , 40 % said he was neutral , and 15 % declined to give an opinion .
The May poll found that Israelis ’ views of Obama ’s predecessor in the Oval Office , George W. Bush , were nearly the opposite .
Some 88 % of Israelis considered Bush ’s administration pro-Israel , 7 % said he was neutral and just 2 % labeled him pro-Palestinian .
Obama had appeared to receive much better numbers in a Dialog poll published last Friday in .
Both the English and Hebrew editions of Haaretz led with the headline , “ Poll : Most Israelis see Obama as fair , friendly toward Israel .
” The English edition elaborated near a picture of Obama that “ 69 % say Obama is fair and friendly .
” The English edition of the newspaper contained no graphics distributing the actual numbers , either online or in print .
The newspaper ’s Hebrew edition , however , included a graphic indicating that just 18 % of respondents considered Obama “ friendly ” toward Israel , 3 percentage points fewer than the 21 % who called the US president “ hostile ” to the Jewish state .
Ten percent did not know , and 51 % defined Obama ’s approach to Israel using the Hebrew word “ inyani , ” which can be translated as matter - of - fact or businesslike but not as fair .
Thereported on Monday that ’s pollster , Tel Aviv University Prof.
Camil Fuchs , called the way the results of the poll were presented “ misleading .
” English Edition editor Charlotte Halle responded that “ published a fair and accurate representation of the surveyconducted by Prof. Camil Fuchs at the request of .
Any attemptto claim otherwise by another newspaper is false .
” Meanwhile , aCNN poll conducted on March 19 - 21 and released on Tuesday found that39 % of Americans see Israel as an ally , while another 41 % consider Israel friendly to the US but not an ally .
Twelve percent said theyconsider Israel unfriendly and 5 % said Israel is an enemy .
TheCNN survey was conducted through telephone interviews with 1,030 adultAmericans .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentagepoints .
Y'know , it kind of figures that Sarah Palin -- whose selection as John McCain 's running mate raised enduring questions about the Republicans ' vetting operations -- would have such a deft touch when it comes to endorsing candidates .
First there was the Nikki Haley fiasco , which of course is very much still ongoing .
Now we have another Palin endorsee , Idaho 's Vaughn Ward , caught red-handedly plagiarizing a well - known speech by ... Barack Obama !
Vaughn Ward , a GOP candidate for Idaho's First Congressional district , is facing charges that he swiped key passages from Barack Obama 's iconic 2004 Democratic National Convention speech for his own campaign kickoff speech in January .
The specific passages in question have since been spliced together by a Tea Party activist who asks , " Who Is Vaughn Ward Really ? "
Mike Tracy , a spokesman for Ward 's campaign tried to downplay the video , telling Politico that the attack was a sign that " [ f ] olks are getting desperate -- they 're saying anything to get Vaughn to go after him .
If anyone thinks he 's anything like Obama , they 're dead wrong . "
These allegations come after a series of missteps for the GOP candidate 's campaign .
Ward fired his campaign manager following an embarrassing discovery that he had borrowed heavily from the campaign language of various other GOP politicians .
Ward later sought to rebound from that hiccup with a high - profile appearance with Sarah Palin , who endorsed him -- along with other military veterans -- back in March , but the event was slightly tarnished by multiple reports showing that Ward had referred to Puerto Rico as a " country " during a recent debate .
Notes Jared Keller :
Palin stopped in Idaho to endorse Ward as the GOP nominee to challenge Democratic incumbent Walt Minnick in Idaho 's first congressional district .
Unfortunately for Palin , Ward has been subject to his own controversy after apparently plagiarizing a speech from another politician : Barack Obama .
More specifically , the congressional hopeful cribbed a passage nearly word - for - word from Obama 's famous speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , a speech which made him a household name .
" Palin 's endorsement is seen as something of great value among Republicans , " writes Adams .
" But the string of unfortunate events that occurred not long after Palin has given her support makes one wonder if there is n't a ' reverse Midas touch ' effect : that rather than turning things to gold , Palin instead turns everything she touches into ... well , the opposite of gold . "
One of Vaughn 's GOP primary opponents , Lucas Baumbach , is being credited with the video .
Ah , the Schadenfreude .
The Most Badass Way To Get Dressed ( GIF )
There are several different ways to get undressed in sports .
One of those ways is to go one - on - one with Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin .
Another is to try defending Luol Deng on the hardcourt .
And then there is this way , which may require an unusual amount of trampolines , but still appears to be quite effective .
Sure , this guy may be getting dressed , rather than undressed , but I ’m pretty sure this trick can work both ways .

Do you want to play Zelda in 3D ?
In a recent Japanese consumer poll , only 8 per cent of Japanese consumers expressed a desire to buy the forthcoming Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming console .
We expect to see the new 3DS at E3 this coming June .
Although whether or not we will manage to get some hands ( and eyes ) on time with it at the show remains to be seen .
However , while the UK gets set to bathe in the so - called " summer of 3D " – with Samsung launching its first 3D TV campaign this month – Japan 's consumers seem to be shrugging their shoulders nonchalantly in response to the promise of new 3D gaming tech from Nintendo .
No glasses required
Nintendo says that the 3DS will be " enjoyed with 3D effects without the need for any special glasses " and that it is set to be the successor to the massively - popular DS .
Japanese organisation goo Research polled 1,059 members of its monitor group - 52.9 per cent of who were male , 16.1 per cent teenagers , 17.8 per cent twenty - somethings , 21.5 per cent thirty - somethings , 16.2 percent in their forties and 28.3 percent older than fifty .
While 42.1 per cent of those polled already owned a Nintendo DS , DS Lite , DSi or a DSi XL — a mere 8.8 per cent , " would … like to get the recently - announced Nintendo 3DS , featuring 3D that does n't require special glasses . "
Whether or not this poll turns out to be representative of Japan 's famously gaming - obsessed wider population of course remains to be seen .

Rage Against the Machine frontman
Zack de la Roca is no stranger to shredding public policy in his line of work : indeed , rebel music has been the man ’s lifeblood for decades .
Though already a legend in the music world , this is one socially motivated rocker who is not about to stop screaming for change .
De la Roca ’s latest endeavor , The Sound Strike , pitches him as not just the frontman to the most politically relevant mainstream rock group in the world , but also as the loudest voice encapsulating a charge of hundreds of artists and music groups that have agreed to boycott the state of Arizona over its crackdown on Mexican immigrants .
ADVERTISEMENT
Since RAW STORY ’s last report on the group , Sound Strike ’s list of artists who ’ve joined the boycott has swelled to nearly 300 , with new names being added seemingly every day .
So far , artists to sign on for the boycott include major acts like Cypress Hill , Kanye West , Chris Rock , Connor Oberst , Rage Against the Machine , Serj Tankian , Nine Inch Nails , Rise Against , Maroon 5 , Massive Attack , Sonic Youth , Anti-Flag , Ozomatli , Tenacious D and many others .
The complete list was published online and featured 296 groups at time of this writing .
“ [ The new law ] forces the cops to hunt down and target anyone they ‘ reasonably suspect ’ that may be undocumented , ” the protest group noted in a press release .
“ And if the people they harass do n’t have proof that they were born in the U.S. , they can be detained and arrested .
This must be stopped . ”
“ Fans of our music , our stories , our films and our words can be pulled over and harassed every day because they are brown or black , or for the way they speak , or for the music they listen to , ” de la Roca wrote .
“ People who are poor like some of us used to be could be forced to live in a constant state of fear while just doing what they can to find work and survive .
This law opens the door for them to be shaked down , or even worse , detained and deported while just trying to travel home from school , from home to work , or when they just roll out with their friends .

“ Some of us grew up dealing with racial profiling , but this law ( SB 1070 ) takes it to a whole new low .
If other states follow the direction of the Arizona government , we could be headed towards a pre-civil rights era reality .
This unjust law was set into motion by the same Arizona government that refused to acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. day as a national holiday . ”
Sound Strike has also raised a petition to demand that President Obama take action against the state ’s immigrant crackdown .
The petition was available in English and Spanish .
“ We as people , as artists , as members of civil society , we have to intervene , ” de la Roca said in a recent interview .
“ That ’s where the Sound Strike has come into play .
It ’s a form of civil intervention by a group of artists who , number one , do not want to compromise the dignity of our brothers and sisters in the state of Arizona who are suffering through this kind of legislation . ”

Seoul , South Korea ( CNN ) -- South Korean President Lee Myung - bak announced Monday his country is suspending trade with North Korea , closing its waters to the North 's ships and adopting a newly aggressive military posture after the sinking of a South Korean warship .
" We have always tolerated North Korea 's brutality , time and again , " Lee said .
" We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean Peninsula .
But now things are different . "
" North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts , " he said , according to an English translation of the speech provided by Lee 's office .
" I will continue to take stern measures to hold the North accountable . "
The White House issued a statement Monday supporting South Korea 's measures , saying they were " called for and entirely appropriate . "
" Specifically , we endorse President Lee 's demand that North Korea immediately apologize and punish those responsible for the attack , and , most importantly , stop its belligerent and threatening behavior , " the White House statement said .
" U.S. support for South Korea 's defense is unequivocal , and the President has directed his military commanders to coordinate closely with their Republic of Korea counterparts to ensure readiness and to deter future aggression . "
South Korean military officials on Thursday announced the results of an official investigation into the sinking of the ship , the Cheonan , which concluded that North Korea fired a torpedo that cut the vessel in half .
North Korea has denied that it sunk the warship , which went down on March 26 , killing 46 sailors .
In the nationally televised speech Monday morning , Lee said his country was adopting a posture of " proactive deterrence " toward the North , announcing that " combat capabilities will be reinforced drastically " and that he will focus on improving national security readiness and military discipline .
" If our territorial waters , airspace or territory are violated , we will immediately exercise our right of self - defense , " Lee said .
Addressing the alleged attack , Lee said , " Once again , North Korea violently shattered our peace .
The sinking of the Cheonan constitutes a military provocation against the Republic of Korea by North Korea . "
Lee also admonished his own people , saying that until the attack " we had been forgetting the reality that the nation faces the most belligerent regime in the world . "
South Korea 's leader called on the North to apologize for the alleged attack and to punish those responsible for carrying it out .
Lee said the alleged attack violated armistice and nonaggression agreements between the two countries .
He said he will refer the incident to the U.N. Security Council " so that the international community can join us in holding the North accountable . "
Tensions between the nations have escalated since the South released its report on the sinking .
On Friday North Korea threatened to back out of the nonaggression pact with the South after Lee vowed " resolute countermeasures " against the North .
" Firstly , from now on ( North Korea ) will regard the present situation as the phase of a war ... " the North 's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Friday , according to South Korea 's Yonhap News Agency .
Should South Korea take steps to retaliate , North Korea will " strongly react to them with such merciless punishment as the total freeze of the inter-Korean relations , the complete abrogation of the north - south agreement on nonaggression and a total halt to the inter-Korean cooperation undertakings , " the committee 's statement said , Yonhap reported .
The United States strongly condemns North Korea 's sinking of a South Korean ship and is consulting with South Korea as it considers its response , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday .
" We 're in consultation with a host of different entities including the ( U.N. ) Security Council ... and we 're working closely with the South Koreans , " Gibbs said .
Lee 's speech Monday brimmed with references to the long history of acrimony between North and South Korea .
He spoke from the War Memorial of Korea , the country 's main war history museum , and noted that this year marks the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War .
" Permeating this War Memorial of Korea are the spirits of the soldiers of the Republic of Korea and United Nations who shed blood on this land , " he said .
" Also dedicated here was the monument memorializing the 46 fallen warriors of the corvette Cheonan . "

UPDATE : Greta Berlin , an organizer with the Free Gaza Movement , has just told Al Jazeera English that their lawyer in Israel has told them that 10 people have been killed as a result of the Israeli attack on the “ Freedom Flotilla ” aiming to break the Gaza blockade .
See below for more :
The Israeli Navy has reportedly attacked the Turkish boat that is part of the “ Freedom Flotilla ” loaded with humanitarian aid and 600 Palestine solidarity activists .
The flotilla was heading towards Gaza in an attempt to break Israel ’s blockade .
A “ tweet ” from the Free Gaza movement , one of the organizations that headed the flotilla , reports , “ At about 4:30 am , Israeli commandos dropped from helicopter onto deck of Turkish ship , immediately opened fire on unarmed civilians . ”
According to Turkish television , at least two people have been killed and dozens , perhaps up to 50 , have been injured .
Those injured may include European parliamentarians who were traveling with the boat .
( These are reports that are coming from Twitter , so keep that in mind , but the English version of Al Jazeera has an article up titled “ Israel ‘ attacks ’ Gaza aid fleet . ”
See here for live reports on Twitter from the topic # flotilla ) .
Protests are being called for across the country and the world .
In New York , according to several sources , a protest has been called for 3 p.m. Monday in Times Square .
The six boats were reportedly in international waters at the time of the Israeli attack .
For a live stream of what appears to be Turkish news television broadcasting reports and images from the Turkish boat , click here .
Turkey has also reportedly summoned Israel ’s ambassador based in Ankara , the Turkish capital , according to Electronic Intifada co-founder Ali Abunimah .
Iara Lee , who is on one of the boats , is reporting that thousands of people in Turkey are protesting outside the Israeli consulate , and there are also reports of thousands of people in Turkey storming the consulate .
For years , designers and editors have focused on a specific demographic of thin women , overlooking the many big and beautiful fashionistas .

In the world of online pizza delivery , Domino ’s patented Pizza Tracker stands alone .
But in recent months , the feature has faced a torrent of criticism from bloggers frustrated by what they perceive as the company ’s worst idea since bread bowl pasta .
The Pizza Tracker , launched a little more than two years ago at all Domino ’s stores , allows customers placing an online order at the Domino ’s Web site to follow the progress of their order from the shop to their front door .
Users receive an e-mail directing them to the order tracking page within seconds of placing an order and , without having to refresh the page , are told precisely when their pie is placed in the oven , checked for quality assurance and dispatched to their home .
Or are they ?
“ The Tracker is a fraud , ” claimed one pizza eater who requested anonymity .
In a rambling online post , the man insisted that , despite the tracker ’s insistence that his pizza had been successfully baked and cooked to perfection , Domino ’s had left numerous messages on his voicemail explaining that his order could not be filled because the store had run out of dough .
“ If the Pizza Tracker were legit , should n’t there be some message to say , ‘ Hey we ca n’t make your pizza , ’ instead of telling me Jeff is putting my pizza in the oven and its out for delivery with Jay ? ” he asked .
Another blogger watched in horror as the Tracker informed him that his order – which consisted entirely of soda bottles – had been “ placed in the oven . ”
“ Is this really patent - pending technology ?
I did n’t know you could patent bullshit , ” he said .
“ Did you actually place my bottles of Diet Coke in the oven ? ”
Tim McIntyre , the vice president of communications at Domino ’s , insisted that his company had not patented bullshit .
“ The Pizza Tracker is real , and it is accurate to within 30 seconds , ” McIntyre told The Daily Caller just seconds after we indicated to customer service that we were investigating the veracity of the Pizza Tracker ’s sometimes extraordinary claims .
Every update customers see on the Tracker except for the final ‘ delivered ’ update , McIntyre said knowingly , is triggered by a button press in the store itself .
And the names the Tracker provides of the employees making the pizza are accurate , he added , even though the Tracker told us that Aladdin was baking our pizza last weekend .
McIntyre acknowledged that the technology is n’t perfect , and occasional but unavoidable problems surface when customers make the mistake of ordering Coke sans pizza .
But even for proper pie orders , McIntyre said , the Tracker cannot accurately predict delivery time .
“ We did n’t want to create a GPS model to show where our drivers are , for safety reasons , but we figure it ’s no more than about nine minutes usually for the delivery to get from the store to the customer , ” he said .
There is no button that drivers press to mark an order ‘ delivered , ’ McIntyre added .
The Tracker simply marks an order ‘ delivered ’ about ten minutes after a driver indicates to the system that he has left the store with the order .
But the Tracker sometimes provides exceptionally misleading information as to the status of the pizza delivery , since it is not designed to inform customers that an order has failed due to an unforeseen circumstance ( say , an unexpected catastrophic lack of cheese ) .
If a franchise clears an order from its screens and ca n’t get in touch with customers to explain the situation , for example , it might appear that an order has been baked and ready when it has n’t , in fact , been cooked up at all .
The Tracker simply assumes that cleared orders are cooked orders .
Such are the costs of building a successful Pizza Tracker , McIntyre intoned with the grizzled intensity befitting a veteran salesman who ’s worked at the pizza chain ever since he graduated from college in 1985 , weathering calamity after calamity along the way .
He emphasized that , as long as you have access to your phone as the pizza is ferried from Domino ’s door to yours , there wo n’t be any problems .
And he ’s got the results to prove it .
“ In the last few years , Domino ’s has become the fourth - largest on - time retailer in America , so that would tell us the Tracker ’s a success , ” he said .
“ We know that 75 percent of people who order their pizzas spend at least a minute or two tracking the product online . ”
As restaurant expert Christopher Muller put it when the Tracker first launched : “ I guess they ’ll sell a ton of pizzas to people with no social life who are sitting in front of computers . ”

Magazine Preview : Our Village Voice
In many ways , Bryonn Bain , CC ’95 and Harvard Law ’01 leads a charmed life .
Admitted to college at 15 and president of his class for four years straight , Bain is now an award - winning slam poet , a working performance artist , and an occasional visiting professor at Columbia .
But his Ivy credentials have n’t protected Bain from being punished from what he calls “ walking while black . ”
After two acute experiences of racial - profiling , Bain organized “ Lyrics on Lockdown , ” a national tour that uses poetry and performance as a platform to raise awareness about mass incarceration and racial injustice in the prison system .
Bain is currently on tour performing his solo work , but Blue & White Features Editor Liz Naiden caught him in between stops to talk about his experience , his time at Columbia , his views on the prison system , and American race relations .
Blue &
White : I understand that you ’ve been wrongfully arrested twice .
Can you tell me about why you were arrested in Morningside Heights and why you wrote a piece in the Village Voice about that experience ?
Bryonn Bain : Like most black and Latino men in this country , I ’ve had multiple encounters with the police that have ranged from harassment on the street to multiple arrests and incarcerations .
In 1999 I was home for the weekend and I was coming out of the Latin Quarter , a club which at that time was on 96th .
And at this point I ’m in my second year of law school , thinking I know a little something , so I tell them , “ Listen , you guys are beyond your jurisdiction , and we have n’t done anything wrong so you need to get out of our way . ”
So we walk around them and head to the train , and just as we ’re swiping our Metrocards one cop comes down the stairs and arrests us , and it ’s kind of like that scene in the second Matrix movie where the agents just keep coming , the cops just keep coming .
And when we get back on the street , we look the bouncers in the face and even though they saw us do nothing wrong they say , “ Officers , they did it . ”
The cops accused me of stealing the laptop I had in my bag , my nice new Sony Vaio that I had brought with me to law school .
I told them I was a law student , and they say , “ Oh , where do you go to law school ? ” I say I go to Harvard .
He says , “ Oh my kid ca n’t afford to go there .
What , are you on a ball scholarship or something ? ” I said , “ Dude , I ’m 5 ’ 9 , and what ’s more , there are no ball scholarships in law school . ”
So they continued to taunt us , and the more we tried to tell them that we were just law - abiding citizens , the more they antagonized us .
So we spent the night in jail .
Because at the end of the night we were leaving the corner bodega and saw an altercation going on – there were some people on the street arguing with some people in a window above the store .
As we turn to go to the subway this bouncer from the club appears and because we happen to be the only people of color on the street at the time , they assumed that we were responsible for the problem .
Kellis Parker , who was the first black professor at Columbia law school and who I respect very much , came and got us out .
Only a week later at Harvard another fabulous professor , Lani Guinier , the first black woman to become a law professor at Harvard , asked us to write about an experience of injustice for class .
So she read my story and encouraged me to get it published and gave me contacts at The New York Times , The New Yorker , and a couple of other places .
The New Yorker never got back to me ; the Times did get back to me and said the article was a little risqué for them .
I ended up contacting Don Schwartz at the Village Voice and they ran it as the cover story .
When it came out they got flooded with responses , more responses than any other piece in the history of the Village Voice .
It continued to snowball , until the following week Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes called me and asked if I ’d like to be interviewed about my experience .
20,000 people heard the story on 60 Minutes , so I guess in retaliation someone at the NYPD started handing out my information , because the week after the interview I started discovering identity thefts .
One of those identity thefts later resulted in there being warrants out for my arrest , which I only realized after I was pulled over with a broken taillight .
My alias apparently was someone who had committed a felony , and I assume someone at the NYPD had given out my information , so he used my name , my social security number and my personal info .
He made bail , did n’t go to his court date , and so they issued warrants for my arrest with him as my alias .
So I was incarcerated again , this time for several days and I wrote about that again in the Village Voice .
After that I really started to do a lot of work in prisons because I realized I had a platform to talk about these issues that a lot of folks do n’t have .
What really hit home for me was that I got a letter soon after my arrest from someone on death row named Nanon Williams .
His letter said , “ Hey , they showed your Village Voice articles to a lot of the brothers on Death Row , and we ’re all so glad that you ’re saying what you ’re saying about racism in the prison system .
They wo n’t listen to us , cause we ’re on Death Row .
But a brother like you who has an elite education and access to these Ivy League institutions , and who can put it in the way that you put it , they ’ll listen to you . ”
That really encouraged me , so I organized a tour around the country with artists , activists , and educators to raise awareness about the prison crisis and mass incarceration .
We went to 25 states doing workshops and performances .
B&W : But you had been involved in prison activism before you were first arrested , correct ?
BB : My father was a Calypso singer from Trinidad and he made his way here singing about apartheid in South Africa .
So I grew up listening to those songs and those stories .
In 1989 , the first time that I set foot in a prison in upstate New York I did n’t have the same objectives of reform that I have now .
My brothers and I were just invited during the holidays to perform at a local prison in upstate New York .
And we kept going back every year to perform for the inmates who kind of did n’t have anybody to check with them and be with them during the holidays .
And that was over 20 years ago , and I did n’t realize that 10 years later I was going to have my own situation with the police .
I was familiar with prisons and performing in prison , so after I was arrested I started organizing and raising awareness and pursue the objective of de-carceration , because that ’s really what we need to do in this country .
The prison population has increased from 400,000 in the 1970 ’s to 2 million people now incarcerated .
The vast majority of people behind bars are in there for drug - related offenses .
We have more people incarcerated with mental illnesses than we have in mental institutions in this country .
And you do n’t see a bunch of folks who have Ivy League educations locked up , there is a direct connection to poverty and illiteracy .
So we need to realize that there is a problem in our society behind this .
B&W : What sort of activism were you involved in at Columbia ?
What else were you involved with here ?
BB : Well I was the first person to be president of my class for four years in a row , so I ’m proud of that .
I also spent a lot time involved in student movements .
You know we took over buildings on campus 3 out of the 4 years I was at Columbia .
We took over Low Library .
B&W : Seriously ?
Took over as in …
BB : We chained the doors , and we took over the building , and we would n’t let any of the administrators out of Low Library for the whole day .
That day , students ran Low .
B&W : What was the purpose of that ?
BB : It was because the administration was preparing to cut need - blind admissions and full - need financial aid .
A big part of the reason that I went to Columbia was because it was one of the places that offered a prestigious education but where it did n’t matter if your parents were able to pay , you could still attend the institution .
So we had about 800 students occupying Low Library and surrounding Low Library , and we chained the doors for most of that day in 1991 .
And we managed to save the policy .
The administration decided to change their minds after we got a lot of press , and the alumni heard about it and they spoke up .
I did that with Ben Jealous , the current president of the NAACP .
B&W : You know he ’s our class day speaker ?
BB : Oh yeah that ’s right !
That ’s a great thing for you guys .
When we took over the building , Ben was on the doors , and I was on the microphone spittin ’ poetry .
Then we took over Hamilton Hall in my junior year to try to save the Audubon Ball Room where Malcom X was assassinated .
Ben was actually one of the people who got suspended for that , along with 3 or 4 other people .
That was one of the battles that we did n’t win , so Columbia tore down the Audubon ball room on the corner of 168th street and put up a biotech facility .
Ben and I were both very involved in student activism .
I also worked on the Black Alumni Council and I started the Alumni of Color Outreach Program .
I contributed to the Double Discovery Center , which brings Harlem students to Columbia .
I also organized a whole series of guest lectures called “ More on the Core . ”
The idea was to challenge the idea that Europe is the only place that has seen advanced civilization in the world .
So we organized speakers come to talk about other civilizations that were n’t being represented in the core , including African civilizations that actually predated Greece and Rome , and which provided inspiration for Greece and Rome .
B&W : You started something called the Blackout Arts Collective in college also ?
BB : Ben and I , we started something through the Intercultural Resource Center called the Strange Fruit Cafe , after the Billie Holiday song .
It was sort of a night of spoken word and hip hop , anyway once a month we did that in Lerner .
So after I graduated Kellis Parker actually encouraged me , he said you ought to take this to other people , so we got permission to start working in public schools and then prisons , doing workshops and performing music , spoken word , and theater .
After my first incident with the police we organized the Lyrics on Lockdown national tour .
Chapters like ours sprung up in ten different cities around the country .
Now the idea has also morphed into the Lyrics on Lockdown course , which brings students into prisons to do these workshops .
I ’ve had undergrads and grad students at Columbia , NYU , and the New School who have taken the course and spent half their semester at Rikers Island prison , the largest penal colony in the world , and it ’s a way for them not only to teach prisoners but to learn something themselves .
The funding was recently cut at Columbia , after being on campus for 5 or 6 years .
It used to run out of the African American studies institute but that department is experiencing budget cuts .
There have been conversations about bringing it back to the law school , if there is student interest and student support then it may come back , but really if it is n’t a priority for students then it wo n’t be a priority for the administration .
The way we took over buildings back when I was a student , writing letters and just making waves , students need to realize how much power they have to get what they want on campus .
So if you do n’t get anything else in this interview , make sure you get that .
Students have a real power that is often unrealized .
Talk about issues , talk about things you want changed , and then go do something about it .
B&W : What was it like to come back to Columbia to teach ?
It sounds like you enjoyed it .
BB : I did , I loved it .
I tried to bring to my class the things that I always wanted as a student , so at NYU we did performances on the subway platform , because my work sort of links art and politics .
At Columbia we spent half of the semester talking about pedagogy , and then the second half of the semester we went once a week to Rikers and split up into workshops working with incarcerated people .
All of the students said that it was unlike any other course that they had ever taken .
The only reason I take a break from that is to pursue my art – I ’ve been doing another show myself called Lyrics From Lockdown .
It combines my story with the story of Nanon Williams , whos ’s been locked up since he was 17 years old , and now has a brand new trial because new evidence has come out showing that he did not commit the crime for which he ’s been incarcerated for the last 18 years .
B&W : Do you think that police brutality and the American prison system are getting better or worse ?
Do you see a trend ?
BB : You know a lot of people will say that America is post - race because Barack Obama is President .
I have some questions for those folks – was India post - gender when Indira Ghandi came to power ?
Was Bolivia post- class when a working class indigenous person took over there ?
The answer is no .
We should learn a lesson from the Clarence Thomas debacle – having a black face in a position of power does n’t mean that conditions have changed for the masses of black people .
Now Barack Obama is a far cry from Clarence Thomas , and there ’s no question that I would rather have Barack Obama as president than John McCain .
But at the same time I have the same kind of educational experience as Barack Obama – I went to Columbia and I went to Harvard Law School – and the police still threw my black ass in jail .
We are too often and too easily appeased by having minority faces in positions of power , but the bottom line is that there is still a lonely pack in this country of people who are brown and black and poor , and the bottom line is more people are still incarcerated in this country than in any country in the world .
Things have gotten better for certain parts of the community , but for certain parts of the community they ’ve gotten markedly worse .
It ’s hard to say that having a black president made things much better for you , particularly if you ’re someone like Nanon Williams who ’s been incarcerated for 18 years for a crime he did n’t commit .
A number of area salons and pet groomers are joining the ranks of those saving
.
But the Deep Water Horizon Response , the unified command for cleaning up
is n’t using these types of booms , said spokesman Mike Lutz , although he could n’t rule out their use elsewhere .
A Matter of Trust , the California - based non-profit organization spearheading the hair / fur collection , said on its website it is receiving about 500,000 pounds of hair and fur every few days to make booms to soak up the oil .
The organization did not respond to several days of telephone calls and e-mails for information on where the booms will be used .
Allison Nyholm of the American Petroleum Institute termed hair booms being used to clean up the gulf “ a bit of an urban myth , ” and said they would sink .
Still , several area salons say they are n’t dissuaded .
Mark J. Carr , owner of M Coiffure salon in Linglestown , said he ’s still willing to save hair and send it to Matter of Trust .
“ If it can get used in any capacity and helps the environment , that ’s good enough , ” Carr said .
“ I still want to put forth any effort I can to help , and hopefully they ’ll find a use for it somewhere , ” said Chrissy Hench of Clippers in Newport , who has collected a large box full of hair .

Illinois state capitol building .
The Fair Map Amendment , a citizen - led initiative in Illinois to reform the state constitution 's procedures on legislative redistricting , may not gather enough signatures to be presented before voters during the next election .
As of last Friday , organizers have collected only 120,000 of the 279,000 votes needed to bypass the state legislature and have the issue decided on solely by the voters in the November 2 election .
The current process of redistricting , or redrawing district lines every ten years following the nationwide census , is in the hands of the state legislature , or the General Assembly .
The maps are often drawn by party leaders , allowing incumbent legislators to minimize and discourage opposition in their districts and perpetuate the leading party 's dominance statewide .
Election statistics indicate that incumbents are successful in their reelection 98 percent of the time , and that Democrats have dominated legislative elections since they were able to draw the redistricting map in 2001 .
The Democratic Party has successfully reinforced their dominance through " spoking " , which involves extending districts in Chicago — a Democratic stronghold — out into the more Republican - leaning suburbs .
In addition to allowing more Chicago residents to become legislators , this method severely weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs .
Republicans , if given the chance to draw the maps , could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican - leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts .
The Fair Map Amendment , supported by Republicans and good - government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois , would take the redistricting process out of legislators ' hands and instead give that task to an independent , nine - member commission .
The amendment would apply to the redistricting of only state legislative districts , not US congressional districts .
The General Assembly would still have to approve the commission 's suggested map , however .
Proponents initially aimed to collect the required signatures by April 1 , but their inability to do so forced them to push their deadline to last Friday .
Even then , organizers were still unable to meet their goal , and they now have until May 3 to send the necessary paperwork to the Illinois Secretary of State 's office .
" We 're not having so much trouble ; it 's two weeks before we have to file , " says Jan Czarnik , a member of the League of Women Voters .
Czarnik suggests that the petition low number of signatures is due in part to not having " enough people circulating petitions in such a short amount of time . "
As Kent Redfield of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois–Springfield commented , " If you 've got basically volunteers circulating petitions rather than , say , political parties , people that are normally used to doing this , you 're going to have to have a larger margin of error . "
Another possible setback is that public opinion may not carry as much fervor as for other previously proposed amendments .
Republicans , who hold the minority in the legislature , have proposed the amendment through more conventional means — via the General Assembly — but have been unsuccessful .
Legislators also have considered other ways to reform the redistricting process .
A few Republican party leaders ' campaign funds have donated cash to the group organizing the petition , and House Minority Leader Tom Cross has asked the governor to call a special session on legislative redistricting .
Some Democrats support the amendment , including Sheila Simon , her party 's candidate for Lieutenant Governor .
Other Democrats , however , strongly oppose the proposal .
Senator Martin Sandoval from Chicago warns that " Hispanics will not see a proportionate and fair increase in Hispanic - majority districts , " and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund wants assurances that minority rights will not be curtailed .

Havana , Cuba -- Alejandro Robaina , considered a legend among Cuban tobacco growers , died Saturday , according to Cuban cigar company Habanos S.A. , which produced cigars named for him .
Robaina was 91 .
He was diagnosed with cancer last year and died on his farm in the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio , said Habanos spokesman Jose Antonio Candia .
Robaina 's tobacco leaves are considered some of the best in the world .
In Cuba , he was called " The Godfather . "
His deeply wrinkled face smiled out from billboards , T - shirts and boxes of Vegas Robaina cigars , among Cuba 's finest .
A box of premium Vegas Robaina cigars can fetch more than $ 500 on the international market .
But the man behind the smile was also a simple country farmer who got up at the crack of dawn every day to survey his fields until cancer slowed him down .
" I would n't say I 've triumphed , but I 've done something with my life , " he told CNN in 2008 .
" The first thing is to love the land , take care of the land . "
Robaina 's family have farmed tobacco continuously since 1845 on the plantation .
Under Robaina , business flourished , and the plantation had some of the best yields in the region , producing highly - prized wrapper leaves used for the outer layer of cigars .
Cigar aficionados around the globe called him the dean of Cuba 's cigar industry and every year thousands of visitors made the two - hour trek from Havana , hoping to share a stogie and a glass of rum with " the Don . "
Robaina kept his lands even when many ranches were nationalized after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro .
" I had a very strong conversation with Fidel 18 or 20 years ago , " Robaina said in 2008 .
" He asked if I would join a big cooperative since I had so many workers , and I told him no .
" For me tobacco growing had to be in the family , done with love .
Because in the big cooperatives , everyone 's the boss , nobody worries as much as the grower . "
Now , almost all of Cuba 's tobacco farms are private , according to the Agriculture Ministry .
And they generally take their lead from Robaina , planting and harvesting on the same days he did .
" I like to sow during a waxing moon , and harvest in a waning moon , " he said .
Robaina said he'd been smoking cigars since he was 10 years old .
" When I get really old , I 'll stop smoking the strong stuff , " he said .
In 1997 , Cuba launched the Vegas Robaina brand , named in his honor .
They 're made from the golden wrapper leaves grown on Robaina 's plantation but are rolled in a separate factory .
Like most of Cuba 's cigars , they 're largely exported .
Because of the U.S. trade embargo , however , Cuban cigars are off - limits in America .
Robaina said in 2008 he hoped that policy would end during his lifetime .
" Of course I have hope they 'll open up the market , " he said .
" Cuba 's willing to send cigars and they 're willing to smoke them .
They 're going crazy because they can't smoke cigars from here . "
Robaina will be buried Sunday , said Candia .
SEOGWIPO , South Korea ( Reuters ) - China deflected pressure to censure North Korea at a regional summit on Sunday , instead urging its neighbors to calm tensions over the sinking of a warship and avoid any clash that could shake Asia .
Seoul and Tokyo blame North Korea , whose leader Kim Jong - il visited China earlier this month , of torpedoing South Korea ’s Cheonan corvette in March , killing 46 sailors -- the deadliest military incident since the Korean War .
China , which is North Korea ’s biggest trade partner and which fought alongside the North in 1950 - 53 Korea War , has declined to publicly join international condemnation of Pyongyang , saying it is still assessing the evidence .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao kept to that stance at the two - day summit in Seogwipo , a honeymoon resort on South Korea ’s Jeju island , which was originally meant to focus on regional economic integration .
“ The pressing task now is to respond appropriately to the serious effects of the Cheonan incident , to steadily reduce tensions , and especially to avoid a clash , ” Wen said , standing next to Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and South Korean President Lee Myung - bak at the end of the summit .
Wen did not mention North Korea by name , nor did he give any firm indication that China would accept any U.N. Security Council effort to condemn or sanction the North .
North Korea has repeatedly denied responsibility for the Cheonan incident .
The official Korean Central News Agency said on Saturday the United States was blaming the North for the ship sinking in order to keep a U.S. Marine base in Japan and make China feel “ awkward . ”

South Korea last week announced a series of sanctions against its neighbor , including cutting trade , resuming propaganda broadcasts across the border , and launching naval exercises near the disputed Yellow Sea maritime border .
It has also pledged to take its case to the U.N. Security Council .
GRAVE IMPLICATIONS
China and Japan are the world ’s number two and three economies and , with South Korea , account for close to 20 percent of global economic output .
Instability on the Korean peninsula could have grave implications for the global economy .
“ I think China was cautious because it does not want North Korea to lash out , ” Hatoyama told reporters at a separate briefing after the summit .
North Korea needed to be taught a lesson so it will mend its ways , but war is not an option , said South Korean President Lee .
“ We are not afraid of war , nor do we want one , ” he told Wen and Hatoyama , according to Lee ’s office .
“ We have no intention of fighting a war . ”

South Korea ’s Lee indicated that he expected China to back a U.N. Security Council response to the sinking .
“ China and Japan have very important roles to play in the international community and I fully expect them to have wisdom on this issue , ” he said .
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council , China has the power to veto any proposed resolution or statement .
“ With regard to the Cheonan , China seems confident that tensions will eventually diminish , ” wrote Stephanie Kleine - Ahlbrandt , the North East Asia Project Director for the International Crisis Group , a non-government advisory organization , in an emailed response to questions .
Hatoyama said Japan will back Seoul when it takes the North to the U.N. Security Council .
But Pyongyang may not bow even if China goes along with such steps , said Kleine - Ahlbrandt .
“ We have seen plenty of cases in which external pressure has not worked on North Korea , ” she wrote .
“ It is , therefore , questionable whether further measures will have the desired effect in this situation . ”
North Korea has warned of war on the Korean peninsula if Seoul imposes sanctions , calling the South Korean government “ military gangsters , seized by fever for a war . ”
It has survived West Bengal 's monsoons , being rammed by a barge and a daily flow of some 60,000 vehicles .
Now the engineers who maintain the historic Howrah bridge over the Hooghly river in Kolkata say a new enemy has appeared : the half - chewed mouthfuls of betel leaf , areca nut and slaked lime spat out by pedestrians .
Key struts that support the girders of the bridge – one of the biggest such cantilever structures in the world – have already lost half their protective metal casing to the acids contained in paan , as the mixture is known , engineers say .
There are few public structures in India that are without the tell - tale red stains from paan , which for thousands of years has been chewed throughout India as a mild stimulant , a palate cleanser and breath freshener .
A series of studies have highlighted the health risks of the tonnes of spit and chewed leaf spilled each day on India 's already decrepit infrastructure , pointing out that the habit increases the risk of infectious disease as well as causing environmental damage , but have had little impact on its popularity .
Forensic specialists said the lime used in paan was a particular problem as it has powerful corrosive properties .
" A safety audit [ of the bridge ] is now being planned to find out the effect of constant spitting , " one senior official told the Calcutta Telegraph .
" The 6 mm bases are now around 3 mm each .
If corrosion continues at such a rate , we would need to decommission the bridge for repairs . "
Amithab Chatterjee , an engineer working on the 500 - metre - long bridge , said : " It may not be a problem now but it may become a very big problem .
The study will find out . "
Efforts to crackdown on paan spitting are under way across the country .
In Mumbai , the commercial capital , commuters caught spitting on trains were recently cornered by activists armed with buckets of water and mops and told to clean up .
Other initiatives have been launched in the central city of Pune and in the poor northern state of Bihar .
In the capital , Delhi , authorities have started a publicity drive aimed at cutting down on the practice , as well as public urination , before this autumn 's Commonwealth Games .
In London Brent council recently launched a campaign , saying it spent £ 20,000 a year cleaning paan stains from pavements .
An estimated 50,000 pedestrians a day use the 67 - year - old Howrah bridge , built under British imperial rule .
Police officers stationed near it said they routinely fined pedestrians caught spitting but a lack of manpower meant that fully protecting its structure was impossible .
Update :
The world is mesmerized by Larissa Riquelme and her cellphone rack .
But , before there was Ms. Larissa promising to get naked for Paraguay , there is a woman by the name of Dallys Ferreira and her promise of massive sex if Paraguay won the World Cup .
The following was originally published March 13 .
Updates tomorrow , including new pics if we can find them .
Maybe she ’ll promise the same thing to the Spanish team .
There is a story floating around South America about a Paraguayan model who promises to do something so outstanding for her country that we had to tell Busted Coverage readers about this news .
Dallys Ferreira is a bikini model who does n’t shy away from showing off the rack .
She also is n’t shy when it comes to her promise to the men of Paraguay if her home country wins the World Cup .
There will be sex .
Lots of it .
And she throws around the world nympho like Peyton Manning hitting the slant route .
Continuously .
Our Spanish ( or whatever language Paraguayans speak ) translators have been busy this morning figuring out exactly what Dallys wants to give men , but it goes something like this .
Dallys Ferreira , beautiful vedette Paraguayan that prevails in Argentina , has assured that if Paraguay gains the Glass of the World it will turn into a species of ninfÃ³mana .
â€ œIf albirroja gets to gain the World - wide one I will have sex all night all along .
If I am going to be able ?
The women of my earth we are very fogosasâ€ , has affirmed in an interview .
Dallys Ferreyra admits that â€œwhen I have sex , if there am to speak or I do to whisper it in Castilian , not in guaranÃ­ , because my language is not indeed most sensual than it hasâ€ .
It says that â€ œI am very passional in the bed and in my first appointments enchant to me to go beyond which habitually is establishedâ€ .
Yeah , it ’s a little hard to follow but , as men , we get the most important part .
Our advice on how to handle this if you live in Paraguay and plan on helping her fulfill these dreams : gamble on Paraguay .
Throw down some coin on Paraguay to advance out of Group F at - 162 .
Then take your winnings , hope like hell the home team wins it all , spend some quality time with Dallys and have that extra cash in your pocket for the hepatitis test .

Misconceptions about rand ( ) .
I was recently alerted to a very sad state of affairs regarding the comp.lang .c
FAQ ( it has since been improved from when I first looked at it , no doubt in part thanks to me , however it still misses the point and says inaccurate things ) .
For those that care to know these things , I hope people know that rand ( ) is just not very good , and alternatives should be used .
Explaining this to a lazy programmer who just wants a reasonable solution is probably a bit much .
For someone just looking for an answer that is " good enough " we need something quick and dirty , but reasonable in practice .
The Travesty
The point is that
x = rand ( ) % RANGE ; /* return a random number in [ 0 , RANGE ) */
is not good enough .
There are three major problems with using the above :
rand ( ) returns a value in [ 0 , RAND_MAX ] .
So if RANGE does not divide evenly into RAND_MAX+1 , the distribution is blatantly wrong .
Specifically the probability of choosing x in [ ( RAND_MAX % RANGE ) , RANGE ) is less than choosing x in [ 0 , ( RAND_MAX % RANGE ) ) .
The quality of rand ( ) on most systems is not that good ; in particular the low bits can follow a short cyclical pattern , or there can be dependencies between the bits .
What happens if RAND_MAX+1 < RANGE ?
For the typical programmer concerned with robustness , the primary concern will be for fixing the first condition above .
Programmers that do n't actually care about this , are essentially happy with " loaded dice " and can stick with the solution given above .
The comp.lang .c FAQ attempts to solve the second but just ignores the first condition totally .
They recommend the following :
/* WARNING !!
Do n't use this , its a bad partial fix of rand ( ) */
x = rand ( ) / ( RAND_MAX / RANGE + 1 ) ; /* Bad advice from C.L.C. FAQ */
Or in other forms :
/* Using floating point like this does n't help in any way .
*/
# define ranrange ( a , b ) ( int ) ( ( a ) + rand ( ) /( RAND_MAX + 1.0 ) * ( ( b ) - ( a ) + 1 ) )
Ok , the point is that this solution does n't do anything about the bias that 's created by trying ( and failing ) to evenly divide the original number of potential results amongst the desired number of potential results .
The FAQ then tries to excuse itself by suggesting that this solution is only good if RANGE is much smaller than RAND_MAX when the bias will be smaller .
The problem is that the bias will be easily detected ( the point where you are 99 % sure that its following its incorrect distribution , rather than the one you want ) after about 1000 * ( RAND_MAX / RANGE ) samples regardless ( the bias still exists for a smaller number of samples , its just harder to detect ) .
A More Reasonable Answer
So does that mean that fixing rand ( ) is infeasible and that we really should be trying to push everyone to use some of the more sophisticated generators from Marsaglia or the Mersenne Twister ?
Not necessarily -- first of all those generators are not always portable , they are not always as fast as rand ( ) and include details that steepens their learning curves .
If you can get over these hurdles , I whole heartedly recommend you study them and pick the one you find most appropriate .
But the much simpler goal of getting an even distribution is actually very achievable and also applies to those more sophisticated random number generators :
/* This actually works correctly .
*/ #define RAND_INV_RANGE(r ) ( ( int ) ( ( RAND_MAX + 1 ) / ( r ) ) ) do { x = rand ( ) ; } while ( x >= RANGE * RAND_INV_RANGE ( RANGE ) ) ; x /= RAND_INV_RANGE ( RANGE ) ;
The idea is very simple .
Just reject a small number of values ( ( RAND_MAX % RANGE ) ) off the top of the range of output of rand ( ) ; forcing a retry if such values are encountered .
The output will be an exactly equally distributed choice from the number range of [ 0 , RANGE ) for any value of RANGE that is less or equal to RAND_MAX .
This does nothing about the 3rd problem above .
For the moment we are going to ignore this .
Now , of course , one might be concerned that this may have poor running time since it may have to call rand ( ) multiple times before producing a single result .
So lets do some calculations to see how bad this really can be in practice .
Let p = ( RAND_MAX % RANGE ) / ( RAND_MAX + 1.0 ) .
This is the probability that any given call to rand ( ) will require a retry .
Note that this value is maximized when RANGE * 2 = RAND_MAX+3 , and which will yield a value of p roughly equal to 1/2 .
The average number of times that rand ( ) will be called is 1 / ( 1 - p ) ( with a worst case of about 2 ) .
The probability that at least n calls to rand ( ) will be required beyond the first one is pn .
So for most values of p which will be much less than 1/32 say , performance should not be a concern at all .
The question is , then , what should be done about values of p which are too large ?
Well , if its because RAND_MAX is too small and in fact RAND_MAX * RAND_MAX < INT_MAX ( a very typical , and sad , situation ) then the simplest solution is to just contruct a better rand ( ) function :
# define XRAND_MAX ( RAND_MAX *( RAND_MAX + 2 ) ) unsigned int xrand ( void ) { return rand () * ( RAND_MAX + 1 ) + rand ( ) ; }
Otherwise , multiprecision arithmetic would be required ( at which point one might as well pick up one of the alternative random number generators . )
We can see that this alternative will help with the 3rd problem above by expanding the range .
However , RANGE may still be too large .
Another Alternative
The other obvious alternative to fixing the rand ( ) function is to construct a random floating point number from it , so that range fixing of it will be more straight forward :
#include < stdlib.h > # define RS_SCALE ( 1.0 / ( 1.0 + RAND_MAX ) ) double drand ( void ) { double d ; do { d = ( (( rand ( ) * RS_SCALE ) + rand ( ) ) * RS_SCALE + rand ( ) ) * RS_SCALE ; } while ( d >= 1 ) ; /* Round off */ return d ; } # define irand ( x ) ( ( unsigned int ) ( ( x ) * drand ( ) ) )
The result returned by drand ( ) is a double precision floating point number in the range of [ 0,1 ) .
The irand (r ) macro will return a random integer in the range [ 0 , r ) .
This has the advantage , that if RAND_MAX = 32767 ( which is very typical ) and your platform has a double with a 53 bit mantissa ( also very typical ) , then this actually produces a bit - faithful random number with 45 bits of precision .
45 bits will be large enough for pretty much any practical RANGE , however , it is still not perfect ( so technically problem 3 is still not fully addressed ) .
The theoretical disadvantages are two - fold : 1 ) overflows ( which actually result from RAND_MAX being too large , or the platform 's double mantissa being too small ) in the mantissa will create roundings that will introduce a slight bias on the order of 1 ULP ( Unit in Last Place ) ; notice that the extremely unlikely case of erroneous overflows are shielded by a do - while ( ) loop .
2 ) The conversion back to integer can introduce a bias of about 1 ULP .
A bias of 1 ULP is typically so small that it is not even realistically feasible to test for its existence from a statistical point of view .
The more tangible disadvantages are that 1 ) rand ( ) is definitely called 3 times ( which is worse than the worst case for the average expected running time of the earlier solution ) , and that 2 ) rand ( ) is usually actually quite terrible at guaranteeing that successive calls to it behave with apparent independence .
Generalizing to a real range
One of the advantages of the drand ( ) function given above is that it extends to use of floating point probability ranges trivially .
So if you want an indicator function on a random sample with a bias of x , then it is simply drand ( ) < x .
To get the probability precisely , we can use rand ( ) to give us a ranged slot and see if it falls entirely below or entirely above x .
If the slot straddles x , then we refine the choice within that slot ( to a sub - slot ) and repeat :
#include < stdlib.h > # define RS_SCALE ( 1.0 / ( 1.0 + RAND_MAX ) ) int randbiased ( double x ) { for ( ; ; ) { double p = rand () * RS_SCALE ; if ( p >= x ) return 0 ; if ( p+RS_SCALE <= x ) return 1 ; /* p < x < p+RS_SCALE */ x = ( x - p ) * ( 1.0 + RAND_MAX ) ; } }
Sampling from an arbitrary discrete distribution
Continuing with the interval idea from above for a boolean distribution , we can now proceed to implement a generalized discrete distribution ( i.e. , one of a finite number of outcomes , but with arbitrary probabilities . )
We start by creating a sorted sequence which represents the cumulative distribution .
I.e. , we create the mapping i => [ slot i- 1 , slot i ) , where slot - 1 = 0 , slot n- 1 = 1 and slot i- 1 <= slot i .
So the probability of choosing the ith entry is slot i - slot i- 1 .
This requires an array of n - 1 ( not n ) entries to be constructed in which the - 1 and n - 1 indexes are omitted .
The function will return with a value of 0 to n-1 inclusive :
#include < stdlib.h > # define RS_SCALE ( 1.0 / ( 1.0 + RAND_MAX ) ) /*
A non-overflowing average function */ # define average2 scomplement ( x , y ) ( ( x ) & ( y ) ) + ( ( ( x ) ^ ( y ) ) / 2 ) size_t randslot ( const double slots [ /* n - 1 */] , size_t n ) { double xhi ; /* Select a random range [ x , x+RS_SCALE ) */ double x = rand () * RS_SCALE ; /* Perform binary search to find the intersecting slot */ size_t hi = n - 2 , lo = 0 , mi , li ; while ( hi > lo ) { mi = average2 scomplement ( lo , hi ) ; if ( x >= slots [ mi ] ) lo = mi+1 ; else hi = mi ; } /* Taking slots [ - 1]=0.0 , this is now true : slots [ lo - 1 ] <= x < slots[lo ] */ /*
If slots [ lo - 1 ] <= x < x +RS_SCALE <= slots [ lo ] then any point in [ x , x+RS_SCALE ) is in [ slots [ lo - 1 ] , slots[lo ] ) */ if ( ( xhi = x+RS_SCALE ) <= slots [lo ] ) return lo ; /* Otherwise x < slots [lo ] < x+RS_SCALE */ for ( ; ; ) { /* x < slots [lo ] < xhi */ if ( randbiased ( ( slots [lo ] - x ) / ( xhi - x ) ) ) return lo ; x = slots [lo ] ; lo ++ ; if ( lo >= n - 1 ) return n - 1 ; if ( xhi <= slots [lo ] ) { /* slots [ lo - 1 ] = x <= xhi <= slots [ lo ] */ return lo ; } } }
[ 0 , 0.3 / RAND_MAX ) , [ 0.3 / RAND_MAX , 1.0 / RAND_MAX ) , [ 1.0 / RAND_MAX , 1.0 )
It would be difficult to sample from this distribution accurately without a solution similar to the above .
Ok , and now we see we can finally address the 3rd problem completely .
If we replace slots [ x ] above with x /( double ) n then we will finally have a solution for what we were originally looking for .
But we can simplify this massively :
#include < stdlib.h > # include < math.h > # define RS_SCALE ( 1.0 / ( 1.0 + RAND_MAX ) ) size_t randrange ( size_t n ) { double xhi ; double resolution = n * RS_SCALE ; double x = resolution * rand ( ) ; /* x in [ 0 , n ) */ size_t lo = ( size_t ) floor ( x ) ; xhi = x + resolution ; for ( ; ; ) { lo ++ ; if ( lo >= xhi || randbiased ( ( lo - x ) / ( xhi - x ) ) ) return lo - 1 ; x = lo ; } }
Seeding the random number generator
The standard typical method for seeding the random number generator is to do the following :
#include < stdlib.h > # include < time .h> srand ( time ( NULL ) ) ;
#include < stdlib.h > # include < limits .h> # include < time .h > static struct { int which ; time_t t ; clock_t c ; int counter ; } entropy = { 0 , ( time_t ) 0 , ( clock_t ) 0 , 0 } ; static unsigned char * p = ( unsigned char *) ( &entropy + 1 ) ; static int accSeed = 0 ; int reseed ( void ) { if ( p == ( ( unsigned char *) ( &entropy + 1 ) ) ) { switch ( entropy . which ) { case 0 : entropy .t += time ( NULL ) ; accSeed ^= entropy.t ; break ; case 1 : entropy.c += clock ( ) ; break ; case 2 : entropy.counter ++ ; break ; } entropy .
which = ( entropy .
which + 1 ) % 3 ; p = ( unsigned char *) &entropy.t ; } accSeed = (( accSeed * ( UCHAR_MAX+2U ) ) | 1 ) + ( int ) * p ; p++ ; srand ( accSeed ) ; return accSeed ; }
On a 32 bit system each entropy source is fetched , on average , once every 36 times that reseed ( ) is called .
If more entropy sources are added this will increase the time between each repeated fetch from each source .
Examples of entropy sources that might be appropriate are 1 ) an on - disk counter , 2 ) the current process - ID , 3 ) processor clock counter ( the TSC MSR on the x86 for example ) values when certain events ( such as network response , mouse movement , keypresses , etc ) occurr .

Going beyond rand ( )
The discussion so far has focussed on trying to make sure that the aggregate number of each possible output from the random number selection is a single constant .
In mathematical terms we are trying to find a random number generator that satisfies : E ( |{X=x}n| ) = np ( the C.L.C. FAQ solution fails simply by virtue of choosing a large enough n whenever 1 / p is not a divisor of RAND_MAX ) as well as hoping for a couple other properties such as E ( |{ X+αX=x ( mod RAND_MAX+1 ) }n| ) = np ( since just an incrementing counter satisfies the first test alone ) .
Generators such as the various Marsaglia generators or the Mersenne Twister are primarily concerned with testing the following :
P( Xk = ( x 0 , x 1 , ... , x k - 1 ) ) = pk .
In non -math speak , it means that every plausible sub-sequence of sequentially fetched random numbers is equally probable .
Or that successively generated random numbers appear independent from the ones generated immediately before them .
One might , very roughly , quantify how good these generators are by how high of a value of k they can satisfy ( how many outputs you can produce before you can , with sufficient computing resources , determine that not every possible sequence of that length is equally represented ) .
For example , the Mersenne Twister ( which is portable to systems with 32 bit integers ) has a k - value of roughly 600 ( corresponding to a cycle of length 219937 - 1 ) and Marsaglia 's CMWC generator ( which , unfortunately , requires assembly language support ) has a k- value of roughly 1000 ( corresponding to a cycle length of about 1010007 ) .
Real world applications ( even lotteries ) would hardly ever need a k - value of more than about 16 or so and more typically can get away with values less than 5 .
Cryptographers have entirely different needs for random numbers .
For example , the requirement of choosing very large prime numbers is necessary for public key based cryptography .
For cryptographers , the state of the random number generator must not be deducible from the examination of any number of outputs with any amount of computing power .
The Fortuna random number generator by Schneier at al ( which is an improvment over the Yarrow random number generator ) hides the output using non-reversible hash functions ( like SHA256 ) and uses multiple sources of entropy .
The idea is that even if the complete state of the generator is known ( itself highly unlikely ) , it will very quickly become unknown .
So the sequence of the numbers output are not determinable with anything short of complete state knowledge and control over the entropy .
As with anything having to do with cryptography , it pays to listen to what the experts say before attempting to roll a home grown solution .
One final note should be spoken with regard to multithreading systems .
We must remember Knuth 's warning from The Art of Computer Programming , that randomly constructed algorithms do n't necessarily lead to a good source of random numbers .
The same comment needs to apply to race conditions affecting random number servers .
Although it would seem that allowing race conditions would be harmless for PRNGs , this is not the case .
First of all many random number generators are susceptible to " 0 - sticking " ; that is if their internal seeds all end up going to 0 simultaneously , they would proceed to issue constant - only output .
Secondly , a race condition could cause the internal state to skip an update meaning that the same number could be output more than once in a row soley because of an occurring race condition .
Third , the mechanisms of a PRNG carry it from state to state along a maximal path -- unpredictably perturbing it cannot increase the path but in fact only decrease it , thus decreasing the length of the PRNG 's cycle .
So in multithreaded systems , PRNGs should be properly mutexed , just like malloc ( ) is .

With the recent sentence on the Comcast affair , it seems that the debate about net - neutrality regulation has paused .
Feeling the carpet pulled out from under it , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) is struggling to find a new legal ground for its intervention .
In the meantime , the stakeholders should reflect on the consequences a lobbying success would bring : the creation of regulations on net neutrality .
The position of telecom operators is clear enough , as they have opposed from the beginning this attack on their assets and their businesses .
But what about the several net - neutrality proponents , like Google , Twitter , Facebook , Amazon and many others ?
Have they really thought about the consequences of net - neutrality regulation — not only in the short but also in the long term ?
Are they not aware that any regulation has unintended consequences ?
In its notice for proposed rulemaking ( NPRM ) , " In the Matter of Preserving the Open Internet , " the FCC proposes six new obligations for telecom operators :
Access to content
Access to applications and services
Connection of devices
Access to competitive options
Nondiscrimination
Transparency
These are the proposed obligations , but the real issue behind them is network management .
Telecommunications networks are scarce resources and , as such , they require management .
In an environment of scarcity , someone has to decide how to assign the limited capacity available .
For most of their history , the management techniques required for telecommunications networks have been simple .
But that is changing now , with the explosive growth of data traffic , and , specifically , the data generated from cellular devices .
Suddenly , network capacity is becoming scarcer than ever , and telecom operators are starting to analyze how to manage the new situation with the resources at their disposal .
In summary , the question of net neutrality is not about the need for network management ; it is about who will decide how the network is managed .
There is no chance of having " dumb pipes , " as net - neutrality proponents seem to demand ; what we will have is either dumbly managed pipes or smartly managed pipes .
" What if the management is done by the government ?
Then we abandon the realm of service and enter into the realm of policy . "
There are basically two options for network management : it may be designed and carried out by the owner of the network , or by " stakeholders " not owning the network ( i.e. , by means of government intervention and regulations ) .
And now we return to the original question .
What would new regulation mean for Google and its net - neutrality allies ?
The owner of the network is interested in obtaining as much revenues as possible .
He can only do so if the service he provides is satisfactory to his customers .
Otherwise , they will change to another network or discontinue the contract .
Of course , this threat will have important implications for the way the owner manages the network .
He will try at any moment to use the scarce resource in a way that most perfectly satisfies the majority of clients .
This seems in line with the interests of Google .
If Google is providing a good service to its users , telecom clients will demand access to Google services , and the telecom operator will not have the option to deny such access .
If he does , he will lose customers and , more importantly , revenues .
What if the management is done by the government ?
Then we abandon the realm of service and enter into the realm of policy .
The interest of the customer gives way to the " public interest . "
And Google will not be able to rely anymore on the satisfaction of its users in order to secure the needed capacity to reach them .
Google , Facebook , Amazon , eBay , and the rest of the big Internet companies will have to rely on lobbying instead of on merits .
The network , managed by the government ( of course , not directly , but by increasing regulation of telecom operators ) , will be assigned according to arbitrary policy criteria not necessarily related to the actual preferences of people .
For example , Spanish movies could be given priority over Google contents due to cultural issues ( or due to better lobbying by those stakeholders ) .
If network owners are deprived of the ability to manage their assets , they will stop investing in them .
After all , nobody wastes money on something they can't use .
The capacity of the network will not grow and it will not be able to carry the vast and growing amount of data demanded .
Once again , this does not look good for Google and its allies , whose businesses rely so heavily on the increase of data traffic .
In conclusion , net - neutrality regulation is not good , not even for its most ardent supporters .
Google , eBay , Facebook , Amazon , and other net - neutrality proponents have a proven track record of success in serving their customers .
Why they prefer to put their future in the hands of governments instead of depending on their own proven capacities of service is simply beyond me .
Though Apple has added additional data security features to the iPhone with every iteration of the OS — including encrypting files on - device for the iPhone 3GS — vulnerabilities still exist .
These issues are of particular concern to enterprise users , since sensitive corporate data may exist on any given employee 's mobile device .
A new vulnerability revealed by security researcher Bernd Marienfeldt , however , shows that all someone needs to get at that data is the latest version of Ubuntu .
Noted iPhone data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski demonstrated last year that common hacking tools could remove the data protection features that Apple added with iPhone OS 3.x and the iPhone 3GS .
He told Ars that there are ways to get around both the on - device encryption as well as the encrypted backups that can be saved via iTunes .
" The only benefit hardware encryption [ as implemented ] is that it makes wipes faster , by just dropping the [ encryption ] key , " he said .
But even the remote wipe feature can be thwarted by removing a device 's SIM card .
Marienfeldt 's research revealed that standard hacking or jailbreaking tools are n't even needed to get at the data .
The latest version of Ubuntu ( 10.04 ) will auto mount the flash storage in an iPhone , allowing access to all of the information contained within .
Files can be accessed even if a pin code is set .
Zdziarski warned that the way encryption worked on the iPhone could be exploited in this way if a tool allowed the iPhone 's file system to be mounted .
" The [ iPhone OS ] kernel decrypts it for you when you ask for files , so you get the decrypted copy , " he told Ars last summer .
Here you can see the entire filesystem of an iPhone 3GS with PIN code lock displayed under Ubuntu 10.04 .
Marienfeldt verified that only the DCIM folder , where images and videos are stored , is accessible on Mac OS X , Windows , and Linux — even older versions of Ubuntu .
However , Lucid Lynx will , when set to auto mount USB - based devices , expose the entire filesystem of any iPhone .
" This data protection flaw exposes music , photos , videos , podcasts , voice recordings , Google safe browsing database , game contents , " Marienfeldt wrote on his blog .
He has shared his findings with Apple , and engineers were able to verify the problem .
" Apple could reproduce the described serious issue and believes [ it understands ] why this can happen but cannot provide timing or further details on the release of a fix , " Marienfeldt said .
Of course , knowing that pretty much anyone with Ubuntu installed can get at all of your data is troubling .
Marienfeldt noted that this problem is quite serious for enterprise users , especially since companies " rely on the expectation that their iPhone 3GS ’s whole content is protected by encryption with a PIN code based authentication in place to unlock it . "
This is probably true ; Steve Jobs recently noted during the iPhone OS 4.0 preview that 80 percent of Fortune 100 companies have employees using iPhones as a work - related mobile device .
AT&T also said that 40 percent of iPhones are now sold to enterprise users .
" When the iPhone came out , what most people heard in the first year from ' 07 to '08 was oh my God , it 's not BlackBerry secure ; this is not going to work on the enterprise space , " AT&T Business Solutions CEO Ron Spears said recently during the Barclays Capital Communications , Media and Technology Conference .
" And by the time the 3G came out in ‘08 they had solved about 80 percent of the security issues .
By the time the 3GS came out last summer , most CIOs will tell you today they have very few issues around the security that they need provided . "
However , this latest example shows that Apple has some work ahead of it to beef up security for its mobile platform .
Apple has promised more robust encryption options for iPhone OS 4.0 , including giving developers an API to encrypt their applications ' data separately .
If these new options rely on the same encryption system as current iPhones , though , that wo n't be enough .
Marienfeldt recommends that Apple employ a more robust full disk encryption method , one that requires the PIN code to be entered before the filesystem will mount on any OS .
From barnacles that hijack crabs to a protozoan that makes rodents cozy up to cats , parasites do a lot more than make you puke .
But for sheer gross - out glory , it ’s hard to beat Leucochloridium paradoxum .
These flatworms live in birds ’ rectums , and they give garden snails a glimpse of hell .
1/ A grazing snail eats a bird dropping .
Gross , right ?
Well , what ’s even grosser is that the dropping is filled with parasite eggs .
Garden snails can’t digest the eggs .
They survive their trip through the snail ’s tummy intact and spread to nearby organs .
2 / The invading Leucochloridium runs through a couple of life - cycle stages before landing in the snail ’s hepatopancreas , the organ that passes for its liver - pancreas - thing .
3 / The parasite pumps embryo after embryo into fat , throbbing brood sacs it builds in the snail ’s eyestalks .
4 / An intelligent designer might have stopped at systemic infection and pulsating , brightly colored tentacles .
Not evolution , though .
Evolution goes up to 11 .
The parasite takes control of the snail ’s rudimentary brain , making the mollusk forget that it ’s scared of daylight and spurring it to inch out into the open .
5 / To us , the infected tentacles look like a fleshy , Cronenbergian nightmare .
To birds , they look like delicious caterpillars .
6 / The birds eat the eyestalks and get infected by the parasites , which reproduce and lay eggs in the bird ’s rectum , ready to be deployed in future poop .
7/ Even if the snails survive the destalking , they stay parasitized — which means they can infect other birds , which can infect other snails .
It ’s the circle of life .
Ronald Reagan appointed some of the best judges money can buy … and in this case , has .
Today , Judge Martin Feldman , a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana , sided with a drilling company which had argued that the Obama administration ’s blanket , 6 - month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was illegal .
The drilling company , Hornbeck Offshore Services of Covington , LA , claimed financial distress from the imposition of the moratorium .
In the ruling handed down this afternoon , Judge Feldman agreed , writing that the administration made an “ arbitrary and capricious ” decision that would have an “ immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs , the local economy , the Gulf region , and the critical present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country . ”
Like many judges presiding in the Gulf region , Feldman owns lots of energy stocks , including Transocean , Halliburton , and two of BP ’s largest U.S. private shareholders — BlackRock ( 7.1 % ) and JP Morgan Chase ( 28.3 % ) .
Here ’s a list of Feldman ’s income in 2008 ( amounts listed unless under $ 1,000 ) : BlackRock ( $ 12000 - $ 36000 ) Ocean Energy ( $ 1000 – $ 2500 ) NGP Capital Resources ( $ 1000 – $ 2500 ) Quicksilver Resources ( $ 5000 – $ 15000 ) Hercules Offshore ( $ 6000 – $ 17500 ) Provident Energy Peabody Energy PenGrowth Energy RPC Inc Atlas Energy Resources Parker Drilling TXCO Resources EV Energy Partners Rowan Companies BPZ Resources El Paso Corp KBR Inc Chesapeake Energy ATP Oil & Gas
In his opinion today , Feldman wrote , “ Oil and gas production is quite simply elemental to Gulf communities . ” … [ emphasis added ]

WASHINGTON —- An alarming new study released Tuesday by the Department of Education found that nearly 70 percent of Americans are incapable of pointing out a map when presented by researchers with a map .
" Not only did a majority of people just stare blankly ahead , but nearly half pointed to nearby desk lamps in their attempts to guess correctly , " said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , who called the findings endemic of the nation 's failing school system .
" In fact , 14 percent of all Americans claimed they had never ' even heard of no map , ' and asked if being prompted to locate one was some kind of trick question . "
According to Duncan , the Department of Education has suspended all further studies and will instead be spending the next six months just screaming into a pillow .

When Arizona governor Jan Brewer signed the most draconian immigration statute in the country last month , she said she was doing it because Washington had failed to act , blaming “ decades of federal inaction and misguided policy ” for creating “ an unacceptable situation . ”
But conservative Grover Norquist , head of Americans for Tax Reform , insists she had a cynical motive :
She was exploiting this hot - button issue .
He says Brewer is a “ lousy governor ” who ’s using a “ clever strategy to get people to focus on something other than her billion - dollar tax increase . ”
With this comment , Norquist is setting off a major catfight between a leading strategist of the conservative movement and a governor hailed on the right for her tough stand on immigration .
Whether or not it was intentional , Brewer ’s timing certainly seems perfect .
As national pundits and the Obama administration rained criticism on her for signing a bill that empowers local law enforcement to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally , Brewer quietly scored a major victory that enraged anti-tax activists .
On May 19 , voters approved a one - cent hike in the state sales tax that is predicted to send a billion dollars into the state ’s dwindling coffers .
The driving force behind the initiative was Brewer herself , who realized that the state ’s $ 1.6 billion deficit could n’t be overcome simply by cutting services without serious repercussions to state residents .
Even with the tax hike , the state is about to drop more than 300,000 residents from Medicaid — about a quarter of the program ’s total capacity .
It has closed rest stops and parks and will be hiking tuition rates at its largest universities by 20 percent .
More cuts would have seriously threatened primary and secondary education .
So last year , shortly after Brewer moved up from the secretary of state ’s office to fill in for Democrat Janet Napolitano — who left the governor ’s mansion to run the US Department of Homeland Security — she realized that the state ’s budget problems could n’t be fixed just by a snip here and a trim there .
She started pushing the tax hike , a move that put her at serious odds with the Republicans in her party and many Democrats , too .
The tax proposal was a very modest one .
But it was so unpopular among Republicans that when Brewer announced it , 20 people jumped in to the primary election to challenge her in August , when she makes her first official run for the governor ’s seat .
The proposed tax hike might have been the death of Brewer ’s campaign but for one thing :
Her decision to sign the immigration bill .
While roundly criticized in Washington and elsewhere , the immigration measure proved wildly popular at home .
And it earned Brewer the support of such luminaries as Sarah Palin , who now appears prominently on a website funded by Brewer ’s campaign , www.securetheborder.org.
Brewer has now become something of a heroine to some conservatives .
They seem content to overlook the tax apostasy .
But not Norquist , who not only hates the tax hike but the immigration bill , too .
Brewer ’s support of that measure has put a major damper on Norquist ’s latest enterprise : an attempt to recruit conservative Latinos into the GOP fold .
In February , Norquist helped launch the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles , a spin-off of the American Principles Project founded by conservative Princeton professor Robert George .
George , a gay marriage foe , had apparently hoped to appeal to Latinos by relying on such social issues as abortion and gay marriage .
( Latinos tend to be more conservative on these topics . )
The group ’s official mission is “ to garner greater Latino support for conservative causes and candidates , and at the same time , to encourage the conservative movement to support Latino conservative groups , leaders , and candidates , as well as policies that are welcoming of Latino immigrants . ”
The project was a recognition that despite major efforts by the sometimes - Spanish speaking George W. Bush , the GOP has a pretty dismal record at reaching the expanding Latino voting bloc that ’s expected to have an increasing influence on future elections .
Norquist officially kicked off the project at a big powwow in March at the Conservative Political Action Convention in Washington , where he appeared with a couple of telenovela stars and the new partnership ’s executive director , Alfonso Aguilar , a former Bush administration Homeland Security official .
But Brewer and her fellow Arizona Republicans did n’t get the memo .
The Arizona law is n’t exactly the sort of “ welcoming ” policy Norquist had in mind .
It comes just as Aguilar has started hosting town hall meetings for Latinos ( the first one was in Orlando earlier this month ) and pitching the outreach as a “ Tea Party for Hispanics . ”
He has also been appearing on TV trying to do damage control in the wake of Arizona ’s immigration crackdown .
Unfortunately for him and Norquist , recent polls suggest that the Arizona law has Latino voters fleeing from GOP candidates en masse , giving Democrats a significant advantage in several races in the West .
When I asked Norquist whether Brewer had basically sunk his latest project , he was somewhat diplomatic .
He would only say that because of the immigration law , it ’s important for conservatives to reach out to Latinos .
He was n’t so polite about Brewer , though .
“ Jan Brewer is on my bad person list already because of her tax increase , ” he says .
“ She ’s not getting into heaven for that reason .
You do n’t need two reasons not to get in . ”
Craig Venter and his team have built the genome of a bacterium from scratch and incorporated it into a cell to make what they call the world 's first synthetic life form
Scientists have created the world 's first synthetic life form in a landmark experiment that paves the way for designer organisms that are built rather than evolved .
The controversial feat , which has occupied 20 scientists for more than 10 years at an estimated cost of $ 40 m , was described by one researcher as " a defining moment in biology " .
Craig Venter , the pioneering US geneticist behind the experiment , said the achievement heralds the dawn of a new era in which new life is made to benefit humanity , starting with bacteria that churn out biofuels , soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and even manufacture vaccines .
However critics , including some religious groups , condemned the work , with one organisation warning that artificial organisms could escape into the wild and cause environmental havoc or be turned into biological weapons .
Others said Venter was playing God .
The new organism is based on an existing bacterium that causes mastitis in goats , but at its core is an entirely synthetic genome that was constructed from chemicals in the laboratory .
The single - celled organism has four " watermarks " written into its DNA to identify it as synthetic and help trace its descendants back to their creator , should they go astray .
" We were ecstatic when the cells booted up with all the watermarks in place , " Dr Venter told the Guardian .
" It 's a living species now , part of our planet 's inventory of life . "
Dr Venter 's team developed a new code based on the four letters of the genetic code , G , T , C and A , that allowed them to draw on the whole alphabet , numbers and punctuation marks to write the watermarks .
Anyone who cracks the code is invited to email an address written into the DNA .
The research is reported online today in the journal Science .
" This is an important step both scientifically and philosophically , " Dr Venter told the journal .
" It has certainly changed my views of definitions of life and how life works . "
The team now plans to use the synthetic organism to work out the minimum number of genes needed for life to exist .
From this , new microorganisms could be made by bolting on additional genes to produce useful chemicals , break down pollutants , or produce proteins for use in vaccines .
Julian Savulescu , professor of practical ethics at Oxford University , said : " Venter is creaking open the most profound door in humanity 's history , potentially peeking into its destiny .
He is not merely copying life artificially ... or modifying it radically by genetic engineering .
He is going towards the role of a god : creating artificial life that could never have existed naturally . "
This is " a defining moment in the history of biology and biotechnology " , Mark Bedau , a philosopher at Reed College in Portland , Oregon , told Science .
Dr Venter became a controversial figure in the 1990s when he pitted his former company , Celera Genomics , against the publicly funded effort to sequence the human genome , the Human Genome Project .
Venter had already applied for patents on more than 300 genes , raising concerns that the company might claim intellectual rights to the building blocks of life .
BEIJING ( Caixin Online ) -- A 1987 Hollywood movie called " Wall Street " featured Michael Douglas as Gordon Gecko , a rich , powerful and ruthless broker who teaches a young disciple that " greed is good . "
Coming out this summer will be a new film , " Wall Street 2 , " also starring Michael Douglas .
And we 've been watching the real show recently from Washington .
That 's where Wall Street bankers defended themselves before the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations and the Financial Crisis Inquiry Committee .
The more they protested their innocence , the more they proved Gordon Gecko is not fictitious but a real - life character .
In investigating the role of investment banks in the financial crisis , the subcommittee looked at the 2004 - 2007 period .
It found that bankers securitized high - risk mortgages , received fat fees , and pushed these mortgage packages to investors who thought they were buying good assets because they trusted Wall Street bankers and credit rating agencies .
The investment bankers magnified risk by re-securitizing toxic mortgages securities into collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , sold them , and then used credit default swaps ( CDS ) and index trading to hedge their own risks .
In emails among themselves , the traders flaunted the fact that their products were crap .
Thank you , Wall Street , for such honesty after the fact .
We Asians bought some of that crap , thinking you were selling safe products .
Because they knew these mortgages were risky , the investment bankers shorted the mortgage market .
That means they sold more than they bought .
So when the CDO market collapsed , the banks profited through their large amounts of short positions .
Moreover , a clear conflict developed between clients and proprietary traders .
The subcommittee found investment banks did not disclose to clients that they themselves had traded billions of dollars in such mortgage - related assets for their own proprietary benefit .
Some products were packaged to allow special clients to short the market .
Then the products were sold to other investors without telling them that they were designed for being shorted .
In other words , they sold what they were shorting or knew was bad , while telling clients they could profit from trading such assets .
I think Asian financial regulators should look into how many of these products were sold in Asia .
What was their defense ?
One senator asked investment bankers repeatedly whether they felt a duty to act in the best interests of clients .
Only one in four affirmed such a duty .
This means Wall Street 's culture is all about treating clients as suckers , because adults are supposed to know what they 're doing .
But some of these adults are local government treasurers , or managers of corporate , pension and insurance funds , who did not fully understand that these well - dressed , highly educated and trusted Wall Street bankers were selling toxic products .
Unfortunately , taxpayers and savers are now paying for this gross dereliction of fiduciary trust .
The highly paid bankers just do n't get it .
Why should they ?
They have already laughed all the way to the bank with fat bonuses .
The man in the street can expect such behavior from street gangs , but not from revered bankers .
They are supposed to be the crème de la crème of society .
Our children actually aspire to join them .
God help them .
One cynical newspaper commentator said the outcome of the Senate hearings was that both sides won .
The investment bankers proved that what they were doing was not illegal , and the senators shamed the bankers enough to pass bank reform bills .
One of the most astute comments came from a senator who said those in trusted positions should know the difference between what is legal and what is proper .
This gets to the core of charges against Lehman Brothers .
The firm 's bankruptcy lawyer said that it reported $ 40 billion in September 2008 , but that it did not reveal that a substantial portion of that amount was encumbered or otherwise illiquid .
Furthermore , the firm used the infamous " Repo 105 " to hide the fact that , if not for Repo 105 , the net leverage would be higher than reported .
In the currency wars of our modern age , we trust bankers as much as we trust our soldiers to defend national frontiers .
In the 1980s , there was a famous book about corporate Wall Street raiders called " Barbarians at the Gate . "
It was later made into a movie .
Wall Street raiders , aided by investment bankers , acted like Huns breaking down the Great Wall .
In testifying to the financial crisis committee , U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner referred to an ample number of examples during the crisis during which " regulators did not use the authority they had early enough or strongly enough to contain risks in the system .
But a principal cause of the crisis was the failure to provide legal authority to constrain risk in this parallel financial system . "
" When people look back at this crisis , when they look at the excessive risks taken by large financial institutions , the natural inclination is to move those risky activities elsewhere , " Geithner said .
" To create stability , some argue , we should just separate banks from ' risk . ' "
But he said that , in important ways , that is exactly what caused this crisis .
Geithner said the lesson for us and the financial system " is that we cannot make the economy safe by taking functions central to the business of banking , functions necessary to help raise capital for businesses and help businesses hedge risk , and move them outside banks , and outside the reach of strong regulation . "
Mr. Secretary , I agree with you at the conceptual level .
But the best system in the world will not work if those who defend the system still think that greed at any cost is good .
Without trust and integrity , no system will protect us from barbarians at the gate .

Rally advice :
You should have at least 5 people to fill these roles :
Person 1 carries a big FREE MARC sign
Person 2 has a megaphone or leads the chanting
Person 3 contacts the media news tip lines
Person 4 takes photos and / or video of the event
Person 5 should openly posses cannabis if they are legal users
Pick the place for the rally first .
The main courthouse in town is a good place .
A busy intersection where you will be seen , or on the sidewalk by any US or Canadian embassy or consulate or a federal building on a main avenue are excellent rally sites .
You do n’t need any permits .
Posters & signs should be prepared and the rally should start at 2:00 pm and go to 5 pm .
Chants should be developed ; like “ Free Marc Emery ” , “ No Prison For Pot ” , “ No More Drug War ” , “ Stop the violence , end prohibition ” , “ Register to vote , Win the Right To Toke ” and , well , you ’ll think of many , they are fun .
Practice them before hand .
Make your signs legible and clear , check spelling beforehand .
People walking with signs while chanting slogans of cannabis liberation is fine for the whole two or three hours , but you can add speakers every 20 minutes or so to change it up .
Campaigning for Ron Paul in 2007 , we learned that a sign saying “ Google Ron Paul ” was very effective in drawing passers - by attention to his videos or philosophy .
A sign at each rally saying “ Google Marc Emery ” or something like that will be helpful in expanding awareness .
Signs suggestions :
* Free Marc Emery
* Free the Prince of Pot
* Google Marc Emery
* America Must Free Marc Emery
* Canada Must Bring Marc Emery Home
* Marc Emery = Political Prisoner
* No Prison For Prince of Pot
* DEA out of __________ ( your country or town here )
* End Prohibition
* No More Drug War
* No Prison For Pot
The purpose of signs is to stir the mind of any passersby who might Google ‘ Marc Emery ’ , ‘ Prince of Pot ’ , ‘ Prohibition ’ , or ‘ Drug War ’ .
It is important to inform your local media of the rally and its purpose , why you support Marc Emery .
Tell them the extradition of a non-violent Canadian to an American prison is WRONG !
Address the fact the DEA ( US Drug Enforcement Administration ) is in your country also , and should be expelled .
One of the under - currents of a worldwide rally , especially with substantial US participation , is to ease the anger many Canadians may feel towards Americans once Marc is incarcerated .
Improperly directed anger will be counter - productive to the cause .
If American rally support is significant , Canadians will see Americans as fellow warriors and victims in the drug war .
The risk is that there will be a lot of unproductive America - bashing by Canadians after Marc ’s sentencing and while he is incarcerated .
Anger and indignation should be channeled against the governments that allow the drug war to exist everywhere on Earth , and towards the politicians that make these injustices and cruelties happen .
On September 10th , 2005 over 40 demonstrations were held around the world to protest Marc ’s arrest for extradition to the United States .
Locations included Moscow , Prague , Wellington , Sydney , Mexico City , Paris , and London ( see more information about that protest here ) .
On September 19th , 2009 more than 100 cities participated in “ The Worldwide Rally For The Prince of Pot ” to demand an end to Marc ’s extradition ( see more information about that protest here ) .
START or ATTEND A RALLY IN YOUR CITY on May 22 , 2010 !
Tell the government to end the War on Drugs and FREE MARC EMERY !

HOW TO HELP FREE MARC EMERY :
First of all and most importantly , please be polite and respectful – but very firm – when contacting the following people .
Secondly , strongly emphasize that Marc Emery is a Canadian citizen who never went to the USA and carried out his activities in Canada .
If he has broken the law in Canada , he should be tried and sentenced in Canada , not sent to a foreign country to be punished under much harsher laws .
Try to bring up these important points along with the “ Facts About Marc Emery ” ( listed below and at www.NoExtradition.net) to help you better explain why Marc Emery should not be imprisoned in the USA :
a ) Vancouver police investigated Marc in 2003 and tried to have charges filed in court , but the Crown refused , so the VPD admitted that the USA picked up the file to get harsh punishment for Marc in the USA .
The Vancouver police worked with Americans on Canadian soil to create the US case .
If Marc could n’t be charged in Canada , he should not be charged in America .
b ) The US District Attorney arranged a plea deal in January 2008 that would allow Marc to serve his time in Canada , as long as the Conservative government laid charges here in Canada , but the government refused .
Again , if the government would n’t charge or punish Marc in Canada , he should not be charged or punished in America .
1 ) Contact your Member of Parliament in Canada or your Representative in the US Congress .
Let them know about Marc Emery ’s situation , and why you and thousands of other voters want Marc to be free in his home country Canada .
Do n’t be afraid or nervous about meeting your representative !
They are paid with your money to represent you , and their job is to listen to you and take your concerns to Parliament / Congress .
Canadians : Meeting your Member of Parliament is something you should do not just for Marc , but also for the future of Canada ( you should express concern about the “ tough - on - crime ” drug laws , like Bill S - 10 ) .
Your Member of Parliament is in town every weekend to meet local voters , and that includes you — so make sure you get your voice heard amongst the anti-marijuana advocates who are visiting their MPs !

“ Today ’s DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery , publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine , and the founder of a marijuana legalization group — is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement .
His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $ 5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts , but those have gone up in smoke today .
Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General ’s most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets — one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery ’s illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada .
Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on . ”

So , how about those Phoenix Coyotes ?
That was some series , was n't it ?
Tense , always in doubt , ultimately won by the favourites but that 's sports for you .
For a neutral it was terrific viewing , and of course a lot of us Oilers fans were less than neutral .
They were the Coyotes !
Against the Red Wings ?
Oiler fans , as a bloc , love underdogs , which makes sense since this season we 're the ultimate underdog .
So a lot of us cheered on the Coyotes and urged them to throw the snake and generally had a good time of it .
Heck , did you see Travis Hair 's letter to Oilers fans urging them to adopt the Coyotes ?
That almost swung me around and I have a heart made of the same cold brick as Patrick O'Sullivan 's hands .
But I am a blogger , and my second duty is to the truth ( my first duty is to Patrick O'Sullivan jokes ) .
So , with all due respect to the Coyotes , who earned my respect and the respect of a lot of others this April , I must regretfully ask that they condemn themselves to the dustbin of history .
It may be insensitive for me to say this now , so soon after their hard - fought elimination , but the truth has no sense of appropriate timing .
You see , the Coyotes are but a mockery of what is good and true .
We Oiler fans - all of us - ought to be cheering for the return of the Winnipeg Jets .
No , this is not simple patriotism , not the blathering drool of the " make it seven ! " crowd waving towels over their heads like drunken orangutans .
The Oilers faithful have their own very specific reasons to want the Jets back and , because I 'm only too happy to tell you all about how clever I am , I shall be specific after the jump .
Perhaps you 're younger than I am and do n't know what the Jets mean - or at least ought to mean - to the Oilers history .
Heck , even I was only nine when the Jets were spirited away to the desert .
But I also spent my formative years ignoring school and reading more about hockey than was really good for me , so I shall appropriate for myself the title of historian .
The Jets and the Oilers have a lot in common .
They were formed in the same year ( 1972 ) in the same division ( the Western ) of the same league ( the World Hockey Association ) .
Of course , their 1972 - 73 seasons went pretty differently apart from that .
The Jets wound up as Western finalists , running out a lineup guys you 've actually heard of like centre Bill Sutherland , goaltenders Joe Daley and Ernie Wakely , and some little - known over - the - hill winger named Bobby Hull .
The Oilers ran out even more recognizable names , or at least recognizable to fans like us , such as Rusty Patenaude , Bill Hicke , and small - town Saskatchewan 's bravest goaltending son Jack Norris .
But those Oilers finished a game below .500 and lost a single - game playoff to the Minnesota Fighting Saints , or at least the first incarnation of the Minnesota Fighting Saints , who would wind up coming back like crabgrass .
The Jets and Oilers were , however , united in mediocrity in the coming seasons .
Both teams were eliminated in the first round of the 1974 playoffs and neither team qualified in 1975 , with the Oilers going two games below .500 despite having Jacques Frickin '
Plante in goal for forty games ( by the way , Plante was 46 at the end of that season ) .
But , with teams moving madly and folding like Steve Tambellini at the poker table , the Jets and Oilers were developing into one of the few geographical rivalries the erratic Association had .
Today , to the extent that the Jets are remembered at all by us Oiler fans , we remember them as our old Smythe Division whipping boys , basement dwellers whose only role in life was losing to the Oilers in the playoffs and occasionally picking up an improbably appealing Canadian boy to be a lone star on a lousy team .
In the World Hockey Association years , things were quite the reverse : the Jets won the 1976 Avco World Trophy after sweeping the Oilers in the second round , were the losing finalists in 1977 while the Oilers went down in the first round to Houston , and another Avco World Trophy came to Winnipeg in 1978 as the Oilers put up another first - round exit .
Only in 1979 could the Oilers rival the Jets ; under head coach Glen Sather and boasting a young centre named Wayne Gretzky , the Oilers won the regular season title by eleven points , cruised through most of the playoffs , and lost only in the championship final to ... the Winnipeg Jets .
The rivalry went south in a hurry after the WHA - NHL merger of 1979 , however .
It was less " merger " and more " screwjob " :
The four WHA teams joining the NHL paid $ 6 million each for the privilege of having their rosters stripped from them and players whose rights were owned by NHL teams reverted to those NHL rosters without compensation .
The Oilers kept Wayne Gretzky , Eddie Mio , and Dave Dryden , as well as picking up some decent pieces like Pat Price , Lee Fogolin , and Dave Hunter in the expansion draft .
The Jets held onto Scott Campbell , Morris Lukowich , and Markus Mattsson .
The highlight of their expansion draft was getting 40 - year - old Bobby Hull back .
The actual best player they picked up was probably Gord McTavish , which is a condemnation in and of itself .
And that 's all she wrote for that rivalry .
But the Jets brought us so much more than their World Hockey Association legacy .
They gave the world the Winnipeg White - Out , which makes waving a towel look positively puerile .
They brought us Dale Hawerchuk , Thomas Steen , and Teemu Selanne - each a certain type of stereotypical undersized player so common to underachieving teams of the era but each also talented enough to ascend to superstardom , as well as possessing an élan that only the Gretzky - era Oilers and the Lafleur - era Canadiens could hope to match .
In latter years they gifted the NHL with Keith Tkachuk , Shane Doan , and a personal favourite by the name of Stu Barnes .
They pulled the infamous Bob Essensa out of Michigan State when grabbing NCAA goaltenders was by no means a fashionable thing to do and somehow moulded him into a starting goaltender in the last years of the wild puck .
The team , while never the most talented , was always one of the most entertaining and the most unabashed fun to cheer for .
Finally , there was their legendary playoff record .
In their NHL history they won only two playoff series , both Smythe semifinals against the Calgary Flames which ought to endear them to us on that basis alone .
They met the Oilers in six playoff series and lost each and every one .
On the last five of those occasions , the Oilers went on to take the Stanley Cup .
Let me put that in perspective .
The Oilers have never won a Stanley Cup without beating the Winnipeg Jets first .
The last of these occasions in 1990 was perhaps the most famous .
The Jets opened the series with a rare win , beating Edmonton 7 - 5 at their own run-and - gun game in a stunned Northlands Coliseum .
But the Oilers clawed back with an overtime win in Game Two , only to head to Winnipeg and lose the next two in a row in a raucous building sensing an upset at last .
But the Oilers reasserted themselves .
A tight 4 - 3 victory at Northlands and then , finally , a precious win over the Jets in their own rink by an identical 4 - 3 score .
The poor Jets had shot their bolt and when they slunk back to Edmonton for Game Seven it was as a beaten team : the final score was 4 - 1 Oilers , and the Oilers had survived their greatest scare of what would be another successful playoff run .
So that , alone , should be one compelling reason to bring back the Jets .
They are the Muttley to our Dick Dasterdly , the Porthos to our d'Artagnan , the yin to our yang .
The Oilers without the Jets is an incomplete system , and it has gone on far too long .
Astronomers have once again found water in an unexpected place , this time on an asteroid in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter .
This artist 's conception shows asteroid 24 Themis and two small fragments , lit by the sun .
The artist has depicted one of the small fragments as inert , as most asteroids are , and the other as having a comet - like tail , produced as water ice vapourizes from its surface .
( ( Gabriel Prez , Servicio MultiMedia , Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias , Tenerife , Spain ) )
The asteroid , called 24 Themis , appears to be covered with a thin layer of frost .
The researchers also found evidence of molecules containing carbon .
This is the first time that water or organic compounds has been found on asteroids .
The astronomers used telescopes at NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility on Hawaii's Mauna Kea mountain to analyze light reflected by the asteroid .
The spectrum of the light was consistent with the presence of water and carbon - containing molecules .
Josh Emery of the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , co-author of one of two studies on the find appearing this week in Nature , said the find supports the idea that an asteroid could be the source of both water and carbon molecules on Earth .
" The organics we detected appear to be complex , long - chained molecules .
Raining down on a barren Earth in meteorites , these could have given a big kick - start to the development of life , " Emery said in a statement .
The water was surprising to find , the researchers said , because at the temperature of the asteroid belt , about – 120 to – 70 C , water ice vapourizes into space .
The asteroids are billions of years old , so the ice on the surface must be replenished somehow .
The astronomers said the most likely source is inside the asteroids .
" This implies that ice is quite abundant in the interior of 24 Themis and perhaps many other asteroids .
This ice on asteroids may be the answer to the puzzle of where Earth 's water came from , " said Emery .
Because asteroids are usually thought of as dry , rocky bodies , the discovery of water on 24 Themis is blurring the line between what 's considered a comet and what 's an asteroid .
FREMONT : Voters in an eastern Nebraskan city have approved a ban on hiring or renting property to illegal immigrants , the latest proposal in a series of immigration regulations taken up around the country .
About 57 per cent of voters in Fremont supported the proposal , according to unofficial results .
Election workers said 3906 voted in favour , with 2908 against the measure on a turnout of 45.7 per cent .
The measure is likely to face a long and costly court battle .
The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will try to block it before it goes into effect .
The town of about 25,000 people has seen its Hispanic population grow in the past 20 years , largely due to the jobs available at the nearby Fremont Beef and Hormel meat - packing plants .
The city also enjoys the low Nebraska unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent .
Nonetheless , residents worry that jobs are going to illegal immigrants , who they fear could drain local resources .
The first serious challenge to the Apple iPad is coming from the most obvious of teams : According to Verizon Chief Exec Lowell McAdam , the carrier is working with Google on " a tablet computer . "
This should be fun .

The WSJ report is about as sparse as possible , mentioning nothing beyond the fact that Verizon wants a tablet , and are now working with Google .
Says McAdam :
We 're looking at all the things Google has in its archives that we could put on a tablet to make it a great experience .

I 'm guessing that did n't come out quite right , but I 'll hazard a guess that this means the the partnership is brand new , and that neither company knows exactly how they 're going to move forward .
I hope for the sake of both companies , and us , that this means that Google is working with Verizon on making the ultimate Android tablet , and that Chrome OS will get brushed aside until it's a bit , er , better .

Let 's play a little game of best case / worst case , shall we ?
Best Case
Google 's ready to prove its tablet mettle , and Verizon wants an answer to AT&T's iPad .
It 's Shakespearean , almost , kind of !
Within months , AT&T and Verizon will fall deeply in love , and commit suicide due to an easily avoidable misunderstanding .
No , wait , wrong play .
I wanted the one where EVERYONE FIGHTS EVERYONE , AND IT IS AWESOME .
This could mean :
• An Android tablet launched with the backing of a major carrier , and presumably a high - profile hardware manufacturer ( Motorola ? )
• Hardware within six months
• An interesting data pricing strategy from Verizon , which will need to compete with AT&T novel ( but flawed ) a la carte system
• An early start against other tablets , specifically from the newly invigorated Palm
• WAR

Worst Case
Sometimes Google is unfocused .
Sometimes Verizon is out of touch .
With their powers combined , we could end up with :
• A Chrome OS tablet .
Web - only tablets are n't as cool as you 'd think .
Google and Verizon need to beat the iPad , not the JooJoo .
Remember this concept ?
Eh. Eric Schmidt reportedly told people that the first Google tablet would run Android , but you never know .
• Massive lead time .
Android was announced in November of 2007 , which was interpreted ( correctly ) as Google 's move to compete with the iPhone .
Problem is , the T - Mobile G1 did n't ship until nearly a year later .
This tablet needs to hit the market well before the next iteration of the iPad , and at least as quickly as whatever WebOS slate HP is working on right now .
• Stupid data pricing .
Verizon took Microsoft 's promising new Kin and strangled it in the delivery room .
A traditional contract , or overpriced data , could do the same to a tablet .
• A raw Android tablet .
The iPad has problems , nearly all of which Android is poised to avoid — but that could befall it , if Google has n't been paying attention .
I 'm talking about better media support , open accessory compatibility , and a syncing app that exists , but is n't necessary for the device to function .

Granted , this whole thing could be a public bargaining strategy for Verizon , a misrepresentation of the facts by an executive who does n't seem to have a perfectly clear view of the facts , or mere hot air .
But I do n't want to believe that .
I can't . [ WSJ ]
SAN FRANCISCO - Google executives offered a mea culpa of sorts for Google Wave on Wednesday , noting that the company did a poor job of explaining Wave 's purpose .
Going forward , the evolution of Wave will probably look a lot like Gmail , they said .
Google a year ago at the Google I / O show here , promising it that would revolutionize real - time communication .
At the time , Wave was presented as a preview , although Google did let its Gmail e-mail product languish as a beta for several years .
At Google I / O 2010 , Google released Wave to the Web at large , after restricting it to developers for the past six months , and then to a limited number of beta testers thereafter .
Google also made
Wave part of Google Apps and made other improvements , such as allowing robots that originally lived only on Wave to live elsewhere on the Web , and open - sourcing the beginnings of a client - server protocol .
" When we put it out there , we did so in sort of a raw form ... what are the set of use cases , how can we make them more useful and more productive , can do it all in Wave , " Lars Rasmussen , the head of Google Wave , said in a press conference here Wednesday .
" No longer do we need to have the discussion here and have instant messages over here .
Can we do it all in one tool ? "
The lesson that Google learned was that it needed to do a much better job of explaining Wave , Rasmussen said .
A year ago , Google offered an hour - long demo preview of what the technology could do , " but we failed to answer the question of what can I actually use Wave for , right now , right here , " he said .
The initial experience of Wave was " a little daunting , " Rasmussen said .
" How do you get your mind around that we 're combining communication and collaboration in one spot ? "
Rasmussen asked .
But he said that there 's been a " big difference " in the feedback received from Wave six months ago to present day .
The problem was that users did n't get it .
To solve that , Google added to the number of tutorials and other aids to ease users into Wave .
Google is also beginning to realize that the consumers do n't want to add an extra tab to their browser .
As a result , Google Wave may end up as a part of Gmail , Rasmussen said .
" I think what we 'll work with in a very short time is integration betwen Gmail and Wave ... over time , and I 'm not promising anything , the two ends will end up more like one , " Rasmussen said .
Some wins for Wave , however , include the " live typing " feature , where users can see what the other is typing as they 're inputting the text .
Rasmussen said that the live feature helped people engaged in a dialogue to anticipate what the other user was going to say , which increased the speed of the conversation .
People also saw others in a Wave as individuals , rather than anonymous e-mail addresses , he said .
So what is Wave good for ?
Working as a group , Rasmussen said .
" We found the sweet spot is all about groups collaborating on things , " he said .
The Seattle Times embedded a Wave as part of its breaking news coverage , and Deloitte & Touche have also used them .
Executives from Salesforce.com and SAP were also on hand to talk about how their companies had integrated waves for collaborative purposes .
More evidence is in that charter schools – at least on average – do no better than regular public schools .
Middle - school students who were selected by lottery to attend charter schools performed no better than their peers who lost out in the lottery and attended nearby public schools , according to a study funded by the federal government and released Tuesday .
This is the first large - scale randomized study to be conducted across multiple states , and it lends some fuel to those who say there is little evidence to back the drive for more charters .
But the study also found more nuanced evidence that the charters that work best are those serving lower - income students , especially in urban areas .
“ When you take a look at our findings and then look back at previous studies , they start to follow a pattern , ” says Philip Gleason , the study ’s director and a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research , which produced the study .
“ Studies that have focused on the largest set of schools find either no or negative effects , but schools in larger urban areas , serving the most disadvantaged students , do have an effect . ”
Charters have been a hot topic lately , with a big push from the Obama administration for states to expand the number of charter schools and to replicate those that seem to have the most effect .
Charters are publicly funded but largely autonomous , and they are frequently criticized by teachers unions , in particular , since they are not bound by union agreements .
The push to create more charters has been questioned in light of research showing no advantage – or even a negative effect – for students attending charter schools .
Such research includes a much - publicized study a year ago from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes ( CREDO ) .
Several other , narrower studies – including one on New York City charters and a study that came out last week on charter schools operated by the Knowledge Is Power Program ( KIPP ) – have showed positive outcomes for charters .
The result , say education researchers , is a heated debate but also a growing consensus that charters , like regular public schools , vary widely in their quality and that they are at their best when serving a more disadvantaged population .
“ It ’s not surprising that suburban charter schools do n’t do anything , because suburban schools are already pretty good , ” says Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach , a professor at the University of Chicago ’s Harris School who has studied charter schools in Chicago .
“ At this point , ” she adds , “ the literature is still trying to figure out , are charter schools better or not ?
And arguably , that ’s the wrong question to even be asking . ”
More interesting , Professor Schanzenbach suggests , would be research on what makes some charters more effective .
The Mathematica study began to explore some of those questions , and it found some correlation between better performance and smaller charters and those that used ability grouping in classrooms more than surrounding schools did .
The study looked at the performance of students after they had been at a charter school for a year or two .
Such national studies only highlight the broad differences in what is ultimately a state - driven policy , says Robin Lake , associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington in Seattle .
“ We ’ve learned a lot about how to make charter schools work , ” she says , adding that a lot of attention now is focusing on how to fine - tune the authorizing process so that states select the best schools , monitor them well , and then shut down those that are n’t performing sufficiently .
But others believe that , while there still may be a place for some charters , research like this study does n’t justify the massive public - policy push to create more charters quickly .
“ The worry is that President Obama and others are getting seduced by the movement because they ’re looking at the results from boutique charters [ like KIPP and Aspire ] rather than at the wide array of charters that do n’t outperform regular schools , ” says Bruce Fuller , an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley .
Professor Fuller remains “ cautiously optimistic ” about charters and says they seem to do some things well , such as attracting energetic young teachers .
But , he adds , “ It ’s irresponsible that President Obama would [ push ] all 50 states to create more charter schools in light of such sketchy evidence . ”

" Prada is selling their products to women , yet they are abusing hard working females who supported their company for decades . "
Rina Bovrisse , the former manager suing Prada for telling her to fire corporate employees it deemed " unattractive , " is back .

Bovrisse 's case recently entered Japan 's civil legal system , after arbitration — a compulsory precursor step to filing a wrongful termination lawsuit in Japan — failed to result in any resolution .
Bovrisse , who has worked in the luxury goods industry for nearly 20 years , including lengthy stints at Louis Vuitton and at Prada in New York , claims that within months of being hired as a senior regional manager by Prada in Japan , she was directed by her superiors to fire or demote 15 women managers they deemed unattractive or too old .

" [ M]ost of the female employees at Prada Japan distant themselves from me in fear of getting fired too , " says Bovrisse .
" They reminded me of women repressed of their rights decades ago .
That was when I was like , wait a minute , this is 2010 , are they for real ? "
Bovrisse says that while she complied with the directives of Prada 's Japanese C.E.O. , Davide Sesia , and senior human resources manager Hiroyuki Takahashi during her first three months with the company , when she was a probationary hire , as soon as she became a permanent employee , she signaled her disagreement with the policies through the appropriate channels .
The reasons offered for the demotions were that the employees concerned were " ugly , fat , old , disgusting , or with bad teeth , [ or ] not Sesia 's & Takahashi's type , " says Bovrisse .
" They liked ‘ cute ' rather than smart , highly skilled female employees . "
Then higher - ups told Bovrisse to change her hair color and lose weight .
Demotions , especially in combination with a transfer to a rural or undesirable store , were preferred over outright firings because the employees would often resign anyway .
" This works in Prada 's favor as they do n't have to provide any layoff or termination package . "
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
" Prada is selling their products to women , yet they are abusing hard working females who supported their company for decades , " says Bovrisse .
And although she claims her former employers offered her a cash settlement during the compulsory arbitration , she continued her case .
" In Japan , we do n't fight for money , we fight for human rights . "
Discrimination based on age or looks is hardly unknown in the field of retail or in the fashion industry as a whole , although it is perhaps slightly unusual for a corporate employee such as Bovrisse to fall subject it .
Abercrombie & Fitch 's controversial " looks " policy was recently called into question when it banished Rhiam Dean , an employee with a prosthetic arm , to its store room .
( It lost the discrimination lawsuit Dean brought . )
And everyone knows that store employees — especially in big cities — are at least partly selected for their looks .
Working in fashion , one almost expects to encounter a certain level of discrimination based on factors beyond one 's own control — and yet even then , Bovrisse says what she faced at Prada was unprecedented in her career :
It was a shock .
I did n't work as a model on the runway ... I worked in this industry for almost two decades worldwide and I never thought I would face anything like this .
The females I respect who taught and inspired me in my career all fall into their ' not Prada look ' category .
Even the famous ones like Oprah / Suzy Menkes , they are not young or size 0 .

Prada eventually fired Bovrisse , first , it claimed , for taking her complaints up the chain of command beyond Japan , and later , it said , for speaking without authorization to the media .
Her career is now effectively over .
" Everyone knows everyone in fashion , " she says .
And her case — which may not succeed — is still many months away from any potential resolution .
But Bovrisse believes that what happened to her was wrong , and that the world depends on people not just rolling over and taking it when the world wrongs them .
" I heard Gucci just announced worldwide managers to be careful about discrimination mentioning about what happened recently to ' another luxury brand ' as a case study to learn from .
If it helps minimize any potential harassment and discrimination in the workplace in any or all industries , I think my enormous stress is worth it . "
A recent history of negative publicity , not to mention even a handful of high - dollar - value damages rulings , might have the kind of chilling effect that would allow the women of fashion to breathe a little easier .

Follow the money in the Koch wiki .
Rich Fink was an executive vice president and a member of the board of directors of Koch Industries , Inc. ; a co-founder of the Koch - funded Mercatus Center , president and a director of the Charles G. Koch Foundation [ 1 ] and a board member at a number of other organizations with ties to the Koch brothers .
The conservative Weekly Standard has described Fink as " a fixture in Koch Industries , coordinating business ventures , philanthropy , and activism and becoming Charles Koch ’s intellectual sounding board . " [ 2 ]
The National Journal reported that Fink retired in 2015 and is said to be " battling health problems . " [ 3 ]
Ties to the Koch Brothers
The conservative Weekly Standard has described Fink as " a fixture in Koch Industries , coordinating business ventures , philanthropy , and activism and becoming Charles Koch ’s intellectual sounding board . "
[ 2 ]
In addition to holding an executive position at Koch Industries , Fink sits along with Charles Koch on the boards of the Institute for Humane Studies and the Mercatus Center , as well as serving on the boards of the Koch Family Foundations .
According to a 2011 profile of Charles Koch in Philanthropy , Fink 's relationship with the Kochs began in the late 1970s when he was looking for funding to form the Center for the Study of Market Processes , which was to be a center for advancing Austrian school economics at Rutgers , where Fink was a professor .
Charles Koch flew Fink to Wichita to be interviewed for funding , which he received .
[ 4 ]
The Center later moved to George Mason University , where it eventually became the Mercatus Center , which has received millions in funding from the Kochs over the years .
Philanthropy writes that Charles Koch and Fink shared a goal for Mercatus :
" ... Koch and Fink had another goal in mind .
Mercatus would bridge two worlds .
Like many of the on -campus centers that Koch has funded , it would continue to conduct original academic research [ … ]
At the same time , it would take advantage of its proximity to Washington , bringing its scholarship into direct contact with public policy . " [ 4 ]
With financial help from the Koch brothers , Richard Fink assisted in establishing the conservative think - tank Mercatus Center , as well as Citizens for a Sound Economy ( CSE ) and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation .
CSE was later renamed the Americans for Prosperity Foundation , which in turn launched the powerful conservative interest group Americans for Prosperity . [ 4 ]
Fink is a board member of AFP , while David Koch is chairman of the board for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation .
Registered as a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) social welfare non-profit , AFP spent $ 122 million during the 2012 election cycle [ 5 ] , including over $ 33 million on its campaign against Barack Obama 's re-election . [ 6 ]
According to the Weekly Standard , Fink also shares credit with Charles Koch for initiating the Koch network semi-annual summit meetings in 2003 .
[ 2 ]
While lists of participants at the secretive meetings have not generally been made public , available documents for meetings in 2010 and 2014 show that Fink was scheduled to make presentations and meet with donors .
A 1997 report by the National Committee on Responsive Philanthropy included this illuminating description of the Fink / Koch strategy to " invest in change along the entire production continuum " :
" In a presentation at the Philanthropy Roundtable 's 1995 annual conference , Richard Fink , president of the Charles G. Koch and Claude R. Lambe charitable foundations , made good use of market metaphors to outline how foundations can exert the greatest impact on public policy .
Adapting laissez - faire economist Friedrich Hayek 's model of the production process to social change grant - making , Fink argued that the translation of ideas into action requires the development of intellectual raw materials , their conversion into specific policy products , and the marketing and distribution of these products to citizen - consumers .
" Grantmakers , Fink argued , would do well to invest in change along the entire production continuum , funding scholars and university programs where the intellectual framework for social transformation is developed , think tanks where scholarly ideas get translated into specific policy proposals , and implementation groups to bring these proposals into the political marketplace and eventually to consumers . " [ 7 ]
See also : Koch network .
Fink has been involved with many Koch - linked organizations , including :
Richard Fink 's son , Chris Fink , serves as vice president for development at Americans for Prosperity . [ 10 ]
Background
Richard Fink received his bachelor 's degree in economics from Rutgers University , his master 's from UCLA , and his doctorate from NYU . [ 9 ]
By 1977 , Fink was a professor of economics at Rutgers University , where he founded the Center for Market Processes with financial help from Charles Koch [ 4 ] .
Fink was also on the editorial board of the Austrian Economics Newsletter from 1977 to 1982 .
A working paper for the Ludwig von Mises Institute includes
Fink in a list of scholars who were " very active " in the revival of Austrian economics in the 1970s . [ 11 ]
In 1980 Fink moved to George Mason University , taking with him the Center for Market Processes , which was renamed the Mercatus Center in 1998 . [ 12 ]
Fink continues to serve as a member of the board of directors at the Mercatus Center . [ 9 ]
Fink left George Mason in 1984 to become president and CEO of a new Koch - funded think - tank , Citizens for a Sound Economy . [ 4 ]
According to the Weekly Standard , David Koch described CSE as
" a sales force that participated in political campaigns or town hall meetings , in rallies , to communicate to the public at large much of the information that these think tanks were creating [ … ]
Almost like a door - to - door sales force that some of the cosmetics organizations have . " [ 2 ]
In 1993 Citizens for a Sound Economy spearheaded a campaign to stop President Clinton 's proposed energy tax .
According to Jane Mayer in the New Yorker :
" The group waged a successful assault on Clinton ’s proposed B.T.U. tax on energy , for instance , running advertisements , staging media events , and targeting opponents .
And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol — rallies that NPR described as “ designed to strike fear into the hearts of wavering Democrats . ” [ 13 ]
Fink joined Koch Industries in 1990 . [ 9 ]
Controversies
Fink has decried accusations that the Koch brothers have engaged in " astroturfing . "
In an interview with the Washington Examiner , Fink made the following statement in response to a question about accusations that Tea Party groups were " corporate - sponsored ‘ astro - turf ’ rather than real grassroots movements " :
" That ’s nonsense .
It ’s clear from the very personal and passionate expressions of concern at these events that they have n’t been scripted or orchestrated .
Tea parties reflect a spontaneous recognition by people that if they do not act , the government will bankrupt their families and their country .
They ’re absolutely right about that .
" Now , if our work over the past 30 or 40 years has helped stimulate some of those citizens who are becoming more active , that ’s great , but it ’s a far cry from pulling strings .
What we have done is support the Americans for Prosperity Foundation [...]
David Koch has been a steadfast supporter of that foundation , though Koch - related funding of AFP and the foundation has amounted to a small percentage of their overall funding in recent years .
That ’s a testament to their broad appeal .
" AFP and its state chapters have begun collaborating with tea party groups , and we ’re in favor of any group willing to constructively address irresponsible government policies . " [ 14 ]
Defending the Kochs ' Support of WI Gov. Scott Walker
In February 2011 , " Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker fell prey to a prank phone call from a New York blogger impersonating David Koch , one of the two wealthy brothers who were big donors to his political campaign and GOP efforts generally , " according to NPR . [ 15 ]
Fink responded in an interview with the conservative National Review Online , saying
" With the Left trying to intimidate the Koch brothers to back off of their support for freedom and signaling to others that this is what happens if you oppose the administration and its allies , we have no choice but to continue to fight . " [ 16 ]
Ties to Big Tobacco
Fink established himself as an ally of big tobacco in the mid 1980's , personally writing letters to U.S. representatives as well as the Surgeon General and testifying before the National Economic Commission , using his positions at the Mercatus Center and CSE as leverage .
In September 1985 , Fink wrote to a federal representative , stating ,
" Dear Representative :
On behalf of the 220,000 members of Citizens for a Sound Economy , I urge you to consider the heavy costs of the U.S. tobacco program , and the enormous benefits to consumers and taxpayers which would result from the elimination of that program . " [ 17 ]
The tobacco industry provided significant amounts of funding for CSE in the 1990s .
Between 1995 and 1999 , at least $ 1,000,000 was given to CSE , with some estimates suggesting the number to be closer to $ 2,000,000 .
In some cases , CSE wrote to tobacco corporations explicitly requesting funds for its campaigns against tobacco regulation . [ 18 ]
In 1999 the United States filed suit against American tobacco companies for deceiving the public about the dangers of tobacco use .
Faced with $ 280 billion in penalties , tobacco companies sought help from allies outside the industry whose goal was to avert the federal suit .
A document drafted by Phillip Morris asked these allies " to write op - eds , LTEs and editorials , give speeches or testimonies , create policy reports , join coalitions , and provide access to policymakers . " [ 19 ]
Already an established tobacco ally , in 2000 CSE requested $ 2,000,000 from Phillip Morris in order to continue their pro-tobacco advocacy .
Positions held
The most effective tool for cleaning up the oil working its way into southern Louisiana wetlands may , in the end , be the equivalent of a box of kitchen matches .
Controlled burns are perhaps the least - worst alternative among a small handful of approaches to clear contaminated wetlands of oil or its refined products , several researchers say .
So far , oil from the five - week - old BP oil spill has hit about 65 miles of the Louisiana coastline and has traveled as many as 12 miles inland , according to state officials
IN PICTURES : The Gulf oil spill 's impact on nature
As oil migrates into the wetlands , several possibilities for dealing with it exist .
But not all of them may be practical in this situation , cautions Qianxin Lin , a coastal ecologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge .
Part of the challenge is that the oil reaching the coast has had several days to weather – essentially losing the components that evaporate most readily , leaving a thicker , watery mousse to move inland with winds and tides .
1. Mighty microbes
One approach that could work is to fertilize the microbial community with nitrogen and phosphorous , which boost the population of the microbes and increases their level of activity .
The hope is that the beefed - up microbe population in the affected wetlands would degrade the oil .
But because the oil is affecting tidal wetlands " we should be very cautious , " says Dr. Lin .
This method is best suited for marsh areas isolated from the rise and fall of tides , he adds .
Tides could carry the nutrients out into the Gulf , triggering algae blooms , which already are a problem offshore .
The problem of algae blooms manifests itself each spring and into mid-summer in the Gulf 's so - called dead zone .
The zone is triggered as nutrients flow down the Mississippi , triggering a population explosion of plankton off the coast .
The plankton eventually die and decompose , a process that strips the once - plankton - rich waters of oxygen vital to fish and bottom dwellers such as crab and shrimp .
Moreover , the marsh sediment already is oxygen poor .
Even when fertilized , microbes might not become as active as anticipated because microbial activity could be limited by the relative lack of available oxygen .
2. Cutting marsh grasses
Another approach involves cutting the oil - coated marsh grasses at the surface
This method would leave the roots intact to hold the soil and regenerate new grass during subsequent growing seasons but would help get rid of oil that can contaminate animals that wander through the grasses .
The movement of people or machines through an affected marsh , however , could drive any oil that has seeped into the sediment deeper , where it can remain to affect the ecosystem for decades , scientists say .
3. Controlled burn
That leaves burning the oil and oiled grasses as the approach that may stand the best chance of helping the wetlands recover , Lin says .
The approach appears to have been successful in dealing with a relatively small spill triggered by hurricane Katrina , according to Amy Merten , a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
In a report documenting the effort , she writes that the storm destroyed a storage tank owed by Chevron Oil .
Most of the oil remained in retention areas designed to contain the leaks .
Later , however , hurricane Rita drove roughly 100 to 200 barrels of the oil into an adjacent marsh .
Burning the marsh removed between 80 and 90 percent of the oil .
Much of the rest was soaked up later with nets or special oil - absorbent material .
Interestingly , the burn took place months after Rita hit , suggesting that , under some conditions , there need not be an extreme sense of urgency if authorities choose this option .
Enough residue remained to be deemed a hazard to wildlife for a time .
But after about two years , monitoring efforts showed that the ecological structure and function of the burned marsh returned to closely match those of adjacent , unburned and untainted marshes , Lin says .
The technique is n't a panacea , notes Lin , who along with LSU colleague Irving Mendelssohn , has studied it .
If water levels in the marsh are too low – perhaps an inch or less covering the sediment – the fire 's heat likely will destroy the roots , which are vital to preventing erosion .
And any intrusion of oil into the soil also can kill off the plants .
Soil retention is crucial to a delta region already losing some 34 square miles of coast a year to sea - level rise – a trend being aggravated by ecologically harmful land - use and flood - control practices .
Efforts to deal with the oil encroaching on wetlands represent " a real challenging problem , " Lin says .

It was only a year ago that Miss USA sanctioned Carrie Prejean for posing topless .
Now , the same organization has released photos of the 2010 contestants rife with soft - porn clichés .
Even pageant owner Donald Trump said the photos — in which the ladies contort on silky sheets — were " a little over the top . "
Should a contest that 's popular with young girls and is still described as a " talent " competition be working this ultra-sexy vibe ?
( Watch a Fox report about the racy Miss USA promotional photos )
This is a pageant , not Playboy :
What kind of a role model are these " scantily - clad babes " for the " little girls , tweens and teens " who watch the pageant ? , ask Lindsey DiMattina and Bonnie Fuller at Hollywood Life .
Miss USA was once a " competition for a college scholarship based on the values of hard work and selfless beauty " — but clearly , now it 's just an audition for a " Playboy center spread . "
Miss USA official photos shocker — is this what our country is coming to ? "
These are classy photos for a sexy contest :
These are " incredibly PG " photos , says Bella at Thinkfashion .
Unlike Carrie Prejean , " it 's not like they 're showing their tatas or anything . "
And besides , these beauty pageants are unashamedly about " attractiveness and sex appeal . "
If you 're shocked by under - dressed women " you should be watching the annual spelling bee , " not Miss USA .
" Miss USA 2010 racy photos — what 's the big deal ? "
A publicity stunt that shows Miss USA for what it really is :
These contests are now so dated they need a scandal to make people watch , says Kirby at Chicago Now .
Well , this is a " brilliant way to market a dying contest " — but by descending to an " all time low . "
I 've always taught my daughters that beauty pageants are " a ridiculous way to expose insecure women . "
Thank you Miss USA for proving me right .
" Miss USA pics — scandalous or brilliant marketing ? "

Get Off SSRI Drugs and Overcome Depression Naturally
by Jeffrey Dach MD
A Young Woman with Depression and PMS Gets Off SSRI Drugs , and Reclaims Her Life , a Case Report
T hirty Two old Debbie came into my office on November 7 , along with her Dad , complaining of severe PMS , painful periods with irregular cycles for which birth control pills had been tried and discontinued because of side effects .
Debbie is so depressed that she spends much of her time alone in her room .
She is on two different antidepressants , Zoloft 200 mg / day and Wellbutrin 300 mg / day prescribed by her psychiatrist .
She has been unable to sleep for many years without Ambien , a prescription sleep drug .
Her Fast Food Diet diet from McDonald's , Wendy ’s and Taco Bell , and lack of exercise has left her overweight .
She takes no nutritional supplements .
Her physical exam shows dilated pupils , dry skin , and brittle thin nails .
Her reflexes , although hyperactive , are delayed ( 230 msec ) .
Header Image : Dilated Pupils , a common finding on SSRI Drugs .
Laboratory Studies
Debbie ’s labs showed a low Vitamin B - 12 level of 304 ( normal above 400 ) , and an extremely low Vitamin D level of 14 ( deficiency is below 20 ) .
Her thyroid labs were low with a TSH of 4.0 ( normal less than 2.5 ) , and a free T3 of 270 ( normal 230-420 ) . (
17
) .
Her luteal phase progesterone level was low as well .
Deciding to Get OFF the SSRI's
I explained to Debbie , that her insomnia , dilated pupils and hyperactive reflexes were du e to the SSRI antidepressant drugs which are over - stimulating her nervous system .
When I suggested that she taper off the SSRI drugs , she and her dad breathed a sigh of relief , and said " that was the main reason they came to see me , to get off the drugs . "
I suggested that Debbie and her Dad go back to her psychiatrist and ask the doctor to work with them in getting off the drugs by providing a tapering schedule .
Later , I learned that her psychiatrist was in general agreement , yet was dragging his feet and refused to provide the tapering schedule for Debbie to get off the SSRI drugs .
After waiting a few weeks realizing we were just wasting time , I finally went ahead and called into her pharmacy the authorization to reduce her SSRI dosage in half every week until the dosage was small enough to stop altogether .
Tapering is required because the SSRI drugs are chemically addictive and can produce withdrawal effects .
5 - HTP for Sleep , acts as an Antidepressant
For sleep during the SSRI tapering period , I recommended 5 - HTP capsules which increases serotonin naturally with no side effects . (
20
)
She was encouraged to stop the prescription sleep drugs ( Ambien ) .
I explained to Debbie that low Vitamin B - 12 , low Vitamin D and low thyroid function could all be possible causes of depression .
John R Lee MD , Pioneered Use of Progesterone
Natural Progesterone for PMS
The PMS and painful periods were treated with natural progesterone capsules , 50 mg twice a day for the last two weeks of her cycle ( days 14 - 28 ) .
The night - time progesterone had the added benefit of helping her sleep .
Debbie was started on natural thyroid half grain daily , high quality multivitamin , B12 , vitamin D , and iodine supplementation , stopped the fast food , and began going out more for daily activities .
By December 3 , Debbie had tapered down to Zoloft 50 mg per day and Wellbutrin 100 mg per day .
She says , " I am feeling good in general .
I have a lot of energy .
I am out of my room more .
I am basically in a good mood , and sleeping about 4 hours a night . "
By mid December , Debbie was off the SSRI drugs and off the sleeping pills .
A Dramatic Improvement
By January 28 , 2008 , Dad calls in and says , " Debbie is doing so much better .
She has more energy and is sleeping well .
The difference is between Night and Day . "
That same day , Debbie calls in and says , " I feel a lot better .
My energy is pretty good .
I am back to work at my mother - in - law ’s business at the sales counter .
I am sleeping good at night 6 ½ to 7 hours .
My mood is stable , pretty much happy .
More normal than before .
I ’m not snappy , and not in my room as much .
I am getting out and doing stuff . "
Regarding her last menstrual cycle , Debbie remarked " This time , no cramps , no PMS , no mood swings .
The progesterone capsules are definitely helping , I have never had a period without pain before .
It was awesome to have no pain .
Now , I can do normal stuff .
Before , when I had my menstrual period , I would be in bed for 7 days because of the pain . ”
Adverse Side Effects of SSRI drugs
Adverse side effects of SSRI antidepressants include akathesia , a form of agitation which drives people to commit suicide , sexual dysfunction ( impotence ) , tremor , involuntary body and facial movements , tardive dyskinesia , and hyperactive reflexes indicating a hyperactive nervous system .
The SSRI induced loss of sexual function may be irreversible even after discontinuation of the drug . (
1
)
In many studies , SSRI efficacy was no better than placebo raising questions about SSRI efficacy .
It is astonishing that today , SSRI antidepressants are the standard mainstream medical treatment for PMS ( Pre-Menstrual Syndrome ) .
In addition , BCP's , birth control pills are frequenty given as treatment for PMS , irregular periods , or any female complaint for that matter ( relating to cycles ) .
Natural , bioidentical Progesterone is a far better and more effective alternative for PMS .
Broda Barnes
found irregular cycles frequently responded to natural thyroid in spite of " normal " thyroid labs .
SSRI drugs for PMS - The Wrong Way
A Practice Which Should Be Abandoned
SSRI antidepressants may have some justifiable uses as a temporary treatment in the severly depressed .
However , the widespread usage of SSRI antidepressants for PMS and Menopause should be abandoned .
Women on SSRI antidepressants for PMS , or menopausal symptoms should be encouraged to taper off the SSRI drugs ( under a physician ’s supervision ) .
The correct diagnostic workup includes hormone levels , thyroid panel , vitamin D and B12 levels .
Treatment with natural bio-identical progesterone , natural thyroid and vitamin supplementation is more effective with fewer side effects than the current mainstream use of SSRI antidepressants or BCP 's ( birth control pills ) .
A Successful Outcome
The case of Debbie Depressed illustrates a successful outcome treating depression and PMS with progesterone , natural thyroid , vitamins D and B12 , and by modifying diet and lifestyle .
It is very gratifying to see Debbie make such a dramatic recovery after discontinuing the SSRI drugs .

Every collection starts small .
Think back to that very first dusty 45 - rpm single you found in your uncle ’s attic , now flanked by scores of vintage vinyl neatly shelved in the living room .
Collecting spirits is no different .
A road trip through Bourbon County , a dinner - party gift of aged Scotch whisky , and before you know it , your libations have taken over more than their fair share of kitchen - cabinet space .
Congratulations :
It ’s time to acquire a liquor cabinet .
First popular during Prohibition , when liquor was often stored out of sight , the home bar has re-emerged alongside classic cocktails as a staple of domestic entertaining .
Go - to furniture retailers like Crate & Barrel and Pottery Barn sell a number of credenzas , consoles and sideboards perfectly suited for wine and spirits storage .
But that ’s presuming you ’re game for spending upward of $ 1,000 on mass - produced furniture .
For those who ’d prefer a unique , vintage piece with a little history , home - bar alternatives abound .
“ The best advice I have , ” says Daniel Hyatt , manager at San Francisco ’s craft cocktail - centric Alembic Bar , “ is to be creative .
A small bookshelf can make a nice bar ; a large rolling - toolbox , like you ’d find at an auto shop , also makes a nice bar . ”
In other words , anything goes .
Hyatt ’s home bar was found at a second - hand store .
But for other spirits enthusiasts , a single cabinet can be too limiting .
Mixologist Michael Robertson , who slings drinks at Portland , Ore. ’s Driftwood Room at Hotel deLuxe , found potential in an old piano .
“ I have made four - tiered shelves where the keys and top were , ” he wrote in a recent email .
“ I took the front panels off and I light it up with candles and rope lights . ”
Realistically , converting a piano into liquor storage is n’t something most folks have the time , ambition or skill to take on .
Much less daunting : Browsing for well - constructed cabinetry at flea markets , antiques and thrift stores , garage and estate sales , and online auctions .
Look for wood structures built with genuine craftsmanship ( dovetail joints are good , veneer finishes are bad ) , sturdy shelves ( preferably a foot between them , to accommodate tall bottles ) and latching doors .
Antique wood ice - chests are ideal , given their just - right capacity with built - in shelving and airtight doors .
Fairly common at antiques stores and flea markets , they typically sell for a few hundred dollars or less .
Several bartenders I spoke with also mentioned adapting vintage Victrola record cabinets , which have ample storage suitable for tall bottles .
They ’re not especially rare , which means they ’re priced affordably .
A quick search on Craigslist found a “ circa 1930s Victor Victrola cabinet ... currently used as bar , ” asking price $ 50 .
There are bona - fide vintage liquor cabinets out there too .
I searched for about six months on Craigslist before happening upon my custom - built 1930s - era dark - wood bar cabinet , with a built - in light and pullout shelf for glassware .
My bar was listed in the dead of winter , its glass doors and interior light lovingly repaired by its seller , Clarence , who stores and sells his estate - sale finds at an unheated , makeshift storefront on Chicago ’s South Side .
My burgeoning collection of spirits has since graduated from the kitchen cabinet to said liquor cabinet in the dining room — with a nice view of the record collection .
TOOLS OF THE TRADE
Beyond spirits , experts like cocktail historian David Wondrich emphasize that basic tools are second only to basic recipes .
“ Beyond that , it ’s icing on the cake , ” Wondrich says .
“ A lot of people will mistake getting the gear right for getting the technique right . ”
While Wondrich does n’t have a home bar — he admits “ there ’s no way I could fit any of ( my collection ) into anything but an actual bar ” — he relies on a simple bar kit for home entertaining .
In it are a cocktail shaker and mixing glass for stirred drinks , a two - part ( Boston - style ) shaker for shaken drinks , a bar spoon , ice cracker and measuring device .
STOCKING UP
An empty liquor cabinet is about as useful as a well with no water .
You do n’t have to spend a fortune , but keep in mind that “ cheap booze will lead to inferior drinks , ” says Toby Maloney , co-partner at New York - based Alchemy Consulting , who has designed beverage programs for Nashville ’s Patterson House and Chicago ’s Violet Hour , among others .
Maloney is among 10 boozehounds from around the country whom we polled for recommendations on bar basics , as well as a few upgrades .

Israel ’s propaganda war with the Palestinians and the Arab world has intensified in recent years , and partisans of both sides in Europe and the US have been active in this .
Israel needs to cultivate the support of the West to survive , so this aspect of the conflict has always been of crucial importance .
Israel ’s image in the West first suffered significantly during the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
The long siege of Beirut , the massacres in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila , perpetrated while Israel looked on , shocked the world .
The impact of these events , comparable to that of the Vietnam war on the US , is still felt even in Israel ( 1 ) .
Between the invasion of Lebanon and the start of the first intifada ( at the end of 1987 ) , Israel ’s “ new historians ” ( 2 ) re-examined the central myths of Zionist ideology critically , and their rewriting of the story of Israel ’s origins gave rise to the small but significant movement of “ post - Zionism ” .
But it failed to prevent a gradual ideological shift to the right in Israeli society , the premature collapse of the Oslo accords and the emergence of an aggressive “ neo- Zionism ” .
According to the Israeli sociologist Uri Ram , “ post - Zionism is citizen - oriented , supporting equal rights , and in that sense favouring a state of all its citizens within the boundaries of the Green Line [ the border between Israel and the West Bank prior to the 1967 war ] , universal and global .
Neo -Zionism is particularist , tribal , Jewish , ethnic nationalist , fundamentalist and even fascist on the fringe ” ( 3 ) .
Israel ’s sabotage of the peace talks , its rapid colonisation of the occupied Palestinian territories and its deadly incursions into Lebanon ( 2006 ) and Gaza ( 2008 - 9 ) worsened the deterioration of its image .
In an attempt to halt this decline , the Israeli authorities , and their unconditional supporters in the West , continue to invoke the memory of the Holocaust in the hope that it will legitimise their actions ( 4 ) .
They have also attempted to implicate the Palestinians and the Arabs in the Nazi genocide .
The Zionist authorities started accusing the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , Amin al - Husseini ( 5 ) soon after 1945 .
A figurehead of Palestinian nationalism in the 1920s and 1930s , he was exiled from Palestine by the British in 1937 .
After a short time in Iraq , he joined the Axis cause in 1941 and spent the war in Berlin and Rome , contributing actively to the propaganda efforts of the Axis powers , helping to set up Bosnian Muslim units of the German Waffen - SS – which did not , however , commit any acts of anti-semitic violence .
A propaganda puppet
Even before his exile , Husseini had been discredited in the Arab world , if not in Palestine , and his exhortations to join the Axis cause made little impression .
According to a US military historian , only 6,300 soldiers from Arab countries passed through German military organisations – 1,300 from Palestine , Syria and Iraq , the rest from North Africa .
The British army was able to recruit 9,000 Arab soldiers from Palestine alone while 250,000 North African troops served in the French Army of Liberation and accounted for the majority of its dead and wounded ( 6 ) .
But the Zionists claimed the mufti was an official representative of the Palestinians and Arabs and in 1945 demanded ( without success ) that he be handed over to the international military tribunal at Nuremberg , as if he had been a key part of the Nazi genocide machine .
Articles , pamphlets and books were produced to present Husseini as a candidate for prosecution .
The mufti served a symbolic purpose , allowing the Zionists to claim that the Palestinians shared responsibility for the genocide , and justify the creation of a “ Jewish state ” on the territory of their homeland .
This motive became a constant in the propaganda of the state of Israel .
It explains the extraordinary importance accorded to the mufti in the Holocaust memorial museum , in Jerusalem .
Tom Segev observes that the wall dedicated to al - Husseini gives the impression of a convergence between the Nazis ’ genocide plans and Arab hostility towards Israel .
Peter Novick points out that the entry on the mufti in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust , published in association with Yad Vashem ( the Holocaust remembrance authority ) , is much longer than those on Himmler , Goebbels or Eichmann , and only a little shorter than that on Hitler ( 7 ) .
Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 there have been many publications claiming that Jews in Palestine in 1948 faced the threat of genocide .
They suggest that the Arabs were ( and still are ) moved by the same hatred of Jews as the Nazis , meaning that the expulsion of the Palestinians when the state of Israel was created – and their continued subjugation by Israel – should be regarded as legitimate acts of self - defence .
Two books , by Klaus - Michael Mallman and Martin Cüppers ( 8 ) , and by Jeffrey Herf ( 9 ) , appear to be serious works as they are based on studies of Nazi , American and British archives , but the authors know very little about the Arab world and do not speak Arabic .
An excellent collection of critiques of Mallman and Cüppers ’ work appears in the Auschwitz Foundation ’s review Témoigner : Entre Histoire et Mémoire ( Bearing Witness : Between History and Memory ) , in which Dominique Trimbur observes that their book is part of “ a historic trend marked by the spirit of the time in which it was written – the early 2000s .
The whole argument lacks subtlety , especially when the authors refer to ‘ the Arabs ’ and ‘ the Muslim world ’ , generalisations typified by the reproduction , or deliberate appropriation of the expression ‘ clash of civilisations ’ . ”
In response , two contradictory trends have emerged on the Arab side : one is the comparison of Israel ’s actions to Nazism , the other is Holocaust denial .
Sign of exasperation
That many Arabs can hold these contradictory positions is a clear indication that they are trying to compensate for an inability to respond effectively to real violence by resorting to symbolic violence .
Iran is attempting to use this tide of reactive and emotional denial in vying with Saudi Arabia for the affections of Sunni Arab Muslims .
In reality , those in the Arab world who seriously support the arguments of western Holocaust denial – “ the anti-Zionism of fools ” , to paraphrase August Bebel ’s famous remark that anti-semitism was “ the socialism of fools ” – are a tiny minority .
In most cases , denialist attitudes stem from exasperation .
This much is suggested by opinion polls among Palestinians in Israel , the Arab population best informed about the Holocaust , a subject thoroughly covered by the school syllabus in Israel ( 10 ) .
A first poll conducted by the University of Haifa in 2006 found , to general surprise , that 28 % of all Arabs in Israel denied the Holocaust , the percentage being higher among the best educated ( 11 ) .
Two years later , against escalating violence , the same poll found a denial rate of 40 % ( 12 ) .
The current situation makes dialogue and communication seem more impossible than ever .
Yet anyone familiar with the irreconcilable differences that separated Israelis and Arabs in the decades leading up to 1948 and 1967 , will realise that many more Arabs and Palestinians today are able to contemplate peaceful coexistence with their Israeli neighbours , and far more Israelis acknowledge that their country is guilty of persecuting the Palestinians .
We must hope that the region will avoid a new catastrophe – the common meaning of shoah and nakba .
Have you ever fumbled around on Craigslist looking for a studio to record your demo ?
Pored over coffee shop bulletin boards looking for a rehearsal space ?
Resigned yourself to a summer of honing your skills in an overpriced basement with a broken PA and no AC ?
OpenStudio , a new web site from Music Nomad , would like to solve those problems .
The site lists available recording studios and rehearsal spaces by location , providing information on hourly rates , size and gear details for each location .
It ’s set up pretty much like a real estate listing site , with a thumbnail for each space , and more details and pictures once you click .
While not the first site to offer this service , OpenStudio ’s streamlined , incredibly easy to navigate interface is easily the most user - friendly ( click here for an idea of the sub- par competition ) .
It ’s worth pointing out that certain locations are currently under - served ( searches for zip codes in Akron , Milwaukee , and even big cities like Chicago and Miami yielded no results ) .
But OpenStudio is new , and the only way to get these areas represented is to list some spaces !
Get on the site and do so !
It ’s currently free to list , so studio owners have nothing to lose and everything to gain .
The Facebook page that encouraged users to post images of Islam 's Prophet Mohammed was taken down globally on Friday , following an order by a Pakistani court for ISPs in that country to block the social networking site .
Facebook officials tell the Associated Press they played no role in the removal of the " Everybody Draw Mohammed Day " page , which drew more than 106,000 followers , according to this Google cache .
The page ignited the fury of many Muslims because Islam considers depictions of the prophet to be blasphemy .
The page had declared Thursday as the day to draw Mohammed to protest against threats radical Muslim groups had made against the creators of US cable TV show South Park for depicting the prophet in a bear suit .
In the same episode Jesus was shown watching porn and Buddha snorting cocaine .
The Facebook page prompted the complete censorship of the social networking site in Pakistan , hurting many small businesses that use the site for marketing purposes , the AP said .
The blockade was ordered to extend through May 31 . ®
An Event Apart is a conference for web developers and designers that happens a few times a year in various cities .
A Feed Apart is a site that aggregates tweets during each conference and displays them in a live stream so attendees can follow them during the conference , and people not attending can see what the attendees are talking about .
A Feed Apart was originally written by Nick Sergeant and Pete Karl of Lion Burger during one of the conferences .
Since then a lot of people have used it and love it .
The current A Feed Apart site is not without its problems .
It was written in a single night so it 's not perfect .
During the last conference it went down several times and lost some tweets along the way .
I work at Dumbwaiter Design with Nick and one day he mentioned that it would be cool if we rewrote A Feed Apart from the ground up .
He 's learned a lot about how people use the site and what the big problems are , so we'd have a better idea of what we need to accomplish .
Nick , myself and Ali Ali have risen to the challenge and started rewriting A Feed Apart .
Ali is a designer and is taking care of the design of the new site .
Nick is handling all the frontend HTML , CSS and Javascript .
My job is the backend .
Ali posted a blog entry about the design of the new version so I figured I 'd write about the backend to show how I 'm trying to improve it .
If you have any advice I 'd love to hear it — the next An Event Apart conference is about three weeks away so there 's still time to add improvements .
You can't hope to improve on a site unless you know how people are going to use it .
AFA has been around for a while and Nick has learned a lot about what people want to get out of it .
There are three main kinds of users of AFA :
People attending the conference
People that wish they were attending the conference
The speakers / organizers of the conference
People that attend AEA are web developers and designers .
They 're up - to - date on the latest technology and almost all of them use Twitter .
During the conference you 'll see a sea of laptops in the audience .
Attendees will tweet about whatever is happening right now .
There 's a huge amount of conversation that happens between attendees that AFA is trying to collect and present .
A simple example is one that Nick mentioned to me : if a presenter mentions a website during her presentation someone will tweet the URL so other people can have a link to easily click on .
Attendees will also tweet their agreement or disagreement with what the presenter is saying as they 're speaking .
The most important aspect of AFA for this group of people is the real time conversation .
If AFA does n't show tweets until a minute after they 've been posted it 's useless to these people .
Another important part of AFA for attendees is that it's a one - stop - shop for the conversation behind AEA .
Switching between windows / tabs / applications to read and contribute is annoying .
The next group of users is those that can't attend the conference for a variety of reasons but are still interested in what 's going on .
For this group the real time nature of AFA is unimportant .
They 're probably not going to be following the conversation 24/ 7 so if a tweet takes a few minutes to display it 's not a big deal .
What these people do care about is the integrity of the stream .
They do n't want to miss any part of the conversation .
If AFA loses tweets they 're better off doing a simple search on Twitter because they 'll get the whole story .
The last main group of users is the speakers and organizers of AEA .
Any speaker worth their salt will want to know what people are said about their presentation .
Obviously they can't be reading AFA while they 're presenting , but afterword they 'll certainly want to go back and see what people were saying during their specific presentation .
Likewise , organizers want to know which presentations people liked and which ones people did n't enjoy .
This could easily influence who they choose to invite to future conferences .
For this group the most important aspect of AFA is the organization of the conversation into chunks , each of which applies to a single presentation .
By reading through each chunk of conversation they can get an idea of the general response to each presentation .
Once we identified the main users of AFA we were able to come up with the goals for the new version of the site :
Stay sane while developing .
Ali , Nick and myself are rewriting the site as a side project , so we do n't want it to take too much of our time or cause too much stress .
Provide the real time conversation .
The site needs to be fast and responsive , so people at the conferences can use it to converse .
Do n't miss anything .
People following along from home should n't feel like they 're missing anything .
We want to provide a complete version of the conversation happening behind the event .
Organize the conversation .
Presenters and speakers need a way to see what people are saying about them .
They want to know what people think about each " chunk " of the event .
Grease the wheels of ( physical ) social interaction .
This is something that AFA has n't tried to address before , but that we'd like to work on with this version .
There are a lot of people at each conference and we'd like to help them get together .
Whether it 's going out for dinner or meeting up at the Media Temple party we want to get people talking to each other .
I wo n't talk about this goal in this post because we 're still figuring out the best way to do it .
If the three of us tried to create the site with nothing more than a couple of laptops and a few chats in person we'd go crazy .
We use a few tools to help us manage the development of the site .
To create wireframes of the design we 're using a free account at Hot Gloo .
Hot Gloo is a great tool that lets us quickly sketch out ideas and comment on them .
To share design comps we 're using Dropbox .
It 's simple to set up a shared Dropbox folder and Nick and I can get real time updates when Ali makes changes to the design .
To work together on the code Nick and I use Mercurial repositories .
Mercurial lets us work on the same code bases simultaneously and we almost never have to worry about merging .
We use Codebase for hosting and issue tracking .
The previous version of AFA was n't truly real time .
When you went to the site your browser would ask AFA for the newest updates every 10 seconds .
There are two main problems with this approach .
The first is that it 's not really real time .
I 've noticed this being an issue in my own experience .
When I watch any of the various " live streams " of Apple press conferences I 'm usually at work where other people are also watching .
We very rarely load the pages of the streaming sites like Gizmodo at the exact same second , so our browsers will be out of sync with each other .
Nick might get an update that I would have to wait 8 more seconds to see .
When I glance over at his screen and see an update that I do n't have I instinctively refresh the page to get it .
This defeats the purpose of the " live updating " code that the developers of these sites worked on .
They may as well have just made a static page and told me to refresh .
The second problem is that querying every 10 seconds can be taxing on the site 's database .
We 're doing this as a side project so we do n't have unlimited funding for a hefty database server .
If 1,000 people are querying for updates every 10 seconds that 's 100 requests per second to the database .
This means we need to have some kind of in - memory cacheing if we want the site to feel snappy on modest hardware .
We want the new AFA to be truly real time .
To do this we need to use long polling by users ' browsers to wait for updates and return them as soon as they come in .
We also need to retrieve the updates as fast as we possibly can , and they need to be stored in memory to avoid hitting the database constantly .
The bulk of the conversation about AEA conferences comes from Twitter .
Tweets are the most important items that we need to display on the site , so we 're using Twitter 's streaming API to pull them in .
Since we do n't want to tie up an entire server to pull in tweets I 've decided to create a Diesel - based application called The Nozzletron to parse the streaming API .
Diesel is a Python framework that takes an elegant approach to asynchronous communication with clients and servers .
Twitter 's streaming API accepts HTTP requests and returns " chunked " responses , each of which is a tweet .
Unfortunately the Diesel 's built - in HTTP client does n't handle chunked HTTP responses so I had to write some code to handle them myself .
The Nozzletron will connect to Twitter 's streaming API and wait for data to come in .
If there 's no data to process it will relinquish the server 's processor so it can do other things .
Processing a single tweet that comes in does n't take much time , so the server is free to do other things most of the time .
I 've also created another application called The Flickrtron to pull in Flickr photos .
Unfortunately Flickr does n't have a streaming API like Twitter so I have to resort to polling Flickr 's API every few minutes for new photos .
Flickr is much less of a real time medium than Twitter though , so I do n't think this is a very big problem .
I 'm using a Python library called Beej 's Flickr API to talk to Flickr .
It is horrible .
It calls itself an " API " but is really just a thin wrapper around calls to the Flickr API .
The objects it returns for API calls are Elementtree objects representing the XML of the response .
I wish I could do something like :
thumb_url = photo.thumbnail_url
Instead I have to use this monstrosity :
thumb_url = " http://farm%s.static.flickr.com/%s/%s_%s_s.jpg " % ( photo.get ( ' farm ' ) , photo.get ( ' server ' ) , photo.get ( ' id ' ) , photo.get ( ' secret ' ) , )
I wish there were a better Python Flickr API out there but there does n't seem to be one .
If I 've missed it please let me know !
We need a fast way to store and retrieve updates so AFA can provide a real time view of the conversation happening at AEA .
With this in mind I 've chosen Redis to store the updates of the currently - happening event .
Redis is an easy - to - set - up , disgustingly - fast , in - memory data store .
It 's similar to memcached but has more intelligent data structures that make my life easier for this project .
As updates ( tweets and flickr photos ) are scraped by The Nozzletron and The Flickrtron they 're placed at the tail end of a Redis list .
That means I can quickly and easily get all the items since item N when a user 's browser requests them with a single LRANGE {list - key} N - 1 call .
I 'm also keeping a few other pieces of information in Redis .
For example , there 's a set of photo IDs held in the {item - key} : flickrtron : grabbed_photos key that keeps track of all of the photos we 've already seen .
This makes it easy to tell if we 've already seen a photo ( and therefore do n't need to query Flickr for more information ) — it 's a simple SISMEMBER {item - key} : flickrtron : grabbed_photos { photo - id} call .
I 'm also using Redis to store statistics about the site like :
How many tweets we 've scraped .
How many photos we 've scraped .
How many people are currently waiting for updates .
This kind of information will be extremely valuable in the future when we 're planning improvements to the site .
Redis makes it fast and safe to update this information using the INCRBY and DECR commands .
There 's one more component to The Nozzletron and The Flickrton that I have n't mentioned .
Both use Redis ' PUBLISH command to push new updates out to users ' browsers as they arrive .
I 'll talk more about that in the next section .
As I mentioned before we want to send updates to users as soon as they 're received .
To do this I 've created another Diesel - based application called Halley to handle this Comet - style communication .
Halley has a few components .
The first uses Diesel 's Redis API to subscribe to a Redis channel like live : {event - id} : items and fire off messages whenever something new comes in .
As soon as a new update comes in from The Nozzletron or The Flickrtron all of Halley 's clients will get it .
When I started working on AFA Diesel 's Redis client did n't support the very new PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE commands .
I implemented them , put my changes on BitBucket , sent a pull request , and started talking to the Diesel crew on IRC .
One of the maintainers pulled my patches and made them even better .
Now Diesel 's Redis client has full PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE support .
It 's a great example of how open source projects can produce awesome results .
The other main component of Halley is an HTTP server that listens for connections from browsers .
The Javascript on the site will call Halley and say " I need updates since number X " , where X is the length of the Redis list of updates at the last time it spoke to the server .
Halley uses Diesel's HTTP
Server to manage these requests .
If a client is asking for everything since X and X is a smaller number than the current number of items it will return the updates that have happened since then .
This might happen if we return an update and then two more updates happen before the browser gets around to sending another request .
If a client is asking for everything since X and X is equal to the current number of items Halley will wait for a new message to be fired from the Loop that 's watching the Redis channel .
While Halley waits she relinquishes the processor to the server so other requests can be handled .
There 's a bit of code to prevent DoS attacks that request every item in the queue over and over again , of course .
The live stream is an important component of AFA , but it 's not the only one .
We also need to organize updates into logical chunks by event and presentation , and provide archives of old events so people can see what happened .
The main AFA site is built with Django and served with Gunicorn and Nginx .
It uses a Postgresql database to store data that 's not " live " .
Because queries for live data are handled with Diesel and Redis we do n't need to send those request through the full Django / Postgresql stack .
Django and Postgresql are only involved when you load a fresh page , and they 're more than capable of handling the amount of traffic that AFA gets for those kind of requests .
I 've created an application called The Strainer to copy data from the live stream to the Postgresql database .
The Strainer looks at the list of live items in Redis , parses those items into Django models and saves them to the Postgresql database .
Using two different types of stores ( Redis and Postgresql ) means we can get the best of both worlds for AFA :
We can keep the live data that 's accessed constantly in an in - memory Redis datastore which makes it blazingly fast .
We can keep the less - frequently - used data in an on - disk Postgresql database which lets us to keep our memory usage low and hosting costs down .
Django 's models and managers make it very easy to separate updates out into the various sessions and presentations that happen at the conferences .
Sessions and presentations are much less in - demand than the live stream so we can take advantage of Django 's abstractions without worrying about the extra memory / CPU usage we incur by doing so .
Another problem AFA has faced in the past is losing tweets .
No code is perfect ( and mine certainly is not ) so we need to anticipate that some of the applications we 're using will crash at some point .
I 'm using Supervisord to monitor the various processes of AFA on the server .
If a process crashes for some reason it will be restarted automatically .
Supervisord also has a wonderful Python API , so I 've created a simple Dashboard view in the Django site that lets us stop / start / restart each individual process with a simple web interface .
The dashboard also shows us the current memory usage of the server and some other statistics so we can monitor how things are working through a web browser ( instead of SSH'ing into the server , which is a pain on a phone ) .
An Event Apart is a large event , but it 's not a huge event .
Despite this I 've been trying to build the backend in a way that can be easily scaled .
Right now it 's hosted on a single server , but each of the individual components could be moved to a separate server with less than an hour of work each :
Redis
Postgresql
Django , Nginx and Gunicorn
The Nozzletron
The Flickrtron
The Strainer
Halley
Moving Django / Gunicorn , Nginx , Redis , Halley , and Postgresql to dedicated servers would increase the performance of the site immensely .
I can't imagine an event that would provide enough traffic to require more than that .
Even if there were an event that needed that kind of throughput , we could easily split the single Halley and Redis servers into multiple load - balanced servers .
This new version of A Feed Apart is still being built .
I 'm learning new things every time I work on it , and I 'm sure there 's still room for improvement .
If you have any questions , advice , or want me to go more in - depth about a specific aspect of the site 's backend please let me know !
Thanks to Owen for the heads up .
From all of us who made the show , we really hope that you do n’t feel it was a waste of your time .
We hope that you spent the entire night not just thinking about the finale on a story level , but that you were emotionally affected by it .
There are two feelings that you feel when you watch the ending of a television show .
The first is the feeling that you have of just understanding that the show is over and the second is what your response is to actually what ’s happening on the screen .
What I liked about the Soprano ’s finale was that it changed the experience because when Chase cut to black , suddenly that feeling of “ the show ’s over ” was replaced by “ is my cable out ? ” – he kind of changed the conversation about it .
For us , we tried to write the last two and a half hours of the show so that those two feelings would feel like they were the same thing .
So , you ’re feeling of saying goodbye to the show – of the show not being around anymore – was actually literally perfectly paralleling what we were showing you on the screen .
If you had an experience anything like that , then it was mission accomplished .
If you did n’t , we blew it and I apologize .

The second free downloadable Doctor Who Adventure Game will be Blood of the Cybermen , which takes place in an abandoned Arctic research station .
That certainly explains the mini-skirt .

After the first episode in the series , City of the Daleks , garnered more than half a million download requests in the first 12 days of release , the BBC and developer Sumo Digital are eager to see how well episode two will do .
In Blood of the Cybermen , the 11th Doctor and Amy stumble upon an abandoned research station in the Arctic that harbors a terrible secret .
That secret might be Cybermen .
Wait ...

Yes , definitely Cybermen .
" Blood of the Cybermen is classic ' Who , " says Phil Ford , Writer , Blood of the Cybermen , Doctor Who Waters of Mars and The Sarah Jane Adventures .
" From the intriguing title , through the pre-credits intro to the mystery surrounding the Arctic base , this is everything you expect from a TV episode - only this time you control the action .
It 's an epic story , and one we could only tell in a computer game .
We 've ambitious sets , a thrill - a- minute narrative , and we re-introduce a Doctor Who adversary not seen since the Tom Baker era . "
I 'm guessing he means Cybermats , the little metallic bugs the Cybermen made out of babies .
Blood of the Cybermen will be available for free download on British PCs on June 26 , after the finale of the 11th Doctor 's first season .
A Mac version will follow soon after , and then they 'll tell the rest of the world when they can pay for it .

I 've still not played the first game , and probably wo n't until it 's made free to those of us in the colonies .
SAN JOSE , Calif . -- Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock could have been outraged by the officiating and frustrated by the bad break that cost his team the game Sunday .
But he used neither as an excuse after his team 's 4 - 3 loss to the San Jose Sharks in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals at HP Pavilion .
The Sharks scored twice in the third period to win and lead the series 2 - 0 heading into Games 3 and 4 at Joe Louis Arena on Tuesday and Thursday .
Red - hot Joe Pavelski scored his second power - play goal of the game during a five - on - three advantage to tie it at 4:40 .
Joe Thornton then capped an odd - man rush to score the game winner at 12:37 after Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom had broken his stick .
San Jose had 10 power plays to Detroit ’s four .
The Red Wings spent much of the third period short - handed after being penalized five times .
But Babcock did not criticize the officiating , which would have resulted in a fine by the NHL .
Instead , he said his players must be more disciplined .
“ Any way you look at it , I do n’t know who you ’re going to beat short - handed 10 times , ” Babcock said .
“ I do n’t know if we were first or second as far as least - penalized team in the league during the regular season .
Obviously , these last two games we got to look after our sticks . ”
There was nothing Lidstrom could do about his stick after it snapped inside the Sharks blue line , resulting in a three - on - one break for the Sharks .
Thornton capped it with his first goal of the playoffs , tapping in the rebound of a shot by Dany Heatley that bounced off Detroit goaltender Jimmy Howard and defenseman Brian Rafalski .
“ It was one of those things , ” Lidstrom said .
“ Puck ’s coming off the boards , I went to one - time it and my stick just broke in half and they were going the other way .
You ca n’t do anything about it . ”
Said Howard , who faced 45 shots : “ Just bad luck , but that ’s the name of the game in the playoffs .
You make your breaks . ”
SHARKS 4 , RED WINGS 3 Key play : After Nicklas Lidstrom had broken his stick at the San Jose blue line , Joe Thornton capped a three - on - one rush by scoring his first goal of the playoffs with 7:23 remaining in the third period , snapping a 3 - 3 tie .
Hero : Joe Pavelski has been a goal - scoring machine in the playoffs .
He has two power - play goals in each of the first two games of this series and a playoff - leading nine goals overall .
Goat : Todd Bertuzzi had no points , no shots on goal and a minus - 1 rating in 13:48 .
He also took a holding penalty , though it was quite questionable , that started the barrage to the penalty box in the third period .
Analysis :
While some of the 10 penalties the Red Wings took were questionable , others were deserved .
They must be more disciplined and keep their sticks on the ice .
They ’re being penalized much more in the playoffs ( 13.9 minutes per game ) compared to the regular season ( 8.8 ) .
Babcock conceded it was bad luck , but added , “ The way I look at it is you do good things over a long period of time and luck goes your way .
It ’s unfortunate .
You know what , at playoff time when things go your way , you do n’t think it ’s good luck , you just think you ’re playing well . ”
The Red Wings received a bench minor for too many men on the ice with 1:06 remaining , dashing their comeback hopes .
This is the first time the Red Wings have trailed 2 - 0 in a series since the opening round against Anaheim in 2003 .
The Ducks went on to sweep that series .
Pavelski again was the star for San Jose .
He has scored a pair of power - play goals in each of the two games in the series and leads all playoff scorers with nine goals , five on the power play .
Pavel Datsyuk , Tomas Holmstrom ( power play ) and Lidstrom scored for Detroit .
The trouble for the Red Wings started when Todd Bertuzzi was called for holding Marc - Edouard Vlasic behind the Sharks net .
Niklas Kronwall then was penalized for hooking Pavelski , resulting in a five - on - three .
Pavelski knocked in the puck from the crease during a scramble .
“ They started really well , ” Babcock said .
“ We weathered the storm and got playing good , and then I do n’t know how many minutes were short - handed in the third .
It got them right back in the game .
And for the ( second ) time in the series , we get scored on with only three guys on the ice .
You ’re not going to win like that . ”
Said Red Wings forward Henrik Zetterberg : “ It ’s tough to be two men down that long .
If you kill it off , you can get some momentum on your side .
But if they score , especially if you still have a minute left on the power play , it ’s tough . ”
Lidstrom ’s goal snapped a 2 - 2 tie at the two - minute mark of the second period .
It came while Holmstrom was screening Evgeni Nabokov and right when a penalty to Patrick Marleau expired .
Marleau , who led San Jose with 44 goals during the regular season , returned after missing the previous game because of the flu .
The Red Wings scored three times on their first nine shots .
Despite getting outshot 15 - 7 in the first period and spending most of it in their own zone , the Red Wings were fortunate to come out of it tied 2 - 2 .
Holmstrom tied it at 2 - 2 at 13:17 .
Parked in front of Nabokov , he tipped in a shot from the point by Rafalski , which first deflected off Johan Franzen .
Datsyuk opened the scoring at 6:51 , snapping a shot over Nabokov ’s left shoulder .
The Sharks answered by scoring twice in a span of 1:31 on goals by Pavelski and Ryane Clowe to take a 2 - 1 lead .
The Red Wings regained momentum , but penalty problems took that away in the third period .
And now , they are faced with an uphill battle .
“ The big thing is we got to make it a series .
Right now , it is n’t , ” Babcock said .
“ No. 1 priority for sure is staying out of the box .
No. 2 , we got to do a way better job in the faceoff circle ( San Jose won 43 - of - 69 draws ) .
They have the puck way too much off faceoffs . ”

Debating War Should Germany Stay in Afghanistan ?
The government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made it clear that it continues to support the country 's involvement in the war in Afghanistan .
But a majority of the population disagrees .
SPIEGEL writers Ralf Neukirch and Barbara Supp wrangle about whether Germany should stay in Afghanistan or withdraw completely .
First published on Alternet
Welcome to Gilded Age 2.0 , a time when government has become an appendage to the super - rich , used by industrialists , financiers and corporate robber barons to monopolize the economy and strip regular citizens of power and money .
One example of just how much corporate cash and oligarchical interests have corrupted America ’ democratic institutions comes out of California , where a giant corporation is spending tens of millions of dollars to push through a law that would snuff out competition and enshrine its corporate monopoly in California ’s State Constitution .
It sounds outrageous , but it is perfectly legal here in the Golden State , where a form of “ direct democracy ” introduced 100 years ago allows voters to write laws straight into the state constitution .
All that is required is a ballot initiative and a two - thirds majority vote by the people .
Ironically , direct democracy was introduced to the state by the Progressive Party as a direct response to the runaway corruption of the Gilded Age , a way to shift power away from corporate and moneyed interests that dominated the legislature and to give it back to the people .
Hiram Johnson , California ’s progressive governor from 1911 to 1917 , said that it would “ restore absolute sovereignty to the people ” by allowing voters to trump elected politicians .
It ’s true , direct democracy gave California ’s citizens a way to bypass their representative government , but it also gave a way for the rich and corporate to write their wishes directly into the highest law of the land — all they ’d have to do is convince , cajole or dupe the people into voting their way .
And that is exactly what executives at Pacific Gas & Electric , a giant energy monopoly in California , decided to do .
Over the past nine months , they ’ve spent massive amounts of cash on political strategists , lobbyists , professional signature gatherers , astroturfers and political ad campaigns in the hopes of scaring and duping California residents into voting “ yes ” on Proposition 16 in the upcoming June 8 primary election .
Convincing voters to vote against their own interests has n’t been easy , or cheap — especially when just about every newspaper in the state has come out with an editorial line attacking the amendment , which has been dubbed “ PG&E Monopoly - Protecting Ballot Initiative ” by some and a “ tapeworm ” by others .
The Sacramento Bee said that the amendment would “ insulate PG&E from competition , permanently locking its business advantage into the state constitution . ”
Mercury News called it “ an outrageous measure …its sole purpose is to protect PG&E profits . ”
The Los Angeles Times waxed poetic , describing Prop 16 as “ dagger aimed directly at a movement to enable municipalities to offer renewable green power to their residents in competition with private utilities . ”
According to San Francisco - based utility watchdog , TURN , Proposition 16 would “ sabotage existing law allowing communities to choose alternatives to PG&E ” by mandating a two - thirds supermajority vote from residents in order for a municipality to form a public utility company or for an existing public utility to expand its services to new customers .
To push it through , PG&E ’s political team has been waging a dirty political campaign that would make Karl Rove proud .
As this article goes to print , records filed with the California Secretary of State show that the company had spent a whopping $ 25 million on the amendment .
PG&E execs indicated that they are willing to spend up to $ 35 million .
The utility has been using that cash to set up fake grassroots organizations to engage the Golden State in an aggressive , no -holds - barred disinformation war , airing misleading TV ads , launching aggressive direct - marketing campaigns and pestering people with telemarketing blitzes that warn of apocalypse if Prop 16 is not passed — doing all of it with their customers ’ money .
“ Never … have I seen political activity by a regulated utility so far outside the bounds of acceptable conduct , ” said John Geesman , former executive director of the California Energy Commission , according to the San Francisco Bay Guardian .
“ It ought to be illegal to take ratepayer dollars and use it against ratepayer interests . ”
True , it should be illegal for private companies to shaft customers with customer money , but it is nothing new for PG&E .
For starters , PG&E was one of the prime backers of the catastrophic law that deregulated California ’s energy sector , which led to rampant fraud , manipulation and speculation in the electricity market by energy - trading companies like Enron , causing artificial electricity shortages , massive black - outs , 20 - fold increases in electricity rates and , ultimately , to PG&E ’s own bankruptcy .
“ California ’s three big utilities lobbied intensely to pass the 1996 deregulation bill …
The California utilities believed that they would thrive from electric utility deregulation and become international energy companies , ” according to a 2001 Public Citizen report on California ’s energy deregulation .
“ However , now that they have been beat at their own game by bigger and meaner companies like Enron , and [ sic ] they are crawling back to the legislature and begging for another consumer bailout . ”
Instead of letting the deregulated market do its magic and let a more competitive company step in , PG&E lobbied California ’s pliable legislators for a 40 % rate increase and two rounds of bailouts that came to a total of $ 16 billion , courtesy of PG&E customers .
In fact , the utility ’s 5 million ratepayers are still paying for the company ’s mistakes through mandatory fees .
By the time PG&E ’s bankruptcy - related debts are paid off in 2012 , ratepayers will each have dished out around $ 1,500 to keep it from collapsing .
But wait , there ’s more .
Not only does PG&E enjoy a government - sanctioned monopoly throughout most of Northern California , but , on top of all the bailouts , California legislators have guaranteed the company 11 % profit margins .
It ’s the kind of risk - free free market that corporate dreams are made of , allowing PG&E to squeeze $ 1.22 billion in pure profit from its ratepayer - suckers in 2009 .
Best of all , PG&E did n’t have to divert any of that cash towards paying down its debts — that ’s what the customers are there for , remember ?
To show its gratitude , PG&E constantly jacks up electricity rates , skimps on service and generally makes its customers pay the highest electricity rates in the state .
According to the Fresno Bee , PG&E charges double the average electricity rates of most public utilities and one - third more than its private counterparts in Southern California .
That kind of price gouging translates to some very attractive executive compensation packages .
In 2009 , Peter Darbee , PG&E ’s CEO , received a compensation package of $ 9.4 million ( earning a bit less than Goldman Sachs Group Chairman Lloyd Blankfein , who took in a total of $ 9.8 million in 2009 ) .
Darbee ’s pay was up nearly 9 % from the previous year , despite a 10 % drop in PG&E ’s profitability , according to the Associated Press .
Since 2000 , Darbee received a total of $ 48,560,044 in salary , stock options , pension benefits and bonuses , according to utility watchdog TURN .
But nothing lasts forever , and recently PG&E ’s robber baron execs have begun to fear that their gravy train might be coming an end .
It seems PG&E customers have started to finally wake up to the fact that they are being fleeced , and have started a slow - burning revolt that seeks to replace PG&E ’s corporate monopoly with local public utilities .
To escape PG&E clutches , municipalities up and down California have been eyeing a 2002 law known as “ community choice aggregation , ” or CAA , which allows California cities and counties to become energy wholesalers who purchase power on behalf of their residents .
The formation of CCAs poses a direct threat to PG&E ’s monopoly by giving ratepayers greater bargaining power and allowing local governments to buy power from any energy producer — independent wind and solar energy companies , for instance — while using PG&E just for its power lines .
In effect , it allows Californians to tap into and directly benefit from their state ’s energy deregulation .
“ CCAs hold the potential for a substantial improvement in the energy market and increased efficiency , ” determined a 2005 study of community choice aggregation by the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California , Berkeley .
Naturally , this had PG&E freaking out .
After all , its business model is built on monopolistic price gouging , not competition .
Paul Hauser , an official from a municipal utility in Redding , a rural region in California ’s far north , offered a glimpse into the kind of money PG&E stands to lose from a grassroots public utility revolution when he testified at a legislative hearing on Proposition 16 in February 2010 .
According to Hauser , customers served by his utility would pay an extra $ 440 per year if they had to be served by PG&E .
Now imagine the panic - stricken mental calculations that would shoot through a PG&E exec ’s brain : $ 440 multiplied by 5 million ratepayers comes out to an annual loss of $ 2 billion in revenue , completely wiping out company ’s profits .
Just losing its monopoly in San Francisco , PG&E ’s home city , could mean losing $ 140 million in income .
To protect its racket , PG&E has been waging war on uppity municipalities trying to enter the electricity business .
Ever since the CCA law came into effect in 2002 , the utility has been racing up and down the state , squashing local ballot measures that would enact CCAs with scare tactics and expensive disinformation campaigns .
In 2006 , PG&E spent more than $ 13 million to defeat an attempt by Yolo County to join the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ( which charges customers about a third of what PG&E does ) .
Two years later , PG&E spent $ 10 million to squash San Francisco ’s attempt to form a CCA that would allow the city to purchase a higher percentage of its electricity from green energy sources , something that PG&E could not provide .
It was asymmetrical political warfare , with PG&E outspending the opposition in San Francisco 160 to 1 .
The company ’ most recent attempt to thwart the formation of a CCA was in Marin County , north of Golden Gate bridge going from San Francisco .
PG&E launched a last - minute disinformation campaign , hoping to turn the population against the local CCA a few months before it was scheduled to become law in March 2009 .
Residents were barraged by inflammatory mailers with “ frightening - looking graphics , ” and pestered with phone calls from a supposedly independent group called “ ommon Sense Coalition ” telling customers to oppose the formation of a CAA , and fliers that predicted doom and gloom .
Residents were shocked and turned off by the aggressiveness of the campaign .
PG&E even threatened to stop supplying power to Marin if the CCA went into effect , and attempted to bribe cities with energy efficiency funds to opt out of the county ’s CCA .
“ They ’re phone - banking , they ’ve got call centers is Iowa and Palm Springs calling saying , ‘ Do you know that your electricity is about to be switched [ off ] with no warning ? ' ” a Marin resident told ABC News in April .
Marin ’s CCA went into effect in March 2010 as planned , while PG&E ’s strong - arm tactics resulted in an official rebuke from California ’s Public Utilities Commission , which passed a resolution forbidding PG&E from refusing to supply electricity to CCAs .
But even while they were waging a losing war in Marin , PG&E ’s brass had already switched strategies .
With an upwards of 40 municipalities planning to break free of PG&E ’s monopoly by forming CCAs , the utility decided to stop wasting money on local fights , figuring that it would be cheaper and more effective to take all the uppity municipalities all at once .
And that ’s where the constitutional amendment comes in .
PG&E CEO Darbee described his team ’s eureka moment when they realized that the company could save a lot of money and effort by focusing its resources on pushing through a constitutional amendment to restrict public utilities , including CCAs , at a shareholders ’ meeting in March 2010 :
[ R ] ather than year after year different communities coming in as this or that …and us having to spend millions and millions of shareholder dollars to defend it repeatedly , we thought that [ a constitutional amendment ] was a way that we could sort of diminish that level unless there was a very strong , you know , mandate from voters that this was what they wanted to do .
…
So it was really a decision about could we greatly diminish this kind of activity for all going forward rather than spending $ 10 to $ 15 million a year of your money to invest in this .
The answer was yes !
Obviously , the amendment would be a hard thing to sell on its merits to California voters , as it would effectively force them to continue to pay double the rates that non-PG&E customers are charged for electricity .
So , during the shareholders meeting , Darbee was very explicit about how they were going to dupe Californians into voting for it .
Does this pudgy dumbshit PG&E CEO look like he deserves $ 10 million a year of your money ?
“ [ It ] occurred to us that people are n’t very pleased with the job that government is doing these days in general , you know … in the context of what everything that is happening with government today — the dysfunctionality of it — we concluded that it was a very ideal time ! ” he said .
There you have it .
PG&E was going to use the good ol ’ Republican “ slippery slope to socialism ” scare and spin the amendment as a way to stop and prevent government takeover of utilities .
Darbee was fully aware of the flak PG&E would get for trying to steamroll the amendment through , but he did not seem concerned .
“ [ T ] here ’s going to be some flap , ” he said .
“ And then , presumably , you know , we ’ll mend any broken fences after that . ”
Time is indeed the best healer and , with our short memories , it ’s quick , too .
PG&E ’s first order of business was to set up a shell organization to initiate and sponsor the constitutional amendment .
Calling itself “ Californians to Protect Our Right to Vote ” ( or “ Yes on 16 , ” for short ) , the group pretended to be a grassroots coalition that represented the interests of every Californian — taxpayers , labor , environmentalists and businesses alike .
In reality , its sole function was to mask the fact that PG&E is the sole backer of Proposition 16 .
“ In tough times , we should decide how our money is spent .
That ’s why we need Prop. 16 , ” says the Yes on 16 web site , painting Proposition 16 as a voter empowerment thing against big , bad government .
“ It requires voter approval before local governments can spend public money or incur public debt to get into the electricity business . ”
What Yes on 16 does not mention is that every single cent of the $ 25 - plus million that had gone in and out of its coffers came directly from a corporation that would directly benefit from the amendment .
You can see the grassroot creds of Yes on 16 by looking at one of their spokespeople : Greg Larsen , a public relations man from Sacramento .
Corporate flacks are obviously in high demand these days , because when Larsen is n’t shilling for PG&E at $ 25,000 a month ( for a total of $ 250,000 ) , he clocks in at his second job : shilling for the payday loansharking industry .
Here ’s him being quoted by Southern California ’s Press - Enterprise on April 15 , 2010 , while still a paid spokesman for Yes on 16 :
“ The real impact of the proposed bill will be decreased consumer choice : unemployment check recipients will lose this option for short term credit in the marketplace , ” said Greg Larsen , a spokesman with the California Financial Service Providers Association in Sacramento .
“ Payday loans are for such small amounts of money for such short periods of time , a 36 percent rate would not allow lenders to even cover their transaction costs . ”
He said the industry does n’t “ see how eliminating financial choices in the marketplace benefits consumers . ”
Before that , Larsen defended an agribusiness outfit that poisoned people with their fecal spinach salad mixes , and also worked as a spokesman for a shady gambling industry group bizarrely named “ A Fair Share for California , a Coalition of Law Enforcement , Educators and Labor , Supported by Horse Racing and Card Clubs . ”
Despite PG&E ’s hyperactive propaganda campaign , opposition to Proposition 16 has been monolithic , which is highly unusual for a schizophrenic , multiple - personality - disorder state like California .
Just about every politically active entity in the state has lined up against the amendment .
Even the crooks over at the California Association of Realtors broke rank with the Chamber of Commerce and came out against Prop 16 , which goes to show just how bad it really is .
In December 2009 , nine state senators sent a letter to Darbee , calling PG&E ’s support of Prop 16 “ misguided as a matter of public policy ” and potentially illegal .
While in March , six publicly owned utilities , as well as the city and county of San Francisco , filed suit against Yes on 16 , hoping to disqualify Proposition 16 from the June ballot .
The lawsuit claimed that the language of the proposition was “ false and misleading ” :
Faced with growing competition from local government entities providing better electricity service at better rates , Pacific Gas and Electric Company ( “ PG&E ” ) hit upon a cynical strategy to protect itself from competition : promote a constitutional initiative to require a two - thirds majority vote whenever local government seeks to provide service in an area under PG&E ’s control .
Since PG&E could not obtain the signatures to qualify such an initiative for the ballot or persuade voters to adopt it if its true purpose and effect were revealed , PG&E crafted the language of the initiative and the petition used to qualify it to appear to be an initiative to require a two - thirds vote for a local government to tax , borrow , or spend on electricity service systems .
Although the suit did not succeed in kicking Prop 16 off the ballot , it did succeed getting the ballot initiative a less deceptive title , changing it from “ Californians to Protect Our Right to Vote ” to “ New Two - Thirds Requirement for Local Public Electricity Providers Act . ”
But even a broad - based opposition to Proposition 16 does not guarantee victory for California voters , not with the kind of moneyed game PG&E has brought to the court .
This is where democracy has brought us : the power of beneficial public agencies have been downsized , while destructive corporate power expanded .
It ’s been happening across America for years , and Proposition 16 would be just another step in the same direction .
Because , if successful , the amendment would n’t just block competition from the public sector .
It would turn the tables on the regulatory process and allow a corporation to impose regulations on municipalities , rather than the other way around .
It is n’t deregulation , but regulation in reverse : corporations directly subjugating government through law .

Norman Rockwell ’s Legacy
Norman Rockwell ‘s Legacy was more than his just being a great painter and illustrator .
He actually was responsible for making available to everyone in an easy - to - understand and even enjoyable way the memories of a simpler and more hopeful life that does n’t seem to exist today .
Recently I connected with Scotty Ingram who had been a child model for the master .
He remembers those day fondly and we agreed on so many points .
When we look at a Norman Rockwell painting , we realize that this was our country and it was good .
If we had it then , we could have it again — an environment where children are safe ; a nourishing family life ; adults working together to build a community that is beneficial to all .
( View some of these paintings here . )
In fact , there is even a word that has been coined , “ Rockwellian , ” to describe the utopia of Rockwell ’s paintings .
No one would deny that there were indeed a lot of horrible things going on in Rockwell ’s life time : two world wars , Nazism , racism in this country , etc .
He painted some of his stories to alert people that they might join together for change .
If we put our attention on the bad , we end up feeling sour and not wanting to move or do anything .
In fact , that ’s why Rockwell ’s art was so appreciated .
He gave us hope that there is still some human goodness left , even in the face of monumental suppression .
In today ’s world , the suppression seems more covert : we are hypnotized by TV and we are deluged daily by bad news in the media from all over the world .
( The many good things achieved every day are mentioned only in small print or in the back of the publication . )
I think we are withdrawing more and more into our shells .
( How many people even know their neighbors in today ’s world ? )
When you look at Rockwell ’s pictures , you get that great feeling that he intended .
Even from years ago , it reaches you now — you smile , you feel better , you get energy , you want to do something good , make someone else feel good , make your community better .
If everyone in the world would get these feelings , can you imagine the impact it could have ?
Till next time … the Rockwell Portrait Artist paints on !

A tiny software startup in Israel is trying to make your PC less frustrating .
I got a sneak peek at Soluto last month , before its official unveiling yesterday , and I 've had a few days to play with their software in advance of this first look .
The idea behind Soluto is to use the experience of thousands ( or , ultimately , millions ) of PC users to approximate the knowledge that a Windows expert gathers by trial and error .
The software — currently in beta and free for the download — runs as a background service that watches your PC as it works , detecting slowdowns and trying to analyze the cause .
By comparing those events and possible causes against a database of apps , drivers , and other software ( cleverly called the PC Genome ) , the software can suggest solutions that you can implement with a click or two .
The company 's long - term goals are ambitious , but it 's starting with the simple , manageable task of speeding up overly long boot times .
When I installed Soluto on a couple of test PCs running Windows 7 , I got to see this process in action .
It analyzed the boot process and then divided the software involved in each step of the startup process into three groups , as shown here ( click to see the full - size image in its own window ) :
For each software component in the top two lists , it offered the option to pause the automatic startup process or delay it .
Choose the former option and you 'll experience a faster start but pay a ( presumably slight ) performance penalty later , when you start the program manually .
You can also delay the auto - startup , giving you a more responsive system and queuing up the autostart tasks to run later , when the PC is under less stress and you are less likely to be frustrated by the extra background work being performed .
It 's a thoroughly conservative process , with recommendations but no automatic optimizations .
After the process was complete , Soluto told me I had shaved my total boot time on the virtual PC shown here by nearly 30 % , from 2:55 to 2:07 .
On a two - year - old physical PC running Windows 7 Professional , I saw an even more dramatic improvement of 37 % , from 1:55 to 1:13 .
A helpful message tells you exactly how much time you 've saved .
Of course , all those times are a little misleading .
Windows 7 already does a decent job of delaying and prioritizing some startup tasks so that the system feels responsive well before it officially completes all boot - related tasks .
On that virtual PC with the nearly - three - minute boot , I was able to be productive less than a minute after startup — launching programs , using a web browser , and checking e-mail while the system did many of its startup tasks in the background .
Still , performance felt snappier and some tasks were more responsive after Soluto had completed its work .
I would expect more noticeable performance improvements on Windows XP , which uses a less sophisticated startup process .
The real innovation that Soluto is bringing to the table is in its PC Genome knowledgebase , which still sports an " Under Construction " sign .
Eventually , it will consist of a database of applications derived from the Soluto agent installed on users '
PCs .
According to Roee Adler , Chief Product Officer , the plan is for " a team of analysts to wake up each morning to a list of prioritized applications that need to be mapped , " so that they can make intelligent recommendations for which ones can safely be removed or delayed .
The PC Genome project will also include a user - editable wiki , with a reputation - based system for moderating and editing user comments .
Soluto 's software is lightweight and unobtrusive , although , ironically , it notes that it delays startup by a few seconds .
On the two systems where I 've installed it , I 've seen no untoward side - effects , and its recommendations have been reasonable and conservative .
This is a very clever solution to a genuinely frustrating problem .
Time will tell if this startup can build the critical mass they need to be a success .
If you try the software out , I 'm interested in hearing your experiences .
Update 25 - May 10 AM Pacific :
Ah , the woes of being a cloud - based startup .
Soluto 's servers are being hammered right now , which means that the cloud - based service is not responding properly and is returning a misleading error message .
The company says they 're working hard to resolve the issues .
Scientists have discovered a fungus in Thailand that takes over ant brains , compelling them to mindlessly do the fungus 's bidding .
We 've heard about parasitic ant zombification before , but scientists have no idea how the fungus controls the ants so effectively .
Advertisement
The carpenter ants in question build hives in trees and forage on the forest floors .
When they are taken over by the zombification fungus , however , they stick exclusively to the ground .
A study reported in the American Naturalist says that this is because the fungus knows it will prosper closest to the ground , so it compels the ants to stay out of the trees .
Advertisement
That 's the heart of what is happening here : the fungus somehow forces the ant to do exactly what it wants .
The ant first acts as a personal transportation service , conveying the fungus to exactly where it wants to be ( the leafy forest floor ) , and then the ant dies and becomes an abundant food source for the fungus .
The fungus even forces the ant to clamp its mandibles onto a desirable leaf habitat , where it stays locked until its death .
Imagine if this happened on a human scale : the fungus would compel you to walk out into a forest , grab tightly onto a tree , and slowly die curled up on the forest floor , probably driving you mad as it ate your brain from the inside .
Now if that had been the plot of The Happening , we probably would have been more interested ...

The Right and the Tea Party like to think of themselves as freedom fighters in the mold of the Founding Fathers , but a closer look reveals that their revolution is really devolution , because at its core , conservatism is about returning to the past .
Upon examination it turns out the Tea Party has more in common with King George , than the Founding Fathers .
Conservatism is the most common attitude in the history of mankind .
Conservatism is the desire to maintain the status quo – both with regards to the customs and the institutions of the past .
The reason is simple : most people are not comfortable with new ideas or their application .
Advertisements
Conservatism is not about change but about stasis ( from Greek σ τά σι ς “ a standing still ” ) .
As the Encyclopedia of Philosophy ( 1967 ) has it , “ Conservatism is …the preference for what has grown up over a long period of time in contrast to what has been made by deliberate human contrivance . ” ( 2:195 ) .
The United States of America is undeniably the result of “ deliberate human contrivance . ”
Lord Hugh Cecil wrote in 1912 ( Conservatism 25 ) that “ Before the Reformation it is impossible to distinguish conservatism in politics , not because there was none , but because there was nothing else . ”
Since that time there have been those who are for change and those who oppose it .
While the conservative attitude has always been with us the name “ conservatism ” itself only developed in London and Paris around 1830 ( 2:195 ) and by 1835 was in use by British Tories .
“ Conservatism most precisely denotes a hostility to radical social change , particularly social change that is instituted by the force of the state and justified by an appeal to abstract rights or to some Utopian aim . ” ( Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2:195 )
The ideas of the Founding Fathers can reasonably be characterized as Utopian and seen as justified by an appeal to abstract rights .
The Declaration of Independence can be seen as the high point of the European Enlightenment , enshrining as it does the liberal principles of the time .
And these were liberal principles .
Not conservative .
They were liberal then and they are liberal now .
The idea put forward by modern conservative “ thinkers ” that the opposite is true is without foundation .
Revolution cannot come about from a conservative mindset ; it can only come about as a result of liberal thinking .
Any conservative revolutionary movement will be a counter - revolutionary movement , designed to restore the status quo in the wake of drastic change .
Liberalism on the other hand stresses change .
The very original ideas of the Enlightenment turned the world upside down .
Humans are rational animals it was now said , and they could prosper without the old demands , promises and threats of religion .
Happiness became paramount : “ We hold these Truths to be self - evident , that all Men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ”
Life .
Liberty .
Happiness .
Not heaven .
Not salvation .
And faith was now a faith in science , faith in humanity and in progress , in reason and in education .
At the heart of the Enlightenment lay the ideal of social justice , as enshrined in the above quote from the Declaration of Independence .
“ In the revolutionary situation there was general support for the polemics of Jefferson , Paine , Joel Barlow and others who argued that “ natural rights ” ( life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ) constitute the foundations of social justice .
Governments are artificial contracts designed to protect these inalienable rights . ” ( Encyclopedia of Philosophy 1:84 )
Our American government was based not on conservative biblical principles but on those of the Enlightenment , on a trust not in God but in humankind .
It was optimism that fueled America ’s experiment in liberty and democracy ; it is fear of the mob and its demand for change that fueled , as it has always fueled , conservatism .
It has been claimed , of course , that the revolution was not a revolution at all , but a “ war of independence ” but that claim is belied by a simple appeal to the literature of the time .
Rip Van
Winkle did n’t wake up shocked because the world had stayed the same , because the status quo had been maintained .
He was shocked by change , by the results of liberalism .
In the Washington Irving story , Rip Van Winkle falls asleep before the French Revolution and sleeps for over twenty years .
An entire generation has passed :
“ The very character of the people seemed changed .
There was a busy , bustling disputatious tone about it , instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquility . ”
There are new terms and ideas : “ rights of citizens – elections – members of Congress – liberty … and other words which were a perfect babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle . ”
As historian Gordon S. Wood observes , “ In a few short decades Americans had experienced a remarkable transformation in their society and culture , and like Rip and his creator , many wondered what had happened and who they really were . ” ( Empire of Liberty 1 )
Yet we see conservatives writers like Thomas E. Woods , author of the “ Politically Incorrect Guide to American History ” ( 2004 ) make claims like this of the colonists : “ They were not revolutionaries seeking the radical restructuring of society . ”
The chain of logic here ( if it can be called that ) is that “ The Americans who protested against British encroachments on colonial liberties wanted to preserve their traditional rights . ” ( Woods 11 ) .
Thomas E. Woods might think so .
Washington Irving ( April 3 , 1783 – November 28 , 1859 ) , who grew up in the wake of all that change Woods insists the colonists did not want , saw things more clearly .
The attempt made by Woods and others like him to relegate “ innovation ” to simply unwanted new taxes is a specious line of reasoning which would make the revolution a conservative reaction to the encroaching evils of liberalism , a complete inversion of historical fact .
Mr. Woods ’ book might indeed be politically incorrect ; it is certainly historically incorrect .
If Woods ’ “ conservative revolution ” would have materialized the king would have stayed and we’d be singing “ God Save the Queen ” rather than the “ Star Spangled Banner . ”
Amusingly , Woods appeals to the Magna Carta ( 1215 ) , the Petition of Right ( 1628 ) and the Bill of Rights ( 1689 ) in defense of his arguments ( and presumably of the colonists ) , but these documents were themselves innovations raised in opposition to the status quo .
In point of fact , taxes are as old as prostitution .
Kings have always imposed taxes .
It was part of the old conservative fabric of society .
The idea that a government would not be able to tax the populace is a liberal one .
Opposition to taxes , not taxes themselves , is the true innovation .
If we follow Woods ’ reasoning to its logical conclusion , he overturns his own thesis .
As should be obvious by now , it is a logical impossibility that the American revolutionaries who gave us the United States were conservatives .
American Tories , or Loyalists , those who supported the king against the revolutionaries , were conservatives .
Their math was simple : change=bad , stasis=good , kill the rebels and restore royal rule – obey the king and keep things as they were .
The American conservative movement today is of a counter - revolutionary nature , a reaction to and against the liberal principles of the Enlightenment , and an attempt to turn the clock back to pre-Reformation days when God , not humankind , was the center and focus of human endeavor , when not natural rights but divine restrictions were the order of the day – a retroactive attempt to turn America into something it was never designed or created to be , indeed , could not have been before the Enlightenment .

All flights in and out of the UK and several other European countries have been suspended as ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland moves south .
There are fears the ash could clog up aircraft engines and cause them to stop .
Eric Moody is a retired pilot for British Airways , who was in the cockpit of a Boeing 747 which flew through volcanic ash over the South Indian Ocean in 1982 .
He recalled the moment all four engines failed to the BBC's Matthew Amroliwala .
Onkalo , on the other hand , is supposed to last 20 times as long as the pyramids have so far — so long that the builders of the site have to take into account the next ice age , when the weight of two miles of ice on top of Finland will be added to the stress on the buried waste containers , copper canisters two inches thick .
It might seem crazy , if not criminal , to obligate 3,000 future generations of humans to take care of our poisonous waste just so that we can continue running our electric toothbrushes .
But it ’s already too late to wave off the nuclear age , and Mr. Madsen ’s film comes at a perfect time to join a worldwide conversation about what to do with its ashes .
On June 3 , administrative law judges from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will begin hearing arguments about whether the Department of Energy can proceed with shutting down development of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada , where the United States had been planning since 1987 to store its own nuclear waste .
If the Obama administration prevails , the United States will be back to square one in figuring out how to get rid of its own 77,000 radioactive tons , including 53 million gallons left over from the dawn of the nuclear age sitting in leaky tanks in the Washington desert near the Columbia River .
There are somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 tons of high - level radioactive waste already in the world , much of it in pools on the sites of nuclear power plants where the rods have to cool for years before they can be put into containers .
Onkalo is being built to do its job without human intervention or maintenance .
Once it is done and sealed back up a hundred years or so from now , the problem is less with keeping all the radioactivity in than keeping people out .
Unfortunately , nothing in history suggests that humans will actually keep out .
Indeed the builders themselves , according to their environmental impact statement , have not ruled out the possibility that future technological development will make it feasible to dig all this stuff back up and reprocess it to create more fuel or weapons material , in which case Onkalo will be like buried treasure
The pyramids , after all , are not an auspicious precedent .
They have been looted and their inhabitants dispersed to the museums of the world by intrepid archaeologists and grave robbers not at all deterred by rumors of the Curse of the Mummy .
When Google Maps 's walking directions instructed Lauren Rosenberg to walk along a very busy highway with no pedestrian walkway , she followed the directions exactly .
Unfortunately , she was hit by a car in the process .
Now she 's suing Google for damages , Search Engine Land reports .
The walking directions from 96 Daly Ave to 1710 Prospector Ave in Park City , Utah told Rosenberg to walk just over one half of a mile along Deer Valley Drive , also known as Highway 224 .
The highway did not have sidewalks or any other pedestrian - friendly amenities , and Rosenberg was struck by a car driven by a man named Patrick Harwood .
Rosenberg filed suit against both Harwood and Google , claiming both carried responsibility in her injury .
Her lawyers claim that Google is liable because it did not warn her that the route would not offer a safe place for a pedestrian to walk .

" There is not and never has been a freeze on construction in Jerusalem , nor will there ever be , " said Yishai , whose approval of a 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 's visit in March sparked tension in U.S. - Israeli ties .
Yishai , who heads the ultra-Orthodox Shas party , told his faction 's newspaper that the issue would not be raised during upcoming visits by senior American officials .
The Interior Minister said that he intended to expedite procedures for planning and construction across Israel , but particularly in Jerusalem .
Residents of the capital were suffering a serious housing crisis , Yishai told the newspaper , forcing many to leave the city .
" We will build everywhere in the capital of the Jewish nation 's everlasting homeland , and I have clarified this to our American counterparts and friends , " said Yishai .
He added that he had instructed the Jerusalem Building and Planning Council to convene after several delayed sessions to discuss renewing construction in the Arab area of Shoafat .
Yishai 's comments came just a day after the U.S. State Department warned both Palestinians and Israelis to avoid taking inflammatory actions in Jerusalem .
" As we have said , if either side takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously undermine trust , we will respond to hold them accountable and ensure that negotiations continue , " said a State Department representative .
The State Department further emphasized the U.S. stance on Jerusalem and expressed faith in the success of the indirect negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel .
" Our policy on Jerusalem remains unchanged .
The status of Jerusalem is an issue that should be resolved in permanent status negotiations between the parties .
This underlines the importance of making progress in the proximity talks to enable the parties to move to direct negotiations that will resolve this and other issues once and for all , " said the U.S. official .

Tensions between the Obama administration and the scientific community over the gulf oil spill are escalating , with prominent oceanographers accusing the government of failing to conduct an adequate scientific analysis of the damage and of allowing BP to obscure the spill ’s true scope .
The scientists assert that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies have been slow to investigate the magnitude of the spill and the damage it is causing in the deep ocean .
They are especially concerned about getting a better handle on problems that may be occurring from large plumes of oil droplets that appear to be spreading beneath the ocean surface .
The scientists point out that in the month since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded , the government has failed to make public a single test result on water from the deep ocean .
And the scientists say the administration has been too reluctant to demand an accurate analysis of how many gallons of oil are flowing into the sea from the gushing oil well .
“ It seems baffling that we do n’t know how much oil is being spilled , ” Sylvia Earle , a famed oceanographer , said Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
“ It seems baffling that we do n’t know where the oil is in the water column . ”
You may want to set aside those How To Destroy Angels remixes for a moment because ( per our buddy Jarrett ) a new song from Trent Reznor ’s other project , um … Nine Inch Nails , just hit the Internets .
As Some Kind of Awesome reports , Reznor contributed the track to director Shinya Tsukamoto ’s Japanese language film “ Tetsuo : The Bullet Man ” to be played over the closing credits .
Despite the fact that the film was completed and showcased at film festivals last year ( making Reznor ’s February ’ 10 contribution likely ineligible for Oscar contention ) , the epic instrumental composition is currently being dubbed as a theme song for the film .

Giving new meaning to the term " server farm , " a team of Hewlett - Packard researchers has come up with a plan for combining cow chips and computer chips to build an environmentally friendly data center -- powered by manure .
In a paper set for release this week , HP scientists have proposed using a " biogas " recovery system that would convert livestock waste into methane , to be used as fuel to generate electricity for data centers -- those cutting - edge computer facilities that serve as the nerve centers for an increasingly Internet - dependent world .
In turn , the system would use the heat produced by the banks of server computers -- sometimes referred to as server farms -- to assist the process of converting the animal waste into fuel .
The result is what Chandrakant Patel , a scientist at HP Labs in Palo Alto , Calif. , calls " a symbiotic relationship between manure and IT . "
Patel , who recalls collecting buffalo droppings for fuel as a boy in rural India , says the ancient practice of burning manure for energy can be updated with new technology , in a process his team has outlined in a paper they 're presenting this week at a conference on energy sustainability , convened in Phoenix by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers .
HP says it has no immediate plans to build a dung - powered data center .
But these days , energy efficiency is an industry Holy Grail .
Modern data centers require vast amounts of electricity , both to power their high - tech components and to run air conditioners that keep the computers from over - heating .
That translates to high energy bills and a big carbon footprint , at a time when corporations face growing pressure to be green .
Some big tech companies , including Google and Microsoft , have built large data centers in the Pacific Northwest , where power from hydroelectric dams is plentiful and less pricey .
But that 's not always an option , and Patel said that ideally a data center should be able to tap multiple energy sources , depending on whether solar , wind or biogas power is available , while using non-renewable power as a back - up .
Patel , an engineer with more than 100 patents to his name , oversees an HP Labs group that works on reducing the environmental impact of the modern tech infrastructure .
After coming up with several advances to reduce the energy demand of large computer systems , Patel said , they began looking at alternative sources of power for data centers .
He 's not the only team member who has first - hand experience with livestock and manure .
One of his co-authors , computer scientist Martin Arlitt , comes from a Canadian ranching family and , according to Patel , " shoveled a lot of the stuff " as a young man .
The average dairy cow produces 20 metric tons of manure per year , according to the researchers , who say they 'd need 10,000 cows to power a 1 - megawatt data center , which they describe as a small to medium - sized facility .
They propose converting the waste into methane gas through a biological process called anaerobic digestion , which is more efficient and less smelly than simply burning the manure .
The methane would then be used as fuel in gas - fired generators to create power .
The science behind their idea is well - established , said Steffen Mueller , principal economist for a U.S. Department of Energy program at the University of Illinois , which advises farmers on using biogas systems to produce their own electricity and heat .
Mueller said he 's never seen a biogas - powered computer facility .
But he added , " there are a lot of potential synergies .
You just have to be willing to locate the data center where the fuel is .
I do n't think you want to ship the manure to Silicon Valley . "
With today 's high - speed networks , Patel says it 's possible to build computer centers near farms in rural areas .
He also sees big potential for using biogas power in developing nations , where electricity is expensive and the existing grid can't support much tech infrastructure .
" This could be an opportunity for emerging economies , " he said , " where the need for IT services will be greater and greater . "

We 'll have to await the official inquiry to find out precisely what went wrong ; early indications are that there were indeed serious lapses , both at the operational and regulatory level .
All the same , it is hard to find an oil industry executive who does n't mutter grimly , " there but for the grace of god go I " .
This was an accident waiting to happen .
The curiosity is that both the oil industry and Americans in general were so unprepared for it .

KINGSTON , ON - A discovery that may pave the way to helping reduce health hazards such as E. coli in water could also make chemicals and drugs such as insulin cheaper to produce and their production more environmentally friendly .
By creating a three - dimensional model , Queen 's University biochemistry professor Zongchao Jia and post - doctoral student Jimin Zheng discovered exactly how the AceK protein acts as a switch in some bacteria to bypass the energy - producing cycle that allows bacteria like E. coli and salmonella to go into a survival mode and adapt to low - nutrient environments , such as water .
The unique feature of this discovery is that the switching on and off take place in the same location of the protein .
Normally these two opposing activities would happen in two different ' active sites ' .
" From a protein function point of view , this is unique and has never been discovered anywhere else , " says Professor Jia .
The discovery opens the door for scientists to identify a molecule that can keep the bypass switch from turning on so bacteria will die in water .
As a result , drinking water would be cleaner and the incident of water bacterial contamination , such as the Walkerton tragedy , could be reduced .
" While other organisms cannot survive without nutrients , the bypass controlled by AceK allows the bacteria to live and cause health problems , " says Professor Jia .
Conversely , discovering a molecule to keep the bypass switch turned on could produce a supply of the bacteria biotechnology companies use to produce compounds , such as insulin .
Instead of using glucose in the fermenting process , companies could use less nutritional and cheaper acetate .
The cost difference would be tremendous and the process would produce less carbon dioxide making the process much more environmentally friendly .
" So we have n't found a cure to stop diseases like E. coli water contamination , but we 've provided a template for people to design a molecule that will disable its ability to survive in water , " says Professor Jia .
" It 's like we have discovered how a lock works and now all we need is to design a key . "

Sarah Hanson - Young has shared some ‘ pleasantries ’ with Australian voters .
In the video ( above ) posted to YouTube this week , the ( sort of ) effusive Greens senator apes similar clips by the likes of US President Barack Obama on Jimmy Kimmel Live , reviewing a selection of so - called ‘ mean tweets ’ and letters directed her way by trolls and haters .
And it would seem likening the senator to a cow is a popular theme .
Here ’s a sample of the ‘ pleasantries ’ :
“ Sarah Hanson - Young .
I could eat a can of alphabet soup and eat more crap than she makes .
Stupid cow ! ” – @BillFromBendigo
“ Let the silly cow , Sarah Hanson - Young , go her hardest .
She would n’t know s*** from clay ! ” – @ TedBullpit1
“ And fix up your eyebrows , COW HEAD ! ” – @njccorp
And our absolute , hands - down favourite :
“ F****** whinging women , cant call a woman love , or a good sort or wink or say hello , or open a door for them or be nice in general !
Well open your own car door , fix your own car , get your own drink , repair your own home , buy a dildo and go f*** yourself ! ! ” – Anonymous letter .
Delightful .
From Tampa to Dublin to Alicante and Dubai empty condos and villas that were never home to anyone , litter the landscape as a sterile reminder of a party that never was .
But perhaps the biggest housing bubble of them all has just been popped – deliberately by the Chinese government who saw that Shanghai and Beijing real estate increases were unsustainable .
Over the last month , Beijing housing prices have fallen at a unbelievable 377 % annualized rate , possibly heralding part III of the Great recession following the US banking collapse and European sovereign debt crisis .
The most dramatic pictures in this collection are of the empty Chinese city of Ordos , which is a piece of government led , speculative development on a scale unimaginable elsewhere .
An entire city waiting to be occupied .
Ordos is not a failure yet , but if it is , it will be emblematic .

Neighbors escaped injury Sunday when a man fired gunshots toward their Avondale home before barricading himself inside his house and taking his own life , police said .
About 12:45 p.m. , police responded to a house in the 500 block of East Hill Drive for reports of a man in his front yard with a shotgun , spokesman Reuben Gonzales said .
The man fired several shots in the direction of a neighboring house , then barricaded himself inside his own house .
There were five people inside the neighboring home but no one was injured , Gonzales said .
Avondale and Goodyear police set up a perimeter and attempted to negotiate with the man but were unable to talk with him , Gonzales said .
After about 4 � hours , police sent in a tactical robot and discovered the man lying on the living room floor .
He was identified as Reynaldo Reyes , 40 .
Officers went in and found him dead from an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound to his torso , Gonzales said .
He was home alone .
May 26 , 2010  --
The U.S. national debt has passed the $ 13 trillion mark , according to USDebtClock.org , an independent website that tracks the real - time growth of U.S. revenues and spending .
On Tuesday , the national debt stood at $ 12,995,779,490,444.52 , according to the Treasury Department 's national debt - tracking website TreasuryDirect.gov .
The Treasury Department did not immediately return a request from ABC News for comment .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , wasted no time in sounding an alarm about the new debt milestone .
In a statement released today , McConnell cited the debt in his criticism of what 's called the tax extenders bill , which would extend unemployment benefits and the amount of time unemployed workers could stay on their group health plan through COBRA , as well as certain tax cuts .
McConnell said the bill would cost $ 130 billion .
" As early as today , we 'll reach a dubious milestone in America : a $ 13 trillion national debt -- the first time in history we 've crossed this frightening threshold .
This extenders bill would add another $ 130 billion on top of that .
... This is fiscal recklessness .
" The true emergency here is our national debt , " he said .
Addison Wiggin , the executive producer of the 2008 documentary I.O.U.S.A. and the editorial director of the website Daily Reckoning , said everything from the government 's regular operations to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the U.S. stimulus package to lackluster tax revenues have contributed to the recent rapid growth of the national debt .
A decade ago , he said , the national debt was $ 5.7 trillion .
By 2005 , it rose to $ 7.7 trillion .
As of six months ago , it stood at $ 12 trillion .
The larger the debt grows , the faster the U.S. government 's interest payments pile up , which helps explain why USDebtClock.org 's national debt tracker jumps hundreds of thousands of dollars in less than a minute .
" As time goes on , it 's such a large figure , you can actually see the interest that we have to pay on it rise if you calculate it down to the second as this site does , " Wiggin said .
Wiggin said that U.S. government 's borrowing grew especially quickly during the height of the financial crisis , because investors wanted to lend money to the United States -- it was seen as a safer place to stash wealth than the stock market or even banks .
The clamor for U.S. Treasury bonds meant that the government could negotiate lower interest rate payments on its debt .
" It 's an odd catch - 22 , " Wiggin said .
" When there 's crisis , people are willing to give money to the government , which allows [ government officials ] to finance extreme deficits , which they 're then using to paper over the crisis . "
Peter Morici , a University of Maryland business professor and a critic of the Obama administration 's approach to the debt , said that the current debt situation can be traced back to President Reagan 's era and can be blamed on the philosophies of both political parties .
" The Republican concept is if you cut taxes , miraculously revenues always appear to cover expenditures , " he said .
" Democrats believe they can spend whatever they want and anything that smacks of ' we 're spending too much , the government is inefficient , ' is some sort of heresy . "
Morici warned that if the debt grows to about 150 percent of the gross domestic product -- the debt is about 90 percent of GDP right now -- the country will risk hyperinflation or " the Chinese buying up Wall Street , " he said , referring to China 's status as the U.S. 's greatest lender .
" Either way , we lose our financial situation in the world , " he said .
But Wiggin believes there 's hope .
In the World War II era , he said , the country faced a national debt that was 125 percent of the GDP .
" After World War II , as a nation , we buckled down and paid off a large portion of the debt , " he said .
" I 'd say there 's always hope because we have done it before . "

DETROIT --
A former Detroit Red Wing who has carried some baggage soon will be a Stanley Cup champion for the first time .
It might be the Chicago Blackhawks ' Marian Hossa , a good guy and tremendous player who flopped in the Stanley Cup finals last year with Detroit .
It might be the Philadelphia Flyers ' Ville Leino , a good guy and promising player who flopped during this past regular season with Detroit .
Both were salary - cap casualties in Detroit , more or less .
Now , they are competing in the Cup finals , which start Saturday .
The Red Wings made a pitch to keep Hossa last summer , but they did n't have the cap room to match Chicago 's 12 - year , $ 62.8 million offer .
And Hossa probably preferred a change of scenery , anyway , following a rough postseason .
The Red Wings wanted to keep Leino , and under different circumstances could have been more patient through his struggles .
But they did n't have a roster spot or the cap space to hide him once their injured players began filtering back into the lineup .
So they traded him Feb. 6 for minor - league defenseman Ole - Kristian Tollefsen and a fifth - round draft pick .
It seemed like no big loss at the time , but nearly four months later , Leino is resembling the late - blooming , highly skilled player the Red Wings thought they were getting when they signed him as an undrafted free agent out of Finland in May 2008 .
He has been strong on the puck , crashing the net , competing in the hard areas of the ice .
He has 12 points ( four goals , eight assists ) in 13 playoff games , gelling with linemates Daniel Briere and Scott Hartnell to help the Flyers reach the Cup finals for the first time since 1997 , when they were swept by the Red Wings .
" I like to play offensive and make plays , so I like going hard and being aggressive on the puck , '' Leino , 26 , told NHL.com .
" You do n't have to sit back and wait for something to happen ( in the Flyers ' system ) .
It 's aggressive hockey and gets you right on top of things . ''
That is what the Red Wings expected from him in Detroit .
But he was too soft , unable to control the puck and frequently getting snuffed out of the play with only the slightest contact .
He was lost on the ice and did n't look like an NHL player .
He has undergone quite a transformation .
" He 's played real well for them , taken full advantage of his opportunity , '' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" He really had an opportunity in November and December , 25 games prior to us trading him .
Unfortunately , he just did n't play nearly as well as we thought and hoped he would .
" When we made the decision , we had severe cap issues .
Other players ( Drew Miller , Patrick Eaves ) worked their way ahead of him on the depth chart .
You try to wait as long as you can .
Ultimately , you can only wait so long . ''
After the trade , Leino looked destined to be a bust in Philadelphia as well .
He was a healthy scratch in 12 of his first 17 games and would have sat out many more if not for Jeff Carter 's injury .
He was scratched for the first four games of the opening - round playoff series against New Jersey .
He made his postseason debut in Game 5 vs. the Devils , once again , only because Carter was hurt .
Now , he is a fixture in the lineup for the Flyers .
Hossa , 31 , is the first player in NHL history to reach the Cup finals three consecutive seasons with three teams .
He appeared to shed his label as a playoff underachiever in 2008 , picking up 12 goals and 26 points for the Pittsburgh Penguins , who lost to the Red Wings in the finals .
But after switching teams , he struggled in last year 's playoffs with Detroit ( six goals , 15 points in 23 games ; no goals , three assists in the finals ) .
Hossa has not been spectacular this postseason , with two goals and nine assists in 16 games , including one point ( an assist ) in his past six games .
But it does n't matter if you 're winning .
This is the Blackhawks ' best chance to end their 49 - year Cup drought because they wo n't be as deep next season .
They have 14 players signed for 2010 - 11 at $ 57.6 million .
The cap is expected to be in the $ 58 million range , and Chicago has several players -- including goaltender Antti Niemi and forwards Andrew Ladd , Adam Burish , John Madden and Ben Eager -- in the final year of their contracts .
Chicago 's time has arrived .
Hossa likely will shed his label as a " Cup curse . ''
The Blackhawks are too deep and too strong for the Flyers .
Gingrich has been trying to straddle the fence with the Tea Party crowd and his good old boys movement , but has found himself on the wrong end of it time and time again .
He sang the praises of Dede Scozzafava which earned him much ridicule from the far right because he supported an establishment conservative .
( Of course , Gingrich promptly turned tail and kissed the feet of Rush Limbaugh , so all was forgiven .
Then he supported Utah 's Robert Bennett , who just got ousted .
Chris Wallace , to his credit , called him out on it on Fox News Sunday and made him look foolish :
Wallace : Your book has drawn strong criticism .
You praised the tea party and when they ousted Utah 's Senator Robert Bennett last week you said this : ' It 's a sign of the anger of the American people . '
But Speaker , just three months ago you endorsed Bennett for reelection .
Gingrich : I did and I think Bennett 's a very nice man , but my comment was n't anti-Bennett .
I think Bennett would agree with me .
He went back home .
I went to Utah for him and what he found was first of all his vote on TARP really signaled people that -- he gave them an explanation for their anger .
Second , Bennett is a very reasonable person .
I think they wanted someone to come in and fight .
Bennett received a lot of support from the GOP establishment like Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney and still he got booted like it was 2006 .
The tea partiers supported Mike Lee , and he did n't get enough votes to win either .
Gingrich may try to hide this fact , but he too supported the Bush bailout of Wall Street , or TARP , and that -- along with the stimulus -- has been the fuel to drive the crazy train of right - wing street - theater merchants .
ABC News ' Teddy Davis Reports : Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich reversed course on Monday , issuing a statement saying that if he were still in office he would " reluctantly and sadly " support the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout bill .
Gingrich , who led the charge against the bailout last week , explained his change in position by saying that the House Republicans , " reinforced by John McCain , " have improved the bill " significantly " so it is " less bad " than the original proposal offered by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Fox News will keep promoting him , but the activist base of the GOP is totally against him .
I doubt he 'll be a serious contender for 2012 now so he 'll probably have to be happy with collecting cash for being a right wing political hit man .
Who will he support next ?
Oh , and how is " Drill , Baby , Drill , " working out for ya ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A big mystery seller of futures contracts during the market meltdown last week was not a hedge fund or a high - frequency trader as many have suspected , but money manager Waddell & Reed Financial Inc , according to a document obtained by Reuters .
The final numbers of the day 's trading is shown on a board on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York May 6 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
Waddell on May 6 sold a large order of e-mini contracts during a 20 - minute span in which U.S. equities markets plunged , briefly wiping out nearly $ 1 trillion in market capital , the internal document from Chicago Mercantile Exchange parent CME Group Inc said .
The e-minis are one of the most liquid futures contracts in the world , providing holders exposure to the benchmark Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index .
The contracts can act as a directional indicator for the underlying stock index .
Regulators and exchange officials quickly focused on Waddell ’s sale of 75,000 e-mini contracts , which the document said “ superficially appeared to be anomalous activity . ”
More than a week after the incident , it was still not clear what impact the unusual trading in the futures contracts had on the broader meltdown in the stock market .
Waddell manages the $ 22.1 billion Ivy Asset Strategy fund , which is well - known for hedging with equity index futures when manager Mike Avery , who is also chief investment officer at the company , feels uneasy about the market .
The Asset Strategy fund has dropped 2.76 percent this quarter , compared with a 0.80 percent decline in the S&P 500 , data from Lipper Inc , a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp show .
Gary Gensler , chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission , said in congressional testimony on Tuesday that it had found one sale that was responsible for about 9 percent of the volume in e-minis during the sell - off in the U.S. markets .
Gensler said there was no suggestion that the trader , whom he did not identify , did anything wrong in only entering orders to sell .
Gensler said data showed that the trades appeared to be part of a bona fide hedging strategy .
WADDELL SAYS WAS HURT TOO
It is unclear what impact the trading in the e-minis had on stock prices during the plunge , but regulators have scrutinized futures trading because the sharp decline in that market preceded the dive in the broader U.S. equities market .
The document said that during the sell - off and subsequent rally , other active traders in e-minis included Jump Trading , Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Interactive Brokers Group Inc , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citadel Group .
During the 20 - minute period , 842,514 contracts in e-minis were traded .
The CME document did not provide a break - out of Waddell ’s trading during that crucial time , but said from 2 p.m. EDT ( 1800 GMT ) to 3 p.m. it traded 75,000 contracts .
Overland Park , Kansas - based Waddell declined to return calls seeking comment .
But in a statement , the company said : “ Like many market participants , Waddell & Reed was affected negatively by the market activity of May 6 . ”
Waddell said in its statement that it often uses futures trading to “ protect fund investors from downside risk , ” and on May 6 it executed several trading strategies including the use of index futures contracts as part of normal operations .
The notional value of the contracts sold by Waddell was $ 4.2 billion , according to document .
How much Waddell paid for the contracts was not stated , but typically the cost would be far less than their notional value .
The company , which advises and distributes the Ivy Funds , has made a name with good results from its family of mutual funds .
Waddell ’s shares fell after the Reuters report , and closed down 5.3 percent at $ 32.25 .
Volume was 1.28 million shares , more than triple the daily average this year .
Analyst Jason Weyeneth of New York brokerage Sterne Agee said he had not learned anything on Friday to lead him to change his “ neutral ” rating on Waddell stock .
The CFTC declined to comment .
A CME spokesman , who declined to comment on the document , said the Chicago - based futures exchange operator never discusses customer activity .
“ We found no evidence of improper trading activity or erroneous trades by CME Globex customers , ” said CME spokesman Allan Schoenberg .
Trading in e-minis takes place entirely on the CME ’s Globex exchange .
Hedge funds and high - speed trading firms often use the e-mini in an arbitrage strategy that seeks to capture the change in prices between the futures contract and the S&P 500 .
Waddell ’s contracts were executed at Barclays Plc’sBarclays Capital and later given up to Morgan Stanley , according to the document .
CME said it spoke to representatives from both banks on May 6 and planned to speak to Waddell representatives the following day .
The firm oversaw $ 74.2 billion in assets as of March 31 .
Morgan Stanley told CME that it did not have concerns regarding Waddell ’s activity because it “ would typically use equity index futures to hedge macro market risk associated with the substantial long exposure of its clients , ” the document said .
‘ QUITE A SHOCK TO THE MARKET ’
Gensler said the contracts were sold between 2:32 p.m. and 2:51 p.m. , the height of the meltdown .
The market for e-minis on May 6 fell more than 5 percent in a little more than 5 minutes starting at 2:40 p.m. -- the height of the crash , the document said .
The e-minis began to recover before stock prices turned higher .
An order the size of the Waddell contract would be a big trade to execute on a normal day , said a trader whose firm is active in the S&P 500 futures market .
About 50,000 contracts are typically traded in an hour , the trader said .
“ To get rid of 75,000 contracts , that ’s a lot of trading even if the market is healthy , ” the trader said .
“ But when suddenly the market changes and there ’s not as many bids there to trade with , 75,000 is going to cause quite a shock to the market .
“ That ’s an enormous position for anybody , whether it ’s a hedge or whether it ’s a trade .
It ’s a big position , no doubt about it , ” the trader said .
Libraries should be doling out books , not scarlet letters .
Nevertheless , a city councilor in Quincy , Mass. , has convinced his fellow board members to consider public shaming as a means to deter patrons from viewing pornography over municipal Internet connections .
While the problem for librarians and library patrons is real and long - running -- if somewhat overblown -- the proposed remedy in this case is wrong - headed .
From a story in The Patriot Ledger :
A resolution , sent to Mayor Thomas Koch , calls for the mayor to forward to the council " a list of the individuals who violated the library 's policy against viewing pornographic material within the past year . "
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
The council unanimously approved the resolution June 21 .
Koch spokesman Christopher Walker said the city 's legal department has to review the request .
The city 's library director seems to possess the cooler head here :
Ann McLaughlin , Quincy 's library director , said library patrons are banned from using computers if they violate the use policy on three occasions .
...
Because there is a three - strikes rule , the library does keep track of who is caught viewing pornography , McLaughlin said .
But she 's not sure if such information should be made public .
" I would say that it's not the kind of information we would be likely to give out , " she said .
" Library records have a different protection under the law .
Access to what people check out from the library is excluded under the law , so if the police come ( looking for that information ) , they need to bring a subpoena . "
And then there are the practical questions :
How would librarians know for certain whether a person was intentionally viewing porn or the victim of spyware ?
It 's no big deal when all that is at stake is a warning from the librarian .
It 's a huge deal when one faces the prospect of public humiliation .
Would there be any due process before the names are made public ?
Who wants that job ?
Would all the names be revealed or just those without enough juice at City Hall or with the library staff to be spared the embarrassment ?
( That 's a rhetorical question because we all know the answer . )
Last question :
So how often does the library staff in Quincy , Mass. , actually have to admonish a patron about staying off the naughty Web sites ?
About " two or three times a year , " according to McLaughlin .
In other words , the city council has better things to do .

Youth Rates Protest , Britomart , Auckland CBD .
August 2007 .
Protesting for the end to youth rates .
Under NZ law if you 're between 16 and 17 you employer is legally entitled to pay you less than an 18 year old .
( begin monologue )
It 's argued that this is because younger workers have less skills , but it 's kind of odd that at on your 18th birthday suddenly you 're worth $ 2 more than the day before , yet you gained no additional skills .
The law has now been changed to state that for the first 200 hours of your employment , you 're to be paid 20 % less than your adult peers .
I still do n't think this is acceptable , does this mean that you only have to do 80 % of the work ?
If a 30 year old enters a new industry with no skills in that industry should they be paid only 80 % of the wage to reflect their lack of skill until they 've been there for 3 months ?
Should n't the same employment rights and protections be given to everyone regardless of age ?

I ’m not a big fan of study - table lamps simply because I can’t stand the surrounding darkness .
Always creeps me out , but I ’m sure most of you students need to invest in one .
Sharing dorm rooms , you ca n’t disturb your mates right !
So when you use one … how much light is sufficient for you ?
How about a lamp that lets you decide the luminance .

Early this year , mobile network operator T - Mobile USA announced it would complete its HSPA + network upgrade by mid-2010 , bringing a theoretical maximum downlink speed of 21 Megabits per second to its entire 3G footprint .
After testing the upgraded network technology in Philadelphia for the last year , T - Mobile today announced that the enhancement has gone live in the " Northeastern U.S , " which includes the New York City metropolitan area , New Jersey and Long Island , upstate New York ( Albany , Buffalo , Rochester and Syracuse , ) Connecticut ( Hartford , New Haven , Milford and Stamford , ) and Providence , R.I. Additionally , the HSPA + network has gone live in Memphis , Tennessee and Las Vegas Nevada .
T- Mobile says its HSPA + network will expand into Boston and Washington , D.C. in the coming weeks .

Only two days ago , one of T - Mobile 's premier Android devices , the HTC Nexus One , was the first consumer smartphone to receive the Android 2.2 " FroYo " update .
The update reportedly boosts the device 's performance as much as 2 to 5 times .
Though only rolled out to a small group initially , the Android team at Google this afternoon said they " expect a final build [ of Android 2.2 ] to be available for OTA updates shortly . "
So with the fastest version of Android yet , and much faster network at its disposal in a large section of the United States , T - Mobile 's Nexus
One has significantly increased in value in just the last week .

These days there are new diseases and super viruses popping up every day in the news , and some studies indicate that many medications have been over - used to the point that they have become ineffective .
Whatever the reasons are for having a weak immune system , there are more than a few solutions to boost your immune system .
Eating healthy can taste good
Studies have shown that the vitamins and minerals you take in boost or inhibit your immune system .
There are a lot of fad diets and supplements on the internet these days that make the claim to aid the immune system , but do your homework .
A diet that has a lot of fruits and vegetables , proper amounts of meat , and is low in sugar should be sufficient for the average person .
Because diet plays such an important role in this I will place a list of foods high on the list of immune system stimulators .
Stress kills , in more ways than one
Stress is a leading cause of heart attack and high blood pressure , but did you know that there are good forms of stress ?
Studies have demonstrated that short term stress , such as speaking publicly , or an argument with your child can build a better immune system reaction in cases of bite or puncture type wounds , creating a fight - or - flight response .
In long term stress the adverse is true , with the immune system being repressed due to the condition being a normal state .
The things that seem small can add up
Keep taking any vitamins you are currently using , this provides the body with the things it needs when you ca n’t find time .
Caffeine dehydrates the body , and robs it of critical minerals .
As I said before , do your research .
There are a lot of supplementals and diet aids that make certain claims .
Your best way to start the investigation is to check the BBB and the online medical websites and journals .
Here is the list of good tasting , immune system bolstering foods .
Vitamin C Packed
Red bell peppers , broccoli , strawberries , tomatoes , sweet potatoes
Minerals count in the equation
Mushrooms , turnip and beet greens , squash , and garbanzo beans .
High in carotenes
Carrots , yams , brussel sprouts , cabbage , garlic , and squash .
This list is by no means complete , but also worth mention is that all citrus are high in antioxidants , as are many types of berries .
Yogurt is also friendly to the digestive tract , providing important probiotics that are necessary for a healthy immune system .
The suggestions laid out here are by no means the “ law of the land . ”
But if a person follows just one of the suggestions in this article , the other suggestions made will come without effort or notice .

Task force allegedly held gun to 14 - year - old boy ’s head
The campaign director for Washington state ’s marijuana legalization effort is unable to account for eight petitions allegedly seized from a medical marijuana dispensary by a drug task force during a raid two weeks ago .
“ WestNET says it only seized two petitions , ” Philip Dawdy told RAWSTORY in a phone interview .
“ What I am told by personnel at North End Club 420 is that ten petitions were seized .
There are as many as eight sheets that are not accounted for at this point .
There is a discrepancy between what WestNET has given back to us and what the dispensary says was seized .
I ca n’t sort that discrepancy out . ”

Sensible Washington is seeking to “ remove state civil and criminal penalties for persons eighteen years or older who cultivate , possess , transport , sell , or use marijuana ” through the initiative process .
In order to get Initiative 1068 onto the November ballot in Washington , they must submit 241,153 valid signatures by July 2 .
Dawdy says his volunteers have collected over 100,000 but plan to triple that total over the next five weeks .
On the morning of May 11 , detectives from the West Sound Narcotics Enforcement Team , a federally - funded , multi-jurisdictional task force showed up at the home of North End Club 420 patient coordinator Christine Casey .
According to published reports , she says they held a gun to the head of her 14 - year - old son and he was handcuffed for two hours .
Adding insult to injury , they also seized $ 80 in cash from her 9 - year old daughter ’s Mickey Mouse purse .
She had already caught the bus to school that morning .
Casey says she had $ 80 because she was rewarded for making straight A’s .
Seattle Weekly reports :
According to court documents filed with the Pierce County Prosecutor ’s Office ( see pdf ) , WestNet found $ 3,000 and 76 pot plants at the home ( about half of which were small seedlings , Casey says ) .
State law allows medical marijuana patients to keep only 15 plants on hand unless they can prove medical need for more .
The task force also found 200 baggies of packaged marijuana at the dispensary itself .
The court documents say the raids followed an undercover operation in which a police operative repeatedly bought marijuana at the dispensary without producing a doctor ’s recommendation , as state law requires before someone can legally use marijuana .
The documents also say that the dispensary was charging double the street value for the pot .
Dawdy says the whole situation could be avoided in the future if voters show support for Sensible Washington in November .
“ Our initiative is designed to legalize marijuana , ” he stated plainly .
“ Then we ’ll let the legislature enact the regulations and whatever taxation scheme they might want to impose .
It ’s up to them to create the regulations . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Dawdy went on to say he ’s bothered that they would seize the petitions in the first place .
“ They get a search warrant that allows them to seize all lists and ledgers , ” he explained .
“ And you know , an initiative does look like a list or a ledger .
But the truth of it is it says on the front of it it ’s an initiative to the people .
There ’s formal language that ’s in like 20 point type addressing it to the secretary of state of our state .
It ’s obviously not evidence of a criminal enterprise . ” ( see .pdf here )
“ The truth of it is , ” he continued , “ when a place gets raided the cops sweep up every piece of paper and put it in a box and sort it out later .
But I ’m still a little bothered that they did n’t use discretion at the scene . ”
A writer for Firedoglake is crying foul over the First Amendment implications of the seizure , seeking support to encourage the task force to put more effort into recovering the missing petitions .
ADVERTISEMENT
Dawdy ’s bigger question is why a partially - federally - funded task force is going after a dispensary in Tacoma , WA that the local police had no problem with .
“ This place has been open for 4 months , ” he said .
“ The local Tacoma police had no problem with the place . ”
“ Both the President and the Attorney General have been very clear that they do not want to use federal resources to enforce federal laws in states with ( their own ) medical marijuana laws .
I ’m not saying these guys are a rogue task force or anything , but you gotta be kidding . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile , Dawdy says he was assured by a member of the WestNET task force that nothing is being done with the photocopies the agency has acknowledged making of the two petitions that were returned this week .
Still , they ’re considered a formal part of the evidence .
“ So I said , well how do we get them destroyed ?
And they said you ’ve gotta get an agreement between the defense attorney and the prosecuting attorney in this case to have them destroyed , ” Dawdy told RAWSTORY .
When he asked if anybody at WestNET would oppose their destruction he was told no , absolutely not .
“ One of the members of the WestNET task force told me that they are very interested in seeing our issue get on the ballot , ” Dawdy continued .
“ They think it ’s an important question that needs to be resolved .
So I told the detective I hope you vote yes on November 2nd . ”
Residents of the village of ‘ Asira al - Qibliya in Nablus District held a joint demonstration with Israeli activists from Combatants for Peace and Rabbis for Human Rights , protesting takeover of their lands by settlers .
During the demonstration , youths from the village went over to a guard tent that settlers had erected near the outpost and took it down .
Following their action , soldiers and armed settlers arrived at the scene .
The soldiers fired tear gas and rubber - coated metal bullets at the demonstrators , and a settler standing near them opened fire from an M - 16 rifle at the demonstrators , who posed no danger as they were running away from the spot .
During the event , an Israeli activist went up to a group of soldiers and demanded that they put a stop to the settlers ’ firing , but the soldiers did not act accordingly .
Later , settlers threw stones and what appear to be firecrackers toward houses in the village , whose inhabitants responded by throwing stones back .
Some note , however , when the future President Barack Obama was asked in February 2007 if he would serve his full six - year term in the Senate ( due to expire in 2010 ) , he responded : " If you get asked enough , sooner or later you get weary and you start looking for new ways of saying things . "
When asked directly if he would run for the White House in 2008 , he said flatly : " I will not . "
Not least among Vasily Grossman ’s great achievements as a Soviet writer was his ability to fashion a true art form out of the procrustean genre of socialist realism .
His technique was as simple as it was subversive .
Rather than employ his characters as monotone metaphors acting in the service of revolutionary fantasy , he made them into variegated people besieged by revolutionary reality .
As the protagonist of Everything Flows , Grossman ’s third novel , puts it : “ The literature that called itself ‘ realist ’ was as convention - ridden as the bucolic romances of the eighteenth century .
The collective farmers , workers , and peasant women of Soviet literature seemed close kin to those elegant , slim villagers and curly - headed shepherdesses in woodland glades , playing on reed pipes and dancing , surrounded by little white lambs with pretty blue ribbons . ”
Grossman let war , persecution and genocide serve as his backdrop but he was most preoccupied with the fate of ordinary human beings caught up in extraordinary circumstances .
Down to the last battlefield commissar , guilt - ridden informant , or NKVD agent , his characters were imbued with a psychological and moral complexity rare for any age , much less a totalitarian one that forced an artistic parade ground upon what Max Eastman once witheringly termed “ writers in uniform . ”
That Grossman survived the twentieth century is no less remarkable than the fact that he became a great Russian novelist in it .
He was born in 1905 in the heavily Jewish town of Berdichev .
Originally trained as a chemist , he became a famous World War II correspondent for Krasnaya Zvezda , whose articles were read aloud for inspiration in the ranks of the Red Army , with whom he returned in 1943 to witness Ukraine ’s “ liberation ” from Nazi occupation as well as the gruesome discoveries of Babi Yar and Treblinka — and Berdichev .
His beloved mother was one of the thirty thousand of Berdichev ’s Jewish population slaughtered in Hitler ’s abattoir in the Caucasus .
It was a devastating personal loss that furnished one of Grossman ’s great leitmotifs of maternal nostalgia .
He also had the distinction , if the term is n’t obscene in this context , of being the first writer in any language to document the death camps .
His article , “ The Hell of Treblinka , ” written in 1944 , was used by the prosecution as testimonial at Nuremberg .
Everything Flows only appeared in the Soviet Union in 1989 after three decades of censorship ; Grossman died of stomach cancer before completing the book , which has just been re-translated into English by Robert Chandler .
A more pessimistic follow - up to Life and Fate , Grossman ’s Tolstoyan masterpiece about World War II , it tells the story of Ivan Grigoryevich , who has just been released from the gulag after serving a thirty year sentence for questioning the legitimacy of dialectical materialism .
His manumission is rooted in a simple historical development — Stalin has died — though the climate of paranoia and mutual incrimination persists .
Grossman is hyper - attuned to every itch and impulse of a society that has just been allowed to breath a little easier but is by no means free .
Consider how well he describes the competing emotions of guilt and defiance in Ivan Grigoryevich ’s cousin Nikolay Andreyevich , who suffers from the Soviet species of survivors ’ guilt .
His particular case has manifold causes .
As a mediocre biologist , his professional fortunes have risen amidst Stalin ’s last act of cruelty before dying — the anti-Semitic purge of the sciences in the wake of the fabricated “ Doctor ’s Plot ” which ended the careers and lives of so many brilliant colleagues — and , unlike the rebellious Ivan Grigoryevich , he has mainly kept his head below the parapet :
Yes , his whole life had passed by in obeisance , in a great act of submission , in fear of hunger , torture , and forced labor in Siberia .
But there had also been a particularly vile fear — the fear of receiving not black caviar but red caviar , mere salmon caviar , in his weekly parcel of food from the Institute .
And this vile ‘ caviar ’ fear had co-opted his adolescent dreams from the time of War Communism ; it had made use of them for its own shameful ends .
What mattered was to have no doubt or hesitations ; what mattered was to give his vote , to sign his name , without a second thought .
Yes , yes , what had nourished his unshakable ideals was two very different fears : fear for his own skin — of being skinned alive — and fear of losing his entitlement to a bit of black caviar .

State of econometrics -- the application of statistical techniques to economic questions .
A few weeks ago , Tim Harford wrote a piece in the Financial Times referencing a piece you wrote back in 1983 called " Let 's Take the ' Con ' Out of Econometrics . "
Harford argued we 've finally succeeded in solving at least one crucial problem -- it did take 27 years -- but we 've finally removed the con ; we 've got more honesty .
Particularly he was focused on the identification problem .
Claimed he was referring to work by Angrist and Pischke , who argued that by use of so - called natural experiments and modern techniques , we 've been able to get a much better assessment of relationships in economic data .
First , talk about your 1983 piece ; what was the con that we ought to be aware of ?
The con is that depending on what model you select , you can get dramatically different estimates and conclusions .
Economists have not spent enough effort alerting their customers to that sensitivity .
That 's the con--pretending that the data sets are providing more information than they possibly can because the econometric method requires you to make a complete commitment to assumptions that you have at best a half - hearted commitment to .
I was arguing what we need to do is develop tools that researchers can use that would separate sturdy from fragile inferences .
Sturdy ones are the ones that do n't depend much on ambiguous assumptions .
The fragile ones change with a very slight change in the model you happen to use .
We need first of all tools that will help us sort the sturdy from the fragile conclusions .
Secondly we need a method of communicating that in the articles we write and a culture that is receptive to that .
The culture as it is now is a " maximize - the - t " - kind of culture , which is a way of saying find something in the data set -- and there are two reasons why there might not be something in the data set .
One is the data set might be too small -- what econometricians call " collinear " -- and the other is that the assumptions that you need are not really credible .
Economists by and large do n't want to hear that kind of negative .
They want to hear that they are making major conclusions from the data sets .
Clarifications :
When you talk about a " t " , the t-statistic in a statistical study is a measure of how likely or unlikely is it that the relationship you found in the data is due to chance .
A high t-statistic would mean it 's very likely that this relationship is there and not just some fluke .
The word statisticians have suggests that it is statistically significant , which we summarize by saying " significant . "
But " significant " really means " important , " and it 's not the same .
Highly recommend that we use the word " measurable . "
We want to know if this data set allow you to measure the effect ; whether the effect is big in an economic sense is a totally different issue .
McCloskey and Ziliak book where they attack the whole concept of modern econometrics on the grounds that we 've become obsessed with the relationship between two variables is significant -- it could be very unimportant ; it could be small in its magnitude and impact but significantly different from 0 , meaning it 's not just a chance .
Key distinction we care about as economists .
We do n't often have a conversation about what size of coefficient do we need for this to be an important effect .
Difficult conversation to have .
Instead we turn it over to statisticians who decide what 's significant or not based on these t values that really do n't have anything to do with the setting and are context - free .
Economists need to impose more order in the conversation and not relinquish the most decision , which is to decide whether or not this is really an important variable or important effect .
5:49 Going back to 1983 article , mentioned being explicit about our assumptions or how sensitive our results are to our assumptions .
When economists talk about their assumptions , they are usually talking about things like " I 'm going to assume that businesses are profit - maximizing , " or " I 'm going to assume that individuals are maximize their utility . "
But in statistical work , econometrics , when you talk about assumptions , you talk about very specific assumptions about where the data come from , the way the errors might be distributed , whether the relationship is linear , quadratic , cubic .
Critical task in the art of drawing inferences from a data set : how to translate a conceptual framework , theory , model , which by its very nature is a simple version of reality , into a compelling and persuasive data analysis .
Your theory might say demand curves slope downward .
That 's not nearly as complete a statement as is needed for a statistician or econometrician to do the data analysis .
The data analysis requires that you select a particular functional form ; allow for the fact that this year 's consumption may depend on last year 's prices as well as today's .
Tomorrow 's as well - - expectations .
Have to think about the other variables that are going to drive the demand and not just the price .
A theorist can get away with making a vague statement that quantity demanded depends on price , but a data analyst has to fill that in to make a very explicit model that has no doubt associated with it .
If there 's any doubt , it 's the random error that we tack onto that model .
The doubt about that is distributional assumptions about which the theorists have no opinion .
Huge step between conceptualization of the problem and building a model that can capture that framework .
8:23 For those listeners who are not practicing or would - be economists or graduate students in economics , etc. , want to set the stage .
In an economics journal , or a medical journal in epidemiology where we are going to look at the relationship , say , between drinking and cancer or in economics between some piece of legislation like the minimum wage and whether it affects employment or not , what you 'll find somewhere in that article if it's an empirical article , is a table or a chart that purports to show that the relationship between the two variables that we care about is of such - and - such a magnitude and is not due to chance .
What is hidden from us as the readers and is the unspoken secret Leamer is referring to in his 1983 article , is that we do n't get to go in the kitchen with the researcher .
We do n't see all the different regressions that were done before the chart was finished .
The chart was presented as objective science .
But those of us who have been in the kitchen -- you do n't just sit down and say you think these are the variables that count and this is the statistical relationship between them , do the analysis and then publish it .
You convince yourself rather easily that you must have had the wrong specification -- you left out a variable or included one you should n't have included .
Or you should have added a squared term to allow for a nonlinear relationship .
Until eventually , you craft , sculpt a piece of work that is a conclusion ; and you publish that .
You show that there is a relationship between A and B , x and y .
Leamer 's point is that if you have n't shown me all the steps in the kitchen , I do n't really know whether what you found is robust .
Kitchen reference , old joke : two things that you do n't want to see in the making -- one is econometric estimates and the other is sausages .
Dirty process .
Why ?
Example : the theory might suggest that a feather in a vacuum will accelerate at a constant rate when it falls .
But economists do n't observe feathers in a vacuum .
They observe feathers when the wind is blowing , when the humidity varies , eagle feathers , duck feathers .
Tons of things that are going to affect the speed at which things fall .
Theorists are allowed to hypothesize that vacuum , but the real world does n't have that vacuum .
Got to translate that into a complete model with all the controls , the kind of things we were just identifying .
You and I can sit down and think of these controls -- you and I will come up with different lists ; tomorrow I 'll come up with a different list from today's .
That 's a sensitivity issue -- we want to make sure that an adequate range of alternative models has been studied and confirmed that all the reasonable models lead to about the same conclusion , which is that you get the sturdy inference .
Or , if what seem like small changes in the models , the kinds of things that economists would be willing to entertain , lead to dramatically different conclusions -- that 's a fragile estimate , not to be believed .
Suggested , alongside this work of art , suggested you should also include some of the souffles that fell , some of the dishes that did n't work out so the reader could judge if there is a real relationship there .
How has the profession reacted to that suggestion ?
Economists will have a table of alternative estimates .
But there 's been no awareness that this is a critical issue .
A lot of work with complex econometrics but not a lot of progress with building tools for identifying sensitivity of our conclusions to our assumptions , or for reporting adequately that sensitivity .
Still in same operating procedure as 30 years ago -- to cook the books .
14:13 Why must be because there is no incentive for us to do otherwise .
Want to come back to that , but staying on track :
What are some of the more recent techniques in econometrics , particularly the use of instrumental variables to create so - called natural experiments , and what the proponents are claiming about those techniques ?
Angrist and Pischke paper well - written , will be out in Journal of Economic Perspectives this month , making what seems like a compelling case that randomization is the solution .
Meaning that in an experimental situation , you have purposeful randomization : try to decide whether fertilizer affects yield , so you randomly select plots that get fertilizers .
Look at treated and non-treated plots -- measure of fertilizer on yields .
Only job in that setting is to determine whether the data set is large enough that you have a statistically significant finding ; or is it too small relative to the size of the effect that it leaves open the possibility that what you are observing is pure randomness and not a real effect .
That 's the traditional view about experiments -- if you do the experimental design adequately with controls and then do the randomization you will get a proper causal conclusion -- to which I totally agree .
We call that science .
The problem with that is you created that in a laboratory .
There is no assurance that it will translate into the same effect in the real world , particularly in economics because we are talking about a social system ; and an expectational aspect also -- makes the transference from laboratory to real world hard .
Those are purposefully randomized experiments -- purposefully designed .
Instrumental variables is a reference to accidental experiments -- scurry around trying to find out something that is as if you had an experiment .
Example : what does immigration do to a community ?
Look at thousands of Cubans when they fled Cuba , Mariel boatlift , and study the impact that has had on the community , which is what David Card has done .
The argument being that since that was an exogenous event -- not correlated with anything else going on in Miami at the time , not like Castro said things are great in Miami so let 's let the people out , which would confound the statistical relationship , or things were horrible in Miami so he let them out .
A random political event that is outside the causal relationship we are trying to study .
Economists think of that as being tantamount to the idea of a randomized experiment .
Problems : First , there 's no such thing as a really exogenous variable .
We do n't know how much Castro was looking over to see what was happening in Miami , so there 's a possibility that that boatlift was responding to something that was happening Miami .
Every one of these is going to open up conversation about whether it is really a randomized treatment or whether it 's correlated with the impact you are trying to determine .
But does a boatlift tell us anything about a 2000 - mile fence ?
Translating that to impact of immigrants in other settings is difficult .
Takes the same kind of work it takes to draw conclusions from non-experimental or observational data -- have to think long and hard about the circumstances that have affected that outcome and put in control variables .
20:04 Previous podcast on macroeconomics -- boatlift immigration issue is micro problem , but in macro we make that leap all the time when we talk about aggregate demand .
When someone says in the past , $ 1 billion had this impact on the economy -- so much unemployment , this level of growth -- people are presuming that the same structural relationships still hold .
Even though the cause of the recession might be totally different , what the money is spent on might be totally different , implicit in those multiplier arguments is the presumption that it does n't matter .
Find that very strange .
Let 's be more explicit .
If you just look at correlation over time , it does n't tell you anything about causal impacts .
So you need something like a randomized experiment .
If you want to know : Does government spending have a multiplier ?
then you have to have a treated group and a control group .
In the case of macro , very difficult to think of what is the natural experiment , whether it 's purposeful or natural , that we can use to make conclusions about the impact of federal stimulus programs .
The one that comes to mind is defense spending -- end of war , start of war .
Robert Barro has used that -- interesting , useful .
Clever .
Angrist and Pischke .
But does apparent defense buildup in WWII tell us anything about the stimulus package that the Obama administration put together ?
Does n't seem to have any relationship , or not be an automatic corollary .
Sympathetic to Barro 's conclusion but have to admit that the scientific nature of it is somewhat problematic .
Did n't stop the people who are not sympathetic from saying it was just totally wrong .
Bizarre that scientific work by macro- or microeconomists on anything that we care about , e.g. , quality of schooling podcast with Ravitch , crucial social policy issues that we all have strong feelings about -- the empirical work , no matter how careful or clever does n't seem to change anybody 's mind who is not already a believer .
That means it 's not science .
In science there is skepticism , too ; takes a while for people to come around .
But it does n't happen at all in economics .
Incentives : the consumers of this work realize that is little incentive to get it right in a scientific sense ; there is an incentive to reconfirm what you already believe .
There is also a belief that there is another side , and the other side could produce some kind of model ; and I 'll wait until I see the whole thing work out before I draw any firm conclusions .
Like a court of law in which you see the plaintiff 's argument but you are not allowed to see the defendant 's ; not going to make a judgment till you see it all worked out .
When you hear only one side , if you are sympathetic to that side you are cheering the whole time the argument is being made : there 's nothing the other side can say ; but they manage to .
Commentary Magazine letters to the Editor would savage the article ; would think the author did n't have a leg to stand on .
Strangely enough , the author would show why his antagonist did n't have a leg to stand on .
Insider or not , sometimes there is no way to choose in any objective sense -- you do n't have any information .
Aggressive language -- economic theory is fiction : sometimes good , insightful , sometimes boring , but fictional representation of the world ; and economic analysis is really journalism .
Journalist 's job is to marshal the facts and put them together persuasively ; but it 's not science .
Fiction and journalism .
The people who swear by these techniques -- Angrist and Pischke as an example -- what would they say to your criticism ?
Angrist and Pischke would be sympathetic ; understand their point , too -- randomization is great if you have it .
Experiments can be highly useful .
Just do n't think any single path will work .
Theories ; studying data sets in different ways ; but to think that designing experiments is going to suddenly change economics into an empirical scientific discipline seems unlikely .
That might be where we have some significant disagreement .
Often the creators of techniques are less enthusiastic than their followers .
Their followers tend to be drinking the kool - aid and have forgotten all the admonishments of the creators about what they should be careful about and watch out for .
Incentives : read in one of your articles -- you make a mention of the fact that the only people who believe the results that come forth are the author .
How could that be ?
Gotten into the habit of asking people if they can name an econometric study that caused the profession to come to a consensus about something controversial .
Most economists struggle to come up with an answer .
Some economists name their own work -- extraordinary .
Is n't it strange that in our field so many people are spending so many hours churning out results that nobody takes seriously ?
Would like to make a distinction between the process and the outcome here .
The process helps us think better as economists .
Analyzing data sets , complex ambiguous settings , helps us think clearly .
Same with economic theory -- carried out mindlessly it's a total waste of time -- but there are people who can do theoretical manipulations , make discoveries , and learn things through that process .
So , even though the final model may be silly and the table of t- statistics may be irrelevant , the process helps us form judgments .
Social conversations we have also help us come to conclusions -- often not the right ones , but some scope for progress .
30:10 Pessimistic note : agree in a world where we sit around in our togas and try to come to agreement on these relationships .
But it does n't quite work that way .
What happens is the more exotic and dramatic your result , the more likely you 'll be featured in the NYTimes .
The university likes that , so there 's a real bias toward shocking claims , contrarian , bizarre claims .
Recent example : the Wall Street Journal had a piece on the front page of its weekend section about two or three weeks ago that when Tiger Woods enters a tournament , instead of encouraging people to try harder , they just give up .
The implication is that our whole understanding of competition has to be reconsidered , because we usually think of competition as bringing out the best in people , people striving to meet the high bar the competitor provides , but with Tiger Woods , he 's so dominant that people just give up .
As a result , competition has this destructive effect .
Lesson : that 's not enough - - we 've got to apply it to business .
The implication is that businesses should n't try to hire the best people , because if you bring in a superstar , people could just sit around and say " I 'll never get a big bonus . "
One of the examples given in the story was at General Electric , only the top 20 % get the big bonuses , so a superstar could discourage people from being in that top 20 % .
Student 's joke -- well , if they have 5 employees , that would be true .
But they have more than five .
Article was based on an unpublished article by researcher at Northwestern who discovered by carefully teasing out and controlling for all the relevant factors , that when Tiger Woods enters a tournament , his opponents score higher by 8/10s of a stroke -- meaning they perform worse .
All this econometric firepower brought to bear .
How many regressions were run where the result was the other way that you did n't tell me ?
Unless I know that , why would I have any confidence in that result ?
Leamer :
Have heard that paper presented ; not as skeptical about the basic finding , but skeptical about the interpretation .
My quality of golfing is much influenced by the people I play with .
Russ :
Told colleague Don Boudreaux about this finding , he said sure it discourages people from golfing - -" I do n't go into golf because Tiger Woods is there . "
There are millions of Americans who have decided to take up other pastimes , tennis , because they do n't think they can beat Tiger Woods .
No doubt true .
Also true that if you are paired with him , or with Larry Bird , famous trash - talker in basketball , it could affect your performance in a negative way .
Might regress toward a lower level .
What is not true is that golfers who are already in the sport did n't give up when Tiger Woods came along .
They worked incredibly harder -- started lifting weights , stopped loafing , put in more hours .
Statistical finding -- remarkably small - - author notes that many tournaments settled by a single stroke ; response : but no tournaments are settled by 8/10s of a stroke .
It 's only an average ; some would be affected by a larger amount .
That 's the not the crucial point .
The crucial issue here is that Tiger Woods does n't enter all tournaments .
That 's the crucial experiment -- the randomization experiment that 's been created .
He tends to enter the harder tournaments .
Jennifer Brown , the economist who studied this , controlled for that .
But that is n't the real comparison .
Harder question : let 's look at golfers who were golfing before Tiger Woods came along , and then after he came along , and let 's see whether on the similar courses before and after whether they took their game up a notch or said they 'll never win .
Her analysis is addressing a different question : within a given year , how do these players play in tournaments that Tiger is in versus ones he is not ?
If I thought I was a competitor with Tiger Woods and I saw him making some of the impossible shots , I could easily be lulled into thinking I could make those same shots and giving it a try , harming my score as a consequence -- that would be one mechanism .
Not making less effort , but trying things I can't do .
Might take more chances ; might decide to play for third , which does pay a lot , so might get more cautious .
Open , by Andre Agassi , similar conversations with himself when he had to play Pete Sampras , dominant player of his era who usually beat Agassi .
That 's not the real question : the author of the article and economist who did the study do n't just want to show about athletes in times of stress -- want to generalize it to general notions about competition .
Tiger impact might be true ; but does it generalize to other settings like corporations ?
Even less than Mariel boatlift study tells us about Mexico and the United States .
Do n't know how to compare the two .
38:55 Macroeconomics : interesting ?
any soul - searching going on in the profession ?
Things we did n't understand about home prices and macroeconomic activity .
Wake - up calls ?
Probably not .
Continue to live in our own cocoons , think of financial policy as somebody else 's problem , does n't affect us .
Huge swing in the profession away from monetarist and rational expectations models in favor of simple Keynesian models , without any basis .
Not everybody has swung that way , but surprising how many in the profession have been endorsing these stimulus packages .
I think I know the answer to how the economy works , too !
In a healthy economy when someone loses their job it does n't precipitate job loss , but when the economy becomes unhealthy , it creates feedback loops , which means that some job loss creates other job loss ; and the government needs to help prevent that negative feedback loop , demand management , but only during those few episodes .
For example now we are in the self - healing phase and the job of the government should be entirely to eliminate the uncertainty .
Problem : Stimulus package extended unemployment insurance , which tangles up looking for work in times of unhealth and the negative feedback loop .
We decided to pay people not to look for work ; made it cheaper to be unemployed .
But , we gave them money -- according to the Keynesian model that kind of makes up for their being unemployed -- it keeps demand going .
Messy system to separate out .
Leamer : Opinion - - it 's all opinion and no data behind it .
Thought Russ was going to say that unemployment insurance was increasing the unemployment rate .
Russ : I think it does .
Believe demand curves slope downward .
Other things going on .
Challenges of predicting accurately .
A lot of people justified those unemployment extensions on the grounds of aggregate demand ; kind of forgot that it would encourage people to not work as hard as they otherwise would .
Not the only reason unemployment is responding slowly to the recovery .
Agree that demand curves slope down ; but long run can be different from the short run .
If you put in place incentives that pay enormous benefits if you are unemployed , you definitely get more unemployment ; but in the context of a cycle people tend to think of themselves as either working or not working , and that self - categorization is not much affected by the benefits they are receiving .
They are out there hoping they are going to get a job .
We need to do some data analysis to find out who is right here .
Eagle feathers , duck feathers , windy day -- with housing collapse , we might expect that unemployed construction workers might be in an unusual situation relative to past downturns that were more general .
About a quarter of the people who are unemployed since the last peak , December 2007 , are in construction .
They are going to have a hard time trying to figure out whether they should stay in construction or not .
A lot of uncertainty and imperfect information .
44:55 Pedagogy , educational question .
Teach a class on how to think about numbers , how to be skeptical about relationships you see ; the way journalists misreport with confidence that is n't justified .
Teach journalists the same principles trying to teach them to be more skeptical .
People take a lot of things on faith .
One response is to say all empirical work is garbage , to dismiss everything .
Confirmation bias , journals generally only publish positive results , etc. Podcast on book Macroeconomic Patterns and Stories ; argue that we need both .
All we have in the area of macro is opinions .
Teach a course called Turning Numbers into Knowledge ; final exam is for the students to read the testimony of the Federal Reserve Chairman to Congress and pick a sentence out of that ; then look at data sets to see whether they can confirm or cast doubt on that opinion .
Process .
Profession is way too heavy toward theory ; macro has completely ignored an enormous data base that could have an impact on how we understand the economy .
People have imposed a particular structure , a straitjacket , on the data which prevents them from learning how this complex economy actually evolves .
What straitjacket ?
You give me your model -- the overlapping generations model , the rational expectations model , the Keynesian model -- all the forecasting models are simple Keynesian models .
Commit yourself .
Example : wrote a paper saying housing is the business cycle .
Housing is absolutely critical ; great leading indicator but also contributes a large fraction of the jobs .
Construction -- large fraction of every one of the downturns we 've had .
Disadvantage in writing a macro paper -- not a macroeconomist .
Advantage in writing a macro paper -- not a macroeconomist .
Came to that question as a student of data .
If you look at the data without the straitjacket , without having a horse in this race , not a Keynesian , Austrian , monetarist , rational expectations guy -- the data shouts , screams that housing has something to do with almost every cyclical downtown of the post - war era .
Skilled and respected data analyst , but not a skilled and respected macroeconomist ; have expertise , reputational credibility -- category might be annoying rather than skilled and with credible reputation .
No macroeconomist say your paper and said this is something kind of important .
Marty Feldstein told Leamer he saw the paper and did n't know that about housing .
Honest man .
Another prominent economist expresses annoyance and said he already knew all that stuff .
Why did n't you write it in that book you wrote ?
" It 's in there somewhere . "
Another not to be named implied he did n't know what you were talking about .
This is what 's there .
You can't say it 's not relevant .
Do they have a different answer ?
You 've done these interviews !
Benign neglect .
Odd given that virtually every macroeconomist in the world would concede that housing had something to do with this downturn .
Interesting question how much of it was due to feedback loops between housing and the financial sector , but nobody denies that housing was a precipitating factor here .
Paper was written in 2007 -- this guy's a real prophet !
Thought police , treat you with disdain .
Marched to my own drummer ; lonely .
In own personal odyssey , find work compelling .
Do n't remember what I might have thought of it in 1985 , but thought you 've got to do something .
But maybe you do n't .
Humility , as a profession .
Not much incentive for economists to think that .
If you want to be in the newspapers , you 've got to be overconfident .
Have issues ?
Been Banned ?
You could try posting here .
You can also , tell us what a great job we have done .
We like that !
While playing around with a few button designs for my latest project , I came up with a simple CSS - only button system that is both lightweight and compatible with nearly all major browsers .
Check it out and let me know what you think !
Download
The zip file below contains the CSS and HTML to create all of the elements in the above example , as well as the image file used .
The HTML
I wanted to keep it dead simple to use , enough so that a single class could be added to any element to create a button .
The HTML I used in the example is as follows :
1 2 3 < a href= ' http://google.com/' class= ' button ' > Google </a > < a href= ' http://bing.com/' class= ' button red ' > Bing </a > < a href= ' http://devgrow.com/' class= ' button large green ' > DevGrow </a>
The CSS
In order to add a subtle gradient effect , I decided to use a single image file .
If you really want , you can leave that out and the buttons should still work fine .
To give you an idea of how it can be customized , I created styles for 7 additional colors and 3 different sizes .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 .button { padding : 5 px 10 px ; display : inline ; background : # 777 url( button.png ) repeat-x bottom ; border : none ; color : # fff ; cursor : pointer ; font - weight : bold ; border - radius : 5 px ; - moz - border - radius : 5 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 5 px ; text - shadow : 1px 1px # 666 ; } .button : hover { background - position : 0 - 48 px ; } .button : active { background - position : 0 top ; position : relative ; top : 1px ; padding : 6 px 10 px 4px ; } .button.red { background - color : #e50000 ; } .button.purple { background - color : # 9400 bf ; } .button.green { background - color : # 58aa00 ; } .button.orange { background - color : # ff9c00 ; } .button.blue { background - color : # 2c6da0 ; } .button. black { background - color : # 333 ; } .button . white { background - color : # fff ; color : # 000 ; text - shadow : 1px 1px # fff ; } .button.small { font - size : 75 % ; padding : 3 px 7px ; } .button.small : hover { background - position : 0 - 50 px ; } .button.small : active { padding : 4px 7px 2px ; background - position : 0 top ; } .button.large { font - size : 125 % ; padding : 7px 12px ; } .button.large : hover { background - position : 0 - 35 px ; } .button.large :active { padding : 8 px 12px 6px ; background - position : 0 top ; }
The CSS is pretty self - explanatory , however an interesting point is that I change the padding in the active state ( .button: active ) while shifting the element up by 1 pixel - this creates a pseudo - 3D effect of physically pushing down on it .
Compatibility and Final Remarks
While the buttons themselves do work on all major browsers ( FF , Safari , Opera , Chrome , IE7 + ) , certain effects may not be available on all browsers .
For instance , IE and Opera will not render rounded corners .
Play with it and let me know what you guys think !
I 'm sure most of you designers already have your own button code - if you 'd like to share it , please post it in the comments ( directly or as a link ) so the other readers can check it out !

Letterhead used by the founder of the Church of Scientology , L. Ron Hubbard .

WASHINGTON — David Axelrod , the top White House political adviser , said Monday that President Obama was amenable to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. ’s call for a new law allowing interrogators to question terrorism suspects for lengthy periods without informing them of their rights .
In an interview on CNN , Mr. Axelrod said Mr. Obama was “ open to looking at ” changing the Miranda rule , which generally bans prosecutors from using as evidence statements made by suspects in custody before they have been warned that they have a right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer .
“ There may be some things that have to be done , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
“ Certainly we ’re willing to talk to Congress about that .
But they would be in the area of adjustments , not a wholesale revision . ”
Mr. Axlerod ’s comments came a day after Mr. Holder called for Congress to enact legislation that would carve out a new exception to the Miranda rule .
It comes from a landmark 1966 Supreme Court decision that is intended to ensure that confessions are not coerced , consistent with the Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination .
While it is virtually certain that the White House knew about and approved of Mr. Holder ’s policy proposal before he made it on Sunday , the remarks by Mr. Axelrod provided a stronger public link between the idea , which has drawn fire from civil libertarian groups , and Mr. Obama himself .
Thanks for the instructable !
A friend and I started this little project this weekend using your design as a starting point .
I liked the idea of detached benches , and your " measure twice , cut the first time , measure again , then make the final cut " way of building things .
I had to tear up a frame from who knows what off a slab in my back yard , and to my surprise found several good treated 2x4's that were perfect for this .
I had enough to make the two benches , but I 'll have to find another weekend to go to the Depot and get lumber for the table .
The first bench took about 2hrs , but the second one was done in less than an hour .
I found it helped to make a template for the legs out of cardboard the night before ... although , the last leg attached was a little short ( measure twice , cut the first time ... ) it was easily fixed with a little shimmy .
I also opted to only use two sets of legs on ea .
bench instead of three ( my benches are 6 ' x 1 ' ) and they feel quite sturdy .
Now I have two sturdy benches for the price of 50 - 75 wood screws !
Thanks !
Just because you live in an urban setting without adequate yard space , or in a cold or inhospitable climate , does n't mean that you can't maintain a delicious selection of fresh fruits and vegetables year round .
By setting up a proper aquaponic growing system , you can almost guarantee a healthy payoff .
The costs and difficulty associated with aquaponics , hydroponics , and other soil - less gardening techniques have plummeted over the past several years , and today , you can set up an entire garden for a small fraction of what it cost in the past .
What Is Aquaponics ?
Aquaponics is a technique for growing plants in a controlled environment using recirculating water in place of soil .
It is similar to a hydroponic growing system — both are soil - less gardening methods that use recirculated water to grow crops .
In hydroponics , nutrients to sustain plant growth are added to the water .
In aquaponics , these nutrients come from animals living in the water .
Fish ( or similar aquatic animals ) live in one portion of the system .
Their waste flows to the plants which use it as fertilizer .
This detoxifies the water so it can be safely re-circulated back to the fish .
If properly maintained , this symbiotic loop can continue almost indefinitely .
Why Choose Aquaponics ?
The basic principle behind the technique is not new by any stretch .
In fact , in its most basic form , it dates back to ancient times and beginnings of human agriculture .
It even has some advantages over traditional farming methods — not only does it allow the grower significantly greater control over the nutrient supplied to the crop , but it also cuts costs as no nutrients lost to ground absorption .
The lack of soil also makes it significantly easier to harvest and control pest infestations .
Early adopters of the technology were forced to spend long hours designing and building custom aquaponic rigs , but now you can purchase many types of high - quality growing products that are more or less ready to go right out of the box .
The best part is , not only does aquaponic gardening make it possible to grow your favorite produce any time of the year , it makes it easier to grow bigger , healthier , and more nutritious foods as well .
How Do You Make An Aquaponic System ?
Of course , when using soil - less gardening techniques such as aquaponics , certain foods are easier to grow than others .
Tomatoes and leafy green vegetables grow especially well in aquaponic systems .
Tilapia , perch , and cod are popular choices for fish .
Crustaceans such as small crabs and crawfish are also well suited for such systems .
While there may be some initial costs involved with building an aquaponic garden , this expense is quickly offset by the food it produces .
Knowing the exact origin of the food you and your family consumes provides peace of mind that 's priceless .

Update , May 29th , 7 PM CST : Update , May 29th , 7 PM CST : Qik have updated their company blog and have cleared up the situation .
Basically , the core Qik experience , meaning streaming from your EVO 4G to Qik , and the 2 - way video chat will be FREE .
Apparently , the subscription charge will be for “ some advanced premium features ” that they are working on .
They ’ll have an announcement on June 4th with additional details on these features .
The fees just keep on coming .
On top of the $ 10 per month “ you own an EVO fee ” and the somewhat more reasonable $ 29.99 per month fee to tether your devices to the EVO , Android Guys are reporting that if you ’re looking forward to the face to face video chat feature on the phone , you should expect to shell out an extra $ 5 a month .
Now , as the title implies , this is n’t 100 % confirmed , and may very well turn out to be fake , but Android Guys did post a picture of what they say are Sprint training manuals detailing the charge .
What ’s interesting is that they say that the charge will reoccur monthly and be billed via PayPal , which lead Android Guys to speculate that the charge is on Qik ’s end rather than Sprints , and we ’re inclined to agree .
Many people , including us , are n’t terribly happy with the $ 10 per month fee , and there are actually websites set up solely to protest the monthly charge .
I doubt we ’ll see the same kind of backlash for this particular fee , mainly because this one seems to be optional , but it would have been nice for Sprint to have advertised this as a premium feature to begin with rather than give the impression that it will be free .

Surviving Apollo 13 astronauts and several flight directors reunited on Monday to remember a failed moon mission 40 years ago this week that they managed to turn into one of the greatest triumphs in the history of space exploration .
Those who gathered included Apollo 13 commander James Lovell , fellow crew member Fred Haise and NASA 's flight director , Gene Kranz - all three of whom were immortalized in the 1995 movie " Apollo 13 , " which starred Tom Hanks as Lovell .
" There 's truly a unique bond .
There is a brotherhood , " Kranz said about how the crisis forged a lifelong bond between everyone involved .
The Adler Planetarium , where the reunion took place , is holding a series of events this month commemorating the Apollo 13 flight .
One exhibit includes a lunar helmet and gloves that Lovell was supposed to wear on the moon had the mission gone as planned .
On April 13 , 1970 , an oxygen tank exploded as the spaceship was four - fifths of the way to the moon .
The crew , which included Jack Swigert , who died in 1982 , was forced to scrap the moon mission and focus solely on getting back to Earth alive .
Lovell 's calm if unsettling words to Mission Control following the explosion that " Houston , we 've had a problem " - now widely recited as , " Houston , we have a problem " - belied his quick internal calculation that their chances of survival were slim .
" But you do n't put that in your mind , " he said Monday .
" You do n't say how slim they are but rather how you can improve the odds . "
In Houston , Kranz led hundreds of flight controllers and engineers in a furious rescue plan .
He insisted on Monday that he never allowed himself to believe that the plan could fail .
Still , he quickly added , " there is some point when you do the best you can and then it's up to a higher authority to steer this mission to its ultimate conclusion . "
The plan involved the crew members moving from the service module , which was hemorrhaging oxygen , into the cramped , frigid lunar lander while they rationed their dwindling oxygen and electricity .
Using the lunar module as a lifeboat , they swung around the moon and aimed for Earth .
In the process of turning what seemed routine into a life - and - death struggle , the entire flight team had created one of NASA 's finest moments , ranking with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin 's walks on the moon .
In 1994 , Lovell and Jeff Kluger wrote " Lost Moon , " the story of the Apollo 13 mission and the basis for the movie .
The movie , Lovell and Kranz concede , helped renew the public 's interest in Apollo 13 at a time when it had started to fade .
Kranz , who was played by actor Ed Harris in the movie , said Hollywood provided a largely accurate account of what happened .
The one thing he took issue with was his character sometimes raising his voice in the control room .
" The fact is , controllers very seldom raise their voices , not in that control room , " he said .
" If you lose your temper , people recognize it and they start ( thinking ) that you are closer to the edge than you really are . "
A circus acrobat accused of spreading HIV to a woman through unprotected sex is being extradited from Sydney to the Gold Coast .
Queensland police have charged Godfrey Zaburoni , 31 , with two charges , including grievous bodily harm , after a woman who tested positive to HIV made a complaint against him .
Health officials say other women in Queensland , New South Wales and Victoria could have been infected .
Acting Queensland Deputy Police Commissioner Col McCallum says Zaburoni , who has been HIV positive since 1997 , has given authorities the names of 12 women with whom he has had sex .
" What we 're urging for is for anybody involved with this person to come forward .
Firstly and primarily we 're concerned about their health and wellbeing , " he said .
" And we ask them to contact Queensland Health .
If they have further concerns , we ask them to contact the police through the CrimeStoppers hotline . "
Zaburoni , a Zimbabwean - born Australian citizen , has appeared as a contestant on Channel Seven program Australia 's Got Talent .
A Sydney court yesterday morning approved his extradition to Queensland and he will appear in the Southport Magistrates Court today .
Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeanette
Young says it is possible more women could have been infected .
" I 'm not confident about the numbers .
I think there 's a number .
Of those 12 , not all of those are in Queensland , " she said .
" Seven of those were in Queensland .
The others were in New South Wales and Victoria , but he 's also been in other states .
" Unfortunately , he was not able to give us sufficient information so we could contact those women directly . "

A tranquillised bear falls out of a tree .
LA city firefighters and animal control officers safely got a 100 - plus pound bear out of the tree on 12031 N Stewarton Drive in Los Angeles .
The bear was shot with a tranquilliser dart and it fell onto a tarpaulin which had been set up under the tree , missing the huge air mattress that had also been set up .
The bear suffered no injuries and it will be taken back up into mountains above Porter Ranch and released back into the wild

A couple of months back , in response to criticism about his multiple characterizations of Tea Party activists as racists , MSNBC oxygen - generator Keith Olbermann issued this agonized open letter to his antagonists :
[ A] sk yourself , when you next go to a Tea Party rally , or watch one on television or listen to a politician or a commentator praise these things or merely treat them as if it was just a coincidence that they are virtually segregated .
Ask yourself :
Where are the black faces ?
Who am I marching with ?
What are we afraid of ?
And if it really is only a President 's policy and not his skin , ask yourself one final question :
Why are you surrounded by the largest crowd you will ever again see in your life that consists of nothing but people who look exactly like you ?
Instead of asking himself , Nathanial Alexander Stuart took a video camera to one of the hundreds of Tax Day rallies April 15 , and asked a handful of black protesters .
This is what Stuart came up with :

The Holy Father needs to directly answer questions , in a credible forum , about his role -- as archbishop of Munich ( 1977 - 82 ) , as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( 1982 -2005 ) , and as pope ( 2005 - present ) -- in the mismanagement of the clergy sex abuse crisis .
We urge this not primarily as journalists seeking a story , but as Catholics who appreciate that extraordinary circumstances require an extraordinary response .
Nothing less than a full , personal and public accounting will begin to address the crisis that is engulfing the worldwide church .
It is that serious .
To date , as revelations about administrative actions resulting in the shifting of clergy abusers from parish to parish emerge throughout Europe , Pope Benedict XVI 's personal response has been limited to a letter to the Irish church .
Such epistles are customary and necessary , but insufficient .
With the further revelations March 26 by The New York Times that memos and meeting minutes exist showing that Benedict had to be at least minimally informed that an abuser priest was coming into the archdiocese of Munich and that he further had been assigned without restrictions to pastoral duties , it becomes even more difficult to reconcile the strong language of the pope in his letter to Irish bishops and his own conduct while head of a major see .
No longer can the Vatican simply issue papal messages -- subject to nearly infinite interpretations and highly nuanced constructions -- that are passively " received " by the faithful .
No longer can secondary Vatican officials , those who serve the pope , issue statements and expect them to be accepted at face value .
We were originally told by Vatican officials , for example , that in the matter of Fr. Peter Hullermann , Munich Archbishop Joseph Ratzinger approved the priest 's transfer to the archdiocese , but had no role in the priest 's return to parish ministry , where he again molested children .
Rather , it was Fr. Gerhard Gruber , archdiocesan vicar general at the time , who , according to a March 12 Vatican statement , has taken " full responsibility " for restoring the priest to ministry .
Gruber , subsequent to his statement , has not made himself available for questions .
We are told , moreover , that the case of Hullermann is the single instance during Ratzinger 's tenure in Munich where a sexually errant priest was relocated to a parish where he could molest again .
If true , this would be a great exception to what , in the two - and - a - half decades NCR has covered clergy abuse in the church , has been an ironclad rule :
Where there is one instance of hierarchical administrative malfeasance , there are more .
Given memos and minutes placing the pope amid the discussions of the matter , we are asked to suspend disbelief even further .
Context of mismanagement
The first reported clergy sex abuse stories , dating back in NCR to 1985 , focused on the misconduct of priests who had been taken to court by parents of molested children -- parents who had gone to church officials , but received no solace .
Instead , what they received from church officials was denial and counter accusation .
Almost from the beginning of the coverage of these trials , it was clear the clergy sex abuse story had two consistent components : the abusing priest and the cover - up by the bishop .

The story grew as more survivors of abuse came forward .
What soon became evident was that this was not primarily a story of wayward priests , but of an uncannily consistent pattern by individual bishops .
In nearly every instance , bishops , faced with accusations of child abuse , denied them , even as they shuffled priests to new parishes , even as they covered up their own actions .
The story was first flushed out in the United States and soon across Canada .
By the year 2000 , sex abuse accusations were turning up across the globe .
In the United States , the scandal flared anew in 2002 when a judge released thousands of pages of documents dealing with the sex abuse scandal in the Boston archdiocese .
Suddenly , ordinary Catholics had access to the patterns involved in the cover - up and to the unfiltered language of memos and legal depositions and letters that outlined how church officials sought to protect perpetrators and marginalize their victims .
All at once , the public outrage was commensurate with the hierarchy 's outrageous behavior .
The story would repeat itself around the country :
Wherever documents were released or legal authorities conducted investigations , the depth of clerical depravity and the extent of hierarchical cover - up were far greater than previously acknowledged by church authorities .
Knowing they had an unprecedented crisis of credibility and facing potential multibillion - dollar liability , the U.S. bishops met in Dallas in June 2002 .
The whole world , represented by more than 800 members of the press , was watching .
There the prelates unveiled what came to be a " Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People . "
It was intended to protect children from molestation , establishing a " one strike and you 're out " policy for offending priests .
It did nothing , however , to hold accountable individual bishops who engineered the cover-up .
By early 2001 , responsibility for managing the church 's response to the ongoing crisis was delegated to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , headed by Cardinal Ratzinger .
The Vatican , by then , viewed the crisis as beyond the boundaries of any one national church .
Crisis crosses borders
In the last decade the story has not gone away .
Rather it has continuously reared its head in nation after nation , especially in those countries with a free press and independent judicial system .
A dominant characteristic of this story is that where and when it has emerged it has done so without the aid of church hierarchy .
To the contrary , it has taken lawsuit after lawsuit , investigative report after investigative report , to bring this horrendous story to necessary light .
Another part of the pattern of this dispiriting tale is that church officials have never been in front of the story .
Always late , always responding , and , therefore , at every step of the way losing credibility .
This seemed to be the case once again with Benedict 's pastoral letter to Irish Catholics .
By the time he issued the letter , the story had moved to his native country , Germany , and had touched him personally .
In the past two months , there have been more than 250 accusations of sex abuse in Germany .
From the German Catholic viewpoint , the pope 's failure to mention anything about these abuse cases has pained them deeply and added to suspicions that the former archbishop of Munich has lost touch with his people .
Inexorably , a story that began with reports on trials in a few U.S. cities a quarter century back has now moved up the Catholic institutional ladder -- from priests to bishops to national bishops ' conferences and to the Vatican itself .
This last step is the one we see emerging this month .
The new focus is unlikely to end anytime soon .
Time for answers
The focus now is on Benedict .
What did he know ?
When did he know it ?
How did he act once he knew ?
The questions arise not only about his conduct in Munich , but also , based also as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
A March 25 Times story , citing information from bishops in the United States , reported that the Vatican had failed to take action against a priest accused of molesting as many as 200 deaf children while working at a school from 1950 to 1974 .
Correspondence reportedly obtained by the paper showed requests for the defrocking of the priest , Fr. Lawrence Murphy , going directly from U.S. bishops to Ratzinger , then head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith , and Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , now the Vatican secretary of state .
No action was taken against Murphy .
Like it or not , this new focus on the pope and his actions as an archbishop and Vatican official fits the distressing logic of this scandal .
For those who have followed this tragedy over the years , the whole episode seems familiar : accusation , revelation , denial and obfuscation , with no bishop held accountable for actions taken on their watch .
Yes , there is a depressing madness to this story .
Time after time , this is a story of institutional failure of the deepest kind , a failure to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ , a failure to put compassion ahead of institutional decisions aimed at short - term benefits and avoiding public scandal .
The strategies employed so far -- taking the legal path , obscuring the truth , and doing everything possible to protect perpetrators as well as the church 's reputation and treasury -- have failed miserably .
We now face the largest institutional crisis in centuries , possibly in church history .
How this crisis is handled by Benedict , what he says and does , how he responds and what remedies he seeks , will likely determine the future health of our church for decades , if not centuries , to come .
It is time , past time really , for direct answers to difficult questions .
It is time to tell the truth .

Violent crime , which is often spurred by food and fuel shortages , are also common .
Since the early 2000 ’s , the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas have been in turmoil .
Israel itself proves to be dangerous to those who visit the region .
Therefore , you should choose not to visit this area when you have children with you .
In the past few years , Nepal has seen increasingly dangerous conditions .
Visitors to the area have experienced issues regarding violence against women , acts of terrorism and have been the victims of other violent crimes .
Traveling here with children should be advised against .
Yemen is another location to avoid when traveling with children .
Terrorist acts have occurred here recently and the overall atmosphere of the area is one which is unsafe for tourists , especially those with children .
Syria has also been experiencing turmoil and visitors to this country have been known to be the victims of various criminal acts .
In addition , terrorism acts have occurred which make the area unsafe for a good amount of visitors .
Therefore , traveling to Syria with children may not be a wise thing to do .
Termite colonies are families - millions of individual workers all descended from one king and one queen .
But the colony itself tends to outlast this initial royal couple .
When they die , new kings and queens rise to take their place .
These secondary royals are a common feature of some families of termites , and they will often mate with each other for many generations .
But there is more to this system than meets the eye .
Kenji Matsuura from Okayama University has found that the secondary queens are all genetically identical clones of the original .
There are many copies , and they have no father - they developed from unfertilised eggs laid by the first queen through a process called parthenogenesis .
These clones then mate with the king to produce the rest of the colony through normal sexual means .
It 's a fiendishly clever strategy .
The original queen 's legacy to the colony is ... herself .
She effectively splits herself into several different bodies and in doing so , greatly increases the number of offspring she has .
And because each of these descendants mates with the king , who has no genes in common with them , the colony neatly skirts around the problems of inbreeding .
Matsuura collected 30 natural colonies of a Japanese termite Reticulitermes speratus and they found that in all but one of these , the original queen had been replaced with several secondary ones - a total of 1,660 between the various nests .
However , the majority of the colonies were still home to the original king , and the remainder had a single secondary one .
This suggests that the king always ' rules ' alone , and does so for a longer period of time than his mate .
When Matsuura analysed the genes of 135 secondary queens from seven different colonies , he found a surprise .
Virtually all of them from any given colony were genetically identical to each other , and in the one where the original queen was still alive , her successors ' genes were perfect matches for her own .
And none of these termites had any genetic variants in common with the kings from their respective colonies .
Clearly , the first queen had spawned her successors without any help from the king .
The same thing did n't apply to other members of the colony .
Matsuura tested 20 workers from each colony and found that every single one was the product of sex between a queen and a king .
To confirm this , Matsuura checked for signs of inbreeding among the workers .
Because the father and mother of inbred individuals are related , they have a higher - than - average chance of carrying the same copies of any given gene , as opposed to two slightly different versions .
This was n't the case for the worker termites - they had high levels of " heterozygosity " , meaning that they frequently carried two different versions of the same gene .
This obviously benefits the queen .
Even after she dies , she had effectively started an entire dynasty of herself , each of whom will produce huge numbers of daughters .
And because these daughters are produced by the usual sexual congress between king and secondary queen , the levels of genetic diversity within the colony remain high .
The king benefits too - it 's likely that the offspring he sires by mating with the various clones of his queen will be healthier and fitter than those he would produce if he had to mate with his own daughters

Specific cells and synapses within implicated neural circuits are recruited during learning , such that memory allocation is not random but rather is regulated by precise mechanisms which define where and how information is stored within the neural network [ 1 ] .
Nearly four decades ago , Seymour Kety suggested that emotionally arousing experiences may be associated with activation of the locus coeruleus , sending adrenergic projections to different regions of the brain ( such as hippocampus , cortex and cerebellum ) [ 2 ] .
Moreover , he proposed that activation of β- adrenoreceptors by released norepinephrine ( NE ) could result in facilitation of synaptic transmission through the mechanism involving increases in the intracellular cAMP concentration and new protein synthesis , thus contributing to the memory acquisition and maintenance .
It is currently hypothesized that synaptic plasticity , specifically long - term potentiation ( LTP ) , in the neural circuits of learned behaviors could provide a cellular substrate of memory storage [ 3 ] .
Consistent with Kety 's proposal , it has been demonstrated recently that direct activation of the locus coeruleus initiated protein synthesis - dependent LTP at the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus in awake rats [ 4 ] .
At the behavioral level , there is overwhelming evidence that emotionally - charged events often lead to the creation of vivid long - lasting memories [ 5 , 6 ] , in part due to a surge of norepinephrine and subsequent stimulation of adrenergic receptors in the nervous system [ 7 , 8 ] , and , as a result , improved memory consolidation [ 6 ] .
Unexpectedly , recent studies of the human subjects indicate that although emotionally - charged events are remembered better than emotionally neutral experiences , emotion may enhance the subjective sense of recollection more than memory accuracy [ 9 ]
.
The results of numerous previous experiments implicate the amygdala in acquisition and retention of memory for emotionally charged events [ reviewed in [ 10 – 12 ] ] .
Thus synaptic enhancements in the conditioned stimulus ( CS ) pathways to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala were shown to contribute in the acquisition of fear memory to the acoustic CS during auditory fear conditioning [ 13 – 17 ] .
It has been demonstrated also that the basolateral amygdala can regulate consolidation of memories in other regions of the brain [ 6 , 18 ] .
The contribution of the amygdala to modulating memory consolidation critically depends on activation of β- adrenoreceptors in the BLA [ 19 –21 ] .
According to the emotional tagging concept , activation of the amygdala during emotionally arousing events could mark the experience as important and aid in enhancing synaptic plasticity in other regions of the brain [ 22 ] .
Consistent with this notion , it has been shown previously that the actions of NE in the BLA promote the induction of LTP [ 23 ] and the expression of Arc protein , implicated in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and memory formation , in the hippocampus [ 24 ] .
On the other hand , plasticity in the auditory thalamus ( specifically in the medial division of the medial geniculate nucleus and posterior intralaminar nucleus ) , prior to projections to the LA , plays an essential role in auditory fear conditioning [ 25 , 26 ] .
This supports the notion that plasticity in multiple regions of the brain may contribute to the formation of fear memory [ 26 ] .
Recent reviews have examined the role of the noradrenergic system in emotional memory [ 27 ] , the influence of norepinephrine on fear circuitry [ 28 ] , and the function of norepinephrine system in general [ 29 ] .
Learning to recognize important cues in our environment with emotional salience , such as danger or altruistic social interactions , is an essential survival mechanism .
Thus evolution has shaped our nervous system to robustly remember cues that elicit emotion .
While some emotional responses are hard - wired into the brain 's circuitry , many of them are learned through experience [ 10 ] .
How do we remember emotionally charged events so well , and what does it tell us about the mechanisms of memory storage in the brain ?
Most of our experiences and information detected by our senses are not remembered .
How does our brain know what events are important enough to be preserved for long - term storage ?
One important clue comes from the fact that the transition of the behavioral experiences into memory likely arises from changes in the efficiency of synaptic transmission in corresponding neuronal pathways [ 30 – 32 , 15 ] .
In this review we will consider at the level of changes in synaptic function how creation of long - lasting memories during emotional arousal might be linked to a surge of norepinephrine in specific neural circuits .

Homeowners who may have hazardous Chinese drywall in their homes should remove it , two government agencies said Friday , in effect advising thousands of people from Florida to California to gut their homes .
Consumers should remove “ all possible problem drywall ” and replace their electrical wiring , sprinkler systems , smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms , according to new guidelines issued Friday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
“ Based on the scientific work to date , removing the problem drywall is the best solution currently available to homeowners , ” said Inez Tenenbaum , chairwoman of the safety commission .
Authorities began investigating problem drywall in 2008 , when homeowners in Florida complained of foul odors seeping from their walls and corrosion in their air conditioners , mirrors , electrical units and jewelry .
Although officials initially found no problem with the Chinese - made material , studies eventually showed that the corrosion could be linked to drywall from China .
The problematic drywall emits hydrogen sulfide at rates 100 times the rates of non-Chinese samples , the commission said .
Some homeowners complained of health problems , including coughing , nosebleeds , sinus infections and other throat , nose and lung irritation .
The commission said it was continuing to investigate claims from residents in 37 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and American Samoa .
The agency issued guidelines in January to help consumers identify whether their homes contained problem drywall .
Homeowners who had new drywall installed between 2001 and 2008 were instructed to look for blackened copper electrical wiring or air conditioner coils .
Inspectors would then test the corrosive conditions in the homes and the drywall .
Now , the same homeowners are being told that the best step is to remove the drywall , which amounts to gutting homes or additions where the cheap , imported building material was used .
It ’s still unclear who will pay for this process .
Thousands of homeowners have filed suit against the Chinese manufacturers who made the drywall and the U.S. companies that sold it .
“ We are looking to recover not just the cost to fix the home , but other damages , ” said Jordan Chaikin , a lawyer with Parker Waichman Alonso , a New York law firm that is representing about 1,000 homeowners who have sued for damages .
Many of the homes containing the Chinese drywall are in the Southeast .
They were constructed after hurricanes destroyed homes in Florida and Louisiana .
In addition , many complaints have arisen from homes built in several states in 2006 , near the end of the housing boom .

In May 2003 , a BP oil rig in 6,000 feet of water had a failure similar to the Deepwater Horizon .
The pipe from the sea floor to the surface broke in half .
In the 2003 case , the blow - out preventer ( BOP ) worked , shutting off the well .
There were no injuries .
BP and NOAA knew in 2003 that “ Loss of well containment would result in more oil spilled in a week than occurred during the whole of the T/V Exxon ’s Valdez oil spill . ”

Barefooted , some even stark naked , the kids follow her as if she were the Pied Piper of Hamelin .
As boisterous cheers announce her arrival the women abandon their chores and elders jostle for attention .
The men are on their best behaviour , teeming with a welter of anxious faces .
In the impoverished hinterlands of Gaibandha district in northern Bangladesh , a frail young woman on her bike is having a dramatic effect .
And Luich Akhter seems to perpetuate her spell with perfection .
In the sweltering post - monsoon heat that transforms the flooded nation into an open - air sauna , the 24 - year - old looks immaculate as she negotiates her way through paddy fields , cows and mosquito - breeding ponds on a weekly visit into Panchpeer village .
In a place where women dutifully give birth in dingy huts , the men know of little outside their fields , and the world revolves around the local mosque ; the sight of a " modern " woman visitor astride her bike is a spectacle .
The more so as Akhter zaps around with gadgets like a netbook , GSM mobile , blood pressure monitor and pregnancy kit , all deftly packed in her shoulder bag .
" It was a scandal when I started my rounds two years ago with just a mobile phone " , says Akhter .
Now it is more of a phenomenon .
She is treated like a champion by people whose lives she 's shaping with once " scary machines " .
Akhter belongs to a motley band of " InfoLadies , " who are piloting a revolutionary idea - giving millions of Bangladeshis , trapped in a cycle of poverty and natural disaster , access to information on their doorstep to improve their chances in life .
" Ask me about the pest that 's infecting your crop , common skin diseases , how to seek help if your husband beats you or even how to stop having children , and I may have a solution , " says a confident Akhter .
" An InfoLady 's netbook is loaded with content especially compiled and translated in local Bangla language , " says Mohammed Forhad Uddin of D.Net , a not - for - profit research organisation that is pioneering access to livelihood information .
" It provides answers and solutions to some of the most common problems faced by people in villages . "
In Bangladesh this means nearly three - quarters of the nearly 160 million that live in rural areas .
From agriculture to health , sanitation and disaster management , the content follows simple text , pictures and engaging multimedia animations to include all users , many of whom are illiterate .
" I love the cartoon that tells about brushing teeth and hygiene , " says 10 - year - old Shamshul .
It took a just a brief meeting with an InfoLady for 60 - year - old Nahar Hossain to finally identify the pest that destroyed his rice fields year after year .
" She matched the picture of my crop with the one on her TV [ netbook ] and recommended a certain pesticide .
I have n't had problems since , " says Hossain , who had spent a lot of time and money seeking government help to no avail .
Corruption and prejudice
The success of the InfoLadies is making the failure of the state more noticeable .
" We have corruption and political interference in every sector , " says Gullal Singha , a state executive officer of Sagatha sub - district .
Sagatha is severely affected by soil erosion and is home to the poorest of the poor .
" Even the ultra - poor entitled for food relief are segregated as Bangladesh Nationalist Party poor or Awami League poor , " says Aziz Mostafa , an elected representative of a local civic body .
This explains why thousands of Bangladeshis have embraced InfoLadies and their laptops , which are making lives easier and arguably better .
" In most cases I 'm able to provide an instant solution using my database , " says Luich , who is educated to secondary school level .
For skin infections , she sends the patient 's picture to her organisation 's call centre in Dhaka , where experts help with diagnosis and advise hospital referral if required .
" In many places there are no doctors for miles , and fatalities for easily curable diseases are very high .
An InfoLady can save lives , " says Shahadat Hossain of NGO Udayan Sabolombi Shangstha .
Government statistics show Bangladesh has only three doctors per 10,000 people .
The 2009 United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) Human Development Report says over 36 % of the country 's population lives on less than US $ 1 a day , and almost every second child under five is underweight .
Women are far worse off as they remain at the bottom of the heap in religiously conservative rural societies .
According to Unicef , nearly 90 % of women in Bangladesh give birth at home without medical assistance , and half of them never seek any antenatal care .
" The access to information campaign is strategically fronted by women to bridge this divide " , says Munira Morshed of Bangladesh Telecentre Network , an umbrella organisation for all telecentre networks in Bangladesh .
The tactic has worked well .
" Women feel free to discuss their gynaecological problems with me , which they do n't even share with their husbands , " says Somunu Akter Labony , an InfoLady from Sagatha .
The 20 - year - old , herself a mother of one , is aware of religious and social sensitivities and provides confidential contraception advice to women .
Finding a confidante in an InfoLady , victims of domestic violence are also coming forward to seek help , says Akhter .
" I inform them about their rights and warn their husbands they could go to jail , " she says .
The impact is palpable as every man she rides past in the village nods his head in acknowledgement .
" She is a terror - the men are scared of her ; even the clerics fear her , " says Najma Begum , the Chandipur telecentre manager .
Now the government is waking up to Digital Bangladesh .
" We will use the existing telecentre network for delivering information and public services through public - private - partnership , " says Mohammed Mahfuzur Rahman , executive director of Bangladesh Computer Council .
This approach for development without perpetual subsidy has found some support .
UNDP policy expert and adviser to the Bangladeshi Prime Minister 's Office Anir Chowdhury says : " The power of ICT is it can actually generate income .
Communities can run it in financially and socially profitable models " .
Chowdhury 's optimism is not unfounded .
The InfoLady and telecentre models are successfully trialling self - sustenance by providing ancillary services .
" It cost me 150 Taka [ £ 1.30 ] in travel and charges to get my blood pressure checked in town , " says Mohamed Monir , a Saghatha resident .
" Labony does it at home for five . "
And Sadnul Hossain is happy to pay 1,000 Taka ( £ 13 ) for a crash - course in MS Office applications at Sagatha telecentre to improve his job prospects .
" Before I had only seen computers in books , " he says .
There is also concern that the profitability of the InfoLady model and her superwoman - style avatar is being hyped as a panacea for all of Bangladesh 's ills .
Farzana Naim , of Manusher Jonno Foundation , which promotes good governance , insists the state must lead - not just find private partners for NGOs to make access to information a sustainable business .
" NGOs have piloted the project , but they are not in a position to replicate this all over the country . "
The army of InfoLadies , however , is turning the corner regardless .
They are busy telling people how to save their crops or send violent husbands to jail .
It 's hard work for young women who are new to their own freedom .
So are there any problems ?
" Just that after 6 pm I change my sim as I get calls from angry or besotted men , " says Akhter .
" They are scared of me in the daylight , but they all want to marry me after six . "
The video is n't a total failure .
I was pretty inspired by that piece of wood .
You 're likely familiar with the venerable Bookmobile , but when is the last time you saw one in your neighborhood ?
In many communities , it 's a rare sight .
Beset by budget cutbacks , library outreach is increasingly rare , leaving it to citizens to pick up the slack and encourage reading in their communities .
Gabriel Levinson is one such citizen .
Since 2008 , he has rode his custom - built Book Bike into public parks across Chicago every weekend , weather permitting .
Heading from park to park , Levinson distributes books donated by publishers to anyone interested .
Inspired by the literary activism efforts of Dave Eggers ' 826 organization , Levinson set out in 2008 to merge his " two passions , cycling and reading .
It seemed natural to me–just as the right to read provides limitless potential for a person , a bike allows you to go just about anywhere .
Being on a bike is freedom to me . "
" Free " is baked into the Book Bike 's mission statement : Levinson only appears at public parks and free events , ensuring that there is no barrier to entry .
As he explains , " the mission is to build and cherish a private library regardless of class or economic state , which is why the Book Bike is only at public parks .
It 's a place where every single person , whether you have a roof over your head or do n't , has the right and privilege to be . "
" I believe that one of the greatest gifts of being alive , of being human , is that of literacy .
If you can read , your world suddenly becomes wide open , all knowledge is at your fingertips and there is no telling where that can lead someone in life .
' Teach a man to fish ' is such a tired maxim .
Why can't the common phrase be ' teach a person to read ' ? "
Levinson has two goals : to create more readers and more consumers for beleaguered publishers .
" The idea is that I 'll put a book in your hand , " he says .
" Maybe you 'll want to buy a book next time around .
My hope has been , in addition to that , people will be inspired to go buy more books . "
The bike is a clever piece of engineering custom - built for Levinson by Stephen Horcha of Haley Trikes .
" I was going to buy a used ice cream bike , " says Levinson .
" I could n't find one , and new ones were too expensive .
I came across Haley Trikes , and Stephen and I worked to design the Book Bike . "
A custom - built tricycle , the Book Bike 's front compartment opens up into a mobile library that can hold as many as 300 books .
In the past two years , Levinson has distributed over 3000 books .
In that time , he has collected countless heartening tales of interacting with readers both old and young .
" One time I was at Garfield Park , these kids came up and I had tons of books .
This one kid asked ' how many can I take ? '
I said , ' Well , are you going to read everything that you take ? '
He said , ' Yeah ! '
So I told him to take whatever he wanted , he ended up walking home with a dozen books of all kinds .
He went away saying ' Thanks , thanks , I promise I 'm going to read all of them ! '
I do n't care what happens after that , to me , that was validation that the whole project is worth it . "
Despite the success , Levinson is looking for ways the project can better fulfill its mandate , and serve both his own community and the literary community .
In previous years , Levinson has accepted book donations from major publishing houses , but this year he is focusing on distributing only zines and books by independent publishers .
And , congruent with his mission to create not only readers , but also customers of literature , he will be accepting monetary donations for the first time .
The funds will be used to compensate independent publishers for books and zines distributed through the Book Bike , and upkeep on the bike itself .
" I had to figure out a way to keep the Book Bike stocked , and financially support independent press and publishers , " he said .
" I 've never accepted money before .
I did n't want money to muck things up , but I feel that I 've established myself with this project , so I 'm confident to take it to this next level . "
Levinson is one practioner of literary activism , but he 's far from the only one .
Another notable literary activist is Luis Soriano , the man behind the Biblioburro project .
Soriano loads his library on the back of two donkeys and delivers books to impoverished rural communities in Colombia .
As described in a New York Times article about Soriano , the teacher is directly fostering bibliophilia in communities with low literacy rates .
Levinson and Soriano stand as evidence that bibliophiles do not need to be connected to an organization to perform community outreach .
While such organizations exist , and are in need of volunteers –the 826 project , Sit Stay Read , and Rock for Reading are three notable examples –Levinson has preferred to remain an agile one - man operation .
" I pursued making this a not - for - profit , and found that it was impeding the growth of the project .
I was spending so much time figuring out what it takes that I literally stalled the project for months .
I want to focus on the people , on the books . "
Perhaps most central to Levinson 's project is that he is not only enabling readers , but enjoying himself in the process , engaging with literature and his community in a way that not enough people do .
He encourages others to follow the lead of efforts such as Soriano 's and his own , emphasizing that the experience can be its own reward .
" The goal is to hit as many parks as possible , and as many communities , well to do and not well to do , so nobody is excluded .
" he says .
" I ride a bike to a park , hang out on my day off , I crack open a book and just chill .
I dont take it for granted that I can do this ; on the contrary , I do everything I can to make the most of it .
What a wonderful way to spend the day . "

My own reading of H.P. Lovecraft 's short story , " The Colour Out Of Space " , published in Amazing Stories in September 1927 , making it a Public Domain work in Europe .
Plot Summary from Wikipedia ;
" The Colour Out of Space " is a first - person narrative written from the perspective of an unnamed surveyor from Boston .
In order to prepare for the construction of a new reservoir in Massachusetts , he surveys a rural area that is to be flooded near Lovecraft 's fictional town of Arkham .
He comes across a mysterious patch of land , an abandoned 5 - acre ( 20,000 m2 ) farmstead , which is completely devoid of all life .
At the centre of the farmstead is an old well .
The site fills him with an unnatural sense of dread , and he hurries past it .
When he returns to Arkham , the surveyor asks around for information regarding the waste .
He learns of an elderly hermit , Ammi Pierce , and asks him about the " blasted heath " .
The hermit tells him a horrific tale .
In the early 1880s , the farm had been productive , run by a Nahum Gardner and his family .
Then , one afternoon in June 1882 , a large meteorite crashed into the farm , beside the well .
It was metallic and contained a substance of an indescribable color that proved toxic .
While scientists were never able to tell what ( or who ) the meteor contained , its effects were undeniable — the entire Gardner family was struck by insanity , illness , and worse , whilst the land around them was slowly drained of life . "
Any reviews appreciated .

2010 's coming stock market crash : 1987 all over again
( Fortune ) --
In two tumultuous weeks in October 1987 , the stock market shed nearly one - third of its value in perhaps the second most notorious crash in U.S. history .
It could happen again .
Do n't be deceived by the rebounding economy , any more than the bulls should have been misled by the balmy climate during the late Reagan years .
Right now , stocks are extremely vulnerable to the same scenario .
The reason :
The market is even more overpriced than when thunder struck on that distant Black Monday .
That does n't mean that a giant correction is inevitable ; far from it .
But the quasi - bubble that followed the big selloff in late 2008 and early 2009 makes the probability of sudden downward swing far more likely .
And today 's high prices make it practically certain that investors can , at best , expect extremely low returns in the years ahead .
Let 's gauge where the market stood just before the shock of October ' 87 .
For this analysis , we 'll use the price - to - earnings multiples developed by Yale economist Robert Shiller , who smoothes the erratic swings in profits by calculating PEs based on a 10 - year average S&P earnings , adjusted for inflation .
In the fall of 1987 , stocks were on a tear .
The Shiller PE had doubled to 18.3 in just four - and - a - half years .
That 's far above the historical average of less than 14 ( though pales in comparison to recent giant PE numbers ) .
The dividend yield was also an extremely narrow 2.6 % , well below the norm of around 4.5 % .
That 's important to remember , because over long periods , dividends are by far the biggest source of investor returns from equities .
Then the bottom fell out of the stock market .
When the carnage ended , the PE had dropped to 13.3 , around its 60 - year average , and the dividend yield was approaching 4 % .
In other words , the fall hardly made stocks a bargain .
But with brutal speed and efficiency , it chopped valuations to levels that made sense .
The slow crash of 2008 - 2009 : a temporary return to sanity
From early 2008 until March of 2009 , stocks suffered a steep decline that echoed the 1987 correction , though over many months versus a few days .
During that period , PEs fell from the low 20s to 13.3 , precisely their level following the ' 87 crash .
Once again , dividend yields approached 4 % .
For a few brief weeks , it appeared that sanity had returned to the capital markets .
Suddenly , equities -- overpriced for 20 years -- looked like a good buy , just as they had in at the close of 1987 .
But the rational interlude did n't last .
By early May of this year , the PE had soared back to almost 22 , shrinking the dividend yield to 1.8 % .
In recent days , stocks have dropped over 7 % amid giant gyrations .
That decline is n't nearly enough to restore equities to anything like their fair value .
So what do the current , extremely price PEs tell us about the future of stock prices ?
The best bet is always that equity values , like most investments , " revert to the mean . "
So following a bubble or bubblette , PEs and dividend yield will inevitably fall back to their historic averages .
The big question is how long it will take .
In 1987 , it took a few days .
In the 1990s and early 2000s , stocks remained overpriced for years .
The problem is that the returns investors can garner at today 's lofty valuations are just too low .
They 're also too low to last .
If PEs stay constant , the total return to investors is the dividend yield plus the growth in earnings per share , with an added bump for inflation .
Today , the yield is 1.8 % .
Earnings per share typically grow at a " real " rate of around 1.5 % , way below the pace that Wall Street advertises .
So the total gain from investing at today 's prices is 3.3 % or so , plus around 2.5 % for inflation , for a total of between 5.5 % and 6 % .
That 's not enough .
Stocks are far too risky for investors to accept those puny rewards , as the wild swings of the last two years , and last two weeks , make abundantly obvious .
The only way for future returns to rise is for PEs to fall .
How far must prices fall to get back to basics ?
For the S&P to return to a PE of around 14 , the index would need to drop by around 33 % to less than 800 , its range in early 2009 .
That would substantially raise dividend yields , and raise future real returns into the high single digits , where they belong .
The drop is going to happen .
Here 's how :
Here 's how I see the odds .
The chances are about one in three that we suffer a huge , wrenching correction in the next year or two similar to the one in 1987 .
That possibility is so high because stocks are so startlingly expensive .
Another high probability event is that markets go on a long sideways grind , with smaller drops along the way .
What 's extremely unlikely is that the market rises substantially from current levels and stays there for any extended period .
Whatever happens in the next couple of years , the odds are overwhelming that investors who buy stocks today will reap puny returns for 10 years .
For example , if you 'd purchased shares at today 's PE of 22 in early 2003 , you would have gotten a return of around 3 % a year , barely enough to compensate for inflation , let alone buy the blood pressure medication you 'd need to survive the scary ride of stock ownership .
Now let 's look out a decade or two .
The evidence is extremely strong that price matters , and matters a lot : except in rare cases , buying stocks when they are pricey -- when the Shiller PE exceeds 20 -- leads to puny returns ten years later .
Not that you 'd ever know that from the happy talk from Wall Street .
So screen the noise out , and follow the numbers .
They 'll eventually get better for investors .
But to get back there , we may revisit October of 1987 .

CONCORD , Mass .  Henry David
Thoreau was jailed here 164 years ago for refusing to pay taxes while living at Walden Pond .
Now the town has Jean Hill to contend with .
Mrs. Hill , an octogenarian previously best known for her blueberry jam , proposed banning the sale of bottled water here at a town meeting this spring .
Voters approved , with the intent of making Concord the first town in the nation to strip Aquafina , Poland Spring and the like from its stores .
In orchestrating an outright ban , Mrs. Hill , 82 , has achieved something that powerful environmental groups have not even tried .
The bottled water industry is not pleased ; it has threatened to sue if the ban takes effect as planned on Jan .
1 . Officials here have hinted that they might not strictly enforce it , but Mrs.
Hill , who described herself as obsessed , said that would only deepen her resolve .
“ I ’m going to work until I drop on this , ” she said .
“ If you believe in something , you have to persist and you have to have a thick skin . ”

Sony has said it will stop making floppy disks , after nearly three decades of manufacture .
Yet millions of them are still being bought every year .
But who is actually buying them ?
That 's about one snap on a brand new digital camera
The floppy disk is the very symbol of storage ; when you want to save a file , you go looking for that little icon that looks like a floppy .
Every year another computer manufacturer stops putting floppy drives in its machines , or a retailer stops selling the disks .
Each time the cry goes up that the death knell has been sounded for the floppy disk .
However , Verbatim , a UK manufacturer which makes more than a quarter of the floppies sold in the UK , says it sells hundreds of thousands of them a month .
It sells millions more in Europe .
" We 've been discussing the death of the floppy for 14 years , ever since CD technology first started coming on strong , " says Verbatim spokesman Kevin Jefcoate .
Yet what was Sony 's best - selling peripheral for its computers in recent years ?
The 3.5 - inch floppy disk drive that connects via a USB cable .
Somewhere out there , the floppy disk is alive and well .
But where ?
Disk - credited
The truth is the 3½ - inch , 1.44 megabyte floppy - the disk that made it big - has always defied logic .
It 's not floppy for a start .
The term was a hangover from its precursor , the 5 ¼ - inch floppy , which had a definite lack of rigidity about it .
However , its smaller successor held even more data .
But then along came the CD - ROM , and then the USB flash drive shamed them both ; the most voluminous USB stick - which could pass for a keyring - can now hold nearly 90,000 floppies ' worth of data .
Old habits die hard , I guess ...
If you you do n't do much in the way of photography or music , then why would you change ?

Research director , IDC
40 ways we still use floppy disks
Sony signals end for floppy disks
One might be tempted to think that , like the vinyl enthusiasts who insist music sounds " warmer " on a record , the floppy has its own fan club .
But unlike the case of vinyl , the digital format of a floppy is no different than that found on your hard drive or USB stick .
Given their limited size and speed of data transfer , along with their increasing obsolescence , it 's harder to find a floppy fan club than it is to find a laptop with a floppy drive built in .
But what about all the second - hand computers that are donated to the developing world ?
Could they be even partly responsible for the thousands of disks still sold ?
Anja Ffrench of Computer Aid International - the largest charity working to distribute recycled IT to Africa and South America - says that they only deal in computers from 2002 and later , meaning that they 'll have the USB connection that obviates the need for floppies .
There are a few instances for which floppies remain the norm , like the specialist , high - value technology that may rely on floppy drives for data .
Saving grace
The vast desks that control the light shows and sounds settings in theatres or music venues have until recently come with floppy drives as standard ; the English National Opera is just one example of an organisation that uses them .
One place you might find at least a few floppy disks A volunteer at the National Museum of Computing says that many scientific instruments - so - called dataloggers , oscilloscopes and the like - record their data onto floppies .
This kind of expensive equipment is made to last , to be bought infrequently - and these gadgets may call for at least a few floppies in their lifetimes .
But these relatively niche uses could n't possibly account for the number of floppies - something like a million a month - that are being consumed in the UK alone .
The answer may simply be that there are a great many old computers that read only floppies , and a great many computer users that have no need for the storage media that have supplanted them in other quarters .
Rather than there being one industry propped up on the values of a floppy , or a horde of enthusiasts buying up the world 's supply , the humble floppy may simply be as much as many computer users need .
" Old habits die hard , I guess , " said John Delaney , research director for IT analysts IDC .
" If you 've been using PCs for a long time and you do n't do much in the way of photography or music with them , then why would you change ?
" There are people who ride technology for as long as it can be ridden without falling over . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I would just like to point out that the reason it is called a floppy disk is because the actual disk which is inside the plastic cover is floppy , as opposed to a hard disk where the disk is actually hard and rigid .
Nothing to do with the 5 1/4 floppy .
Jamie Chapman , Pentre , South - Wales I still be using Floppy Disks and use them to store sound effects for Video Editing .
As the effects are short files they are ideal media for this and are reliable .
USB
Keys could be used but usually are of to big of a storage and are not as easy to be stored .
I still hope that they will be made till someone comes up with a system that works as well as Floppys and do not use more space .
Using CDs or DVDs are not really a replacement as if one goes wrong I loose the lot as for a Floppy I just loose one sound effect but usually have two , so I have at least one back up and would make straight away a new backup .
Bernhard Koster , Poole / Dorset
I 'm totally shocked that floppies are still used in such numbers .
truly amazing
Navin , Guyana
I work in IT and have n't used a floppy for years and instead , I have USB sticks lying in piles like the floppies used to .
For little under £ 3.00 you can buy a 512MB and just about a 1GB USB stick which can be used to boot devices , for storage , and to even give away !
With the days of 24 floppy disks to install Microsoft Office 95 , and getting to disk 23 an hour later and it's corrupted , I wo n't be looking back !
Some will argue long live floppy disks , but in my opinion , goodbye forever !
Lee Osborne , Colchester , Essex , UK
One factor by which the numbers used may be exaggerated is the way floppies are sold .
I needed one recently but the smallest pack I could find contained twenty .
I now have nineteen spare and probably useless disks but they will each have registeered as sales in the statistics .
If all purchases are like mine the actual usage may be a lot smaller than the statistics suggest .
Edward Alport , Colchester
There are still plenty of embedded machines in the production industry that use floppies for backup and install purposes .
Some of the machines that control production machines are so old they do n't require windows , only DOS , and the floppy is still king here .
Seyhan A , Swansea
I have an old music keyboard which uses floppies .
Luckily I was able to get a box of 200 new disks from my company when they ditched them - enough to keep me going ...
Lyndon , Birmingham I work for an IT company and we still use floppy disks to take " boot " and " root " backups of our Unix systems as these are designed to fit perfectly on a 1.44 MB disk .
Chris , London Still use 3.5 as back up it makes life much easier if you want to send copies through the post without giving away too many secrets .
Dave Spittal , Nottingham I Still have one computer running DOS , and those old DOS programs were designed to use floppies .
Why keep a DOS machine ?
It 's more reliable than any modern OS .
That DOS machine will run for years and years without ever crashing and losing data .
Flash Light , NYC , USA Ideal for small documents , without too much fiddling about .
With USB sticks one should dismount and they often get lost .

You 'll remember I wrote about this before , when I first found out Whirlpool took millions in bailout money and then announced they were moving this plant to Mexico .
Now they 've closed the plant and soon the town will turn into a ghost town :
“ We were considered the refrigerator capital of the world , ” said Randall Reynolds , who was a forklift driver .
But that family tradition will soon end because Whirlpool plans to close the plant on Friday and move the operation to Mexico , eliminating 1,100 jobs here .
Many in this city in southern Indiana are seething and sad — sad about losing what was long the city ’s economic centerpiece and a ticket to the middle class for one generation after another .
“ This is all about corporate greed , ” said Ms. Ford , who took a job at Whirlpool 19 years ago .
“ It ’s devastating to our family and to everyone in the plant .
I wonder where we ’ll be two years or four years from now .
There are n’t any jobs here .
How is this community going to survive ? ”
At a time when the nation ’s economy is struggling to gain momentum , Whirlpool ’s decision is an unwelcome step backward .
It continues a trend in which the nation has lost nearly six million factory jobs over the past dozen years , representing one in three manufacturing jobs .
Connie Brasel , who earned $ 18.44 an hour making thermal liners for the refrigerators , sees Whirlpool ’s move as a betrayal not just of the workers but also of the United States .
“ This country made Whirlpool what it is , ” she said .
“ They did n’t get world - class quality because they had the best managers .
They got world - class quality because of the U.S. and because of their workers .
And now they want to pack up and move to Mexico .
I find it offensive . ”
[...]
The closing leaves not just Ms. Ford and her son without a job , but also her husband , a worker in the metal - pressing shop .
“ My mom and dad told me that when they were young , there were jobs everywhere , ” she said .
“ They said we had Whirlpool , Bristol - Myers , Mead Johnson , Windsor Plastics , Guardian Automotive , Zenith .
Now if you want to find a job , there ’s nothing around . ”
Ask the workers who is to blame , and they say not just Whirlpool , but also President Bill Clinton for having negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement , which eliminated tariffs on trade with the United States ’ neighbors .
They say the pact has siphoned jobs to Mexico .
They also blame Indiana ’s governor , Mitch Daniels , saying he has largely ignored their plight , and President George W. Bush and President Obama , saying they had done little to reverse manufacturing ’s decline .
“ When people are unemployed for a long period , they would look at any administration , including this one , as being part of the problem and not doing enough , ” said Mohammed F. Khayum , the dean of the University of Southern Indiana ’s business school .
“ It can definitely play a role in this November ’s elections unless things turn around before then . ”
On the bright side , if the party turns into a sleepover , they already have a tent pitched .

Gulf Dead Zone Growing Irrespective of Oil Spill
With every disaster come the rumors of more disaster to come .
I remember Hurricane Andrew , 1992 , and the silliness that followed it such as : thousands of dead are being taken out in body bags by the military .
They are being loaded secretly in Home Depot trucks .
Then there was “ another hurricane is due within days ” rumor and the government [ of course ] is keeping it quiet so as to avoid panic .
Millions are expected to die .
Remember all of the crazy rumors immediately following the 9/11 attacks ?
Nothing has changed following the Gulf oil spill .
Similar nonsense is being bandied about , especially on the social networks such as FaceBook , MySpace , blogs and etc. by the “ sky is falling ” folk who say the oil spill will be the cause of huge fireballs that will destroy coastal cities to the most laughable : the extinction of the human species .
Naturally there are the equally silly but always inevitable “ the government is secretly responsible and is covering up for BP ” claims .
Among these highly exaggerated and almost always ridiculous assertions is the “ dead zone because of the oil ” theory .
Well the fact is that there has been a dead zone in the Gulf since 2001 .
It continues to grow and has nothing to do with oil .
Read this story and tell me what you think :
University of Michigan aquatic ecologist Donald Scavia and his colleagues say this year ’s Gulf of Mexico “ dead zone ” is expected to be larger than average , continuing a decades - long trend that threatens the health of a $ 659 million fishery .
The 2010 forecast , released by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , calls for a Gulf dead zone of between 6,500 and 7,800 square miles , an area roughly the size of Lake Ontario .
The most likely scenario , according to Scavia , is a Gulf dead zone of 6,564 square miles , which would make it the Gulf ’s 10th - largest oxygen - starved , or hypoxic , region on record .
The average size over the past five years was about 6,000 square miles .
It is unclear what impact , if any , the Deepwater Horizon oil spill will have on the size of this year ’s Gulf dead zone because numerous factors are at work , the researchers say .
“ We ’re not certain how this will play out .
But one fact is clear :
The combination of summer hypoxia and toxic - oil impacts on mortality , spawning and recruitment is a one - two punch that could seriously diminish valuable Gulf commercial and recreational fisheries , ” said Scavia , Special Counsel to the U - M President for Sustainability , director of the Graham Sustainability Institute , and a professor at the School of Natural Resources and Environment .
Farmland runoff containing fertilizers and livestock waste — some of it from as far away as the Corn Belt — is the main source of the nitrogen and phosphorus that cause the annual Gulf of Mexico hypoxia zone .
Each year in late spring and summer , these nutrients flow down the Mississippi River and into the Gulf , fueling explosive algae blooms there .
When the algae die and sink , bottom - dwelling bacteria decompose the organic matter , consuming oxygen in the process .
The result is an oxygen - starved region in bottom and near - bottom waters : the dead zone .
This year , the situation is complicated by uncertainties related to the Gulf oil spill .
If sufficient oil reaches the area typically subject to summer hypoxia , the size of this summer ’s Gulf dead zone could increase for two reasons : microbial breakdown of oil — which consumes oxygen — and the oil ’s potential to reduce diffusion of oxygen from the air into the water , the process that normally replenishes oxygen levels in the water column , Scavia said .
On the other hand , the presence of oil could restrict the growth of hypoxia - fueling algae , helping to limit the size of the Gulf dead zone .

Dog Climbs Tree To Get To Frisbee
I ’ve seen lots of dogs do tricks with frisbees before , but I ’m not sure I ’ve ever seen one climb a tree to get to a frisbee … until now .
As you ’ll see in this video , this is one determined dog .
News of the underground suicide bombings in Moscow on Monday led news broadcasts around the world within minutes of the explosions .
But not in Russia .
Time magazine reports that none of the country 's three main TV networks interrupted their normal broadcasts to report Russia 's worst terrorist attack in five years .
Critics say the slow response of the networks — Channel One , Rossia 1 and NTV — is indicative of the state of television journalism in Russia today .
They claim that the broadcasters have been so cowed by the Kremlin , they are incapable of covering events of vital national importance .
Arina Borodina , a TV critic with Moscow 's Kommersant newspaper , says : " Can you imagine an attack during rush hour in New York or Paris , and a television channel does n't show anything for two hours ? "
Ever since Vladimir Putin came to power a decade ago , the Kremlin has steadily reined in the coverage of the main television networks , all of which are controlled by the government or state - owned companies .
In the 1990s , the channels tended to slant their coverage in favor of their oligarch owners , but they also produced incisive investigative reports previously unknown to a population raised on Soviet propaganda .
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied dictating to the networks on how to cover major events , but they almost never stray from the official line nowadays and often provide fawning coverage of prime minister Putin President Dmitri Medvedev .
According to Anna Kachkayeva , a professor at Moscow State University and a TV critic with Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty , says the reluctance of the networks to broadcast breaking coverage of the bombings was only partially due to Kremlin pressure .
She believes the art of live coverage has also disappeared in the past 10 years as news broadcasts have become more and more scripted , saying : " There just are n't very many people around anymore who can do live television . "
However , Anatoly Lysenko , a pioneer in contemporary Russian television , argues that the channels reported responsibly and helped avoid a city - wide panic .

So , the new Transformers game is pretty good .
Especially its dedication to fans of the original series .
But we did n't think it would be this dedicated .

This is the game 's closing credits .
Yes , it 's cel - shaded , and yes , that 's Stan Bush singing , the same man responsible for the 1986 Transformers animated film 's trademark tune .
About the only thing that would have made it better would have been to get that gravel - voiced guy to go " NEXT WEEK ON .... TRRRRRRANSFORMMERSSSSSSSSS " , but that would have been so perfect I 'd have had to get my head checked , make sure I had n't gone crazy .

Google will begin letting users run encrypted searches on its flagship search site Google.com starting next week , the company said in a blog post Thursday .
Allowing users to search using https - the web security system which many associate with online banking and shopping – would mark a first for a major search engine , and could begin a move by web services such as social networks to begin offering encryption for more than just log-ins .
Such increased adoption would cut down on network eavesdropping and also have the added benefit of preventing some online attacks .
Ironically , the announcement of the upcoming change came in a long blog post explaining that the search company had been " mistakenly " eavesdropping and recording what people were doing on unencrypted wi-fi networks as its Street View cars were taking pictures of cities around the world and recording the IDs of wifi networks and routers .
That data is used to help geo-locate people using devices without GPS , but the company has said for years it was not collecting session data .
Google turned on encryption – better known as https :// – as a default for Gmail users earlier this year .
That encrypts the data sent between a user 's browser and Google 's servers , making it nearly impossible for someone in the middle to read the contents of that e-mail .
When not using SSL , a user of a school or corporate network can have their e-mail and web traffic content read by authorities who control the network , while anyone using an open Wi-Fi connection can have their traffic sniffed by a hacker using simple tools .
Gmail was the first major webmail service to offer encryption for full sessions , rather than just for log-ins .
Google allowed power users to use https :// for years , and under pressure from privacy and security advocates turned it into the default for all users earlier this year .
In contrast , Gmail 's competitors including Yahoo Mail or Microsoft 's Hotmail do n't even offer https sessions as an option .
Using https , rather than http , is not technically difficult , but the authenticating handshakes between a server and a browser do require more resources from both a server and the browser .
That means it costs a company more to run a service and can slow down an application .

BERLIN , May 11 ( Reuters ) - Germany ’s opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) said on Tuesday they had not decided whether to support a European rescue package for the euro , and warned the country could end up footing the entire cost of the bill .
The package -- 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro states plus 60 billion euros in a European stabilisation fund -- includes some 123 billion in loan guarantees from Germany , a German government source told Reuters on Tuesday .
Another source said Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s cabinet had approved Germany ’s share in the aid , which has been strongly criticized by conservative media and could face a legal challenge at the country ’s highest court .
SPD parliamentary whip Thomas Oppermann told ARD television there were still too many open questions about the plan , which parliament is due to begin debating next week .
“ What happens if other countries who get aid from the package drop out ?
Will the German share increase then ? , ” he said .
The government has said the German share could rise because not all EU member states would have the means to participate .
“ In the worst case scenario , the Germans may have to guarantee the 440 billion euros alone , and we wo n’t be able to do that , ” added Oppermann .
“ After the Lehman crisis , after the Greek crisis , we ’re for the third time faced with the decision of approving packages the German taxpayer will probably have to pay for in the end . ”
The opposition Greens said on Monday the plan was unlikely to come to a parliamentary vote before June .
Although Merkel does not need the SPD ’s support to get the financial aid package bill through the lower house of parliament , she is keen for as much backing as possible due to widespread public opposition to Germany financing any bailouts .
The make - up of the upper house is still unclear after Merkel ’s centre - right coalition lost its automatic majority in elections in North Rhine - Westphalia at the weekend .
“ We are Europe ’s fools again ! ” Germany ’s biggest selling daily , Bild , said on its front page on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , hedge funds , banks and speculators could do what they wanted on financial markets , Oppermann said .
“ A substantial participation of the banks and hedge funds in the costs of the crisis must be arranged , ” he said .
“ Today we ’ll probably just see a simple authorisation of credit again .
That ca n’t be it .
If we want to protect the euro ... then measures must be agreed that at least make speculative trading on markets harder or even impossible . ”
If the government did approve a bill to introduce a financial transaction tax , then it was “ not ruled out ” the SPD would back the European aid package , Oppermann said .
The centre - left SPD abstained from voting on the Greek aid package last week after failing to push through an addendum in support of a European financial transaction tax .
EU finance ministers said the International Monetary Fund was expected to contribute 250 billion euros to the package , taking the total to 750 billion euros , about $ 1 trillion .

The new prime minister was left waiting on air while Kyle and Jackie played a song - Gettin ' Over You by David Guetta featuring Fergie .
" I think when you 're doing something as complicated as being prime minister , there are days when people are going to look at what you 're doing and go , ' That 's fantastic , ' and there are going to be other days when they look at what you 're doing and say , ' Why on earth did she do that ? ' , " Ms Gillard said .
" So I 'm not going to try and promise people everything 's going to be smooth sailing and they 're going to be applauding at the end of each day because the job 's too tough for that , but I 'll be trying my best to be as frank as I can with the Australian people about the challenges we face . "
Asked if she would be outlawing redheaded jokes now that she was prime minister , Ms Gillard laughed and said she would still allow them .

Of all the many changes at TheNation.com , the one you wo n’t readily detect is the technology underlying the new site – the open source content management platform " Drupal . "
With redesigns , readers naturally focus on the " front- end , " ( did the colors change ? are there new features ? ) but the real innovations are often in the " back - end , " the platform , or language , that runs the site .
In this case , the " back end " is an important part of the story , as The Nation opted to use a technology that also makes a political statement .
Ad Policy
" Open source " software code is published and made freely available to the public , enabling anyone to copy , modify and redistribute it without paying or earning royalties or fees .
It ’s like a song that a musician can sample or remix for free .
This creates a community of global web programmers who can share and improve the platform .
The idea is rooted in community :
One person creates , another person improves , and the knowledge is widely shared .
If he understood open source , Glenn Beck might well denounce it as a socialist practice .
Open source as a concept goes beyond software .
Its political analogy , " open politics , " reflects core values which The Nation has long advocated : government that is transparent , open and rooted in the public interest .
Applied to political organizing , co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum and former Nation editor Micah Sifry summarized in a 2004 Nation article , " open source would mean opening up participation in planning and implementation to the community , letting competing actors evaluate the value of your plans and actions , being able to shift resources away from bad plans and bad planners and toward better ones , and expecting more of participants in return .
It would mean moving away from egocentric organizations and toward network - centric organizing . "
This past February a " good government " manifesto in The Nation by Lawrence Lessig , author of the book Free Culture expanded on the idea of open politics , and for three years The Nation ‘s Net Movement correspondent Ari Melber has reported on the intersection of technology and transparency in government .
The specific platform we ’re using for TheNation.com , Drupal , has a progressive lineage as well .
Described as " Software to Power the Left " by new media thinker David Cohn , Drupal was the foundation for the groundbreaking " DeanSpace " online community in 2004 , and has since been used and improved by dozens of leading progressive advocacy groups .
Today Drupal powers the websites of publications like The New Republic , Mother Jones and The Economist , and provides the content management platform for a little site called WhiteHouse.gov .
( The decision for The White House to go open source was controversial – Nancy Scola of Tech President had a good post detailing why it was such a powerful statement . )
What , if anything , does this mean for TheNation.com readers ?
The great thing about Drupal for a news organization is the flexibility that a public , continuously evolving platform provides .
If we wanted to build an interactive package to amplify a groundbreaking investigation , it used to take days .
Now there are thousands of programmers who can build it fast – or have already built it .
If we want to change the layout of our homepage or special section to reflect the significance of an unanticipated breaking news event , it used to take three weeks .
Now it takes three clicks .
And , beyond the practical and technological benefits , going open source was a political act for The Nation — an embrace of transparency and community .
We hope that others will choose it too .
Watch this short video for a succinct introduction to Drupal and the notion of an open - source community and let us know what you think of our new website in the blog ’s comments field or relaunch@thenation.com .
The Exegesis includes details of visionary experiences he says he had
The journals of sci - fi author Philip K Dick will be published next year .
The Exegesis , much anticipated by fans of the writer , will come out in autumn 2011 , publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt revealed .
Dick , who died in 1982 at the age of 53 , had 44 novels published .
His first was Solar Lottery in 1955 .
He is best known for works including The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? - the basis of 1982 film Blade Runner .
Other films based on Dick 's books include Total Recall and Minority Report .
Dick 's journals include descriptions of a series of " visions and auditions " he says he experienced .
It would be hard to imagine a better Google story .
If the company 's own web services somehow outed the most intimate secrets of CEO Eric Schmidt - a man who says net privacy is only for miscreants - that would surely be the Google story to end all Google stories .
But a comeuppance of such epic proportions seems too much to ask .
Today 's story will do just fine .
Last month , when Mountain View launched its Google Buzz social networking service , US deputy CTO Andrew McLaughlin was among those who belatedly realized that the Tweetbookish Gmail add - on had publicly exposed the people he emails and chats with the most .
So says the Washington - obsessed blog , Big Government .
And it was kind enough to provide screenshots .
You can see them here .
On one level , this is amusing because McLaughlin is officially the country 's chief internet brain , the man charged with bringing the so - called Web 2.0 revolution to Barack Obama 's federal government .
As Big Government points out , McLaughlin works in Obama 's Office of Science and Technology Policy , whose mission includes “ safeguarding the privacy of every American ...[ by ] holding businesses accountable for violations of personal privacy . "
But the story resonates on an entirely different level when you consider that McLaughlin joined the Obama administration after serving as Google 's chief lobbyist - its head of global public policy .
And according to those screenshots posted by Big Government , Google Buzz outed countless Google employees as among McLaughlin 's most contacted contacts .
The blog counts 28 Google employees in his contacts list , including several top Google lobbyists and lawyers .
Which is just the sort of thing McLaughlin's ( many ) critics were concerned about when he was appointed as deputy CTO .
As the news broke that McLaughlin had left his Google post for the federal government , public advocates called on Obama to halt the appointment , howling that the new President was backtracking on an executive order intended to lock the " revolving door " between the executive branch and corporate lobbyists .
" Given Mr. McLaughlin ’s role over the years at Google , and most recently his position with its political action committee , any post at the White House would violate the intent of your executive order , " read a letter from the Center for Digital Democracy and the consumer watchdog known as Consumer Watchdog .
" As Google ’s Director of Global Public Policy , Mr. McLaughlin led a team of corporate policy advocates working to influence a wide range of issues in the United States and globally .
Simply put , he has been responsible for Google ’s worldwide lobbying efforts . "
As Fortune examined in an October 2009 feature entitled " Obama & Google ( a love story ) , " the administration 's Mountain View ties run deep .
Googlers were among the biggest supporters of the Obama campaign , donating roughly $ 803,000 according to OpenSecrets.org .
Only Microsoft and Goldman Sachs employees gave more .
After the election , McLaughlin worked for the Obama transition team full - time , taking leave from Google , while Eric Schmidt was appointed to the President Elect 's Transition Economic Advisory Board .
Schmidt and other top Googlers then contributed $ 25,000 apiece to the inauguration , and McLaughlin was one of several ex-Googlers eventually appointed to the administration , including former Google project manager Katie Stanton , who became the White House director of citizen participation .
Sonal Shah , former head of global development at Google.org , was put in charge of the White House Office of Social Innovation .
Meanwhile , Eric Schmidt now sits on Obama 's Council of Science and Technology Advisers .
Following Big Government 's post about McLaughlin's Gmail activity , Consumer Watchdog filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , seeking emails between the deputy CTO and his former employer .
" This shows what was wrong with Google Buzz in the first place , but it has also outed McLaughlin as maintaining ongoing ties with Google , " Consumer Watchdog 's John Simpson tells The Reg .
" It 's one thing if you go to a company and get a technology guy who 's buried in the company and bring him into government .
But McLaughlin was their top global lobbyist , peddling influence for the company around the world . "
And of course , there 's the added irony that McLaughlin is supposed to be guarding our net privacy .
It would seem he was displeased with the Google Buzz privacy setup .
But in showing his displeasure , he also seems intent on maintaining private conversations with all those Google employees on his contacts list .
" By default , Buzz adds the people you e-mail most as your ‘ followers ’ , and then lists them on your public Google Profile Page , " he wrote in a , well , Google Buzz post , according to Big Government .
" In other words , Google exposes the people you e-mail most , by default , to the world .
That violates my sense of expectations - I expect the list of people I e-mail most to be kept private .
What should I do ?
I guess I do n’t really have an option other than turning off Buzz .
Any other ideas ? ”
McLaughlin then goes to make a " feature request " of the Buzz development team , asking for a way to privately contact his " followers " - i.e. , the list of people compiled from his email and chat contacts .
" I want to post something to my followers , but I do n't want it to appear on my public profile .
But when I choose ' Private . '
I get a list of contact groups , none of which is ' Followers . '
Under ' Private , ' there should [ be ] a choice for ' Followers , ' dynamically updated as I add or delete . "
Google has since modified the Buzz privacy settings , after complaints from privacy advocates , the press , and apparently Google employees .
But this we knew .
What we do n't know is the details of McLaughlin 's ongoing relationship with Google - or to what extent he 's committed to " holding the company accountable " for its violation of Americans ' personal privacy - including his own .
Thus Consumer Watchdog 's FOIA request .
This story may get even better . ®
Bootnote
Actually , it does get better .
The most amusing aspect of Andrew McLaughlin 's most contacted list is that it includes Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales .
We can only hope " Jimbo " has no serious influence on American internet policy .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says he 's quitting office and bringing to a close the Labour Party 's 13 - year hold on power , as his two chief rivals sealed a coalition deal after the country 's inconclusive election .
Enlarge By Leon Neal , AFP / Getty Images Conservative Party chief David Cameron struck a deal with Nick Clegg , leader of the third - placed Liberal Democrats .
LONDON ( AP )  Britain woke up to a new political era Wednesday with the first coalition government since World War II an unlikely marriage between the Conservative Party and the left - leaning Liberal Democrats
With a handshake , smiles and waves , the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed his new coalition partner , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , outside the shiny black door at 10 Downing Street and set off on the business of running the country .
Cameras flashed .
The alliance was necessary because no party won a majority of parliamentary seats in last week 's national vote .
Britons struggling to make ends meet during a punishing recession have been enraged at politicians of all stripes after a damaging lawmakers ' expense scandal last year .
The government will immediately begin tackling Britain 's record $ 236 billion deficit .
It is still unclear whether the Liberal Democrats will back the Conservatives ' plan to begin immediate spending cuts a punishing course of action that is n't likely to win praise from the electorate .
One of the first calls of congratulation to the new prime minister came from President Obama , an acknowledgment of Britain 's most important bilateral relationship .
Obama invited Cameron to visit Washington this summer .
The 43 - year - old Cameron became Britain 's youngest prime minister in almost 200 years the last was Lord Liverpool at 42 in 1812 after cementing a coalition deal with the third - place Liberal Democrats .
Clegg and four other Liberal Democrats received Cabinet posts .
A number of other Liberal Democrats would receive junior posts .
Both Cameron and Clegg have acknowledged that Labour in power for the last 13 years was too closely tied to Washington 's interests .
Both men back the Afghanistan mission , but Cameron hopes to withdraw British troops within five years .
Clegg has said he 's uneasy at a rising death toll .
Leaner coffers may also mean less money to enter foreign - led military operations .
Relations with European neighbors could also become problematic .
Cameron 's party is deeply skeptical over cooperation in Europe and has withdrawn from an alliance with the parties of Germany 's Angela Merkel and France 's Nicolas Sarkozy .
Clegg , once a member of the European parliament , has long been pro-European .
Once described as sandal - wearing hippie academics , Clegg 's Liberal Democrats emerge from the political fringe to the top rung of government .
Among the most visible will be Vince Cable , who will take an as yet unspecified post in charge of Britain 's banks , the BBC reported .
Labour , meanwhile , took steps to regroup , with the maneuvering underway for the job of party leader after former Prime Minister Gordon Brown resigned Tuesday .
David Miliband , the former foreign secretary , has emerged as a top candidate and has earned the backing of another early favorite , former Home Secretary Alan Johnson .
Brown 's deputy Harriet Harman is interim Labour leader until a formal leadership vote takes place .
The agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , reached over five tense days of negotiation , delivered Britain 's first coalition government since World War II .
" This is a genuine compromise between the parties , " said William Hague , the new foreign secretary .
" There are many things the Liberal Democrats have had to swallow that are very difficult for them , just as there are some things like holding a referendum on a new voting system that are very difficult for the Conservative Party to accept . "
Cameron and Clegg agreed to a pact after the Conservative Party won the most seats in Britain 's May 6 election , but fell short of winning a majority of seats in Parliament .
Cameron 's Conservatives said senior lawmaker George Osborne will serve as Treasury chief , and lawmaker Liam Fox as defense secretary .
The coalition has already agreed on a five - year , fixed - term Parliament the first time Britain has had the date of its next election decided in advance .
Both sides have made compromise , and Cameron has promised Clegg a referendum on his key issue : reform of Britain 's electoral system aimed at creating a more proportional system .
" Nick Clegg and I are both political leaders who want to put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and for the national interest , " Cameron said Tuesday .

Crude oil spread through fragile US marshlands Thursday , a month after a drilling rig blast released a devastating spill that now threatens Florida , Cuba and even beyond .
Oil has been pouring into the Gulf of Mexico since the massive April 20 explosion on the BP - leased Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 and ruptured an underwater well pipe .
While British Petroleum said Thursday that a tube was now siphoning away 3,000 barrels of oil a day from the leak , a nightmare scene was unfolding in Louisiana wetlands .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The day that we have all been fearing is upon us today , ” Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said Wednesday after seeing thick oil washing into the state ’s coastal marshlands .
Crude is also being dragged towards Florida ’s popular tourist beaches and fragile coral reefs , by an oceanic current that could wash oil ashore on the state ’s coastline in as little as six days , before carrying it up the US East Coast and even into the Gulf Stream .
The grim picture produced rare cooperation between the United States and Cuba as diplomats from the two nations discussed potential risks , as well as the cause of the spill and its projected movement .
Oil in the so - called Loop Current could cause tremendous damage to a wide range of marine life , experts warned .
“ The Loop Current is a super - highway carrying babies of a wide array of fishes and other kinds of marine life from their spawning zones to the places where they will ultimately grow up , ” Environmental Defense Fund chief ocean scientist Doug Rader told AFP .
ADVERTISEMENT
In Louisiana , the damage was already being seen , with Jindal telling reporters that “ heavy oil ” had entered the marshlands .
“ It ’s already here , but we know more is coming . ”
Louisiana biologists said they had rescued an endangered Kemp ’s Ridley sea turtle whose exterior was heavily oiled , the first found so far .
Oil samples from the turtle , rescued on Tuesday , were being analyzed to determine whether they came from the spill , officials said .
South of Venice , the seaport where BP has established its response headquarters , oil was seeping into the marshes at a rapid pace .
ADVERTISEMENT
Shiny tar balls were caught in thickets of reeds where crabs swarmed about , their shells painted orange by the crude .
In some spots , a thick blanket of oil hung at the bottom of the marsh .
Earlier , European Space Agency satellites showed oil being pulled into the powerful clockwise - moving Loop Current that joins the Gulf Stream , the northern hemisphere ’s most important ocean current system .
ADVERTISEMENT
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the main US agency monitoring the spill , agreed that a small portion of the slick had entered the current “ in the form of light to very light sheens . ”
But it tried to temper fears , saying the oil may never reach Florida and if it does , it “ would be highly weathered ” with evaporation and chemical dispersants having “ significantly ” reduced the volume .
Rader warned it was “ inevitable ” that the cocktail of oil and chemical dispersants would eventually make it to Florida , washing up on beaches on the southeastern US coast .
ADVERTISEMENT
Cuba ’s southwestern coast , home to major coral and mangrove systems , as well as a nursery area that supports much of western Caribbean marine wildlife , is also at threat .
BP , which is continuing its efforts to siphon up as much of the oil as possible via a mile - long suction tube , said Thursday it was recovering some 3,000 barrels of crude a day .
The firm estimates that some 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , a day of crude is spewing from the wreckage of the Deepwater Horizon rig , although independent experts warn the flow rate could be at least 10 times higher .
BP , which has claimed the environmental impact of the spill would be “ very modest ” , agreed Wednesday to a US lawmaker ’s demand for a live video feed of the oil leak , which could help scientists better assess the flow ’s rate .
ADVERTISEMENT
BP hopes to stop the noxious flow with a so - called “ top kill ” operation in about a week , in which heavy drilling fluids would be injected into the well to stem the oil flow , followed by a cement operation to seal it up permanently .
With concerns mounting over lax federal oversight of the offshore oil drilling industry , top US Senate Democrats urged President Barack Obama to order “ immediate and enhanced inspections ” of drilling in US waters .
“ As the Gulf Coast continues to be threatened by the lasting effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster , we are deeply concerned that this accident could be repeated elsewhere , ” they wrote to Obama .

More Light Presbyterians are a group working for the full inclusion and membership of Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgendered people .
We march in the Houston Pride Parade every year .
We also have a huge organic garden that donates produce to a local food pantry .
For the last twenty years or so , we have provided families living with AIDS a " Christmas Basket " which contains two weeks of food for a family of four .
This last December we fed seventy two families .
We are a small church that feels like a big family .
Our worship services often have banjos , guitars , trombones , tamborines and accordions .
I have been running the church music for the last few years and joke that our motto , taken from the Muppet Movie should be , " They do n't look like Presbyterians to me . "
I love that my daughter , age 10 , had this to say to the news today :
" Some churches say sit down and we 'll tell you a story , " Rosy said .
" But in our church we say , ' Do you have any questions ?
Would you like to learn about this ? ' "
We are active as a SOCIAL JUSTICE Church .
Last night about 11 pm an arsonist burned my church building down .
We lost everything : two buildings , all our furniture , books , hymnals , a new piano , a wall of crosses from around the world and so many other things .
Our building is gone but our church is strong .
I do n't know why someone decided to burn my church building .
I 'm angry and I want answers .
I know that there are people actively campaigning against churches who are fighting for social justice .
I know that violence against progressive churches has become more common .
I also know that we will meet in the parking lot Sunday morning and worship .
We will find a way forward and we will continue with the work we are called to do .
Sunday morning I 'll tune my guitar , call the hymns and we will sing .
If you are in Houston Sunday morning drop by and lend a voice .

Audio : Firing gays is bright and brilliant ?
by Jeremy Hooper
It 's not that talk show host Penna Dexter is so much concerned about her tangible right to discriminate , should the Employment Nondiscrimination Act ( ENDA ) become law .
Np , no -- she 's really more worried that we 're going to become a " bland " America that loses its " color and individuality " :

* Audio source : Penna Dexter 's " Point of View " radio program , 5/25/10 ( full podcast can be downloaded for free on iTunes )
Maybe not the best idea for those who are opposing nondiscrimination that 's modeled in the same vein as the 1964 Civil Rights
Act to bring color to people 's minds .
Just a thought .

A month ago , it appeared that NFL players had learned from the experiences of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger .
Memorial Day weekend came and went without a single arrest .
But that does n’t mean it came without any incidents .
Bengals running back Cedric Benson has been arrested in Austin , Texas for an assault that allegedly occurred on May 30 , according to Tom Plohetski of Statesman.com .
He allegedly punched a bar employee in the face at Annie ’s West .
Benson faces charges of assault with injury .
He has posted bail .
A top -five pick of the Bears in 2005 , Benson ’s tenure in Chicago ended two years ago , after Benson was arrested for drunk boating and drunk driving within a relatively short time frame .
The latest incident comes at a time when Benson hopes to get a new contract from the Bengals .
Benson joined the Bengals during the 2008 season , and he played well enough to land a two - year deal , after testing the free - agent market .
He ’s due to earn a base salary of $ 2.65 million in 2010 .
In the Daily Mail Chelsea and Manchester City are being " offered the chance to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic " , in much the same way the Mill was this week " offered the chance " to buy a sliver of an as yet unbuilt Andalucian golf - carpark resort via an exclusively mailshot glossy mag idiot - lure .
Pini Zahavi is touting football 's equivalent of Susan Boyle around for slightly more than £ 40 m .
City are most likely to fall for it .
" Ibrahimovic has been instrumental in securing victories , even in the last few games .
To say so lightly that this player does not work , that he is not worth it , is to have a short memory , " Johann Cruyff sales - pattered yesterday , painting the languid Swede 's tyres black and infusing him with the welcoming aroma of baking bread .
Didier Drogba has invited Fernando Torres to sign for Chelsea in a sensational £ 70 m deal , albeit in a slightly insulting way .
" Of course I would welcome Torres .
If there is a chance for him to come here , he will be welcome , because any help is welcome ! " he added , leaving £ 28.50 on top of the fridge and asking if he can stay a bit longer to do some ironing .
Occasionally irresistible Tottenham goal - moocher Roman Pavlyuchenko and the often overlooked Yossi Benayoun could be about to move in a swap deal .
Lokomotiv Moscow are also interested in Pavlyuchenko .
" The situation has changed , " ejaculated spunky Lokomotiv head coach Yuri Semin .
" I 'm afraid it will be difficult to get Pavlyuchenko . "
Leeds have finally given up on keeping Jermaine Beckford , who wo n't be anywhere near as good somewhere else but will definitely make more money in return for playing only 10 times a season and being passed about the Premier League 's lower - mid tier every other transfer window a bit like Jason Roberts .
" He has an unusual agent and it's not easy to have discussions with him , " Ken Bates says .
In the Daily Mirror Everton are planning " a stunning swoop " for strangely likeable goal - munchkin Craig Bellamy .
Manchester United and Arsenal are " on red alert " in the hope that this will prove attractive to Mikel Arteta , whose contract talks are floundering .
And flimsy utility poseur Michael Mancienne , who has essentially never really played for Chelsea and gets constantly farmed out on loan to lesser clubs where he only looks so - so , has detected that " it might be time to leave Chelsea " .
In the Sun Alex McLeish is going to buy scuttling Lanco - Franco winger Charles N'Zogbia .
McLeish is also after Venusian left - back Paul Konchesky and flailing youth Ben Foster .
Joe Hart is already on his way back to Manchester City .
" It 's sad .
My orders were that I went back , " he said , removing his spiked metal helmet , hurling his Luger into the River Volga and beginning the long march back through the parched Russian wheat fields .
Stoke plan to make a £ 5 m bid for West Ham 's Mark Noble and also " boot out at least nine players this summer " .
" I want a leaner squad next year , " Tony Pulis said , grabbing a handful of James Beattie 's muffin top .
Portsmouth want Gus Poyet to be their new manager if Avram Grant takes over at West Ham .
And Aruna Dindane may yet escape from the twin half - nelsons of Blackburn and Wolves and make a dash for Panathinaikos .
" My agent informed me about Panathinaikos – I 'm really interested , " he said , making an interested face .
Arsène Wenger wants to " add one player , and add more defensive strength to our team " , a slightly gratuitous use of the word " more " .
Portly fair dinkum Aussie goalhangeroo Robbie Fowler says it 's time for Rafael Benítez to go .
" It 's a big club and no one is bigger than the club , " Fowler said much too loudly while consuming charred meat .
" I want Liverpool to do well and whether Rafa 's there or someone else , I do n't mind . "
Also , " fans of Manchester United were last night trying to work out which ex-star burned his TACKLE with hair removal cream – and were pointing the finger at CRISTIANO RONALDO . "
Brian McClair , of all people , has been going on about this in his United magazine column .
The Mill thinks it 's a toss up between Denis Irwin and Steve Bruce .
On Goal.com Inter striker Mario Balotelli will not be joining Manchester City in the summer , according to his agent .
" This possibility does not exist , " shiny - suited Latino Mr 10 % Mino Raiola told popular ice cream flavour Tuttomercatoweb .
Plus there 's the EXCLUSIVE news that Valencia midfielder Ever Banega wants to sign for Liverpool .
The Argentinian midfielder , who appears to be a bit of a nutcase , is 21 and would cost £ 8.5 m .
There 's something about " a fairly embarrassing ' video scandal ' " too , but the Mill is too prudish to Google it .
By all means go ahead .

How To Prepare Your Kids For Post 2.0
Introduction
MetaFun is a program to compile functional programs into C++ template metaprograms .
It allows you to write programs in the very Haskell - like language Kiff ( for Keep It Fun & Functional ) , and then use them as compile - time C++ metaprograms .
You can download the latest version of MetaFun from GitHub .
Kiff :
The input language
MetaFun 's input language , Kiff , is a simplified version of Haskell .
It supports the following features of Haskell :
Algebraic data types ( data )
) (!)
Type synonyms ( type )
) Declared types for definitions
Parametric polymorphism ( but not typeclasses )
typeclasses )
The following builtin keywords : let ... in ... (! ) λ ... -> ... if ... then ... else ... Special [ x , y ] syntax for lists
( note that features marked with a (! ) are not actually supported by the MetaFun compiler yet . )
Kiff also includes the following primitives , mapped to the native C++ operators and types :
The types Bool and Int
and The bool literals True and False
and Numeric literals
Bool operators && , || and !
, and Int comparison : == , != , < , <= , >= , >
, , , , , Int operators : + , - , * , / , %
To give you an idea of what Kiff code looks like , here 's a possible definition of sum :
foldl :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] -> a foldl f x [ ] = x foldl f x ( y:ys ) = foldl f ( f x y ) ys add x y = x + y --
The builtin operators are not first - class functions sum xs = foldl add 0 xs -- Currying is not yet supported
The compiler
The C++ code generated by the compiler consists of a bunch of template structs , one for each definition .
Constructors are represented as structs with template parameters for constructor parameters .
Bools and Ints are boxed .
For reference , here 's MetaFun 's C++ output for the above code of sum :
template < int > struct Int ; template < bool > struct Bool ; struct nil ; template < class , class > struct cons ; template < template < class , class > class , class , class > struct foldl ; template < class , class > struct add ; template < class > struct sum ; template < int x > struct
Int { static const int v = x ; } ; template < bool b > struct Bool { static const bool v = b ; } ; template < template < class , class > class f , class x > struct foldl< f , x , nil > { typedef x v ; } ; template < template < class , class > class f , class x , class y , class ys > struct foldl< f , x , cons < y , ys > > { typedef typename foldl< f , typename f< x , y >: :v , ys >: :v v ; } ; template < class x , class y > struct add { typedef Int< ( x : : v ) + ( y : : v ) > v ; } ; template < class xs > struct sum { typedef typename foldl< add , Int< 0 > , xs >::v v ; } ;
Caveats
MetaFun is the result of me spending a week in bed because of a knee injury , and toying around with the concept of an easy - to - use language to write compile - time programs .
The fact that it was thrown together in a couple of days shows : MetaFun is but a proof - of - concept demo .
It 's barely finished enough to compile the 9 - digit solution program below .
Here 's a list of some notable known problems :
No currying in function calls
No support for lambda expressions
The type checker does n't actually support type synonyms
Zero optimization : Local definitions are lifted even when they could be local nested structs in C ++
A detailed example
The following program solves the 9 - digit problem using a simple backtracking algorithm .
In fact , it is the result of a direct , manual backwards translation of Károly Lőrentey 's solution , and was the motivating example behind writing MetaFun .
A pair of new surveys from ChangeWave show that demand for the iPad has grown since the device hit the market in early April , while 91 percent of those who already bought one are satisfied with their purchase .
The results of the two surveys conducted in May were revealed Thursday by ChangeWave .
One polled 3,174 consumers to measure future demand for the iPad , while a second survey of 153 new iPad owners set out to discover their impressions of the device .
In the larger study of general consumers , 7 percent of respondents said they are " very likely " to buy an iPad , while another 13 percent said they are " somewhat likely . "
That 's the highest level of consumer interest ChangeWave has seen in the iPad to date .
In February , a previous survey from the same company found that 4 percent of respondents were " very likely " to buy , and 9 percent said they were " somewhat likely . "
While those numbers were lower than the current totals , they were also higher than the pre-release demand for the iPhone based on a 2007 survey .
Among those polled in ChangeWave 's May survey , 245 identified themselves as currently owning an e-reader .
Among those , 62 percent currently have an Amazon Kindle , versus 16 percent for the iPad — just weeks after the hardware 's release .
A major change from the February survey came in the form of content read on e-readers .
The introduction of the iPad resulted in spikes of newspaper , magazine and blog reading on portable e-readers .
Both online newspaper and magazine reading were up 7 percent , while blogs increased 1 percent .
Half of those who own an iPad said they read newspapers on their device , compared to just 14 percent of all other e-reader owners .
And 38 percent of iPad owners read magazines , compared to 11 percent of other e-reader owners .
" In short , " the ChangeWave study said , " more than 3 times as many iPad e-Reader owners say they read Newspapers and Magazines as do all other e-Reader owners . "
ChangeWave 's survey of 153 new iPad owners found that 74 percent said they are " very satisfied " with their purchase , and another 17 percent are " somewhat satisfied . "
Just 2 percent said they were unsatisfied .
The American way of war is a marvelously ingenious thing .
And thoroughly modern too .
No more of that " do n't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes " jazz ; your modern " warfighter " ( they are n't called " soldiers " anymore , you know ) prefers to view his targets through , say , a computer screen safely ensconced back in the Homeland or thousands of feet in the sky , or else through the unearthly greenish glow of night - vision scopes .
And open combat ?
Forget it .
The new American way is the sneak attack on civilian homes in the dead of night .
You creep up , you break in , you cap a few ragheads , then you run away .
What glory !
What magnificent valor !
The Washington Post reports on yet another glorious page in the annals of the exceptional nation " intended by God to be a light set on a hill to serve as a beacon of hope and Christian charity to a lost and dying world . "
It 's the usual story .
Secret " warfighters " suddenly attack a civilian compound in the middle of the night .
This , not surprisingly , provokes a few shots from some of the inhabitants , who have no idea who is attacking their home .
The superior firepower of the beacons of hope and Christian charity quickly overcome the piddling arms of the demonic heathens , however , and in a trice , there are dead gook – sorry , raghead – bodies all around .
Including children – you 've got to have children in your body count these days , if you want to be a thoroughly modern Christian beacon warfighter .
Then you and your brave band of secret warriors run away and prepare for the next bold raid .
Naturally , the local losers come out and boo - hoo - hoo over their dead relatives , as if no one had ever seen their son shot to death in front of their eyes before .
They trot out all their evidence that the victims had nothing to do with the " insurgents " ( which is what your modern warfighter calls anyone who objects to the presence of armed foreigners prowling all over their land ) , they keen and wail and do all the other animalistic stuff that primitives do when one of the pack snuffs it .
" Oh , I lost my son , oh my son , my precious son , " etc. , etc. – as if there 's not a dozen more when he came from ; you know how those people breed .
But anyway , here 's the beauty part : if the local dorky darkies start to complain , you just say , " Hey man , we came under fire !
Those monkeys shot at us when we came sneaking up on their house in the middle of the night with our guns drawn .
That proves they were bad guys .
We had to take them out . "
That 's it .
That 's the drill .
It happens virtually every week now in Afghanistan – just as it happened time and again in Iraq , back when some guy named Stanley McChrystal was in charge of covert ops for that evil , reactionary throwback , George W. Bush .
Whatever happened to old Stan anyway ?
Oh yeah ; the nice , progressive , thoroughly modern Barack Obama put him in charge of the whole shooting match in Afghanistan , as well as the not - so - secret war of assassination in Pakistan .
And oddly enough , the slaughter of civilians in both of these target countries has been rising ever since .
But hey , that 's just how we roll nowadays .
That 's the American way of war .
Creep , sneak , kill , run , lie – repeat .
Sure , it only makes things worse , creates more enemies , keeps the wars going .
But is n't that the point ?
Check it out , baby : they 're piling an extra $ 33.5 billion of prime war pork on top of the mountain of Terror War funding already laid out for this year !
And you need a whole lot of blood to wash down that meat – and a whole lot of new enemies to make sure the feast never ends .

X - ray dose up to 20 times higher than originally estimated – more evidence that devices are dangerous , illegal , and need to be removed from airports immediately
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , June 29 , 2010
Airport body scanners could lead to an increase in skin cancers according to scientists at Columbia University , who warn that the dose emitted by the naked x-ray devices could be up to 20 times higher than originally estimated , in another clear example of how the scanners are completely illegal , dangerous to public health , and need to be removed immediately .
Dr David Brenner , head of Columbia University ’s centre for radiological research , warns that children and people with gene mutations whose bodies are less able to repair damage to their DNA are most at risk .
“ If all 800 million people who use airports every year were screened with X - rays then the very small individual risk multiplied by the large number of screened people might imply a potential public health or societal risk .
The population risk has the potential to be significant , ” said Brenner .
Brenner ’s research shows that the scanners will likely contribute to an increase in a common type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma which affects the head and neck .
“ If there are increases in cancers as a result of irradiation of children , they would most likely appear some decades in the future .
It would be prudent not to scan the head and neck , ” added Brenner .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Brenner has urged medical authorities to look at his work , pointing to the dangerous notion of mass scanning millions of people without proper oversight .
“ There really is no other technology around where we ’re planning to X - ray such an enormous number of individuals .
It ’s really unprecedented in the radiation world , ” said Brenner .
Similar concerns to those explored in the Columbia University study were voiced back in February by the influential Inter - Agency Committee on Radiation Safety , who warned in a report that the scanners increase the risk of cancer and birth defects and should not be used on pregnant women or children .
Despite governments claiming that backscatter x-ray systems produce radiation too low to pose a threat , the organization concluded in their report that governments must justify the use of the scanners and that a more accurate assessment of the health risks is needed .
Pregnant women and children should not be subject to scanning , according to the report , adding that governments should consider “ other techniques to achieve the same end without the use of ionizing radiation . ”
“ The Committee cited the IAEA ’s 1996 Basic Safety Standards agreement , drafted over three decades , that protects people from radiation .
Frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can lead to cancer and birth defects , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , ” reported Bloomberg .
In the United States , people can refuse the body scanner and opt for an aggressive and intrusive hand - search , but people traveling out of the UK and other areas of Europe do n’t even get the choice – they are forced to go through the scanner if asked and cannot refuse or they are banned from traveling .
Despite the media reporting universal acceptance of the scanners , in reality 600 formal complaints had been made about the devices in the first two months of their usage alone .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The alarming health concerns surrounding body scanners have been equaled by the shaky legality of the devices .
In the UK , the scanners break child porn laws which forbid the production of indecent images of children , but the UK transport authorities have broken the law and mandated that children be required to pass through the machines .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) also wrote a letter to the UK government warning that the scanners broke privacy laws .
As we have highlighted , not only do the body scanners pose health risks but they also violate the fundamental human right of the innocent to be protected against strip - searches .
Despite official denials that the images produced by the devices show details of genitalia , journalists who have investigated trials of the technology have reported that details of sexual organs are “ eerily visible ” .
Indeed , as we have previously highlighted , when the scanners were first introduced at Australian airports in 2008 it was admitted that the X - ray backscatter devices do n’t work properly unless the genitals of people going through them are visible .
“ It will show the private parts of people , but what we ’ve decided is that we ’re not going to blur those out , because it severely limits the detection capabilities , ” said Melbourne Airport ’s Office of Transport Security manager Cheryl Johnson .
Attempts to keep this under wraps by lying about the images produced are an effort to head off challenges to the legality of the devices .
Historically , civil lawsuits where an individual has been strip searched by a member of the opposite sex have proven to be successful in North America .
Courts have consistently found that strip searches are only legal when performed on a person who has already been found guilty of a crime or on arrestees pending trial where a reasonable suspicion has to exist that they are carrying a weapon .
Subjecting masses of people to blanket strip searches in airports reverses the very notion of innocent until proven guilty .
Barring people from flying and essentially treating them like terrorists for refusing to be humiliated by the virtual strip search is a clear breach of the basic human right of freedom of movement .
Several examples of airport security staff abusing the use of the devices have already come to light since their introduction earlier this year .
Indian film star Shahrukh Khan told a BBC talk show that naked images of his body from the scanner were printed out and circulated by airport staff at Heathrow in London .
Heathrow denied the claim but Khan himself never retracted the story , and had no apparent motive for making it up .
Heathrow authorities were unable to deny a later example of the scanners being abused , when it emerged that a Heathrow worker had perved over a naked image of a female colleague after she passed through one of the devices , before commenting , “ I love those gigantic tits ” .
Jo Margetson , 29 , reported John Laker , 25 , to the police after she had entered the x-ray machine by mistake and Laker took the image before making lewd comments .
In Miami , a TSA worker in Miami attacked a colleague who had made fun of his small penis after he passed through a scanner device .
The story again emphasized the fact that authorities were brazenly lying in claiming that the images produced by the devices did not show intimate details of genitalia .

One of those " WTF " moments !!!
Information Floyd Landis recently gave to the United States Anti-Doping Agency about how cyclists have and still are getting around the biological passport analysis system could have an immediate impact on the sport , according to at least two people with direct knowledge of the system .
Michael Ashenden , a Australian exercise physiologist and blood doping researcher who sits on the nine - man independent panel that reviews biological passport data for UCI ( cycling 's international governing body ) , and Dr. Don Catlin , an anti-doping researcher who pioneered methods for steroid detection , both told ESPN.com that Landis ' information could be crucial in understanding how cyclists try to beat the system .
That biological passport , which monitors blood values and urine samples over time in order to build evidence of blood manipulation and is financed in large part by the sport 's elite tier of teams , was put into place to supplement traditional drug testing .
Yet according to Landis , teams and riders with enough monetary resources and sophisticated medical advice knew how to circumvent the biological passport even before its official implementation in 2007 .
Landis told ESPN.com last week that during the two or three years leading up to his 2006 Tour de France victory -- subsequently nullified after he tested positive for synthetic testosterone -- he and some of his fellow riders combined strategically timed transfusions and microdoses of EPO ( erythropoietin , a red blood cell booster ) in order to keep their blood values constant rather than spiking and dipping .
The main difference between their methodology and that of riders in the 1990s , Landis said , was riders of his era learned to inject EPO intravenously rather than subcutaneously , as a cancer patient or someone with another grave illness would do .
When EPO is injected under the skin , it is absorbed first into soft tissue and released into the bloodstream gradually , prolonging its therapeutic effects .
Injecting EPO intravenously has the same effect of boosting red blood cell count and improving oxygen processing capacity .
However , the drug disperses more quickly in the bloodstream and thus becomes undetectable sooner -- especially if riders dilute their blood with an intravenous drip of saline solution or simply by drinking a lot of water after injecting it .
Roughly speaking , the biological passport is designed to catch riders who cheat based on fluctuations in their baseline blood values .
One fundamental element is the ratio of their " young " or new red blood cells , called reticulocytes , compared with mature cells .
When an athlete transfuses his own blood , the body responds by slowing down production of reticulocytes .
Landis said riders brought the level of red blood cell production back to normal by microdosing with EPO during races on a nightly basis .

Dealing with negativity online can be tough , which was why we were all ears when Tim Ferriss , author of The Four Hour Work Week , took the stage at The Next Web ' 10 event in Amsterdam to discuss how to learn to love haters .
While Mashable recently offered you advice on how to deal with negative feedback specifically in the social media realm , Ferriss takes the concept a step further with advice on how to contend with — and benefit from — criticism across all platforms .
We caught up with Ferriss backstage at the event to find out more about his seven principles for dealing with haters .
Read on for some interesting ideas and let us know which work for you — as well as your own strategies — in the comments below .
1 . It does n't matter how many people do n't get it .
What matters is how many people do .
" It 's critical in social media , as in life , to have a clear objective and not to lose sight of that , " Ferriss says .
He argues that if your objective is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people or to change the world in some small way ( be it through a product or service ) , you only need to pick your first 1,000 fans — and carefully .
" As long as you 're accomplishing your objectives , that 1,000 will lead to a cascading effect , " Ferriss explains .
" The 10 million that do n't get it do n't matter . "
2. 10 % of people will find a way to take anything personally .
Expect it .
" People are least productive in reactive mode , " Ferriss states , before explaining that if you are expecting resistance and attackers , you can choose your response in advance , as opposed to reacting inappropriately .
This , Ferriss says , will only multiply the problem .
" Online I see people committing ' social media suicide ' all the time by one of two ways .
Firstly by responding to all criticism , meaning you 're never going to find time to complete important milestones of your own , and by responding to things that do n't warrant a response . "
This , says Ferriss , lends more credibility by driving traffic .
3 . " Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity . " ( Colin Powell )
" If you treat everyone the same and respond to everyone by apologizing or agreeing , you 're not going to be recognizing the best performers , and you 're not going to be improving the worst performers , " Ferriss says .
" That guarantees you 'll get more behavior you do n't want and less you do . "
That does n't mean never respond , Ferriss goes on to say , but be " tactical and strategic " when you do .
4 . " If you are really effective at what you do , 95 % of the things said about you will be negative . " ( Scott Boras )
" This principle goes hand - in - hand with number two , " Ferriss says .
" I actually keep this quote in my wallet because it is a reminder that the best people in almost any field are almost always the people who get the most criticism . "
The bigger your impact , explains Ferriss ( whose book is a New York Times , WSJ and BusinessWeek bestseller ) , and the larger the ambition and scale of your project , the more negativity you 'll encounter .
Ferriss jokes he has haters " in about 35 languages . "
5 . " If you want to improve , be content to be thought foolish and stupid . " ( Epictetus )
" Another way to phrase this is through a more recent quote from Elbert Hubbard , " Ferriss says .
" ' To avoid criticism , do nothing , say nothing , and be nothing . "
Ferriss , who holds a Guinness World Record for the most consecutive tango spins , says he has learned to enjoy criticism over the years .
Ferriss , using Roman philosophy to expand on his point , says : " Cato , who Seneca believed to be the perfect stoic , practiced this by wearing darker robes than was customary and by wearing no tunic .
He expected to be ridiculed and he was , he did this to train himself to only be ashamed of those things that are truly worth being ashamed of .
To do anything remotely interesting you need to train yourself to be effective at dealing with , responding to , even enjoying criticism ...
In fact , I would take the quote a step further and encourage people to actively pursue being thought foolish and stupid . "
6 . " Living well is the best revenge . " ( George Herbert )
" The best way to counter - attack a hater is to make it blatantly obvious that their attack has had no impact on you , " Ferriss advises .
" That , and [ show ] how much fun you 're having ! "
Ferriss goes on to say that the best revenge is letting haters continue to live with their own resentment and anger , which most of the time has nothing to do with you in particular .
" If a vessel contains acid and you pour some on an object , it 's still the vessel that sustains the most damage , " Ferriss says .
" Do n't get angry , do n't get even — focus on living well and that will eat at them more than anything you can do . "
7. Keep calm and carry on .
The slogan " Keep Calm and Carry On " was originally produced by the British government during the Second World War as a propaganda message to comfort people in the face of Nazi invasion .
Ferriss takes the message and applies it to today 's world .
" Focus on impact , not approval .
If you believe you can change the world , which I hope you do , do what you believe is right and expect resistance and expect attackers , " Ferriss concludes .
" Keep calm and carry on ! "

NEW ORLEANS 
In another serious setback in the effort to stem the flow of oil gushing from a well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico , BP engineers said Saturday that the “ top kill ” technique had failed and , after consultation with government officials , they had decided to move on to another strategy .
Doug Suttles , BP ’s chief operating officer for exploration and production , said at a news conference that the engineers would try once again to solve the problem with a containment cap and that it could take four to seven days for the device to be in place .
“ After three full days of attempting top kill , we now believe it is time to move on to the next of our options , ” Mr. Suttles said .
The abandonment of the top kill technique , the most ambitious effort yet to plug the well , was the latest in a series of failures .
First , BP failed in efforts to repair a blowout preventer with submarine robots .
Then its initial efforts to cap the well with a containment dome failed when it became clogged with a frothy mix of frigid water and gas .

In 1913 , [ with regional alcohol prohibition gaining popularity and dry politicians experiencing a boom ]
Congress overrode President William Howard Taft 's veto of something called the Webb - Kenyon Act , which outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages into a dry state … .
The override was followed by enactment of a national income tax authorized by the recently ratified 16th Amendment .
Until 1913 , the federal government had depended on liquor taxes for as much as 40 percent of its annual revenue .
" The chief cry against national Prohibition , " the ASL 's executive committee said in a policy statement that April , " has been that the government must have the revenue . "
But with an income tax replacing the levy on liquor , that argument evaporated , and the ASL could move beyond its piecemeal approach and declare its new goal : " National Prohibition , [ to ] be secured through the adoption of a Constitutional Amendment . "
CHICAGO – “ It ’s disappointing .
America is my home .
What ’s gone wrong ? ” asked Leroy Smith , a laid off Chicago bus driver .
“ I ’m through being patient .
We need the government to put us back to work now . ”
“ You ’re not alone in this fight .
So many people are laid off but sometimes you think you ’re the only one , ” said Darrell Jefferson , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 241 .
Over 1,100 transit workers were laid off in February that has crippled transit service and thrown families into crisis .
Smith and Jefferson were testifying to a Chicago Workers Rights Board hearing April 28 about the jobless and budget crisis gripping the city , state and nation .
“ The ATU is doing a great job of supporting others in their struggle .
The transit crisis is not just here .
It ’s a national problem .
ATU Local 241 will be in this fight , ” he said .
The Workers Rights Board heard a broad array of moving testimony from workers , veterans , immigrants and academics that illustrated in very stark and personal terms the horrible impact of the economic crisis .
Mel Rothenberg of the Chicago Economic Planning Group said 30 million working aged people are unemployed or underemployed .
Rothenberg said only the federal government can create jobs on a scale that is needed .
He called for jobs creation through a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) on Wall Street speculators .
A FTT of .25 % on stocks and .10 % on currency and debt trading could have raise $ 750 and $ 1.2 trillion during each of the past five years .
Eugene Cherry is an Iraq war vet .
He knows first hand the tribulations of hundreds of thousands of veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars into an economic crisis at home .
“ Companies are n’t as willing to hire you .
Many vets came back , but could n’t get their old jobs back , ” said Cherry , who like many vets has suffered from PTSD .
“ We ca n’t find jobs – there simply are none . ”
This has compounded the crisis among vets , who are suffering extremely high rates of suicide .
Cherry said the Veterans Administration is inadequate in dealing with veterans who come back with many issues .
The Obama Administration domestic spending freeze makes it impossible to help people in need .
The economic crisis is having a particularly sharp impact on disabled Americans , whose unemployment hovers at 80 % .
Donna Shaw , a member of Disabled Americans Want Work Now !
described how she was laid off from her bank job a year ago and has been unemployed since .
She said her employer refused to provide her with the things she needed to do her job .
“ The bank has deep pockets , but never provided a sign language interpreter for any of the mandatory weekly meetings and trainings , ” said Shaw .
“ This was a clear violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act . ”
Shaw said people with disabilities must struggle with discrimination in hiring and on the job .
The result is disabled Americans experience high levels of poverty .
The jobless crisis is also allowing employers to get away with union busting and threatening immigrant workers with deportation .
Mary Constantino worked as a bagger at Pete ’s Fresh Market for two years .
She got fed up with harassment and sexual discrimination on the job and along with her fellow workers turned to UFCW to organize her workplace .
“ I was fired for organizing .
This is so unjust .
All we wanted was better working conditions and better wages to provide for our families , ” she said .
“ They threaten to call ICE .
Many workers are afraid to denounce what happened , ” she said .
But Constantino like all the others who testified vows to fight for jobs at a living wage and with a voice at the workplace .
They are not afraid or intimidated .
“ I ’m not going to resign myself to a life of indentured servitude , which is what Wall Street is asking us to do , ” declared Stephanie DeBose , a carpenter and union member who has been unemployed for three years .
“ We have to get active and make our voices heard . ”

The new student loan law that passed in reconciliation is very popular and it's excellent policy :
Since the bank - based loan program began in 1965 , commercial banks like Sallie Mae and Nelnet have received guaranteed federal subsidies to lend money to students , with the government assuming nearly all the risk .
Democrats have long denounced the program , saying it fattened the bottom line for banks at the expense of students and taxpayers .
“ Why are we paying people to lend the government ’s money and then the government guarantees the loan and the government takes back the loan ? ” said Representative George Miller , Democrat of California and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee .
Well , we 're not anymore .
The new law cuts out the for - profit lenders in the middle , freeing up billions to go to students .
The right 's answer to that ?
“ The Democratic majority decided , well look , while we ’re at it , let ’s have another Washington takeover , ” said Senator Lamar Alexander , Republican of Tennessee and a former federal education secretary .
“ Let ’s take over the federal student loan program . ”
Yup .
" How dare the federal government take over the federal student loan program . "
They really do parody themselves .
​​Washington drug agents have illegally seized signed petitions for marijuana legalization , according to organizers of ballot initiative I -1068 .
Marijuana advocacy group Sensible Washington says it has learned that a dozen signed copies of the marijuana legalization initiative for Washington State of which it is the sponsor , were seized last week by the federally - funded WestNET drug task force .
Advocates say that the drug agents who seized the petitions are interfering with a constitutionally - protected legislative procedure .
“ Our estimate is that 2009 signatures are sitting in WestNET ’s offices in Port Orchard , apparently seized as ‘ evidence ’ during a series of raids against the North End Club 420 in Tacoma , ” said Sensible Washington campaign director and initiative co-author Philip Dawdy .
​” We have made repeated calls to WestNET ’s office , but have yet to receive any assurance that the task force ’s personnel have secured the signed petitions and that they plan to promptly return them to Sensible Washington , ” Dawdy said .
“ It proves how insane marijuana prohibition has gotten , that law enforcement would seized signed copies of I - 1068 as ‘ evidence ’ in a drug raid , ” Dawdy said .
“ The only thing they are evidence of is democracy in action , ” Dawdy said .
“ It is not a crime or evidence of a crime for citizens to sign a statewide initiative . ”
Sensible Washington is calling upon WestNET to immediately return the seized petitions to its offices at 3161 Elliott Avenue , Suite 340 , Seattle , WA 98121 , or to make other arrangements for the immediate delivery to Sensible Washington .

When Kathy and Michael Caisley started looking for a new home , they visited several condos and single - family homes .
" So many were brand - new , luxurious and unaffordable , " said Kathy Caisley , a city planner .
" Then there were a lot of generic , cottage - style homes ; we would have had to sacrifice the look we really wanted . "
What they really wanted was a sleek modular home like the ones they 'd been obsessing over in Dwell magazine , so they did some research .
" It seemed impossible , " added her husband , Michael Caisley , a video game sound designer .
" We figured it just was n't happening in Chicago . "
And for the most part , it is n't .
Prefab housing often conjures up images of double - wides and trailer parks or the mail - order homes Sears popularized in the early 1900s .
Overcoming the social stigmas associated with the homes , costs , as well as Chicago 's strict building codes have been deterrents for many designers .
But a friend introduced the Caisleys to Jeff Sommers , the owner of Square Root Architecture , who had the same dream .
Sommers is now at work on the Caisleys ' prefab , a modern home Sommers describes as eco-friendly and designed for urban installation and one , he hopes , will be a prototype for new affordable housing .
" If every one of these homes reduces the urban heat effect , improves water management and lowers gas and electric use by 50 percent — and you multiply that by hundreds or thousands — that 's a big impact , " he said .
The concept of prefabricated homes has taken off in many parts of the country , with 30 percent of new home construction in the past decade , either prefab or made with prefab components , according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Sommers , who plans to erect the Caisleys ' home this summer in the West Town neighborhood , has been working with Chicago zoning officials for more than two years .
" Safety is always the main concern , " said Bill McCaffrey , director of public affairs for the city Department of Buildings .
" Prefab homes must comply with Chicago building and inspection regulations .
The biggest issues are the copper pipes and electric conduits behind walls . "
Architect Michelle Kaufmann , who designed a prefab home on display at the Museum of Science and Industry , said that working in Chicago — even on an exhibit home — was a challenge .
But Mayor Richard Daley and Buildings Commissioner Richard Monocchio encourage green building , said McCaffrey .
And for the past year , Sommers and fellow architect Kate Votava have been working on a home for the Caisleys that meets Chicago 's code requirements .
For a traditional Chicago project , licensed installers and city inspectors visit the site at every stage ensuring that plumbing , mechanical and electrical components are up to code .
But construction for the prefab is being done out of state — at a factory in Middlebury , Ind . — so there is no city site to visit .
" This is a hybrid approach to prefab , " said Sommers .
" We are drywalling 90 percent in the factory and leaving those connection points visible for traditional inspections .
The city has been very willing to work with us . "
Tim Heppner , a consultant on the Chicago Green Homes Program , said the time is right for prefab in Chicago .
" We are starting to see the problems of pollution and people are saying , ' Wait a second .
All of the old ways of doing things got us into this mess .
We are looking for different ideas and willing to try something new , ' " Heppner said .
" I went over the drawings , and everything looks good from an environmental perspective . "
Heppner said of Sommers ' design , calling the architect a " pioneer " in Chicago .
" This project is an innovative look at an old idea and if it gets going will be a really affordable , energy - efficient house in Chicago , and that 's what we are all looking for , " he said .
Kaufmann , a leader in green , modular home design , agrees that the time is right .
She designed mkSolaire , a three - story , loft - style prefab featured in the Museum of Science and Industry 's " Smart Home : Green + Wired " exhibit .
Modular home construction leaves behind 50 percent to 75 percent less waste than traditional building , causes less impact on neighborhoods , costs less and is safer for builders , said Kauffmann .
" It 's crazy that we are still building buildings the way we have been for hundreds of years .
It 's so wasteful and time - consuming , " said Kauffmann .
" To think that the best way to build is on site is like saying cars should be built in driveways .
It does n't make sense . "
Kaufmann is developing a community of modular buildings -- townhomes , live - work and multi-family — as part of the Aria neighborhood revitalization project in Denver .
Julius Zsako , a spokesman with Denver Community Planning and Development , said that although modular makes up a small portion of the market , he has n't heard of anyone having trouble getting permits .
Sommers expects the Caisleys ' home to be a model for what can be done with prefab and green homebuilding .
The home includes upgraded insulation to limit the conductivity through the walls , solar thermal panels and a ductless HVAC system , which is twice as efficient as a traditional model , easier to install and controlled room by room .
Photovoltaic panels are a future possibility .
" I want to create something so great that even if you do n't care about the environment , you will make the responsible choice because you 'll save money , " Sommers said .
He said his initial goal was to keep costs at $ 150 a square foot , which would include everything except the price of the land .
But the Caisleys upgraded some of the finishes and appliances .
" The final cost should be about $ 180 to $ 200 per square foot for a 2,000 - square - foot , three bedroom , two - bathroom , two - story house with an attached garage , " said Kathy Caisley .
" You could n't buy a new house with those specs in that area . "
Sommers ' hope is that his work will lead to an amendment to the building code , making modular construction an affordable option for green housing in Chicago , as it is in Denver and other U.S. cities .
" It 's not rocket science , " Kaufmann said , adding that her firm has completed 55 homes in the U.S .
" Luckily , I think there could be a good outcome of the perfect storm of the financial and environmental crises happening at the same time .
Everyone is trying to do more with less and be smarter about using technology — and green homes cost less to live in , " she said .
I am very sad to write that Martin Gardner , a skeptical giant and genius by any standard , died today in Tulsa Norman , Oklahoma .
Wikipedia has a list of his remarkable achievements .
He was a lifelong friend of James Randi , who has written a brief statement at the JREF page .
I 've heard Randi tell many a tale about him .
His love for Martin was worn on his sleeve .
[ Update ( 23 May 2010 ) : Richard Dawkins wrote up his thoughts , and Scientific American , which published a column by Martin for more than three decades , put up a post as well . ]
I never met Martin , but he influenced my life anyway .
I do n't know exactly how old I was , but I think I was in sixth grade when I found a copy of one of his many books filled with brain teasers and math puzzles .
I 've always loved puzzles , but Martin 's books showed me how to think around some problems , how to take that needed step to the side to see the solution lying beyond ... and more importantly , trained me how to find the path to that solution .
Very few people wake up one day seeing the world rationally ; it 's a series of steps that takes you there .
Eventually you look around and realize it , and when you look behind you you see the footsteps that brought you to that place .
Off in the distance , well behind me , but at a critical point in my life , I can see where Martin gave me a nudge .
It was a small push , to be sure , just a gentle poke , but with time it acquired vast leverage .
The skeptic community mourns the loss of one of our giants , but we know we 're all better off for the time we had him here .

Germany - based Otto Bock Healthcare has announced that its prototype prosthetic arm which can be controlled by thought is ready to hit the market .
The device has been in testing on Christian Kandlbauer -- who does n't have any arms and has a conventional prosthetic on his right side -- for the past four years .
He 's the first person in Europe to have a thought - controlled prosthesis installed , but the research is complete and the finished product should soon be available to the public .
The arm makes use of targeted muscle reinnervation ( TMR ) , which uses nerves that controlled the lost arm to control the prosthesis .
The nerves are transplanted to the chest in a six - hour operation and enable the prosthetic control .
The full details of the arm 's operation and controls have yet to be unveiled , but hit up the source link for more information .
PHOENIX --
It was tough to tell which team had the Most Valuable Player - caliber point guard Sunday night in Game 1 of the
at Phoenix .
But it was n't difficult to tell which team now has control of the best - of - seven series : the Blazers .
Despite trying every which way imaginable to give the game away in the final minutes -- missing free throws and a breakaway dunk -- the Blazers stunned a red - hot Phoenix team 105- 100 behind a determined and dynamic performance from

Miller had 31 points , 8 assists , 5 rebounds and drew a huge charge on
late as the Blazers ended the Suns ' eight - game home winning streak despite 25 points and 9 assists from his counterpart , MVP candidate
.
" Andre was tremendous .
He is like our quiet assassin , our quiet leader out there , " said
.
" He just goes about his business and seems to rise to the occasion at the right time . "
It was Miller 's two free throws with 3.7 seconds left that put an end to a crazy close of the game , when the Blazers went 8 for 14 from the free - throw line in the final two minutes and Camby missed a breakaway dunk with 51 seconds left to give the Suns hope .
" Game 1 is always the most important game , " said Miller , who tied his career playoff high for points .
" We did almost everything right . "
The Blazers also got a huge performance off the bench from Phoenix - native
, who scored 10 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter .
It ended a string of 18 consecutive Game 1 road losses by the Blazers dating back to 1983 , and established the Blazers as the only road team to win in the NBA 's opening playoff games .
It also slowed down one of the NBA 's hottest teams .
Phoenix entered the playoffs winning 14 of 16 while boasting the NBA 's second - best record since the February All - Star Break ( 23 - 6 ) .
" They have to beat us four times , " Nash said .
The first one , and usually the hardest one , is done .
" We did n't just come here to get one , " coach
said .
" We got the first one .
Now we want to get the next one on Tuesday night .
But we know we have our work cut out for us . "
The Blazers have won 11 consecutive series when winning Game 1 and are 15 - 1 overall .
Conversely , the Blazers are 3 - 24 when losing the opening game of a series .
Since 1946 - 1947 , the team that has won Game 1 of a best - of - seven series has gone on to win the series nearly 79 percent of the time ( 309 of the 393 ) .
" We just did n't play well , " Nash said .
" We did n't make shots we normally do . "
It was an intense , entertaining and well - played game , with the lead seesawing throughout .
The Blazers kept the game to their pace , slower than high - scoring Phoenix would have preferred , and prevented the Suns from utilizing their favorite part of their arsenal , the fast - break .
The Blazers held the Suns to four fast - break points , a season low , in part by turning the ball over only 10 times .
had 22 points , but struggled with his outside shot , hitting only 8 of 20 attempts and
added 18 , including a huge three - pointer with 1:46 left that gave the Blazers a 97 - 92 lead .
, starting for the injured
, struggled all night while coming nowhere near matching Roy 's team - leading 21.5 scoring average .
Fernandez missed his first four three - pointers and finished with 5 points on 2 of 7 shooting .
He also committed two costly third - quarter fouls , one that gave
three free throws and another on Richardson on an inbound play with two seconds left on the shot clock .
The Blazers trailed 72-70 entering the fourth after former Blazers forward
made a jump hook in the lane with 2.5 seconds left .
The Suns this season were 43 - 5 , including 26 - 2 at home , when entering the fourth with a lead .
The Blazers took a 25 - 24 lead after the first quarter , opening leads as large as seven .
The Suns opened with a surprise strategy that featured 6 - foot - 6 Richardson on Miller and Nash on Fernandez .
The move was to prevent Miller from posting up Nash , and while Miller did n't look to score inside , he set an attacking tone with two lobs to Aldridge for scores and two push - ahead passes that resulted in fast - break layins for Batum , Bayless and Aldridge .
The Blazers , usually a jump - shooting team , did most of their damage inside , as they looked for Aldridge and made several forays into the paint .
In the first quarter , the Blazers held a 20 - 8 advantage on points in the paint .
As is to be expected throughout the series , the Suns bench was a spark in the second quarter .
, a former star who has been injured for much of the season , hit all five of his shots , including three three - pointers .
His last three - pointer , with 2.6 seconds left in the half , drew Phoenix to within 44 - 43 and incensed McMillan , who wanted Batum to foul with about five seconds left to force the Suns to have to inbound again .
The Suns bench outscored Portland 's reserves 25 - 9 in the first half , and when Barbosa hit a three - pointer with 9:36 left , the Suns had their first lead of the game , 31 - 28 .
The lead would build to 40 - 35 , but the Blazers scored nine consecutive points , regaining the lead when Camby tipped in his own miss .
It was one of 12 first - half rebounds for Camby , one off the franchise playoff record for a half set by Bill Walton in Game 5 of the 1977 NBA Finals .
Camby finished with 17 rebounds and three blocks , including an important swat of Stoudemire down the stretch .

Lane Bryant Ad Too ' Racy and Risque ' Say FOX and ABC ( VIDEO )
The newest Lane Bryant commercial ad featuring plus - size model Ashley Graham has caused quite a stir with several television networks .
ABC and FOX claim that the ad is " too racy and risque " .
The popular ABC reality show " Dancing With the Stars " refused to air the spot because they said it bared " too much cleavage " .
FOX first balked at showing the ad on " American Idol " but plans to do so on Wednesday night .
Apparently they relented when it was pointed out that they will be airing a Victoria 's Secret ad on Tuesday night .
Ironically , ABC has also aired VS ads during the DWTS time slot .
Many believe that the reluctance of networks to air the ad had more to do with discrimination against full - sized women and their voluptuous curves .
Check out the ad for yourself below and do let us know what you think .
A longtime ark - hunter has serious doubts about this week ’s announcement that Noah ’s ark was found in eastern Turkey .
A Chinese - Turkish team from Noah 's Ark Ministries International held a press conference April 25 in Hong Kong to present their findings and say they were “ 99 percent sure ” that pieces of wood found at above 12,000 - feet elevation and dated as 4,800 years old were from the biblical Noah ’s ark .
Such a finding would provide evidence for a literal interpretation of the Bible and boost the evangelical Christian worldview in a relatively young Earth that was formed in seven days and where a wrathful God punishes the wicked .
IN PICTURES : Noah's Ark
But Dr. Randall Price , an evangelical Christian and former member of the Chinese - led team that announced this week ’s finding , says the latest purported finding may not withstand closer scrutiny .
" If the world wants to think this is a wonderful discovery , that ’s fine .
My problem is that , in the end , proper analysis may show this to be a hoax and negatively reflect how gullible Christians can be , " he says .
' Difficulties with a number of issues '
Dr. Price , who is director of the Center for Judaic Studies at the conservative Liberty University in Lynchburg , Va. , was the archaeologist on the Chinese - led team in 2008 when this alleged discovery was first made .
He says he has “ difficulties with a number of issues related to the evidence at hand . ”
Price declined to elaborate .
However , a leaked email from Price – which he confirms that he wrote – shows that he has reason to believe that a group of local Kurdish men trucked wood up to the mountain and staged an elaborate hoax for the Chinese team .
A group of Kurdish workers “ are said to have planted large wood beams taken from an old structure in the Black Sea area ( where the photos were originally taken ) at the Mt. Ararat site .
…
During the summer of 2009 more wood was planted inside a cave at the site .
The Chinese team went in the late summer of 2009 ( I was there at the time and knew about the hoax ) and was shown the cave with the wood and made their film , ” Price writes in the email .
Price is a longtime searcher himself for the ark .
As a member of Noah ’s Ark Search LLC , he had gone on a number of expeditions to Mount Ararat .
Price was not the only member to withdraw from the Chinese - led team over questions about their purported finding .
Not good evidence
Dr. John D. Morris , who is president for Dallas ’ Institute for Creation Research and has been a consultant to the team since 2005 , says he declined an invitation to be a part of this week 's press conference in Hong Kong .
“ I ’m a scientist .
I need to have good evidence , ” says Dr. Morris .
“ As of right now , there is not . ”
Morris , who is also a fundamentalist Christian , led 13 expeditions to Mount Ararat between 1971 and 1990 as he searched for the ark .
He has been in contact with the Chinese - led team for the past decade .
He says their finding is inconclusive and calls for more research .
Video available on the team 's web site shows the team exploring inside a wooden structure embedded in a sort of ice cave .
The wooden walls of one compartment are smooth and curved .
Morris says it is almost unfathomable that such heavy materials could be hauled up to 12,000 feet and lodged in the mountain ice without a major operation using heavy machinery .
“ I think it would be highly unlikely that anybody could carry wood up .
I ca n’t comprehend that .
I do n’t think there ’s fraud involved .
But that is a possibility .
And only serious scientific work on - site can resolve that , ” Morris said in a telephone interview from Dallas .
The Noah 's Ark Ministries International has no contact information on their web site , and the Monitor was unable to track down team members today for further comment .
But in the press conference , they appeared to be aware that skeptics may question the findings .
" We are not saying that we are 100 percent certain that what we found is Noah 's Ark .
No one has ever seen the ark , no one knows what it looks like , " said team member Yeung Wing - cheung .
" We are only 99 percent certain that it is Noah 's Ark based on historical accounts , including the Bible and local beliefs of the people in the area , as well as carbon dating . "
Yeung would not reveal the location of the site because he says the team is waiting for the Turkish government to set up an official preservation area to continue their work .
Wood dated 4,800 years old
Morris , Price , and the Chinese - led team are a few of the many who have gone in search of the biblical boat .
In the Book of Genesis , God commands Noah to built the massive vessel and bring “ every sort [ of animal ] ... male and female ... everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life . ”
Then a 40 - day flood hits .
A 2004 ABC News poll showed that 60 percent of Americans read the story of Noah ’s Ark as literally true .
Within that group of believers is a large subsection who believe not in a worldwide flood but rather a regional flood as is mentioned in alternative texts such as the Epic of Gilgamesh .
However , a mere regional flood would not send Noah ’s ark up 12,000 feet on Mount Ararat .
Yeung told the South China Morning
Post that a piece of wood obtained from the site was dated as 4,800 years old by a carbon - dating method in Iran .
This matches with the range of years stated in the Bible , suggesting when the vessel was built .
Reinforcing a fundamentalist view
The discovery of Noah ’s ark would reinforce a literal interpretation of the Bible , says Claude Mariottini , an Old Testament professor at Northern Baptist Seminary outside Chicago .
“ People want to prove the Bible is true .
If they can find the ark on Mount Ararat , it proves there was a Noah and a universal flood and it ’s all true , ” he says .
“ If God is a God of truth then what the Bible says must be truth .
If the story of Noah is not real , then for many people it puts their faith into question , ” says Dr. Mariottini , who believes the story is an allegory for how God is sovereign over creation and punishes sin .
The debate over evolution and creationism has increasingly called for hard evidence and empirical proof .
And Christians have responded .
“ Modern science has challenged the Biblical narrative .
For people who want to take the Bible literally , it drives them to look for this empirical evidence , ” says Carlos M. N. Eire , a professor of history and religious studies at Yale University , in New Haven , Conn .
“ It ’s not just about Christians , it ’s about human nature , ” adds Dr. Eire .
“ It ’s a very deep human instinct to search for truth in whatever you believe in and having physical contact with that . ”
Finding the ark ' would not prove anything '
If this is Noah 's ark , it 's not likely to drastically alter the perspectives of theists or atheists , says Eire .
Fundamentalists would remain committed to a literal interpretation of the Bible while non-believers would continue to demand more evidence .
Christians believe out of faith , not evidence , says Dr. Morris of the Institute for Creation Research .
“ It would not prove anything to me , ” says Morris .
“ My faith is not in Noah ’s ark .
But it would be an obvious physical confirmation based on what I believe . ”
The finding could divide Christians themselves , he adds , and provide fodder for evangelicals who believe that God flooded the entire world and , except Noah 's family , killed off all humans because of their evilness .
“ To recognize that God judges sin and that God will judge their sin is something [ some Christians ] would just as soon not believe in . ”
Previous expeditions have also come back from Mount Ararat with evidence of Noah ’s ark .
French explorer Fernand Navarra found a five - foot section of the ark that was originally dated at 5,000 years old , though later shown to be only 500 to 750 years old .
“ This has happened before , ” says Eire .
“ It will probably keep happening again . ”

When Clemson swept Florida State in a three - game baseball series this past week , the Tigers became the first ACC school to win a division title in both football and baseball in the same academic year , according to Clemson 's sports information department .
Clemson won the Atlantic Division football title this past fall with a 6 - 2 record , then posted an 18 - 12 mark in baseball this spring .
And quarterback Kyle Parker had a little something to do with both .
Last season , Parker threw for 20 touchdown passes and 2,526 yards -- both school freshman records .
This spring , Parker has hit a team - best 18 home runs and also leads the team in batting average ( .373 ) , slugging percentage ( .725 ) and on - base percentage ( .508 ) .
Parker is the first Division I athlete to throw 20 touchdown passes and hit at least 18 home runs in the same academic year .
He is also the first ACC athlete to play on an ACC division championship team in football and baseball in the same year .

NASA 's newest probe to study the Sun was launched on Thursday , February 11 , 2010 , after the winds subsided and the weather cleared over the Florida launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station .
The Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) lifted off from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
Its ' first - of - a- kind ' mission will be ''¦ to reveal the sun 's inner workings in unprecedented detail .'
[ NASA ]
The launch , which happened at the beginning of its one - hour launch window , occurred at 10:23 a.m. Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) , 1523 Greenwich Mean Time ( GMT ) .
The launch was scrubbed on Wednesday , February 10th , when winds were too high for mission launch requirements .
Check out the iTWire article " NASA scrubs SDO solar probe because of wind gusts " for additional details .
In addition , a YouTube video of the launch appears at ' SDO Launch .' An Atlas 5 rocket lifted up the SDO payload into space , from its launch pad at Cape Canaveral .
The goals of the SDO mission is to learn more about the Sun , especially with regards to its magnetic field and its variable and often times violent solar weather patterns that impinge on our daily lives here on Earth .
The slightly - longer - than - five - year mission will send back a bunch of data from its very high , circular geosynchronous orbit of about 36,000 kilometers , with a longitude of 102 degrees West and an inclination of 28.5 degrees .
Page two continues with a " bit " more information on the NASA SDO mission .
NASA states that SDO will return about 150 million bits of data each second to Earth for analysis by scientists .
In fact , NASA is quoted in the article ' NASA Successfully Launches a New Eye on the Sun ' : ' The most technologically advanced of NASA 's heliophysics spacecraft , SDO will take images of the sun every 0.75 seconds and daily send back about 1.5 terabytes of data to Earth -- the equivalent of streaming 380 full - length movies .
" Richard R. Fisher , director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA , stated , " This is going to be sensational .
SDO is going to make a huge step forward in our understanding of the sun and its effects on life and society . "

“ Hanging one scoundrel , it appears , does not deter the next .
Well , what of it ?
The first one is at least disposed of . ”
— H.L. Mencken ( 1880 - 1956 )
Execution by hanging was the most popular legal and extralegal form of putting criminals to death in the United States from its beginning .
Brought over to the states from our English ancestors , the method actually originated in Persia ( now Iran ) about 2,500 years ago .
Hanging soon became the method of choice for most countries , as it produced a highly visible deterrent by a simple method .
It also made a good public spectacle , considered important during those times , as viewers looked above them to the gallows or tree to watch the punishment .
Legal hangings , practiced by the early American colonists , were readily accepted by the public as a proper form of punishment for serious crimes like theft , rape , and murder .
It was also readily practiced for activities that are not considered crimes at all today , such as witchcraft , sodomy , and concealing a birth .
For centuries , most hangings were carried out by the sheriff or legal entity of the town or county where the death sentence had been passed .
Prisoner ’s deaths were usually painful as most executioners were not proficient enough to know how to calculate the correct “ drop ” of the hangman ’s noose to ensure breaking the neck , thus the victim usually died by strangulation .
The use of gallows with a trap door did not become common practice until the 1870s .
Prior to that , most were hanged from the branch of a tree , being turned off the back of a cart , or from a horse .
Hangings began in the U.S. pretty much at the same time that settlements began to be formed in the “ New World . ”
One of the first was a man by the name of John Billington who arrived with the original band of pilgrims at Plymouth Rock on the Mayflower in 1620 .
Allegedly , Billington was prone to blasphemous language , and during the journey over the ocean , the ship ’s captain , Miles Standish , had Billington ’s feet and neck tied together as an example of a sin-struck man possessed of a Devil ’s tongue .
But , that ’s not what got him hanged , rather , it was but an unpleasant experience for the blasphemer .
However , ten years later , Billington became the prime suspect in the murder of another settler by the name of John Newcomen .
Soon , the man was summarily hanged by an angry mob of pilgrims in 1630 .
The earliest recorded female hanged in America was that of Jane Champion in 1632 in Virginia for an unknown offense .
Up until the late 1640s hangings of men during these early pilgrim times were usually caused by sexual offenses such as sodomy or bestiality ; and women were most often hanged for concealing a birth .
However , this all began to change in 1647 when many began to be hanged for practicing witchcraft .
Guilty of “ flapping his hands and arms ” and “ behaving in a peculiar manner , ” Thomas Hellier , a 14 - year - old white boy , became a suspect in a rash of thefts and was sentenced to a life of bondage on a Virginia plantation .
Never agreeable to his servile status , Hellier was sold several years later to a harsh taskmaster named Cutbeard Williamson .
After Williamson , Williamson ’s wife , and a maid were murdered with an ax while they slept one night , Hellier was assumed to be the murderer and hanged by a mob on August 5 , 1678 .
His body was lashed with chains to a tall tree overlooking the James River where it remained for several years until it rotted away .
Culminating in 1692 , both men and women were hanged after the notorious witchcraft trials in Salem , Massachusetts .
One of these notorious cases was that of four - year - old Dorcas Goode who was convicted of witchcraft and sent to prison in 1692 .
She was the daughter of Sarah Goode , who was one of the first three people accused of witchcraft .
Little Dorcas was taken to prison with her mother , and at one point she confessed to practicing witchcraft .
It ’s pretty certain that her mother told her to do that in an effort to save her life .
As it turned out , Sarah Goode was hanged on July 19 , 1692 , and her little daughter stayed in prison for several more months .
When she was finally released she had lost her mind .
Later her father petitioned the authorities for help in taking care of her .
It was during the American Revolution that the term ‘ lynch law ’ originated with Colonel Charles Lynch , a Virginia planter and his associates , who began to make their own vigilante rules for confronting the British Tories , loyalists to England , and other criminal elements .
This type of rough justice was also used regularly by whites against their African American slaves .
Those white men who protested were often in danger of being lynched themselves .
One such man was Elijah Lovejoy , editor of the Alton [ Illinois ]
Observer , who was shot by a white mob after publishing articles criticizing lynching and advocating the abolition of slavery .
After the revolution , the most common hangings of white men were due to war - related crimes such as spying espionage , treason or desertion .
Blacks were summarily hanged , at the will of their owners , most often for the “ official ” reason of revolt .
However , it could have been for any cause whatsoever and merely “ labeled ” as such .
Whites who sympathized with the slaves were also often hanged .
It was also during this time that vigilantism arose in the absence of formal criminal justice systems .
Most often called vigilance committees , these groups got together to blacklist , harass , banish , “ tar and feather , ” flog , mutilate , torture , or kill people who were perceived as threats to their communities or families .
By the late 1700s , these committees became known as lynch mobs because almost all the time , the punishment handed out was a summary execution by hanging .
In the first part of the 19th century , opponents of slavery , cattle rustlers , horse thieves , gamblers and other “ desperadoes ” in the South and the Old West were the most common targets of those who were not of African American descent .
Meanwhile , hangings , burnings , and whippings continued to kill slaves with common regularity .
The state of Montana holds the record for the bloodiest vigilante movement from 1863 to 1865 when hundreds of suspected horse thieves were rounded up and killed in massive mob actions .
Texas , Montana , California , and the Deep South , especially the city of New Orleans , Louisiana were hotbeds of vigilante activity in American history .
“ Lynching ” found an easy acceptance as the nation expanded west to the frontier , where raw conditions encouraged swift punishment for real or imagined criminal behavior .
Vigilance committees , consisting of anywhere from several dozens to several hundred men , formed quickly who summarily made the decision to execute in order to repress crime .
Even where official law enforcement did exist , prisoners were sometimes dragged from jail by a lynch mob and executed .
One of the first recorded hangings in the West of a woman was during 1849 when miners pioneered the boomtowns of California where gambling , drinking , violence , and vigilante justice was common .
One woman , known as “ Pretty Juanita , ” was convicted of murder after stabbing a man who had tried to rape her .
Before she was hung , she gave a laugh and a salute as the rope pulled tight around her neck .
She was the first person hanged in the California mining camps .
On June 2 , 1850 , five Cayuse Indians were hanged in Oregon City for the Whitman massacre .
All five had turned themselves in to spare their people from persecution .
Before the execution , one of the condemned by the name of Tiloukait said : “ Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people ?
So we die to save our people . ”
In June 1851 , an Australian with a bad reputation became the first victim of San Francisco ’s” vigilance ” committee .
Caught in the act of stealing a safe , Jenkins , along with three other Australians from Sydney , were subjected to a mock trial , then marched to San Francisco ’s Custom House , where they all had nooses put around their necks and were hanged on the spot .
A second San Francisco “ vigilance ” committee formed in 1856 and lynched two men , James P. Casey and Charles Cora .
Casey had shot and killed a newspaper editor named James King who had been bolding assaulting evildoers in his newspaper .
Charles Cora , an Italian gambler , had shot and killed a U.S. marshal named Richardson in November 1855 .
A mob of about 6,000 persons either helped to perpetrate or witnessed the lynching of the two men .
Casey and Cora were seized and hanged from projecting beams rigged on the roof of a building on Sacramento Street .
Before the mob dissipated , two more unidentified men were hung from the beams for unknown reasons .
Other non-vigilante lynchings were also occurring with regularity , such as the hanging of two slaves on July 11 , 1856 , in South Carolina for aiding a runaway slave , and the hanging of four black male slaves on December 5th of the same year , allegedly for “ revolting ” against the state of Tennessee .
Though lynchings were always more prone to blacks , two white criminals were in Iowa in 1857 , one for murder , and the other for counterfeiting and theft .
April 9 , 1859 , saw Colorado ’s first execution in the settlement of Denver .
John Stoefel was hanged for shooting his brother - in - law .
Both men were gold prospectors , and Stoefel wanted his brother - in - law ’s gold dust .
Because the nearest official court was in Leavenworth , Kansas , a “ people ’s court ” was assembled , where Stoefel was convicted and hanged within 48 hours of the murder .
Though Denver consisted of only 150 buildings at the time , about 1,000 spectators attended the Stoefel hanging .
Meanwhile , trouble has been brewing along the Kansas / Missouri border over the issue of slavery for several years .
The fanatical activist John Brown had been a primary participant in what became known as “ Bleeding Kansas . ” John Brown was hanged on December 2 , 1859 , at Charles Town , West Virginia .
Just two weeks later , on 16 , Shields Green and John Anthony Copeland , two of five African - American conspirators , were hanged for their participation in John Brown ’s raid on Harper ’s Ferry .
Copeland was led to the gallows shouting , “ I am dying for freedom .
I could not die for a better cause .
I had rather die than be a slave . ”
In the Antebellum days of Texas between 1846 and 1861 , vigilantes instigated most of the lynchings .
Often these vigilantes imitated legal court procedure , trying the offender before a vigilante judge and jury .
Though conviction most often resulted in whipping , 140 offenders were lynched during this time frame .
Vigilante groups increased in frequency with the approach of the Civil War when mobs frequently sought out suspected slave rebels and white abolitionists .
The tension came to a head on September 13 , 1860 , when abolitionist Methodist minister Anthony Bewley was lynched in Fort Worth , Texas .
Bewley , born in Tennessee in 1804 , had established a mission sixteen miles south of Fort Worth by 1858 .
When vigilance committees alleged in the summer of 1860 that there was a widespread abolitionist plot to burn Texas towns and murder their citizens , suspicion immediately fell upon Bewley and other outspoken critics of slavery .
Recognizing the danger , Bewley left for Kansas in mid-July with part of his family .
A Texas posse caught up with him near Cassville , Missouri and returned him to Fort Worth on September 13 .
Late that night , vigilantes seized Bewley and delivered him into the hands of a waiting lynch mob .
His body was allowed to hang until the next day when he was buried in a shallow grave .
Three weeks later his bones were unearthed , stripped of their remaining flesh , and placed on top of Ephraim Daggett ’s storehouse , where children made a habit of playing with them .
But the violence in Texas did not end with Bewley .
As rumors continued of a slave insurrection , it led to the lynching of an estimated thirty to fifty slaves and possibly more than twenty whites over the next two years .
The entire affair culminated in the greatest mass lynching in the history of the state , in at what is now called “ The Great Hanging at Gainesville . ”
During a thirteen - day period in October 1862 , vigilantes hanged 41 suspected Unionists .
During the same year , the Sioux Uprising resulted in more than 500 dead white settlers on August 17th .
Reacting from broken government promises and corrupt Indian agents , as well as going hungry when promised food was not distributed , the uprising began when four young Sioux murdered five white settlers in Acton , Minnesota .
A military court sentenced 303 Santee Sioux to die , but President Abraham Lincoln reduced the list to 38 .
Outraged , several hundred white civilians tried to lynch the 303 Santee Sioux on December 4 , 1862 .
The soldiers , protecting the prisoners at a camp on the Minnesota River , were able to stop the angry crowd .
However , on December 16 , 1862 , the 38 condemned Indian prisoners were hanged in Mankato , Minnesota , an event that is now known as the largest mass hanging in United States history .
Afterward , the government nullified the 1951 treaty with the Santee Sioux .
Active Civil
War tensions were brewing everywhere at this time and on January 23 , 1863 , Confederate soldiers hanged a Fort Smith , Arkansas attorney .
Martin Hart had previously served in the Texas legislature where he spoke out against succession .
However , when Texas became a part of the Confederacy , Martin resigned his government post .
Soon , he organized the Greenville Guards , pledging the company ’s services “ in defense of Texas ” against invasion .
Though he was under a Confederate commission , he spied against the Confederacy .
In Arkansas , he led a series of rear - guard actions against Confederate forces and is alleged to have murdered at least two prominent secessionists .
He was captured on January 18 by Confederate forces and hanged five days later .
More tension was brewing in New York City when its male population was called to war .
On July 13 , 1863 , three days of massive anti-draft protests began .
In what was the nation ’s bloodiest riot in history , 50,000 Civil War draft protesters burned buildings , stores , and draft offices , and actively attacked the police .
Protestors clubbed , lynched , and shot large numbers of blacks , who they blamed for the government ’s position .
When troops returning from Gettysburg finally restored order , 1,200 were dead .
While the rest of the nation was busy fighting the Civil War , the deadliest campaign of vigilante justice in American history was erupting in the Rocky Mountains .
Fighting violent crime in a remote corner beyond the reach of the government , were the Montana Vigilantes .
Sweeping through the gold - mining towns of southwest Montana , the armed horseman hanged 21 troublemakers in the first two months of 1864 alone .
One of these so - called troublemakers was elected Sheriff Henry Plummer , who was said to be the leader of a band of Road Agents called the Innocents .
After hanging Plummer and his two main deputies on January 10 , 1864 , the Vigilantes went on to hang more bandits in such places as Hellgate ( Missoula ) , Cottonwood ( Deer Lodge ) , Fort Owen and Virginia City .
Though these Montana Vigilantes are still revered in Montana as founding fathers , historians have provided evidence that the whole thing regarding Sheriff Plummer and his Road Agents may very well have been a fraud .
The evidence suggests that many of the early stories , on which the outlaw tale is based , were written by the editor of the Virginia City Newspaper , who was a member of the vigilantes and the story was fabricated to cover up the real lawlessness in the Montana Territory – the vigilantes themselves .
Furthermore , the robberies taking place in Montana did not cease after the twenty - one men were hanged in January and February of 1864 .
In fact , after the “ Plummer Gang ” hangings , the robberies showed more evidence of organized criminal activity and the number of thefts increased .
Random lynchings continued in Montana Territory throughout the 1860s even though territorial courts were in place .
Over a six - year period , they lynched more than fifty men without trials until a backlash against extralegal justice finally took hold around 1870 .
By late that same decade , however , Montana was again stirring with new settlement as railroad construction pushed westward and the vigilantes once again became active by making threats for “ undesirables ” to leave the territory .
Reliance on mob rule in Montana became so ingrained that in 1883 , a Helena newspaper editor advocated a return to “ decent , orderly lynching ” as a legitimate tool of social control .
Meanwhile , back on the Civil War battlegrounds , soldiers were being hanged by the dozens for crimes such as guerrilla activity , espionage , treason , but most often for desertion .
One such major spectacle was between the dates of February 5th and February 22nd , 1864 , when 22 deserters were executed by hanging at Kinston , North Carolina .
Legal hangings were performed with regular frequency , the most public of which was the execution of the conspirators who were found guilty of killing Abraham Lincoln in 1865 , just days after the close of the long and bloody Civil War .
Mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth ’s bullet , Booth escaped but was shot down 12 days later in his hiding place .
Mourning the loss of Lincoln , the government began a full - scale investigation , identifying eight members of a conspiracy team , including one woman by the name of Mary Surratt .
Four of these conspirators were hanged before hundreds of spectators on July 7 , 1865 , in the courtyard of the Old Arsenal Penitentiary in Washington , D.C. Mary Surratt was the first woman ever legally executed by the federal government of the United States .
These public spectacles of death for legal hangings and lynchings often took on a festival - type atmosphere , as families attended with picnic baskets in hand , vendors sold souvenirs , and photographers took multiple photographs of the event , many of which wound up on penny postcards .
It was n’t to be until many decades later that public executions in the U.S. ceased in 1936 .
From the ashes of the ruthless and costly Civil War , a violent stage was set for outlaws , vigilante justice , and mob violence that killed thousands of men , women , and children , most of them black .
Upon the founding of the Ku Klux Klan in Tennessee , the lynching of African Americans grew to epidemic proportions .
“ Lynching ” took on a whole new meaning as illegal hangings were soon attributed primarily to racist activities .
From this time onward , mob violence was increasingly reflected in America ’s contempt for racial , ethnic , and cultural groups – especially those of the black population .
But , it did n’t stop there , these racial prejudices also extended to Native Americans , Mexicans , Asian immigrants , and European newcomers .
Youth was no bar to execution by these vicious people , as on February 7 , 1868 , a 13 - year - old African - American girl named Susan was hanged in Henry County , Kentucky for murder .
Susan , who was a babysitter , was accused of killing one of her charges .
The newspapers helped to make these hanging more public by reporting items such as this one that appeared : “ she writhed and twisted and jerked many times . ”
After her death , many of the purportedly “ solid citizens ” asked for a piece of her hanging rope for a souvenir .
Lynchings during this time also targeted white men and women who were known to interfere with “ Judge Lynch justice ” against the blacks , those who had aided runaways , Union activists , and abolitionists .
Lynching in the Wild West also increased after the Civil War as it experienced its most brazen period of extralegal hangings .
Though most often focused as either a deterrent to crime or a resolution in political disputes , there were waves of indiscriminate terror waged against Mexicans , Chinese immigrants , and Native Americans .
In many of the western territories , no legal authority existed , so the vigilantes took it upon themselves to dispense justice .
In others , these Old West pioneers were simply too enraged or impatient to await the legal decisions .
However , not all of the hangings in the Wild West were performed by vigilantes .
One such instance was the hanging of John Millan in Virginia City , Nevada on April 24 , 1868 .
Millan was accused of killing a popular prostitute named Julia Bulette .
Bulette who began her one - woman operation in 1861 was so popular among the locals that she rode in the Fourth of July Parade and was made an honorary member of the local fire department .
On January 20 , 1867 , Julia was found strangled in her home with her jewels and furs missing .
On the day of her funeral , every mine in the area shut down , and 16 carriages filled with the town ’s leading men followed the hearse to the cemetery .
Several weeks later , John Millan was arrested for her murder .
While awaiting trial , Virginia City wives treated him like a hero , bringing him cakes and wine in jail .
Found guilty , he was sentenced to hang .
On April 24 , 1868 , crowds gathered from all over the state to watch Millan die on the gallows that were constructed one mile outside town .
Back in the turbulent South , Wyatt Outlaw , a town commissioner in Graham , North Carolina , was lynched by the Ku Klux Klan on February 26 , 1870 .
Outlaw , who was the president of the Alamance County Union League of America ( an anti-Ku Klux Klan group ) , helped to establish the Republican party in North Carolina and advocated establishing a school for African Americans .
The Klan hanged him from an oak tree near the Alamance County Courthouse .
Dozens of Klansmen were arrested for the murders of Outlaw and other African Americans in Alamance and Caswell Counties .
Many of the arrested men confessed , but , despite protests by Governor William W. Holden , a federal judge in Salisbury ordered them released .
Later the same year , on the raw frontier of the West , gunfighter Clay Allison sat brooding about a locally convicted murder by the name of Charles Kennedy .
While drinking in an Elizabethtown , New Mexico saloon on October 7th , he soon stirred up sentiment against Kennedy .
In no time , he led a lynch mob across the street to the jail , where they dragged Kennedy screaming from his cell .
He was then taken to a local slaughterhouse where he was hanged and his body was mutilated with huge knives used for butchering cattle .
Allison cut the body down , and using an ax , chopped Kennedy ’s head off and jammed it onto a pole .
Allison then rode his horse all the way to Cimarron , New Mexico where he put the head on display on the bar of Henry Lambert ’s saloon .
Later , someone stuck it on the corral fence at the St. James
Hotel where it remained for months and eventually mummified .
During this time , former slaves and free black men continued to be executed such as ten black men on October 19 , 1870 , in Clinton , South Carolina .
In November four black men were lynched in Coosa County , Alabama ; four were lynched in Noxubee County , Mississippi , and a federal revenue agent was hanged in White County , Georgia .
Lynchings continued in earnest in the South and the Old West over the next couple of years .
In 1873 , Klansman laid siege to the small town of Colfax , Louisiana , which was defended by black veterans of the Union army .
On Easter Sunday , April 13 , armed with a small cannon , the whites overpowered the defenders and slaughtered 50 blacks and two whites after they had surrendered under a white flag .
While hangings were taking place all over the South and the Wild West , one of the most famous was that of Jack “ Broken Nose ” McCall on March 1 , 1877 .
Having gone to Deadwood , South Dakota in 1876 , using the name of Bill Sutherland , he sat in on a poker game with Wild Bill Hickok .
Losing all his money , Wild Bill generously gave him back enough to buy breakfast but advised him not to play again until he could cover his losses .
Humiliated , McCall shot Hickok in the back of the head the very next day .
He left Deadwood after killing Hickok , but was later arrested in Laramie , Wyoming , brought back to Yankton and put on trial for Hickok ’s death .
Found guilty , he was sentenced to hang .
On March 1 , 1877 , he stood trembling on the scaffold , begging for someone to save him .
He was buried in Yankton in an unmarked grave with the rope still around his neck .
James Miller , a 23 - year - old man described as a “ mulatto , ” was the first man to be sent to the gallows after Colorado achieved statehood in 1876 .
Miller , a former soldier , was convicted of shooting and killing a man who had earlier forced him , at gunpoint , to leave a dance hall reserved for whites .
When Miller was hanged in West Las Animas on February 2 , 1877 , the trap door would at first not open .
When it eventually fell , the trap door detached and came to rest on the ground .
Miller dropped , but the hanging rope was too long , and Miller ’s feet came to rest on the trap door below .
The trap door was then removed so that Miller could swing freely .
He then strangled for 25 minutes before expiring .
The local sheriff , reportedly distraught over the botched execution , resigned and left town .
Back in the East , in what has become known as “ Pennsylvania ’s Day With the Rope , ” eleven “ Molly Maguire ” coal miners were hanged by the state for murder and conspiracy .
Their real crime was attempting to organize the mine workers .
On June 21 , 1877 , all of them were hanged for their “ obstinacy . ”
“ Top kill ” has yet to stop Gulf oil flow
Massive spill nation ’s worst , study confirms
By Tom Eley
28 May 2010
On Thursday afternoon , BP admitted that the success of its latest attempt to stem the flow of oil from the ocean floor , the so - called “ top kill , ” was in doubt .
The effort to blast thousands of gallons of heavy mud directly into the Deepwater Horizon rig ’s failed blowout preventer one mile beneath the water ’s surface was suspended early Thursday morning so that BP could analyze data , company spokesmen said .
BP said a second attempt would be launched Thursday evening , and indicated that it might include golf balls , pieces of rubber and other objects — a so - called “ junk shot . ”
It may take until the weekend to learn whether or not the top kill has stopped or even restricted the oil gush , the company said .
BP had not revealed to the media , or even the US government , that it had suspended the operation early Thursday , shortly after midnight .
On Thursday morning an oblivious Thad Allen , commander of the US Coast Guard , claimed that the top kill had been a success and that no more oil was being emitted .
That afternoon he said he thought BP was still pumping mud into the blowout preventer .
Allen ’s early comments led to jubilant headlines in the US media , but within hours BP was urging caution before admitting in an evening press conference that the result of the effort was , at best , unclear .
“ What we do know is that we have not yet stopped the flow , ” said BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles .
“ I probably should apologize to folks that we have n’t been giving more data on that , ” he said when he was asked why BP did not explain earlier that it had suspended the top kill .
“ It was nothing more than we are so focused on the operation itself . ”
Earlier efforts to stop the spill using unmanned submarines , a four - story containment dome , and a tube to siphon off oil have also failed .
Meanwhile , the enormous scale of the disaster has come into sharper focus .
New studies authored by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) reveal that the spill in the Gulf of Mexico is many times worse than the estimate originally advanced by the Obama administration and BP .
It is now certain to be the worst spill in US history and one of the worst ecological catastrophes in world history .
The USGS estimates the leakage rate falls in a range of between 500,000 and 1 million gallons per day .
This would mean that somewhere between 17 million and 36 million gallons have been spilled , far more than the 11 million gallons of heavy crude lost by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska ’s Prince William Sound .
Yet the actual magnitude of the spill may be far higher .
For weeks after the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon , which took the lives of 11 workers , the Obama administration joined hands with BP and the Coast Guard in pushing a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) estimate of 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day .
Steady criticism from scientists and mounting physical evidence finally forced the survey from the USGS , which operates within the Department of the Interior .
Steven Wereley , a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University , has come out with a far higher estimate .
Analyzing only two of three leaks using computer particle analysis , Wereley told the House Energy Committee on May 19 that his best estimate was that the rate of the spill was 4.2 million gallons per day .
If so , the spill has emitted upwards of 150 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico .
BP has refused to allow scientists to measure the quantity of oil emitted below the water ’s surface , repeatedly claiming that it was impossible to know how much oil was spilling and that “ it ’s not relevant to the response effort . ”
Scientists reject both claims .
“ If we do n’t know the total amount we are never really going to know where it all went , ” points out earth science professor David Valentine of the University of California .
According to Valentine , surface observations cannot be accurate for underwater spills , “ especially when you have oil traveling such great distances from the sea floor to the sea surfaces and when you have dispersants and other things that are acting on the oil . ”
BP ’s position that the size of the spill is irrelevant to cleanup stands in contradiction to its own emergency planning statement .
On the second page of the 583 - page document is the following passage : “ an accurate estimation of the spill ’s total volume … is essential in providing preliminary data to plan and initiate cleanup operations . ”
BP ’s transparent aim in obscuring the size of the spill is to limit its liability .
“ If they put off measuring , then it ’s going to be a battle of dueling experts after the fact trying to extrapolate how much spilled after it has all sunk or has been carried away , ” Lloyd Benton Miller , a lawyer who represented victims of the Exxon Valdez spill , told McClatchy Newspapers .
“ The ability to measure how much oil was released will be impossible . ”
Evidence continues to mount that the damage done beneath the water ’s surface is massive .
A team of scientists from the University of South Florida on Thursday discovered an enormous plume of oil stretching 22 miles from the ruptured wellhead toward Mobile Bay in Alabama .
The cloud of hydrocarbons is also about six miles wide and reaches from near the water ’s surface to 3,300 feet down .
David Hollander , associate professor of chemical oceanography at the University of South Florida , said the thickest concentration was found about 1,300 feet down .
Hollander and other researchers believe that the plumes may have been created by the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants to break up the oil at its point of emission .
The impact on marine life will be severe .
“ There are two elements to it , ” Hollander told the Associated Press .
“ The plume reaching waters on the continental shelf could have a toxic effect on fish larvae , and we also may see a long - term response as it cascades up the food web . ”
Fears of what may be taking place underwater have been substantiated by diver Philippe Cousteau , Jr. , grandson of the legendary French diver Jacques Cousteau .
Diving with an ABC news crew off the Louisiana coast , Cousteau reported tiny oil droplets up and down the water column that coated his diving suit .
He called what he saw a “ nightmare ” and “ one of the most horrible things I ’ve ever seen underwater . ”
The impact on Gulf Coast shores , which had been mitigated for weeks by favorable winds and currents , is now catastrophic .
Louisiana officials report that over 100 miles of coastline have been fouled by heavy crude oil stretching much of the length of the Mississippi Delta , potentially suffocating estuaries and marshlands critical for the state ’s multibillion - dollar fishing industry .
The Mississippi Delta is one of the most important biological areas in North America .
It is home to about 40 percent of all US wetlands , and provides habitat and breeding grounds to thousands of species of fish , reptiles , amphibians and birds .
Additionally , it provides a major bulwark for heavily populated southern Louisiana against the hurricanes that regularly strike the region .
Tens of thousands will lose their livelihoods along the Gulf Coast .
Fishing has been shut down in 20 percent of US waters in the Gulf with no end in sight , and tourism , critical along the coast as far as south Florida , has been severely damaged .
The spill ’s impact on human health is also a major concern .
On Wednesday , seven fishermen engaged in spill cleanup in the Breton Sound area were hospitalized after complaining of nausea , dizziness , headaches and chest pains .
West Jefferson Medical Center spokeswoman Taslin Alfonso said the men believed they became ill due to exposure to the chemical dispersant used by BP to break up the spill , Corexit .
In another ominous development for the Gulf Coast , NOAA on Thursday predicted one of the most severe hurricane seasons on record , including between 8 and 14 hurricanes , seven of which could be “ major ” — with winds of over 111 miles per hour .
Major storms pose the threat of lifting oil off the seafloor and driving it further onto sensitive coastlines .

( CNN ) -- Tea Party activists and other conservatives are planning rallies next month in support of Arizona 's tough new immigration law , which has come under attack from Democrats , Latino groups and some maverick Republicans .
But a growing chorus of conservative evangelical leaders has broken with their traditional political allies on the right .
They 're calling the Arizona law misguided and are attempting to use its passage to push for federal immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants .
The group , which includes influential political activists such as Richard Land , head of the Southern Baptist Convention 's public policy wing , and Mathew Staver , dean of the Liberty University School of Law , will soon begin lobbying Republican leaders in Washington to support comprehensive immigration reform under President Obama .
But a big part of their job is to first persuade rank - and - file evangelicals to get on board .
" There 's a misconception among people at the grass roots that the pathway to citizenship is amnesty , and it's not , but we have to overcome that , " said Staver , who heads the law school at the university founded by Jerry Falwell .
" There 's a lot of work to be done . "
Staver and Land have partnered with the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez , an influential Hispanic evangelical figure , and Rick Tyler -- former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 's longtime spokesman and head of Gingrich 's new values - based organization -- to try to draft a consensus evangelical position on immigration reform .
" After securing our borders , we must allow the millions of undocumented and otherwise law - abiding persons living in our midst to come out of the shadows , " reads a recent draft of the document , which is still being finalized .
" The pathway for earned legal citizenship or temporary residency should involve a program of legalization for undocumented persons in the United States . ... "
Many conservatives say illegal immigrants should be forced to return to their home countries and start the process of legally coming to the U.S. from scratch .
Rodriguez , who heads the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference -- which represents about 16 million Latino evangelicals in the U.S. -- says he 'll soon start presenting the document to Republican leaders like Gingrich , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Florida Senate candidate Marco Rubio in hopes that they sign on .
" If the conservative evangelical community looks to the Republican Party and says , ' We demand integration reform , we demand a just assimilation strategy , ' that may be the tipping point in getting substantial Republican support for comprehensive immigration reform , " Rodriguez said .
The conservative evangelicals pushing comprehensive immigration reform say that undocumented workers should have to pay fines , clear background checks , learn English and take a civics class before being granted citizenship .
Many evangelicals say their push for immigration reform is biblically based , citing passages urging respect for civil laws and concern for migrants and the vulnerable .
" Discussion of immigration and government immigration policy must begin with the truth that every human being is made in the image of God , " the National Association of Evangelicals said in a recent resolution backing comprehensive immigration reform . " ...
Jesus exemplifies respect toward others who are different in his treatment of the Samaritans . "
But evangelical leaders are also working to convince Republicans that the party will lose Hispanic voters -- a fast - growing bloc -- if they take a strident line on immigration .
The Southern Baptist Convention 's Land said that Hispanics , like non-Hispanic white evangelicals , generally take a conservative approach to social issues like abortion and gay marriage , but that they often vote for Democrats because of the immigration issue .
" Hispanics are hard - wired to be like us on sanctity of life , marriage and issues of faith , " said Land , describing political similarities between Hispanics and white Southern Baptists .
" I 'm concerned about being perceived as being unwelcoming to them . "
The last time Washington attempted immigration reform , under President George W. Bush in 2007 , the project failed , largely because many conservatives and Republicans said the plan 's inclusion of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the U.S. was tantamount to amnesty .
Most major evangelical groups sat out the 2007 fight over immigration reform , but many , including the National Association of Evangelicals , which represents 30 million Americans , have since taken up the cause .
Trying to apply the political lessons of 2007 , the evangelical leaders now pushing comprehensive immigration reform stress that the borders need to be secured as part of any reform package .
" I look at the Arizona law as a cry for help from a state that 's being inundated as a result of the federal government refusing to enforce its laws , " Land said .
But , he added , " I think the Arizona law is the wrong way to attack the problem . "
Passed last month , the Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question someone about their immigration status if they are in the process of enforcing some other law or ordinance .
Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling , though supporters say a package of changes to the law signed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer addressed those concerns .
Many evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform say the law 's passage gave new urgency to their campaign , which had been under way since last year .
Rodriguez says he declined to join other Latino groups in calling for a boycott of Arizona because he thought it would alienate white evangelicals at a time when he 's trying to win their support .
Still , Rodriguez and the handful of conservative evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform have yet to persuade some of the country 's most powerful evangelical groups -- including Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council -- to come on board .
" We 've been looking into this deeply but are n't ready to discuss our position , assuming we 'll get to one , " Tom Minnery , vice president of public policy at Focus on the Family , said in an e-mail message last week .
Even if such groups join their campaign , evangelicals backing comprehensive immigration reform may face another challenge : Persuading the White House to move forward with the plan after the bruising fight over health care reform .
From Bill Moyers Journal William K. Black on Fraud :
William K. Black thinks President Obama did n't acknowledge a key component in the financial crisis that the bills before Congress wo n't address — fraud .
A former regulator who helped crack down on massive fraud during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s , Black tells Bill Moyers on THE JOURNAL that , despite evidence of fraud at the top banks , prosecutions seem far away .
" If you go back to the savings and loan debacle , we got more than a thousand felony convictions of the elite .
These are not , you know , tellers or something .
We today have zero convictions , zero indictments , zero arrests of any of the elite , non-prime lenders that , through their fraud , drove this crisis . "
On Thursday , April 22 , President Barack Obama made the case for increased regulation of the financial industry in a televised speech at Cooper Union in New York City .
It was widely billed as President Obama 's chance to harness the momentum behind reforming Wall Street and move forward the bills being considered in the House and Senate .
Those measures face stiff opposition from most of the Republican Party and an army of lobbyists from Wall Street who have the ear of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle .
Bill Moyers last broadcast is going to be next week .
You 'll be sorely missed Bill .
Transcript of the clip below and you can watch the entire interview here .
BILL MOYERS : What did you think of the President 's speech late this week ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK
It 's a good speech .
He 's a very good spokesman for his causes .
I do n't think substantively the measures are going to prevent a future crisis .
And I was disappointed that he was n't willing to be blunt .
He used a number of euphemisms , but he was unwilling to use the F word .
BILL MOYERS : The F word ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK
The F word 's fraud in this .
And it 's the word that explains why we have these recurrent , intensifying crisis .
BILL MOYERS : How is that ?
What do you mean when you say fraud is at the center of it ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK
Well , first , when you deregulate or never regulate , mortgage bankers were never regulated , you effectively have decriminalized that industry , because only the regulators can serve as the sherpas , that the FBI and the prosecutors need to be able to understand and prosecute these kind of complex frauds .
They can do one or two or maybe three on their own , but when an entire industry is beset by wide scale fraud , you have to have the regulators .
And the regulators were the problem .
They became a self - fulfilling prophecy of failure , because they , President Bush appointed people who hated regulation .
I call them the anti-regulators .
And that 's what they were .
BILL MOYERS : This hearing that , where you testified this week , looking into the bankruptcy at Lehman Brothers , had something on this .
TIMOTHY GEITHNER :
And tragically , when we saw firms manage themselves to the edge of failure , the government had exceptionally limited authority to step in and to protect the economy from those failures .
BEN BERNANKE : In September 2008 , no government agency had sufficient authority to compel Lehman to operate in a safe and sound manner and in a way that did not pose dangers to the broader financial system .
ANTON VALUKAS :
What is clear is that the regulators were not fully engaged and did not direct Lehman to alter the conduct which we now know in retrospect led to Lehman 's ruin .
BILL MOYERS : The regulators were not fully engaged .
I mean , this is an old story .
We all know about regulatory capture where the regulated take control of the regulators .
WILLIAM K. BLACK
Yeah , but this one is far worse .
That 's not very candid testimony on anybody 's part there .
The Fed had unique authority .
And it had it since 1994 to regulate every single mortgage lender in America .
And you might think the Fed would use that authority .
And you might especially think that , if you knew that Gramlich , one of the Fed members , went personally to Alan Greenspan and said , there 's a housing bubble .
And there 's a terrible crisis in non-prime .
We need to send the examiners in .
We need to use our regulatory authority .
And Greenspan refused .
Lehman was brought down primarily by selling liar 's loans .
It was the biggest seller of liar 's loans in the world .
And when we look at these liar 's loans , we find 90 percent fraud .
90 percent .
And we find that most of the frauds are not induced by the borrower , but they 're overwhelmingly done by the loan brokers .
BILL MOYERS : And liar 's loans are ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK
A liar 's loan is we do n't get any verified information from you about your income , your employment , your job history or your assets .
BILL MOYERS : You give me a loan , no questions asked ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK
No real questions asked .
Certainly no answers checked .
In fact , we just had hearings last week about WaMu , which is also a huge player --
BILL MOYERS : Washington Mutual --
WILLIAM K. BLACK -- in these frauds .
Washington Mutual , which used to make , run all those ads making fun of bankers who , because they were stuffy and looked at loan quality before they made a loan .
Well , WaMu did n't do any of that stuff .
And of course , WaMu had just massive failures .
And who got in trouble at WaMu ?
Who got in trouble at Lehman ?
You got in trouble if you told the truth .
They fired the people who found the problems .
They promoted the people that caused the problem , and they gave them massive bonuses .
BILL MOYERS : I watched the testimony where you were present the other day in the Lehman hearings .
And there was a very moving moment with a former vice - president of Lehman Brothers who had gone and tried to blow the whistle , who tried to get people to pay attention to what was going on .
Take a look .
MATTHEW LEE : I hand - delivered my letter to the four addressees and I 'll give a quick timeline of what happened , May 16th was a Friday , on the Monday I sat down with the chief risk officer and discussed the letter , on the Wednesday I sat down with the general counsel and the head of internal audit , discussed the letter .
On the Thursday I was on a conference call to Brazil .
Somebody came into my office , pulled me out , and fired me on the spot with out any notification .
I stayed , sorry .
BILL MOYERS : Matthew Lee , vice - president of Lehman Brothers , fired because he tried to blow the whistle .
What does that say to you ?
WILLIAM K . BLACK
Well , it tells me that they were covering up the frauds , that they knew about the frauds and that they were desperate to prevent other people from learning .
BILL MOYERS : Matthew Lee told the accounting firm Ernst & Young what was going on .
Is n't the accounting firm supposed to report this , once they learn from somebody like him that there 's fraud going on ?
WILLIAM K. BLACK
Yes , they 're supposed to be the most important gatekeeper .
They 're supposed to be independent .
They 're supposed to be ultra-professional .
But they have an enormous problem , and it 's compensation .
And that is , the way you rise to power within one of these big four accounting firms is by being a rainmaker , bringing in the big clients .
And so , every single one of these major frauds we call control frauds in the financial sphere has been -- their weapon of choice has been accounting .
And every single one , for many years , was able to get what we call clean opinions from one of the most prestigious audit firms in the world , while they were massively fraudulent and deeply insolvent .

Thanks to a pair of knockout fake trailers , a team of Finnish filmmakers will soon start shooting an outlandish sci-fi Nazi movie financed in part by fans who flipped over the clips .
The first teaser for Iron Sky , embedded below , has pulled more than 1.3 million YouTube views since its release two years ago .
The follow - up clip ( above ) , released last month , continued the momentum as the project 's website harvested micro-investments from 52 fans enticed by the spooky - sleek visuals .
The trailers also generated buzz on the strength of the bizarrely original Iron Sky premise : During the closing days of World War II , Nazis in flying saucers escaped to the moon .
In 2018 , they plan a victorious return to Earth .
With 90 percent of the feature - length project 's $ 8.5 million budget now funded , casting for Iron Sky is nearly complete , with filming set to begin in Australia and Germany this fall .
CGI maestro Samuli Torssonen supervised Iron Sky 's visual effects after spending seven years working on zero - budget feature Star Wreck .
For the Iron Sky trailers , " everything was either shot by ourselves or created by our VFX team at Energia Productions , " Torssonen told Wired.com in an e-mail .
" I think for indie productions it is very important to have in - house creative which can archive visually impressive shots with a decent budget . "
Torssonen relied on Maya 3 - D software to craft the trailers ' visual effects .
" Every shot was filmed against blue / green screen in a local studio , " he said .
" Every shot , of course , also had quite a lot of CGI . "
Fan investments in Iron Sky were augmented by money from 12 traditional financiers , according to producer Tero Kaukomaa of Blind Spot Pictures .
" If we are able to make money , " Kaukomaa said , " then the crowd who invested will make money , and if that happens , it will speed up the possibility to fund films totally with crowds . "
But VFX man Torssonen cautions that " fan / community funding is not an easy way out .
We did n't come out of nowhere .
We 've been building our internet community and visibility since 1999 , with Star Wreck .
You have to invest a lot of time and energy to win the trust of the internet audience .
The only way to do that is to deliver good quality .
Mediocre stuff just wo n't cut it . "
As a hybrid model blending conventional business cash with microdonations from sci-fi zealots , Iron Sky is emerging as the most expensive fan - curated movie to date .
As such , it points the way toward a future in which audience and investor become one and the same .
" I think it 's great that the audience can , in some terms , ' order ' a film that they find cool by investing , participating in the production or donating money , " Torssonen said .
" They can give ideas and feedback , become part of the whole process , and finally see a film in theaters that has been tailored for their needs . "

Police in Mexico's Guerrero state are investigating the killings of five men found decapitated near the resort town of Acapulco , authorities said Saturday .
The men were between 20 and 30 years old and were found in a car in the region of Costa Grande in the subdivision of Tamarindo , less than 3 miles from Acapulco , Guerrero state police officer Jorge Tellez told CNN .
All five showed signs of torture and their bodies were riddled with bullets , police said .
Three of the men were killed Friday , investigators said .
They did not know when the other two died .
All were Mexicans , according to Guerrero state public security and civil protection spokesman Arturo Cuellas .
Three of the victims were identified as Jonathan Gomez Tellez , Jose Pastor Valencia and Osiris Villanueva Vargas .
Police are working to determine the identities of the two others .
Guerrero state police said they did not know the motive of the killings .
Guerrero is in southern Mexico and is contentious territory for drug cartels .
The state is near a major drug trafficking artery for such drugs as cocaine , which flow through Central America from Peru and Colombia .
Sometimes we need to fill two divs simultaneously using ajax .
Generally , we use two different ajax calls to achieve this rather knowing the fact that it can also be done using single ajax call .
One simple example is better than hundered words .
Lets setup an example .
Here is the DEMO
HTML
Suppose we have two different divs having Ids div_1 and div_2 respectively .
< div id =" div_1 " ></div > < a href= " " class= " button " >
Click Me</a > < div id =" div_2 " ></div >
.
AJAX file
The above divs to be filled simultaneously from ajax file having ids inner_1 and inner_2 respectively .
< div > <!--
This is empty div and please do n't remove this --> < div id =" inner_1 " >
This is data from ajax file having id inner_1 . </div > < div id =" inner_2 " >
This is data from same ajax file having id inner_2 .
</div > </div >
.
Javascript
Now , here is the trick of jquery , how divs on main page is filled simultaneously .
( jquery latest pack included )
< script type = " text/ javascript " src = " http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.pack.js " language = " javascript " ></ script > < script type = " text / javascript " language = " javascript " > $ ( function ( ) { $ ( '. button ' ) . click ( function ( ) { var postData = '' " ; // you can send any data to ajax file .
$ ( ' # div_1 , # div_2 ' ) .html ( '< img src= " ajax - loader .
gif " />' ) ; // placeholder $.ajax ( { url : ' ajax_file.php ' , // your ajax file type : ' post ' , data : postData , success : function ( resp ) { $ ( ' #div_1 ' ) .html ( $ (' # inner_1 ' , resp ) .html ( ) ) ; $ ( ' #div_2 ' ) .html ( $ ( ' # inner_2 ' , resp ) .html( ) ) ; } } ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
.
Here is the DEMO
All Done !
Cheers !!
Not long after the administration finalized an arms reduction treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , President Obama is now seeking $ 80 billion in funding for nuclear weapons .
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , the money would be spent to “ rebuild and sustain America ’s aging nuclear stockpile . ”
The US has one of the two largest arsenals on the planet , some 5,113 warheads , a holdover from the Cold War arms race with the former Soviet Union .
Despite very public efforts to declare himself an advocate of total nuclear disarmament , President Obama has made no secret of his ambitions for an updated nuclear stockpile , ostensibly for “ safety ” reasons .
But in reality , an arsenal capable of wiping out much of the life on the planet is never really safe , and questions about the military ’s handling of the arsenal are nothing new .
Likewise it is difficult to argue , in a post Cold War world , that the US truly needs such an enormous arsenal merely for “ deterrence . ”
Yet for the administration selling the case for new nuclear weapons will likely have a relatively easy time of it , particularly with the illusion of Obama ’s bona fides on disarmament looming large in the background .
The flurry of attention to Congo ’s conflict minerals problem today – a column in The New York Times , a viral video spoof on the “ I ’m a Mac … ” ad , a frontpage piece on the Huffington Post – worked its way up to the tiptop echelon of the tech world today – to Steve Jobs .
WIRED ’s Gadget Lab blog just published a post highlighting the first - ever direct response from the Apple founder about conflict minerals , a problem that plagues every electronics company and thus links consumers to the war in Congo – if unwittingly .
Here ’s the exchange between Apple loyalist Derick Rhodes and Jobs , as reported by WIRED :
Hi Steve ,
I ’d planned to buy a new iPhone tomorrow – my first upgrade since buying the very first version on the first day of its release – but I ’m hesitant without knowing Apple ’s position on sourcing the minerals in its products .
Are you currently making any effort to source conflict - free minerals ?
In particular , I ’m concerned that Apple is getting tantalum , tungsten , tin , and gold from Eastern Congo through its suppliers .
Looking forward to your response ,
Derick
Jobs ’ reply :
Yes .
We require all of our suppliers to certify in writing that they use conflict few [ sic ] materials .
But honestly there is no way for them to be sure .
Until someone invents a way to chemically trace minerals from the source mine , it ’s a very difficult problem .
Sent from my iPhone
It ’s a very welcome development that Jobs decided to personally weigh in on this issue and respond to a concerned consumer , because ultimately it will be decisions by him and other industry leaders that will give customers the choice to go conflict free .
But because we have a couple of questions with his argument , Enough is replying in kind .
Here ’s an email we just sent to him :
Thanks ,
Steve .
You have always blazed a path where others thought it impossible .
Tracing minerals is n’t easy , but it can be done .
The chokepoint is at the smelter , where the raw mineral ores are processed into metals .
Tin and tantalum firms that supply electronics companies have started tracing programs in the past six months , and certain electronics companies are beginning to audit this process .
But to guarantee to consumers that iPads , iPods and iPhones are verifiably conflict - free , we need more resources and commitment from industry leaders like you .
We have a roadmap to accomplish this , through tracing , auditing , and certification .

So it looks like Ralph Lauren is not the only company whose art department studied at the Gumby School Of Photoshop For People Who Like To Make Women Look Weird .
Ann Taylor apparently also employs a number of graduates .

Although the mall retailer — recently buoyed by better - than - expected quarterly results — may be crawling back towards fashion respectability , its website is a veritable treasure trove of inept Photoshop .
Did nobody notice that the model for this $ 119.99 dress appears to have shoulders twice the width of her hips , even though she 's standing front on to the camera ?

OK , Seattle has become the eleventh city to decide to boycott Arizona and their draconian immigration law .
Yesterday , the Seattle City Council unanimously voted to boycott Arizona by ending official city travel there and resolving , when practical , to cut off future contracts with Arizona - based businesses .
That makes Seattle the 11th city to endorse a boycott of the state in opposition to its controversial immigration law .
Five of the boycotting cities are in California : Los Angeles tops the list as the biggest , and its boycott could deliver the most painful blow to Arizona 's economy , as the city has $ 58 million in existing contracts with Arizona companies , according to the L.A. Times .
In pending city votes , some members of Dallas 's city council are considering a boycott , along with the municipal governments in Milwaukee , Wisconsin and Berkeley , California . --
Legal challenges to the Arizona easure could well render the boycott campaign moot , however .
Since the law , which makes it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant , is already facing five legal challenges , it may be overturned before it can go into effect July 23 .
Here 's a list of the cities that have announced travel and / or city contracts boycotts so far : - Seattle , Washington - El Paso , Texas - Austin , Texas - Boston , Massachusetts - St. Paul , Minnesota - Boulder , Colorado - San Diego , California - West Hollywood , California - San Francisco , California - Los Angeles , California - Oakland , California
And it 's only going to get worse and worse for the Sheriff Joe Arpaio - led Arizona .
The FBI is looking into accusations that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is using his position to settle political vendettas .
Over the past year , 5 Investigates examined more than two dozen complaints against the sheriff from business owners , government workers , mayors and law - enforcement officials .
They claim they spoke out against Arpaio , and shortly after , deputies paid them unwelcome visits .
I think I 've been covering this issue pretty good since Arizona has decided to lead the way for racial profiling to ravage our land .

It was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she ’d seen him .
She had n’t even known him then , and so what she ’d felt was only sexual attraction , not love .
Even after they ’d gone out for coffee , she could n’t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation .
But ever since the night they went back to Leonard ’s place after watching “ Amarcord ” and started fooling around , when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff , as she often was with boys , instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it , she ’d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off , worrying that her body was n’t good enough , or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she ’d unwisely ordered at dinner ; worrying , too , about having suggested they order Martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said , “ Sure .
Martinis .
Let ’s pretend we ’re Salinger characters ” ; after having had , as a consequence of all this anxiety , pretty much no sexual pleasure , despite the perfectly respectable session they ’d put together , and after Leonard ( like every guy ) had immediately fallen asleep , leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping that she would n’t get a yeast infection , Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she ’d just spent the whole night worrying was n’t , in fact , a surefire sign that she was falling in love .
And certainly after they ’d spent the next three days at Leonard ’s place having sex and eating pizza , after she ’d relaxed enough to be able to come once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction , after she ’d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing that he was staring at her ( imperfect ) ass , to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator , to read the brilliant half page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter , and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl , certainly , by the end of those three days , Madeleine knew she was in love .

But that did n’t mean she had to tell anyone .
Especially Leonard .
Madeleine had met Leonard in an upper - level semiotics seminar taught by a renegade from the English department .
Michael Zipperstein had arrived at Brown thirty - two years earlier filled with zeal for the New Criticism .
He ’d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography - free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical , in Paris , in 1975 , where he ’d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted , over duck cassoulet , to the new faith .
Now Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotic Studies : Introduction to Semiotic Theory , in the fall , and , in the spring , Semiotics 211 .
Hygienically bald , with a seaman ’s mustacheless white beard , Zipperstein favored French fisherman ’s sweaters and wide - wale corduroys .
He buried people with his reading lists : in addition to all the semiotic big hitters – –Derrida , Eco , Barthes– – the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac ’s “ Sarrasine ” to issues of Semiotext ( e ) to xeroxed selections from E. M. Cioran , Robert Walser , Claude Lévi-Strauss , Peter Handke , and Carl Van Vechten .
To get into the seminar , you had to submit to a one - on - one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions , such as what your favorite food or dog breed was , and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response .
This esoteric probing , along with Zipperstein ’s guru ’s dome and beard , gave his students a sense that they ’d been spiritually vetted and were now — for two hours Wednesday afternoons , at least––part of a campus lit - crit élite .
Almost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike , who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in , in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade , who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth - century France .
Madeleine had become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons : because she loved to read .
The university ’s “ British and American Literature Course Catalogue ” was , for Madeleine , what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates .
A course listing like “ English 274 : Lyly ’s Euphues ” excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby .
“ English 450A : Hawthorne and James ” filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed that was not unlike the sensation Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria .
Right up through her third year of college , Madeleine had kept wholesomely taking courses like “ Victorian Fantasy : From ‘ Phantastes ’ to ‘ The Water - Babies , ’ ” but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot .
Going to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism .
Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution .
It drew a line ; it created an elect ; it was sophisticated and Continental ; it dealt with provocative subjects , with torture , sadism , hermaphroditism– –with sex and power .
Semiotics 211 was limited to ten students .
Of those ten , eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory .
This was visually apparent at the first class meeting .
Lounging around the seminar table , when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside , were eight people in black T - shirts and ripped black jeans .
A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T - shirts .
There was something creepy about one guy ’s face ––it was like a baby ’s face that had hideously aged––and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he ’d shaved off his eyebrows .
Everyone in the room was so spectral - looking that Madeleine ’s natural healthiness seemed suspect , like a vote for Reagan .
She was relieved , therefore , when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her .
He had a cup of takeout coffee .
Zipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar .
The boy without eyebrows spoke up first .
“ Um , let ’s see .
I ’m finding it hard to introduce myself , actually , because the whole idea of social introductions is so encoded .
Like , if I tell you that my name is Thurston and that I grew up in Greenwich , Connecticut , will you know who I am ?
O.K .
My name ’s Thurston and I ’m from Greenwich , Connecticut .
I ’m taking this course because I read ‘ Of Grammatology ’ last summer and it blew my mind . ”
When it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine , he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major ( biology and philosophy ) and had never taken a semiotics course before , that his parents had named him Leonard , that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name , especially when you were being called to dinner , and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it .
Leonard did n’t make another comment .
During the rest of the class , he leaned back in his chair , stretching out his long legs .
After he finished his coffee , he dug into his right snowmobile boot and , to Madeleine ’s surprise , pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco .
With two stained fingers , he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek .
For the next two hours , every minute or so , he spat , discreetly but audibly , into the cup .
It was the last semester of Madeleine ’s senior year , a time when she was supposed to have some fun , and she was n’t having any .
She ’d never thought of herself as hard up .
Since breaking up with her last boyfriend , Barry , a student filmmaker , she ’d enjoyed being unattached .
It was a relief not to have to organize your weekend around what your boyfriend wanted to do .
It was great to concentrate fully on academics , to spend time with your female friends , to skip shaving your legs for a week , if you wanted , and just wear pants .
As far as Madeleine was concerned , she did n’t want a boyfriend .
But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco she began to think she was fooling herself .
Looking back , Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations .
Her freshman roommate , Jennifer Boomgaard , had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm .
Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody , much less a stranger , Madeleine felt that Jennifer was a little too quick with her intimacies .
She did n’t want to be shown Jennifer ’s diaphragm , which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli , and she certainly did n’t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jennifer offered to squirt into her palm .
Madeleine was frankly shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place , when she wore it to the Harvard - Brown game , and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge .
That winter , when the Reverend Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally , Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric , “ Did you put your diaphragm in ? ”
They lived the next four months in a twenty - by - fifteen room without speaking to each other .
Though Madeleine had n’t arrived at college sexually inexperienced , her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line .
Aside from one makeout session with a Uruguayan named Carlos , a sandal - wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara , the only other boy she ’d fooled around with was a high - school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend .
She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty , pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track , and quietly crying .
His blue blazer was too big for him .
He ’d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him .
Now he was starving and was n’t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not .
Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine .
She helped him negotiate the Ratty and , afterward , took him on a tour of the university .
Around ten - thirty that night , they ended up back in Madeleine ’s dorm room .
Tim had the long - lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll , a little prince or yodelling shepherd boy .
His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine ’s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door .
“ Oh , ” she said , “ sorry , ” and proceeded to stand there , smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall .
When she finally did leave , Madeleine sat up , readjusted her clothes , and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school .
Sophomore year had n’t been much better , romance - wise .
And then junior year she ’d gone out with Barry .
A sensitive male , Barry took part in Take Back the Night marches , bearing a candle up College Hill with a crowd of women .
On the wall of his bedroom he painted the words “ Kill the Father . ”
Killing the father was what , in Barry ’s opinion , college was all about .
“ Who ’s your father ? ” he asked Madeleine .
“ Is it Virginia Woolf ?
Is it Sontag ? ”
“ In my case , ” Madeleine said , “ my father really is my father . ”
“ Then you have to kill him . ”
A month or so later , Madeleine got rid of Barry instead .
Each week , Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of literary theory and one literary “ text . ”
The pairings were eccentric , if not downright arbitrary .
Madeleine still was n’t sure to what extent Lyotard ’s “ The Postmodern Condition ” had illuminated Pynchon ’s “ The Crying of Lot 49 . ”
In Week Four , they started on Derrida .
As the class beat its way into the thickets of deconstruction , however , Madeleine ’s attention often wandered to Leonard .
He was as husky as a jock , and yet he spoke in a careful , soft , almost professorial tone .
One week , he forgot his book and had to look over Madeleine ’s shoulder .
His Skoal had a menthol scent , cleaner , more pleasant than she expected .
Whenever he looked at her with his St. Bernard ’s eyes ( the eyes of a drooler , maybe , but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche ) , Madeleine could n’t help staring back a significant moment longer .
The Derrida went like this : “ In that sense it is the Aufhebung of other writings , particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture . ”
In poetic moods , it went like this : “ What writing itself , in its nonphonetic moment , betrays , is life .
It menaces at once the breath , the spirit , and history as the spirit ’s relationship with itself .
It is their end , their finitude , their paralysis . ”
Since Derrida claimed that language , by its very nature , undermined any meaning it attempted to promote , Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning .
Maybe he did n’t .
That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology , so many loop - de- looping clauses .
That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of .
( Could “ the access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality ” really be a subject ? )
Reading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty - handed after jogging with hand weights .
Once released from Semiotics 211 , Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library , down to B Level , where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold , and grabbed something , anything —
“ The House of Mirth , ” “ Daniel Deronda ” — to restore herself to sanity .
How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before !
What exquisite guilt she felt , wickedly enjoying narrative !
Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth - century novel .
There were going to be people in it .
Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world .
But then , in Week Five , for reasons that were entirely extracurricular , semiotics began making sense .
It was a Friday night , just past eleven .
Madeleine was in bed , reading the assigned text for that week , Roland Barthes ’s “ A Lover ’s Discourse . ”
She had the book in her lap .
With her right hand , she was eating peanut butter , spooning it straight from the jar .
The spoon fit perfectly against the roof of her mouth , allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue .
For a book purportedly about love , the Barthes did n’t look very romantic .
The cover was a sombre chocolate brown .
Opening to the introduction , she began to read :
The necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration : that the lover ’s discourse is today of an extreme solitude .
Outside , the temperature , which had been below freezing for the past week , had shot up to the fifties .
The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness , drainpipes and gutters dripping , sidewalks puddling , streets flooded , a constant sound of water rushing downhill .
Madeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness .
She sucked the spoon and read on :
What we have been able to say below about waiting , anxiety , memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with , to be added to , subtracted from , and passed on to others : around the figure , the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes , by a final parenthesis , is held a second longer before handing it on .
( Ideally , the book would be a cooperative : “ To the United Readers and Lovers . ” )
It was n’t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine .
It was n’t only that these opening sentences of Barthes ’s made immediate sense , were readable , digestible .
It was n’t Madeleine ’s relief at recognizing that here , at last , was a book she might write her final paper on .
What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them .
Here was a sign that she was n’t alone .
Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling .
In bed on a Friday night , wearing sweatpants and eating peanut butter from the jar , Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude .
It had to do with Leonard .
With how she felt about him and how she could n’t tell anyone .
With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him .
With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so .
After class that Wednesday , Madeleine and Leonard had ended up walking together to the Blue Room , the campus coffee shop .
As they stood in line , Leonard had mentioned that the Film Society was playing a Fellini film that weekend .
“ Do you like Fellini ? ” he asked .
“ You want to know something embarrassing ? ” Madeleine said .
“ I ’ve never seen a Fellini film . ”
“ Then you should see one , ” Leonard said .
He asked for her phone number , and she wrote it down on the front of his notebook .
Since then , Madeleine had stayed in every night , waiting for Leonard to call .
When she came back from classes in the afternoon , she interrogated her roommates to find out if Leonard had called .
“ Some guy called this morning , ” Olivia said , on Thursday .
“ When I was in the shower . ”
“ Why did n’t you tell me ? ”
“ I forgot . ”
“ Who was it ? ”
“ He did n’t say .
I was dripping wet . ”
“ Did it sound like Leonard ? ”
“ I do n’t know what Leonard sounds like . ”
“ Thanks for taking a message , ” Madeleine said harshly .
And so now it was Friday night , her roommates had gone out to a party , and Madeleine had stayed in “ to study . ”
She was reading “ A Lover ’s Discourse ” and marvelling at its relevance to her life :
Waiting attente / waiting Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being , subject to trivial delays ( rendezvous , letters , telephone calls , returns ) .
. . .
Waiting is an enchantment : I have received orders not to move .
Waiting for a telephone call is thereby woven out of tiny , unavowable interdictions to infinity : I forbid myself to leave the room , to go to the toilet , even to telephone ( to keep the line from being busy ) .
Her father had called twice already , wanting to discuss graduation plans , and she ’d nearly hung up on him .
She could hear the television going in the apartment below .
Her bedroom window faced the state - capitol dome , brightly lit against the dark sky .
The heat , which they could n’t control , was still on , the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing .
The more she thought about it , the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude did n’t only describe the way she was feeling about Leonard .
It explained how she ’d always felt when she was in love .
It explained what love was like and , just maybe , what was wrong with it .
Here the telephone rang .
Madeleine dog-eared the page she was reading .
She waited as long as she could ( three rings ) before answering .
Leonard said hello .
“ Oh , hi , ” Madeleine said .
“ I thought you might be my father .
He ’s freaking out about graduation already . ”
“ I was just having a little freakout myself . ”
“ About what ? ”
“ About calling you . ”
This was good .
Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip .
She said , “ Have you calmed down or do you want to call back later ? ”
“ I ’m resting comfortably now , thank you . ”
Madeleine waited for more .
None came .
“ Are you calling for a reason ? ” she asked .
“ Yes .
That Fellini film ?
I was hoping you might , if you ’re not too , I know it ’s bad manners calling so late , but I was at the lab . ”
“ I do n’t think that was a complete sentence , ” she said .
“ What did I leave out ? ” Leonard asked .
“ How about ‘ Would you like to come with me ? ’ ”
“ I ’d love to , ” Leonard said .
Madeleine frowned into the receiver .
She had a feeling Leonard had set up this exchange , like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead .
She was going to say goodbye when Leonard said , “ Sorry .
Not funny . ”
He cleared his throat .
“ Listen , would you like to go to the movies with me ? ”
She did n’t answer right away .
He deserved a little punishment .
And so she put the screws to him––for another three seconds .
“ I ’d love to . ”
And there it was already , that word .
She wondered if Leonard had noticed .
She wondered what it meant that she had noticed .
It was just a word , after all .
A way of speaking .
So Madeleine believed , anyway , until she went home with Leonard the next night and stayed for three days .
Leonard had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low - rent student building .
The halls were full of bikes and junk mail .
Stickers decorated the other tenants ’ doors : a fluorescent marijuana leaf , a silk - screen Blondie .
Leonard ’s door , however , was as blank as the apartment inside .
In the middle of the room , a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp .
There was no desk , no bookcase , not even a table , only the nasty couch , with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it .
There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and , in one corner , a small portrait of Leonard , done in pencil .
The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington , wearing a tricornered hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge .
The caption read , “ You go .
I like it here . ”
Madeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine .
A ficus tree endured in the corner .
Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to .
Madeleine , taking pity on the tree , began to water it until she caught Leonard looking at her one day , his eyes narrowed with suspicion .
“ What ? ” she said .
“ Nothing . ”
“ What ? ”
“ You ’re watering my tree . ”
“ The soil ’s dry . ”
“ You ’re taking care of my tree . ”
She stopped doing it after that .
There was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day .
A big greasy wok sat on the stove .
The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal , however , was to pour Grape - Nuts into the wok .
With raisins .
Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement .
The apartment had a message .
The message said : I am an orphan .
Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together , and she never had an answer .
They did n’t do anything .
She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing , really wanting to know .
What did they do ?
She talked ; he listened ; then he talked and she listened .
She ’d never met anyone , and certainly not a guy , who was so receptive , who took everything in .
She guessed that Leonard ’s shrinklike manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself , and though one of her rules about dating was never to date guys who went to shrinks , Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition .
Back home , she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks .
They called it “ having a heavy . ”
If a boy approached during one , the girls would look up and give warning : “ We ’re having a heavy . ”
And the boy would retreat .
Until it was over .
Until the heavy had passed .
Going out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time .
Whenever she was with him , Leonard gave her his full attention .
He did n’t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Barry had , but he made it clear that he was available .
He offered little advice .
Only listened , and murmured , reassuringly .
People often fell in love with their shrinks , did n’t they ?
That was called transference and was to be avoided .
But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink ?
What if your shrink ’s couch was already a bed ?
And plus it was n’t all heavy , the heavies .
Leonard was funny .
He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice .
His head sank into his shoulders , his eyes filled with rue , as his sentences drawled on .
“ Did I ever tell you I play an instrument ?
The summer my parents got divorced , they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo .
The people next door were Latvian , the Saulitises .
And they both played the kokle .
Do you know what a kokle is ?
It ’s sort of like a zither , but Latvian .
“ Will you shut up about ‘ Lost ’ already ! ” Facebook

“ Anyway , I used to hear the Saulitises playing their kokles over in the next yard .
It was an amazing sound .
Sort of wild and overstimulated on the one hand , but really sad on the other .
The kokle is the manic - depressive of the string family .
I was bored to death that summer .
And I used to sit on my grandparents ’ porch , listening to the Saulitises playing next door .
That sound really got to me .
I was sixteen .
Six foot one .
One hundred and thirty - eight pounds .
A major reefer smoker .
I used to get high in my bedroom and then I ’d go out to the porch to listen .
Sometimes other people came over to the Saulitises ’ .
Other kokle players .
They set up lawn chairs in the back yard and they ’d all sit there playing together .
It was an orchestra !
A kokle orchestra !
Then one day they saw me watching over the fence and invited me over .
They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Saulitis how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons .
I used to go over there every day .
They had an old kokle they let me borrow .
I used to practice five , six hours a day .
I was into it .
When Jack Kerouac first coined the term ' the Beats ' for his loose - knit group of world - weary bohemians , he meant it in the sense that they were outsiders - a dangerous , free - thinking underclass .
But the Beats ' empathy for jazz and , in particular , the free - form bebop of Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk , brought with it a glamorised fancy for heroin .
As with so many working musicians , the pioneers of bebop eased their pressures with the needle .
And just as the misadventures of Pete Doherty would be news today , Charlie Parker made the front pages in 1946 after a Sunset Strip binge led to his being committed for electro - shock treatment .
The kids loved him for it .
Assuming a direct correlation between their jazz heroes ' habits and their inspired musical improvisations , the Beats began experimenting , too .
In an era where teenagers were carving their own niche and so to be ' hip ' was everything , a fledgling youth movement was , for the first time , fuelled by narcotics .
As Miles Davis noted in his autobiography : ' People were considered hip if they shot smack . '
With their subterranean fusion of radical jazz , their stream - of - consciousness compositions and their acquiescence to the languorous medications of smack , Kerouac redefined Beat 's meaning to embrace the ' beat ' - ific vibe of the time , and the drowsy ambivalence of heroin 's afterburn .
' I 'm beat ' in Fifties New York would equate to ' I 'm done in ' today .
But the laid - back , live - and - let - live philosophy the term espouses sowed the seeds of Flower Power when the Beats went West .
But before Beat turned to free love , there was an equal and opposite reaction to the Beatniks ' pretensions across the Atlantic in London 's Soho .
Annexing their moniker from the modernists first described in Colin MacInnes ' 1959 novel Absolute Beginners , London 's original mods started to congregate among the coffee bars and clubs of Wardour Street in 1960 .
Eschewing the threadbare , wayfaring look of the beatniks , the mods favoured neat , tailored clothing and a correspondingly upbeat philosophy for life .
They bucked the trend for binge - drinking and generally getting ' out of it ' , preferring a music , lifestyle and drug choice based on mental and sartorial acuity .
Where the beatniks preferred barbiturates or downers , the mods were all about uppers .
Up until 1964 , amphetamines with street names like Bennies and Dexies were both legal and commonplace , often prescribed for fatigue , weight loss , and respiratory and heart complaints .
Universally known as Purple Hearts , Dinaml was the most popular high street pep pill of its time .
Its side - effects , as described in moralistic detail in the accompanying use and dosage leaflet of the day , might just as well have been broadcast as a come - hither to the mod community : ' Do not exceed the stated dose .
Can cause incidence of euphoria , enhanced wakefulness , increased physical activity , decreased appetite , increased respiration and feelings of power , strength , self - assertion and enhanced motivation . '
All around the country , women were popping a couple with their elevenses to help chase away the cobwebs , the blues and those pesky extra pounds around their hips .
All over London , their sons and daughters raided their medicine cabinets for night fuel .
Above all , mods were night crawlers .
They flocked to coffee bars instead of pubs , not just because they sneered at drunks but because most of these newfangled cappuccino bars boasted 2 am licences ( pubs shut at 10.30 ) .
They also had jukeboxes long before the boozers , allowing the young ones to wash down their Bennies with a frothy coffee and dance to the Who , Small Faces , the Kinks or the Pretty Things , whose ' Midnight to Six ' is perhaps the quintessential mod track .
The mods ' soul brothers were the rude boys from Ladbroke Grove , Brixton and Harlesden .
Nattily dressed in tonic suits and pork pie hats , the rude boys were the sons of the sticksmen - the Windrush generation , brought up on the ska and bluebeat of their parents ' birthplace .
But in 1968 , back in Jamaica , the scene was changing .
Artistes like Toots Hibbert of the Maytals were slowing the backbeat right down .
Reggae was lilting and gently mesmeric , as though crafted for the weed that inspired its form and theology .
Reggae quickly became the soundtrack to an increasingly politicised young Jamaica .
With the arrival of bands such as the Pioneers and the Wailers ( featuring Peter Tosh and Bob Marley ) , the nascent reggae scene began to embrace sociopolitical and religious themes and , particularly , the growing influence of Rastafarianism on Jamaican youth .
The smoking of cannabis in its purest form ( grass , or ganja , as opposed to pot ) became as intrinsic a part of the Rasta 's holy trinity as the Ethiopian flag and the choppy skank of reggae 's rhythm guitar .
For Rastas , the smoking of herb or ganja is a spiritual act , often an accompaniment to bible - reading , with reggae the musical backbeat to both the religion and the way of life .
And while the music made occasional reference to the darker practices of freebase and ' icing ' ( most notably Dillinger 's 1978 anthem ' Cocaine ' ) , reggae 's constant referencing of kaya ( cannabis leaf ) , collie men ( weed dealers ) and Mary Jane ( marijuana ) celebrates it as a spliff culture .
Cannabis was helping shape the development of the North Beach hipsters in San Francisco , too .
When Kerouac , Allen Ginsberg , Neal Cassady and the rest of the NY alternative community upped from Greenwich Village to San Francisco in 1962 , they found a melange of counter - cultural ideas , individuals and music .
A whole new scene was springing up around the ornate but dilapidated Haight - Ashbury area : clubs , ' happenings ' and young bands with grandiose names like the Grateful Dead , Jefferson Airplane and the Quicksilver Messenger Service .
Something was afoot .
There was also a folk scene based around The Cabale Creamery in Berkeley that began to fuse the anti-war philosophies of its regulars with a general drift towards Native American spiritualism and the kind of back - to - nature frugality espoused in Henry Thoreau 's utopian classic Walden .
The Creamery 's co-founder , Chandler Laughlin , favoured free - flowing garments and headbands in the Native American tradition , and the younger followers of the folk scene began dressing similarly .
One of their number was Owsley Stanley , a studious young man who spent his time manufacturing a drug whose complex name - lysergic acid diethylamide - was quickly abbreviated to three initials : LSD .
And while pot served its purpose , often hallucinogenic , LSD was the drug the foundling hippy communities had been waiting for .
Laughlin discovered The Red Dog Saloon , an isolated club in the desert , and brought his followers out for what would turn out to be the world 's first hippy ' happening ' .
Projecting Bill Ham 's surreal oil and colour lightshow against the walls , and encouraging the notion that no boundary should exist between performers and crowd , Laughlin mixed together the best of the alt - folk scene with the emerging Haight - Ashbury bands and a load of LSD .
By dawn , psychedelia was born .
The scene and its acolytes moved from the desert back to San Francisco and , on 16 October 1965 , the first self - billed psychedelic rock show took place at the Longshoreman 's Hall .
Advertised as ' A Tribute to Doctor Strange ' and attended by 1,000 devotees , the gig featured the Marbles and Jefferson Airplane , who invited their followers on stage to sip acid - spiked punch from a gigantic chalice .
By January 1966 such gigs , hosted by Ken Kesey under his banner the Trips , were bringing in 10,000 hippies a night , with thousands more turned away .
Kids were descending on San Francisco expressly to join the commune of peace , love and experimentation as it moved onwards to bigger and bigger homes , such as The Fillmore and The Avalon Ballroom .
The tentacles and tenets of hippydom reverberated all around the world , but as with every bolshy new scene that drags itself kicking and screaming into the world with all the brio , vim and attitude of the here and now , hippies and their music inevitably became a sad parody of themselves .
Instead of the vibrant terrorism of Jimi Hendrix or the astral psychedelia of Sergeant Pepper , we had soppy long - hair bands who happened to smoke pot and down mushrooms , culling the sixth - form imagery and iconography of Tolkien and Dungeons and Dragons .
We had Yes .
We had Gong . But , as Jean - Jacques Burnel warned , ' Something better change . '
The punks were coming .
From the first three - chord blasts of the Ramones , Sex Pistols and the Clash , punk was shock - treatment for the disaffected teens .
It was fast , furious , short and bittersweet .
Songs were the antithesis of those 20 - minute aural symphonies the likes of ELP and Rick Wakeman had been getting away with in the early to mid-Seventies .
Most proto - punk anthems were two - minute garage thrash - bangs and the drugs of choice , too , were fast , cheap and often DIY .
Amphetamine sulphate , speed , was everywhere , its crushed - tight powder geometrically folded into Stanley blade - sized wraps .
Amyl nitrate , too ( called rush before the gay community coined poppers , after its pupil - dilating effects ) , sniffed straight from the 10 - bob bottle .
Anything that would induce an immediate energetic charge to complement the adrenalised urgency of the music would fit the bill .
Anything sluggish or introspective was condemned as hippy shit .
Yet , for all the similarities in the two scenes ' backgrounds and fanbases , punk 's drugging was quite unlike the pill - popping hedonism of the mod world .
Mod was , generally , an aspirational and forward - looking code , whereas punk was rebellious and nihilistic , kicking against the system with youthful fury .
Punk 's narcotic sideshow was scuzzy , cheap and often home - made .
Prior to a Psychedelic Furs gig at Eric 's Club , Liverpool , a young man dumped a plastic bag on to a table top , with thick , crystalline powder spilling out .
After the slightest hesitation , a dozen eager fingers began dabbing , licking , slurping , dabbing again .
That man , now one of the foremost backline technicians on the live - band circuit , laughed : ' Go easy , will you .
That 's only just out the oven !'
The club was raided by the drugs squad later that night and was closed down , never to re-open .
The fast times were , for the time being at least , brought to a halt .
Just as particular sociopolitical climates stimulated the special musical / narcotic relationships that led to the growth of reggae culture , for example , or punk , so too can economic conditions depress a generation 's creative output .
A direct product of the youth unemployment that accompanied Margaret Thatcher 's first term in office was a country - wide heroin epidemic among the young .
Heroin is an opiate , a soporific and it's no co-incidence that much of what passed for youth culture in the early to mid-Eighties was retrospective and nostalgic .
Yet one of the Eighties ' more idiosyncratic underground scenes grew exponentially from the inertia of dole - life .
Bored and listless , eking their giro out over its fortnightly dawdle , teenagers fell back on the consolations of smack and pot .
This was a life spent lying down , waiting for a better day and its curious soundtrack was a pick - and - mix culled from the catalogues of Frank Zappa , Pink Floyd , Simon & Garfunkel , Soft Machine , Peter Gabriel 's Genesis and , curiously , Chris de Burgh .
The progeny of the former working classes were now hitting the bong .
But while this was , in the main , a passive and slow - travelling phenomenon , mainly confined to the northwest , at weekends it grew wings .
In the form of jobbing cabaret bands such as Groundpig , the Munchies and Drama , the first of our tribute super - groups were starting to find a huge and grateful constituency among a young , under - waged crowd who simply wanted to let off steam among themselves .
At its primal core , this was the tribal precursor to acid house .
For a scene to be genuinely innovative , it needs its own high - octane fuel .
It needs that all - too - rare synthesis of right time , right place , right crowd , right music .
And above all , it needs the right drug .
So when ecstasy filtered its sinuous way through basement clubs of London in 1986 , it lit the well - laid gunpowder trail to one of the UK 's great cultural explosions .
So many diverse yet empathetic little subcultures were waiting to be dragged in under that one great star - spangled panoply as 1986 became 1987 .
Warehouse parties , house music , rock bands such as New Order using DJs and samplers , the disco revival , the Wag - club - led return of working - class football dandies to the dance floor - and not just here but in Amsterdam , in Chicago and in Ibiza , of course .
All these crazy little strands , waiting to explode , and ecstasy threw the switch .
From its earliest incarnations with Daryll Pandy , Baby Ford , S - Express and Bomb The Bass , right through to the golden age of Madchester , it was the acid in acid house that made the genre sparkle .
Ecstasy , or MDMA , was unusual in that the drug had been developed by Merck not to cure anything specific , but to make people talk to one another .
In its earliest trials , MDMA was intended to help revive marriages that had hit a stale patch .
But ecstasy 's ability to induce communal euphoria allied to coruscating light shows , and a new tribe of DJs who came from the dance floor themselves and knew how to build a crowd 's delirium , meant acid house was an overnight phenomenon .
And where punk grew roots at its own pace , developing its notoriety through fanzines , word of mouth and specialist night - time radio , gradually spreading nationwide , acid was the stuff of tabloid furore .
But this time the copycat rave syndrome did n't kill the genre dead .
As quickly as the tabloid version of acid house filtered down to youth clubs and high - street pulling palaces , the sheer invention fostered by the drug itself and the communities it inspired led to side movements , subtle shifts in the tempo and the nuances of dance music from Balearic to New Beat .
And it all led inexorably to indie dance .
Of all the great pop repercussions to result from the marriage of MDMA and disco music , the gurning faces of Happy Mondays '
Bez , stage left and Barry Mooncult of Flowered Up , stage right , best crystallise its inspired lunacy .
Here were bands who took the purest ethic of punk - get guitar , make stuff up , play - mashed it all up with seductive drum loops , throbbing bass samples and irresistible dance - floor ' riddims ' , then asked their mates to dance on stage .
It was back to the days of Aquarius , where nothing could ever be deemed excessive , no contribution lesser in value than another .
So when Bez began regularly to lope onstage with the Ryder brothers , bug - eyed and slack - jawed , shaking his maracas like an electrocuted grasshopper , it was going to take something magnificent , and some industrial dosage of drugs , to trump his act .
Barry Mooncult , who donned an all - in - one planet suit and proceeded to walk up and down in front of the band , smiling , was that ace .
One of the century 's last great ' happenings ' , set to a repetitive four - four beat as Shoreditch Town Hall rioted , felt like a moment that might never be bettered .
And it still feels that way .
Maybe grime and dubstep would n't sound as alien and paranoid as it does without the stupefying effects of powerful hydroponic skunk .
New rave seemed briefly to get its kicks out of ketamine .
Rod Stanley , editor of Dazed & Confused magazine , has a thought : ' No one has really " invented " or discovered a new drug for a while .
Every time one has been found over the decades , young people swiftly work out the best music experience to go with it , ' he says .
' If a new drug were discovered today , a new music scene would spring up overnight . '
But with scenes like techtonik making a virtue of being wholly drug - and alcohol - free , one has to wonder whether the links between music and drugs are finally breaking down .
Hawaii had the perfect blend of beaches , jungles , and arid areas .
And once our writers developed the idea of the flashback story for our characters , Honolulu and the rest of the island was utilized for everything from war - torn Iraq to Korea , Britain , Berlin , and Moscow with snow .
Were other locations considered before Oahu was selected for filming ?
What were they ?
Why Hawaii ?
The original location scout for the pilot occurred before I joined the show .
The producers had decided that Australia was probably the best place for Lost , based on the research they had done .
They were headed for Australia with a stopover in Hawaii , but at the last minute they decided to take a look at Hawaii before continuing on .
They spent a couple of days on Oahu and found everything they needed .
No one ever went to Australia .
When it is right , you select the place and get to work .
I joined the show the day they returned because I heard it was going to be in Hawaii , a place I fell in love with when I was 13 and learned to surf there .
The final episode of Lost has been filmed , and in just a few weeks we ’ll know all the secrets of the island ( we 're joking , of course — this show is bound to leave us guessing ) .
But what we can know , in certain terms , is what it was like to shoot on Oahu and the location of the survivors ’ beach camp .
We can also discover how the crew created a Tunisian desert and a snowy Buffalo , New York , on a lush tropical island .
Or why John Locke is so good at throwing knives and Kate seems so comfortable climbing into the jungle canopy .
We caught up with executive producer Jean Higgins to find out some of the secrets of the show .
Then check out our Lost travel guide , so you can see the island like an Oceanic Flight 815 castaway ( without the smoke monster ) .
— Mary Anne Potts
The show has really spanned the globe in all seasons .
How did you accommodate such diverse settings from a tropical island ?
I think the words " adapt " and " innovate " would best sum up the production of Lost .
It was always a challenge to get a script with descriptions like , " We are in the Tunisian desert … " It is a credit to our Location and Art departments that they could come up with things like the coral quarry on the west side of the island that became the Tunisian desert .
With the help of horses , costumes , and a little green screen to extend the horizon , we were there .
The first time we were asked to do snow it was supposed to be winter in Buffalo , New York .
I thought on that one for a while …
Suddenly came to me that because we were on an island , all the food had to be shipped in or out on refrigerated ships .
We just had to find the company that blew ice into the holds of the ships and we would have snow .
It took ten dump trucks full of shaved ice , and we had to shoot quickly because the temperature was about 80 degrees .
But we made half a block of Chinatown in Honolulu look like Buffalo .
The beauty of making Lost was that we all agreed when we started that we would push the envelope artistically .
I never wanted to tell the writers , “ We ca n't do this ; ” we had to find a way .
The scripts were so well written and the characters so well drawn that the production needed to be on that level as well .
But we were on a piece of real estate that is farther away from any other landmass on the planet .
So due to our location , we were a " low tech " show .
We could not call the rental house in Hollywood and order up what we needed for the day , we had to figure out different ways around our challenges to get the shots we wanted .
For example , lacking certain types of motion picture cranes on the island , we developed what became a standing joke with the crew , a " ladderpod " [ pictured above ] .
Our grips took three aluminum extension ladders and married them together with a plate designed to accept a camera head .
It became a way to get high shots where you could not take a crane or another device .
Locke is always throwing knives .
Richard just did a major scene on horseback .
Kate seems to always be up and down trees .
Desmond goes sailing .
Sawyer took a canoe over to the other island .
Do the actors get special training in specific adventure skills before shooting ?
Our cast members are excellent physical actors , as well as being wonderful actors who can play the range of emotion called for .
Terry O'Quinn ( John Locke ) is a consummate actor .
Knowing that he would be called upon to throw the knives , he practiced for hours .
Nestor Carbonell ( Richard Alpert ) had a part this year where his character was in the 1800s and he had to ride a horse .
When we asked Nestor if he could ride , he told us he could but had not for some time .
We gave him some " brush up " lessons to make sure that he was comfortable with the horse he would ride and the period saddle that was required .
Evangeline Lilly ( Kate Austen ) is a natural tree hugger .
She did most of her own climbing — there is a harness and safety line that you cannot see and a stunt coordinator standing by for safety .
Henry Ian Cusick ( Desmond Hume ) sails the boat in the story .
But the sailboats we used are large .
They have to be to fit the actors and the crew filming them — so they can not be sailed by one person , so there was usually someone below deck helping out .
Josh Holloway ( James " Sawyer " Ford ) has had a boat of his own for a long time .
He was a natural paddler , and if you look we usually put him in the steersman position at the back , which is the most difficult .
And of course , everyone gets gun training from the propmen , who have the weapons license .
When Sawyer jumped out of the helicopter in Season 5 , did he do his own stunt ?
Sawyer jumping out of the helicopter was a great shot .
I am lucky because in addition to producing Lost in Hawaii , I get to be 2nd Unit Director for all of the aerial and underwater sequences .
Having an actor jump out of a helicopter is far too dangerous .
ABC and the Insurance department would never let us have Josh jump out of a helicopter , and rightly so .
From a studio - production standpoint , if injured , he would be unable to continue filming , which is why we have stunt doubles .
Michael Trissler — our Stunt Coordinator — and Josh 's stunt double did the jump from 90 feet .
If it is a question of running or jumping logs while racing through the jungle , then the actors usually do it themselves .
Our Greens department would go through the path and removed anything that will trip or cause harm prior to us shooting .
Each scene looks to be in complete wilderness .
Is that the case , or is civilization just out of view ?
Many of our scenes are far into the wild .
All of our vans used to transport cast and crew and stakebed trucks are four - wheel drive .
Each department also has a fleet of " mules , " or ATV vehicles capable of carrying equipment .
There are some beautiful places , like Kualoa Ranch , which we use often .
Kualoa is the exquisitely beautiful valley with the high walls .
Legend has it that the valley is so beautiful that the Hawaiians , when paddling by in their canoes , were not allowed to look at it unless they were royalty .
And while all the scenes appear to be completely in the wilderness , many times we are at the edge of the road .
This is the film business , and while we want the look wild , we still have to be fiscally responsible .
Trekking far into the wild takes time , which is time which could be spent filming .
And time of course is money .
We have a budget for visual effects to remove telephone poles and paint out buoys and boats in the ocean , which occur from time to time .
Where is the beach where the survivors have their camp ?
Is it somewhere travelers can go ?
The survivor beach camp was located at Police Beach .
This is a private beach owned by the Kamehameha Trust , located east of Halie 'wa on the North Shore .
They have been wonderful to us — it is the best backlot I have ever had .
It is roughly 500 acres of beaches , coves , jungle , coconut grove , and savannah .
We were able to shoot many , many diverse scenes there .
We could be arriving on a beach in the morning and shooting a scene in the deep jungle the same night .
Travelers can see one of the small beaches we have used , called Markers Cove , which is right next to the property .
How about the jungle ?
Is that in a park ?
There are many jungle areas that we use .
We have always differentiated between the jungles — you will see the lush , green jungles ; the jungle with the vines hanging down ; and then what we referred to as the " dark territory " jungles .
The stunning dark jungles are located along the Old Pali Road , just a couple of miles from downtown Honolulu .
These are beautiful , original growth jungles with incredible banyan trees .
We have done a lot of work along the Judd Trail , which is open to the public and a wonderful hike .
This same look can be found in the Manoa area north of the university .
We have used jungles in He'eia ( an unincorporated park not open to the public ) , at Kualoa Ranch , and , of course , at our own Police Beach location .
We have also a different kind of jungle at the Turtle Bay Hotel and Resort .
There is a stand of banyan trees there that take your breath away .
We have used the jungle at Waimea Falls Park , which is an arboretum , bird sanctuary , and has a waterfall .
Waimea is open to the public and I would definitely recommend it .
And , of course , just opposite on the ocean side is the incredible Waimea Bay , where we have also shot .
Did aspects of indigenous Hawaiian culture influence any of the sets or scenes ?
The Hawaiian culture did not influence our on - screen persona — if you look at the temples and the architecture of the sets our cultural roots were more a combination of Egyptian , Roman , and Asian .
But the culture definitely affected our living and working styles — all for the better .
We truly became an ohana , family in the Hawaiian language , both at work and off hours .
The crew was close - knit and kickball tournaments , surfing at lunch and on weekends happened all the time .
I also think the cast was able to have a much more private life thanks to the Hawaiian culture .
If we had been in Hollywood , they would have been hounded by the press .
But here there is a much more " give them their space " laid - back approach .
The cast could actually go to the beach and not be bothered .
It was only if some mainland newspaper had sent over some paparazzi that they were hounded .
How have you dealt with or embraced the weather associated with the tropical climate ?
Did any tropical critters cause problems ?
Hawaii truly is a paradise .
There is nothing here that can really trouble you and nothing that will kill you .
There are no snakes -- only one , in the zoo , Monty the Python .
There are snake fences at the airport and if one is detected coming in from one of the planes ( they get in the wheel wells ) , there is an entire patrol that goes after it .
There are no sand mites or leaches .
What they do have are small scorpions ( painful , but not deadly ) and centipedes ( also painful , but not deadly ) .
We always had to be careful when we went back to the survivor camp after shooting other places for a while .
We would have to make sure all the bedding , airline seats , and tents were shaken out to make sure the scorpions and centipedes had not taken up residence .
Here in Hawaii , we have only the wet season and the dry season .
If it rains , it only rains for an hour or so and then passes through , so we 'd just wait it out .
It makes for difficult shooting days , but we never stop shooting even with delays of up to an hour and a half .
Sometimes the rain is so light that even though we are getting wet you cannot see it through the lens , so we 'd keep shooting .
But in Season 2 , it rained for 42 days straight .
We were about to have the Construction crew start building an ark !
We juggled our shooting schedule and so never stopped shooting , but there are a lot of wet sequences in that season .
The biggest problem with the constantly changing sky as clouds blow through is for our Director of Photography , who has to make the lighting match from shot to shot no matter what the sun is doing at the moment .
Do the cast and crew have any favorite off - hours adventures ?
Kayaking ?
Hiking ?
Diving ?
Can you tell us who and where ?
The cast does pretty much everything everyone else does here — lots of swimming , most of them surf , some windsurfing , some of them scuba dive , lots of them hike .
Ian is a runner .
I think the nicest thing is that they have a lot of time with their families for these kinds of activities .
The cast is spread out on the island with many of them in Kailua , some in Hawaii Kai , some in Kahala , and one is out on the North Shore .
( And if I told you who and where then I would be violating their privacy ! )

Yesterday , during an interview with Andrew Warner at Mixergy , I spoke about my early work experience bagging groceries , selling shoes , pumping gas , etc .
There ’s nothing particularly unique about these jobs – they are common jobs .
But they taught me some important lessons about people , how they decide what to buy , and what really matters to them .
Selling shoes ( and tennis rackets ) twenty years ago reminded me of selling software today .
The shoe world and tennis racket world are very much like the software world .
Manufactures pitch features and technological advantages but customers judge the products in an entirely different way .
When I worked at this golf and tennis pro shop selling shoes and rackets , brand reps would come by and tell the staff about the latest products .
They ’d explain the new EVA midsole in this shoe , and the Goodyear rubber outsole in that shoe .
They ’d talk about flex grooves , heel notches , cushioning systems , etc .
They ’d talk about graphite frames , widebody rackets , sweetspots , etc .
On paper these were strong selling points , but in the store very few people cared .
Here ’s how most people found a shoe and decided if it was right for them .
They ’d walk up to the pegboard wall where the shoes were lined up .
They ’d pick up a few , spin ‘em around , and put them back .
Then they ’d hone in on one of them because they liked the way it looked .
They ’d ask for their size , I ’d bring it out , and they ’d try it on .
They ’d jam their thumb between their big toe and the tip of the shoe to see if it fit .
Then they ’d maybe bounce around a bit or “ hard walk ” to see how the cushioning felt .
Then they ’d look in the mirror to see how it looked .
They ’d they ’d buy it or repeat the process with another shoe .
The technology did n’t matter .
The number of flex grooves did n’t matter .
The chemical composition of the insole , midsole , and outsole did n’t matter .
What mattered were the absolute basics :
Do I like the way it looks , does it fit , and is it comfortable .
Sold .
All the other things that we were told about the shoe could never represent themselves in a 3 minute try - on anyway .
Sole durability did n’t matter now .
All the soles were equally durable during a 3 minute walk around on a carpeted store floor .
Any talk about a midsole went right over their head .
All they knew was “ this felt good ” or “ this is too narrow ” or “ this rubs my big toe ” or “ ooh , this is comfortable . ”
I could explain this stuff all day long , but their realization always trumped my explanation .
This is n’t to say that some people did n’t take the features and technology seriously , but it is to say most – nearly all – did n’t .
They did n’t care about the same things the manufacturer cared about .
And they certainly did n’t see the world the same way the brand rep saw the world .
The customer wanted the simple things done well .
Their evaluation consisted of a few key things : look , fit , and comfort .
And that ’s it .
The same thing was true for tennis rackets .
We were armed with every last fact about every last racket , but here ’s how people picked a racket : 1 . Their friend or tennis pro told them to buy it , or 2 .
They picked it up , did a few fake swings , bounced their hand off the strings , pictured themselves holding it on the court , and either bought it or repeated the same test with another racket .
Often times they ’d ask if it came in another color .
No one asked about the size of the sweetspot , and very few cared about fiberglass vs. graphite .
Some did , most did n’t .
They cared about how it looked , how it felt , how much it weighed , and if their friends would approve .
I could move people to this racket or that racket with some fancy facts , but most people made up their own mind based on a set of pre-determined criteria that had more to do with their own preferences than the brand ’s preferences .
I saw the same thing when I worked at the grocery store .
From the types of labels people read to the number of bags they wanted to take home .
People would opt for clarity , comfort , and convenience .
Yeah , spreading out groceries across 3 bags may have technically been better , but that meant they ’d have to make another trip to their car when bringing their groceries in their house .
They wanted simple .
One trip , done .
It all reminds me of the software business .
The industry is obsessed with touting features while the public is obsessed an entirely different set of criteria :
Does it solve my basic problems and is it easy to use ?
Does it make sense ?
Do I understand it ?
The real lesson for me is this : People want the basics done well .
Does it look good , does it feel good , is it comfortable , is it clear , is it easy ?
No matter what you ’re selling , those seem to be the things that really matter .
Get those right and you ’ve got a great shot at building a successful product and business .
Yet another supposed expert has taken to a national forum today to announce that women are dumb .
But arguments like his are n't just harmless flame - bait : they 're an excuse for perpetuating inequality .

What sets Prof. Richard Lynn 's piece in ( of course ) the Daily Mail apart from , say , Larry Summers 's notorious comments is the sheer broadness of his argument .
Lynn is n't just saying , as Summers did , that men and women may have genetic differences in math and science ability — rather , he claims that " on average , men are more intelligent than women . "
And not only are women less fit than men to be scientists and engineers ( an all - too - common view , despite Lynn 's claim to be stating an unpopular opinion ) , but " a clear and rather startling imbalance emerges between the sexes at the high levels of intelligence that the most demanding jobs require . "
That 's right — women suck not just at , say , astrophysics , but at " demanding jobs " in general .
Lynn notes that girls ' educational achievements would seem to belie this notion , but explains " the blame lies with our exam system , with its emphasis on coursework , which rewards diligence more than it does intelligence . "
Of course , the " diligence " argument has long been used to explain away the performance of immigrants and people of color , but Lynn does n't seem particularly concerned with problematic history of the testing of intelligence as it relates to race and gender .
He does , however , love him some prehistory .
He explains ,
We must look to the field of evolutionary psychology for an explanation of why men have emerged as the more intelligent sex .
[ ed.
Bingo !]
As the hunter part of a hunter - gatherer society , men were faced with complex , life - threatening problems that needed solving on a daily basis .
For example , how to kill that elusive deer ?
The hunters that used all their mental capabilities to come up with the answers , successfully killing animals day after day , were clearly the most intelligent .
They were the high - status males of their day and - provocative as it is to say so - must have possessed far sharper minds than those of women engaged in the relatively simple tasks of gathering berries and raising children .
Advertisement
Basically , hunting is hard , and raising kids is easy , which is why dudes got so much smarter .
Lynn does note that " when it comes to verbal intelligence , women match men because , in our hunter - gatherer past , women needed verbal abilities to negotiate their relationships with both men and women and to teach and socialise their children . "
But since " verbal abilities " are a girl thing , they 're a sidebar to the real intelligence that forms the basis of Lynn 's argument .
Which reaches his crux when he writes , " why should society struggle so hard - and so expensively - to try to engineer a perfect balance between the sexes ?
By all means , take steps to ensure that boys and girls get the same opportunities in education , but let 's also accept that those same opportunities will not produce the same outcomes . "
All mockery aside ( tempting as it is to poke fun at Lynn 's comparison of his own contentions to " Galileo 's theory that Earth revolved around the Sun " ) , we 're still so far from equal opportunity that we can't yet make any predictions about outcome .
And this is why the assertion that we need to accept women 's lesser intelligence always seems so bizarre — when social inequalities are , at least to this " outraged feminist , " so obvious and pressing , why go looking for evo-psych explanations ?
The answer : because those explanations mean we do n't have to change anything , and we can just tell women to accept their ( lesser ) lot and like it .

Sorry , Men ARE More Brainy Than Women ( And More Stupid Too ! )
It 's A Simple Scientific Fact , Says One Of Britain 's Top Dons [ Daily Mail ]
In the Life of Brian , a 1979 comedy from the Monty Python team , the hero ends up whistling the song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life despite having his hands nailed on each side of a cross .
Sound familiar ?
Last weekend , Tony Hayward left for a yacht outing two days after a very public crucifixion on Capitol Hill .
So was this a sign that he is a born optimist , convinced things can only get better -- or simply an admission that he might as well enjoy himself for a couple of days given he 's likely to lose his job over the oil spill disaster in any case ?
Retaining an upbeat tone , in an email to staff last Friday , Hayward again pledged to get [ BP ] through the immediate crisis as a stronger and safer company .
That was after a week that saw a congressional grilling , credit downgrades to just above junk status , a pledge to pay $ 20 billion into a cleanup and compensation fund and a freeze in dividend payouts for the rest of 2010 .

Over the last couple of months several devices have been touted as iPad competitors , some even as iPad killers .
It would seem that nothing could be furthest from the truth then those first comments about several different devices .
In just a couple of days we have had news that HP has moved to acquire Palm , a maker of smartphones which has put a lot of effort into creating its own mobile operating system and that Microsoft has canceled its internal development project on the dual screen mobile device that was being called Courier .
Why are these two fact so significant ?
Let ’s start by looking at the HP acquisition of Palm …
From the beginning it has been clear to me that Windows 7 just is n’t going to cut it as tablet operating system to compete with the iPad ’s iPhone OS .
It would seem that some people at HP recognized this fact and moved to secure a promising OS from a team with great experience in working in the mobile world and with touch interfaces , but from a company that lacked HP ’s deeper pockets to be able to push harder .
This is a smart move by HP and one that may provide the missing element for HP to compete with Apple : an OS it has total control over and that can be tailored to HP ’s devices .
As a consequence of the move to acquire Palm and its intellectual property HP seems to have delayed the release of its Slate tablet .
Delaying the Slate makes good sense as ( running Windows 7 ) it would be a poor competitor for the iPad and it might tarnish the brand as it moves to produce and release a device running a properly developed ( from the ground up ) touch - based mobile operating system .
So , while it is possible that HP might still release the Windows powered Slate tablet , I would n’t hold my breath waiting for it .
Then we have Microsoft ’s Courier project .
This has never been more than a leaked story or rumor , a rumor that seemed to be true in essence but not in detail .
It would seem that Microsoft never intended to released the Courier as a product but was instead using it as a testbed for new technologies .
This is a common practice of Microsoft ’s research branch .
So it would seem that the Courier that some considered to be a worthy response from Microsoft to the iPad is , in the end , nothing of the sort .
A pity .
A company with Microsoft ’s history deserves better than to just dwindle away , but that is what is going to happen if they do n’t get their act together pretty soon .
There were several other devices that caught the attention of the technology media and blogs or at least a lot of rumors .
One other tablet to have figured prominently in the news recently was the JooJoo , from a Singapore based company named Fusion Garage .
This device which looks very good in theory got bad reviews from those that tried , as you can see if you follow the link to Engadget .
There was a lot of talk about the device up till about a month ago but there was also a lot of talk about a lot of pre-orders for the device being canceled before it actually shipped .
These are , however , rumors as far as I know .
The JooJoo though now a shipping product does n’t seem to have a snowball ’s chance in hell of threatening the iPad as a direct competitor .
Right now the iPad seems to have been given free rein to grow and expand into the Market .

Here 's a mind - melting Juan Rivera infinite regress from Tuesday 's Angels - Rangers game .
[ Screengrab via reader Josh ; video at MLB.com ]
Thursday saw a high quality seminar take place , jointly hosted by Demos 's Open Left project and Soundings .
Its purported aim was to bring together thinkers from across the spectrum of the centre left , with John Cruddas and David Milliband turning up to represent this politically .
Defeat , and economic crisis , certainly broaden the scope of such seminars and the intelligence of the discussion .
It becomes possible for someone like David Milliband to talk about capitalism as something which varies , not least in its injustices , rather than as some autonomous global cash - cow that wo n't ever be questioned .
Meanwhile , those beyond the reaches of Blair 's Big Tent become empowered to talk in less aggrieved terms , now that they feel listened to .
What continues to frustrate me on such occasions is the difficulty posed by that old Humean dilemma , how to move from ' is ' to ' ought ' .
There are various ways that those on the left currently tend to combine empirical and normative claims .
1. Moral tautology : People accuse positivists of speaking in tautologies , but surely moralists do as well .
Perhaps an analytical philosopher can help me out here , but is n't the sentence " we ought to pursue a more just society " actually empty of any meaning ?
Do n't the words ' ought ' and ' just ' cancel each other out ?
This is a charge that is levelled at Kantians and Rawlsians , when they argue that the just action or society is the one that the reasonable and just person would select .
The question is how moral categories can achieve some bite upon the world .
2. Appeal to ' our history ' :
This is never to be under - estimated , but lets not forget that Tony Blair was appealing to ' Labour values ' when he distanced himself from Labour policies .
Weberian ' traditional authority ' ( ' you should obey me because that 's how we do things ' ) is important , but still does n't get you much closer to working out priorities and policies than the moral tautology .
The New Labour neglect of its ' core vote ' wo n't be reversed , simply by quoting Nye Bevan ; it will require working out who that core vote is , who they consider themselves to be , and how they differ and resemble previous ' core votes ' from the past .
3. Utilitarianism : Values often get smuggled into technical economic arguments .
At the moment , this is taking place in the refreshingly grand , politically charged sphere of fiscal argument .
The right and the left argue about whether the deficit really is too high , whether the bond markets really do have the power the media claims , whether deficit reduction really will impede the chances of growth .
Clearly these are latently normative perspectives in conflict , but they purport to be technocratic .
And then we 're on the slippery , de-politicising slope towards ' what matters is what works ' .
4. Ideology :
If there 's one thing ideologies are good for , it 's moving from ' is ' to ' ought ' .
But they leave me feeling a bit how Adorno felt towards religious believers - just because it would be nice and helpful if God did exist , is no reason to ignore the awkward existential possibility of nihilism .
As Marx himself said " I am not a Marxist " .
The reason ideology stifles is that it takes the other three - moralism , history and technocracy - and combines them neatly into a package , which it would otherwise be the job of politics to produce .
What is missing , I suggested at the seminar , is a different account of history , as provided by sociology .
Anthony Giddens took a lot of flack for The Third Way , but that was because ( in Hume 's terms again ) everyone , perhaps even Giddens himself , mistook an ' is ' for an ' ought ' .
To draw the Labour Party 's attention to globalisation , risk cultures , post - industrial production and individualism never had to be a call for even more globalisation , even more auditting , an even bigger retail sector , or even more individualism .
He was n't even a Lord back then !
But it did supply something that ( 1 ) moral tautologies , ( 2 ) reading Tawney , ( 3 ) designing tax credits and ( 4 ) reading Marx could n't do on their own , namely re-ground a political movement in the present and for the future .
Marx wrote that " men make their own history , just not under circumstances of their own choosing " .
Giddens played an important role in reminding people of the second half of that sentence ; unfortunately he also somehow persuaded people to forget the first half , although tragically not when it came to foreign policy .
What is there between a moral instinct and a technocratic problem ?
How 's this for an answer : a publicly expressed and measurable sociological development that demands a collective response .
This means not defining a political movement in terms of this year 's policy agenda ( welfare , immigration ) , nor in terms of new clever policy innovations ( tax credits ) , nor in terms of media myths ( crime ) .
Instead , social history - or rather , capitalist society - will throw up ever new collective threats that capitalism itself will struggle to solve .
In Marxist terms , it produces contradictions that the state 's task is to alleviate ; in neo-classical terms , each epoch has its own defining ' negative externalities ' .
19th century ' Manchester liberalism ' produced the extreme negative externalities of degrading factory conditions , corrosion of family life and disease .
This was publicly expressed , measurable and it demanded a collective response , which it received in the birth of the labour movement .
20th century Fordism collectivised and rationalised the economy , but left individual risks - unemployment , ill - health , old age - as negative externalities .
With the birth of national statistics and national media , these had become publicly expressed , measurable and they demanded a collective response , which they received with the post - 45 political settlement .
So the question is , what might be the equivalents today , that are not only technical problems in need of a technocratic solution , but defining short - comings of contemporary capitalism ?
Here are four , and note that not one of them would have shaped Tony Blair 's thinking fifteen years ago :
Mental ill - health and loneliness : I 've been looking at some policy documents on mental health in the UK , and the figures on its reported rise are quite startling .
Admittedly some stress might need to be on ' reported ' .
But in some respects , depression and anxiety are the supreme negative externalities of consumer - oriented capitalism , generating capitalism 's latest contradiction - that we can drag ourselves outside to shop , but not to produce or co-operate with one another .
Incidentally , recognising this is not in itself a call for more policies to promote , teach or maximise happiness .
Energy scarcity :
We recognise that climate change will be the definining policy challenge of the next century .
Maybe it will eventually lead us towards a more thoroughly planned economy .
But in the medium term , energy prices will rise sharply and Britain will need to produce more energy from renewable ( or else face even higher prices ) .
Current financial structures or corporate structures were n't designed to make this happen .
Energy poverty will get worse .
Yet there are potential co-operative solutions , and no doubt plenty of as - yet - unthought - of ones .
Zero growth :
This is n't really a negative externality , although it is a collective action problem which markets wo n't solve .
What if Britain has no growth for the next decade ?
What if Britain can't pursue its environmental goals at 3 % growth a year ?
The knee - jerk Keynesianism of some on the left amazes me .
Historical sensibility , and the possibility of not being in power for another decade , would require a broader view that did not cling to the policy tools and goals of the latter half of the twentieth century .
Of course national accounts will continue into the future ; but they will not be so prominent for ever .
This is a major challenge for the centre left , that could cripple it .
Housing : Our present financial structures , and culture of ownership , strategically under - deliver housing .
This is hugely socially divisive .
It 's crucial not to view any of these as policy challenges that the state can simply solve , not even if it had all the money it needed , especially the first .
But , strange as it may sound , seemingly intractable collective needs and problems may be more effective bases for political mobilisation and identity than technical faults that require an engineer to come and fix .
Experts will play a role in advising on each of the above , but they cannot promise results .
This too is beneficial for political mobilisation .
I can identify with CND in its endlessly frustrated ambition to erradicate nuclear weapons ; I can't identify with a government department , perhaps least of all the most effective ones .
Far be it from me to tell the Labour Party what it is about .
Maybe none of the above four is relevant or concerning to the left .
What I think the emphasis on " publicly expressed and measurable sociological developments that demand a collective response " can do is to break people out of the previous four traps , in which we swing wildly between moralistic slogans and technical intricacies .
Max Weber argued that to have a vocation for politics was to have a " matter of fact devotion to a cause " .
Take out either the facts or the devotion to a cause , and you end up with something politically inert .
A GROUP of terrorists is planning to kill millions of Americans .
Only one man can stop them : Jack Bauer .
Unfortunately , he has been imprisoned in a secret facility .
And tortured .
Then decapitated and fed to boars .
“ Fortunately , ” says the president 's chief of staff , “ he was trained for exactly that . ”
That was a spoof of “ 24 ” by Dave Barry , a comic writer .
But the real thing is not much more realistic .
In a typical day , Agent Bauer is shot and stabbed more often than he takes bathroom breaks , but it never seems to slow him down .
The last two episodes of the eighth ( and allegedly final ) series of Fox 's hit show , which aired on May 24th , were as furiously absurd as ever .
Russia is involved in a Middle Eastern plot to set off a nuclear weapon in New York , which the American president hushes up for reasons viewers quickly forget because — Dammit Chloe , there 's no time !
— Bauer is disembowelling a bad guy to retrieve a SIM card with vital information on it that he has swallowed .
The central conceit was a brilliant one .
The action takes place in real time .
Each episode is an hour of an action - packed day .
A digital clock ticks loudly on the screen .
The suspense is excruciating .
The show was perfectly timed to resonate with real - world events : it began shortly after September 11th , 2001 .
Yet it long ago lost all contact with reality .
An African general sends frogmen under the White House to assassinate the president .
A private military contractor based in Virginia decides that it would be commercially wise to declare war on the federal government .
And so it goes .
All this is harmless fantasy , of course .
Or is it ?
A disconcerting number of Americans take “ 24 ” seriously .
During a televised debate in 2007 , Tom Tancredo , a Republican presidential candidate , was asked what methods he would authorise to extract information from a terrorist suspect in a “ ticking bomb ” scenario .
“ I 'm looking for Jack Bauer at that time , let me tell you , ” he said .
Bauer routinely tortures terrorists in disgusting ways to save innocent lives .
Being a fictional character , he never tortures the wrong guy or extracts false information .
Real life is not like that .
Yet a Pew poll last year found that half of Americans think that torturing terrorist suspects can “ sometimes ” or “ often ” be justified .
Only a quarter said “ never ” .
Last Friday , the Devils signed both Mattias Tedenby and Jacob Josefson to three - year , entry - level contracts .
The Swedish players , selected only one year apart , will attend both rookie and training camp this season .
But the big question facing both players is this – can they produce immediately ?
This past season was a great showing for Devils ’ prospects .
Players like Mark Fraser , Vladimir Zharkov and Niclas Bergfors all received big minutes and contributed immediately .
Other prospects , such as Matt Halischuk , had smaller roles , but still contributed effectively .
Some players , such as Fraser , have a good opportunity to make the team next season .
And it looks like both Tedenby and Josefson will have the same opportunity .
When talking about both prospects , Devils ’ general manager Lou Lamoriello expected the players to be ready for the NHL .
“ In our opinion we think they should be ready to make the next step to the NHL , ” Lamoriello said to Bergen Record reporter Tom Gulitti .
“ They both had good seasons in the Elite League in Sweden .
They ’ve both had all the international competition they need . ”
Lamoriello even went as far to say he believed there ’s a good chance both players will be on the roster next season , even though he still has yet to find a coach .
With all this positive talk and high expectations surrounding Tedenby and Josefson , I ’d like to take a look at each players and weigh in with my expectations of them for this season .
Mattias Tedenby – LW
Tedenby , from everything I ’ve read , seems to be the real deal .
The Swedish winger , only 5 ’ 9 ″ tall , possess great speed and even better offensive creativity .
Tedenby , the Devils 2008 first - round pick ( 24th overall ) , does n’t shy away from contact , seemingly willing to throw his body around and play physical hockey .
Scouts have also praised his acceleration , and some even compare him with Zach Parise .
But there ’s always some flaws as well .
In the reports I ’ve read , Tedenby gets bashed for not playing good defensive hockey .
Some scouts believe he can be too offensive minded , which diminishes his backchecking and defensive abilities .
His size has also been questioned , but it seems like anyone under 5 ’ 11 ” usually faces questions about durability , etc. in the NHL
Overall , Tedenby seems to be a solid NHL prospect .
I do believe he spent some time in camp with the Devils this past offseason , but I could be wrong .
From the reports I ’ve read , he could easily become the next Bergfors and , potentially , the next Parise .
It ’ll be interesting to watch him develop through both rookie and training camp .
I could see Tedenby making the team as a fourth - line winger , with the opportunity to move up the depth chart based on play .
Here ’s some video of a Tedenby goal .
The stickhandling and shot are both pretty nasty :
Continue reading after the jump for the prospect profile of Jacob Josefson .
Jacob Josefson – C
Josefson ’s position gives him an edge of Tedenby to make the team out of camp .
The Devils may lose two centers this summer , with both Rob Niedermayer and Dean McAmmond becoming free agents .
The team also sorely lacks a true second line center , a role which Josefson looks more than ready to fill .
Josefson , only 19 years old , played in the Swedish Elite League the past two seasons , posting a combined 81 points in 84 games .
Josefson has been praised by scouts for his two - way play , something we all know the Devils organization preaches .
They also praise Josefson ’s creativity and playmaking ability .
Josefson also plays a physical game , and is n’t afraid to mix it up .
But , of course , there are some flaws .
Scouts criticize his ability to score goals , calling his shot “ decent . ”
There ’s also a lack of aggression , and scouts would like to see if he can learn how to finish plays himself .
Other than that , most scouting reports could n’t find many flaws with the Swedish center .
Here ’s what one website said about Josefson :
Josefson is the prototypical Devils prospect ; a player who thrives at playing a cerebral , two - way game .
After excelling in the SEL , it seems like Josefson is ready to take the next step .
I expect him to have a solid rookie camp , and if he can earn a spot during training camp , I ’d see a fourth - line role for him .
But do n’t be surprised , if he plays well , to see Josefson get some time as the number two center .
The Devils have lacked someone there for the past few years , and if he plays well he deserves a shot to get that opportunity .
Overall , I think both Tedenby and Josefson will make the team this season .
I think Josefson will contribute slightly more , but expect both players to see time with the Devils next season .
Paul Goble reports :
Faced with a declining number of men in the prime draft age group and increasing resistance even among them , the Russian defense ministry is calling for extending the length of time during which the spring draft will take place , drafting men as old as 30 , reducing the number of deferments and bringing to justice those who illegally avoid service .
If these measures are adopted , the Russian military might be able to fill its draft quota this time around but only at the cost of increasing disruptions in the economy and especially in the lives of young men and of worsening public attitudes toward the military , activists and experts warn .
Russia ’s spring draft began on April 1 and was slated to last until July 15 , but the problems the military has been having with securing enough draftees this time around have been so severe that the General Staff this week offered a series of proposals so that it can reach its quota .
First , Col. Gen. Vasily Smirnov , the Staff ’s deputy head , called for extending the draft to August 31 to give the system a chance to round up more people .
He said that last year , 100,000 individuals refused to serve and that now “ 10,000 [ potential ] draftees do not want to receive ” draft notices .
“ At the same time , ” “ Stoletiye ” reported , Army General Nikolay Makarov , the chief of the General Staff said that approximately 200,000 people are seeking to avoid service and that the military wants to force prosecutors to bring those who are refusing to fulfill their military obligation to justice .
Second , the defense ministry announced that it wants to increase the upper age limit for draftees from 27 to 30 , thereby increasing the size of the draft pool , at least this time around .
And third , the ministry “ proposed reducing by 70 percent the number of higher educational institutions of Russia whose students are deferred from service . ”
All these measures would require parliamentary action .
Viktor Ozerov , the chairman of the defense and security committee of the Federation Council , said that he supported some but not all of these proposals .
And Anatoly Kucherena , a member of the Social Chamber , said that the proposals should be subject to the widest possible public discussion .
But if these two are at least willing to consider the military ’s proposals , others , especially in the activist community , are appalled by what the General Staff has suggested .
Valentina Melnikova , the head of the Union of Committees of Soldiers ’ Mothers , said she was shocked by what commanders want .
In an interview with Svobodnaya Pressa , Melnikova said that the proposals represented “ a putsch by the generals ” and even recalls “ August 1991 . ”
That is because , she continued , Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov had met with her group only nine days ago and told its members that he had no plans of this kind .
Serdyukov was either dishonest , something she does n’t believe , or he did n’t know what his generals were planning , Melnikova added .
If he is in charge , she suggested , the defense minister needs to impose order and dismiss those generals who are acting on their own .
If he is n’t , of course , there is a bigger problem than the arrangements of the current draft cycle .

Apart from all the other scientific facts about the earthquakes , the bible mentions that these are signs of the ends of times .
Luke 21:11 reads the following : " and there will be great earthquakes , and in one place after another pestilences and food shortages " .
To me that is no surprise .
“ The seismic activity has suddenly increased in all the planet ” , explained the Indian seismologist Rajender Chadha in 2007 .
In addition , the number of victims has grown due to the fast increase of the population in zones of risk .
According to the Geologic Service of the United States , the earthquake and tsunami that took place in the Indian Ocean in 2004 was one of the " deadliest " .
Another sign is hunger .
“ There will be food shortages ” , noted Jesus ( Matthew 24:7 ) .
In 2005 , the magazine Science declared : “ 14 % of the world - wide population ( 854 million people ) suffer chronic or acute undernourishment ” .
And in 2007 , the United Nations informed that there were 33 countries incapable to feed his inhabitants .
But , how is this possible when the world - wide grain production is increasing ?
Partly , it must be that the grain of many fields of culture is not destined to the human consumption , but to the ethanol elaboration .
In the developed countries , the rise in the prices of foods forces many to choose between the food and other basic necessities , like medicines or the heating .
Another important sign was the decreasing moral and social values .
The apostle Paul wrote : " But know this , that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here .
For men will be lovers of themselves , lovers of money , self - assuming , haughty , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , disloyal , having no natural affection , not open to any agreement , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , without love of goodness , betrayers , headstrong , puffed up [ with pride ] , lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God , having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power ; and from these turn away . "
( 2 Timothy 3 : 1 -5 ) Are these not the characteristics of many people seen today ?
As you see , the bible has many proofs of the ends of times and one of these are strong earthquakes .
Near Concepcion , Chile there was an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and shortly after an aftershock of 6.9 and diminishing .
A couple of months ago , Haiti had an earthquake .
We are only in March , and so far there have been many " great earthquakes ... in one place after another . "

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Syfy is giving online fans a chance to write and design every aspect of an upcoming Saturday - night creature feature .
The cable network is launching a production site , B Movie Mogul , where fans can vote and pitch ideas for the film , from title , creatures , wardrobe , dialogue and character deaths to promotional taglines .
The resulting “ script ” will be shot as a two - hour Syfy original movie to be released next year .
“ We constantly have fans e-mailing with compliments , complaints and questions about our movies , and this is a way of involving the fans in a new way , ” said Thomas Vitale , executive vp programing and original movies .
“ This is where entertainment is going and just the start of many more things of this nature for Syfy . ”
Syfy is teaming with entertainment site IGN on the site ; the partnership will last 15 months and launch Friday .
The first stage will have fans voting on one of three overall concepts for the movie : a 2010 apocalypse story , a Bermuda Triangle - set creature feature or a Roswell , N.M. - set alien movie .
But the venture raises the question :
What if fans create a lousy movie ?
“ When you have a lot of people working on something , good ideas will come out of it , ” Vitale said .
“ We will have something that will be entertaining . ”

NASA 's mysterious Project M aims to send an android to the Moon inside three years .

The project has n't yet secured NASA funding nor money from the U.S. government , so Project M is far from official , but it's one of the most exciting projects to come down NASA 's R&D pipeline in quite some time , and it 's thought to be very far along in the planning stages .
The idea is to send a stripped - down rocket - after all , a robotic mission wo n't require oxygen , food , or water - to the Moon .
The lone crew member will be a humanoid walking robot whose manipulator arms will closely resemble those of humans .
The robot would operate both independently and under the control of humans back at NASA .

Once the robot is in place , the potential applications are enormous .
Most practically , the robot can be used to test out the engineering logistics of long - term lunar ( or even Martian ) occupation , giving future astronauts a better sense of the challenges faced in building extraterrestrial constructions .
The more advanced manipulator arms would also open up opportunities for more sophisticated scientific experiments than those afforded by more basic rovers .
Perhaps the biggest benefit of Project M , at least in the ( for better or worse ) all - important world of public relations , is its almost absurd ambition .
The project aims to get a robot on the Moon in just three years - you know , around the time Iron Man 3 comes out .
It 's a daring , ambitious project that comes at a time for NASA when , in the wake of the cancellation of Constellation and the retirement of the space shuttles , both seem to be in relatively short supply .
But do n't take our word for it - check out the concept animation below detailing just how Project M would work .

Bruce Schneier on the danger of worst - case thinking :
You ca n’t be too careful !
Actually , you can .
You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes .
You can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child predators .
You can eschew all contact with people because of the possibility of hurt .
He argues that we ’re making bad decisions on the basis of what is possible rather than what is probable .
Does anticipating disaster really make us safer ?
Are the costs worth it ?
Schneier and I agree that one group certainly benefits from this kind of Black Swan doom - and - glooming : screenwriters .
Basically , any fear that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst - case thinking .
When I ’m waiting for a meeting , I ’ll often wonder , “ If Godzilla fell back into this building , knocking it over , would I climb ‘ up ’ or ‘ down ’ to get out ? ”
That ’s somewhat productive thinking for a screenwriter .
For a policy - maker , less so .

Senate bill 1070
Senate bill 1070 has lit a fire under the behind of this country .
After reading the bill it appears the question about its legality is more about being politically correct than a question of law .
The political correctness issue has come into play a lot lately .
It may be because this term is encompassing and just about fits every issue that one might desire to use it on .
The political correctness proponent does not think profiling is legal .
Just because you look like a bank robber complete with bank bag , mask and gun you should not be asked why you are standing in front of the bank .
Is this situation a form of profiling ?
If profiling is illegal , it would be easier for the bank robber to plead the defense of “ no probable cause for the arrest ” if it was not proper for the police to question him / her .
Of course this issue does not bring race into the mix , but what if a witness had described the robber as a black man , or an Asian woman or a Mexican man ?
Does this mean the police should not stop and question anyone who matches this description ?
Of course not .
So now we have the crime of crossing the Arizona / Mexico border illegally .
Both a Federal Crime and An Arizona crime .
Police must use the same standard of stopping and questioning a person in the “ Illegal Alien ” scenario as they would with a suspected bank robber .
Arizona ’s law says ; “ For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or agency of this state or county , city , town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the united states .
A reasonable attempt shall be made , when practicable , to determine the immigration status of the person , the person ’s immigration status shall verified with the Federal Government pursuant to 8 United States Code Section 1373 c ”
Whats wrong with this ?
It has always been a crime to enter this country illegally .
Recently the smuggling of drugs and people across our border has required more stringent enforcement and more manpower .
But wait .
It is a Federal Crime to illegally cross the border and is enforced by Federal agents .
It is not a state crime .
( Until now )
If the Federal Government ca n’t do the job who can ?
Can our individual states make it a State crime to be an illegal immigrant within their borders and enforce this law themselves ?
Arizona says yes we can and has actually gone so far as to say the immigrants who cross the Arizona border illegally are “ trespassing ” .
The citizens of this country should take notice of the actions of the Arizona lawmakers .
Arizona has taken a traumatic step by using the power granted to them by our Constitution .

How to protect your children
The journalist who helped break the story that detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were being tortured by their US jailers told an audience at a journalism conference last month that American soldiers are now executing prisoners in Afghanistan .
New Yorker journalist Seymour Hersh also revealed that the Bush Administration had developed advanced plans for a military strike on Iran .
ADVERTISEMENT
At the Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Geneva , Hersh criticized President Barack Obama , and alleged that US forces are engaged in “ battlefield executions . ”
“ I ’ll tell you right now , one of the great tragedies of my country is that Mr. Obama is looking the other way , because equally horrible things are happening to prisoners , to those we capture in Afghanistan , ” Hersh said .
“ They ’re being executed on the battlefield .
It ’s unbelievable stuff going on there that does n’t necessarily get reported .
Things do n’t change . :
“ What they ’ve done in the field now is , they tell the troops , you have to make a determination within a day or two or so whether or not the prisoners you have , the detainees , are Taliban , ” Hersh added .
“ You must extract whatever tactical intelligence you can get , as opposed to strategic , long - range intelligence , immediately .
And if you cannot conclude they ’re Taliban , you must turn them free .
“ What it means is , and I ’ve been told this anecdotally by five or six different people , battlefield executions are taking place , ” he continued .
“ Well , if they ca n’t prove they ’re Taliban , bam .
If we do n’t do it ourselves , we turn them over to the nearby Afghan troops and by the time we walk three feet the bullets are flying .
And that ’s going on now . ”
The video of Hersh was uploaded to Michael Moore ’s YouTube account Tuesday .

Hersh has a long history as an investigative journalist and worked for many years at The New York Times .
In 1969 , he broke the story of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam .

In this post - 9/11 age , the idea of preemptive war against a terrorist - prone country supposedly went out of favor after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq .
Yet Congress is now pushing President Obama toward steps that could easily be interpreted as an act of war against Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
The House and Senate are moving quickly on a bill to force US sanctions on the sale of gasoline to the Islamic Republic of Iran .
In theory , the measure would only punish US and foreign companies that export refined oil products to Iran which , despite being a major exporter of petroleum , lacks sufficient oil refineries .
But there ’s a big problem :
The only way to really enforce such a crippling sanction against the Iranian economy would be through an American - led naval blockade which , by international law , is an act of war .
In recent days , Iran ’s regime has made it pretty clear that it is preparing to fight such a blockade , if it comes to that .
Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps began a five - day sea , land , and air military exercise April 22 in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman .
The war games may even extend to the Strait of Hormuz , the watery chokepoint through which a fifth of the world ’s oil flows on giant tankers , and which is guarded by the US Navy .
History is instructive here :
It was a US ban on the export of oil to Imperial Japan for its invasion of China that triggered the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor .
And a US naval blockade of Cuba in 1962 almost led to nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
Also on April 22 , the House of Representatives voted by a huge 403 - 11 margin to set a deadline of May 28 for an agreement with the Senate on the gasoline sanctions .
In the Senate , too , patience with President Obama ’s slow and often faltering approach to Iran is running thin .
“ We have waited long enough for diplomacy to work , ” says Senate majority leader Harry Reid .
“ Iran is a festering sore in the world . ”
Mr. Obama may be able to fend off pressure from Congress to strangle Iran ’s economy with sanctions on its gasoline imports .
But much depends on whether countries like China , Russia , and even Germany are willing to impose other types of penalties that are more targeted at top members of the regime , especially the Revolutionary Guard and its affiliated companies .
The toughest ones proposed by Obama focus on Iran ’s access to banking , insurance , and credit .
The White House hopes the UN Security Council will agree by early May to a package of new sanctions .
The US has been successful since 2006 in having the Council ratchet up pressure on Iran as that country further defies calls for it to open its secret nuclear program to international inspections .
The West is especially worried about Iran ’s rush to produce bomb - grade uranium .
China ’s cooperation is essential .
It recently hinted that it is ready to support some of Obama ’s proposed sanctions .
Critical to China ’s support are offers from Arab oil exporters to make up for its loss of oil exports from Iran .
Another signal of China ’s support was a visit by its Navy to the United Arab Emirates last month .
Hovering over these moves is the threat of Israeli air attacks on Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Israel did strike Iraq ’s nuclear plant in 1981 and a Syrian one in 2007 .
The US opposes such an Israeli operation , which could create an uncertain escalation of conflict in the Middle East .
But some experts say the US would have a tough time restraining Israel if that country attacks Iran before the US elections this November .
Support for Israel is very high in Congress .
US lawmakers need to be concerned that any unilateral US sanctions on gas imports to Iran could lead to a naval confrontation .
Such a measure should only be taken with the widest international support and only if Iran appears ready to deploy a nuclear weapon that would destabilize the region .
Similar conditions were not in place before President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq , and that war effort suffered for it .
Preemptive war , even if it only a naval blockade , should never be done lightly .
Thinking about BP and the Gulf : in this old interview , Milton Friedman says that there ’s no need for product safety regulation , because corporations know that if they do harm they ’ll be sued .
Interviewer :
So tort law takes care of a lot of this ..
Friedman : Absolutely , absolutely .
Meanwhile , in the real world :
In the wake of last month ’s catastrophic Gulf Coast oil spill , Sen . Lisa Murkowski blocked a bill that would have raised the maximum liability for oil companies after a spill from a paltry $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
The Republican lawmaker said the bill , introduced by Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) , would have unfairly hurt smaller oil companies by raising the costs of oil production .
The legislation is “ not where we need to be right now ” she said .
And do n’t say that we just need better politicians .
If libertarianism requires incorruptible politicians to work , it ’s not serious .

Texas doctors are opting out of Medicare at alarming rates , frustrated by reimbursement cuts they say make participation in government - funded care of seniors unaffordable .
Two years after a survey found nearly half of Texas doctors were n't taking some new Medicare patients , new data shows 100 to 200 a year are now ending all involvement with the program .
Before 2007 , the number of doctors opting out averaged less than a handful a year .
“ This new data shows the Medicare system is beginning to implode , ” said Dr. Susan Bailey , president of the Texas Medical Association .
“ If Congress does n't fix Medicare soon , there 'll be more and more doctors dropping out and Congress ' promise to provide medical care to seniors will be broken . ”
More than 300 doctors have dropped the program in the last two years , including 50 in the first three months of 2010 , according to data compiled by the Houston Chronicle .
Texas Medical Association officials , who conducted the 2008 survey , said the numbers far exceeded their assumptions .
The largest number of doctors opting out comes from primary care , a field already short of practitioners nationally and especially in Texas .
Psychiatrists also make up a large share of the pie , causing one Texas leader to say , “ God forbid that a senior has dementia . ”
The opt-outs follow years of declining Medicare reimbursement that culminated in a looming 21 percent cut in 2010 .
Congress has voted three times to postpone the cut , which was originally to take effect Jan .
1 . It is now set to take effect June 1 .
Not cost - effective
The uncertainty proved too much for Dr. Guy Culpepper , a Dallas - area family practice doctor who says he wrestled with his decision for years before opting out in March .
It was , he said , the only way “ he could stop getting bullied and take control of his practice . ”
“ You do Medicare for God and country because you lose money on it , ” said Culpepper , a graduate of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston .
“ The only way to provide cost - effective care is outside the Medicare system , a system without constant paperwork and headaches and inadequate reimbursement . ”
Ending Medicare participation is just one consequence of the system 's funding problems .
In a new Texas Medical Association survey , opting out was one of the least common options doctors have taken or are planning as a result of declining Medicare funding — behind increasing fees , reducing staff wages and benefits , reducing charity care and not accepting new Medicare patients .
In 2008 , 42 percent of Texas doctors participating in the survey said they were no longer accepting all new Medicare patients .
Among primary - care doctors , the percentage was 62 percent .
The impact on doctors has not been lost on their patients .
Kathy Sweeney , a Houston retiree , twice has been turned away by specialists because they were n't accepting new Medicare patients .
She worries her doctors might have to drop her if Medicare cuts go through and they can't afford to continue in the program .
“ I 've talked to them about the possibility , ” said Sweeney , who sent her legislators a letter calling on them to fix Medicare .
“ They 're hanging in there as long as there 's not a severe cut , but just thinking I could n't continue doctor - patient relationships I built up over years is disturbing .
Seniors should be able to see the doctors they want . ”
The problem dates back to 1997 , when Congress passed a balanced budget law that included a Medicare payment formula aimed at reining in spending .
The formula , which assumed low growth rates , called for payment cuts if spending exceeded goals , a scenario that occurred year after year as health care costs grew .
The scheduled cuts , expected to be modest , turned out to be large .
Congress would overturn the cuts , but their short - term fixes did n't keep up with inflation .
The Texas Medical Association says the cumulative effect since 2001 already amounts to an inflation - adjusted cut of 20.9 percent .
In 2001 , doctors receiving a $ 1,000 Medicare payment made roughly $ 410 , after taking out operating expenses .
In 2010 , they 'll net $ 290 .
If the scheduled 21.2 percent cut goes through , they 'd net $ 72 , effectively an 83 percent cut since 2001 .
The issue caused the Texas Medical Association to break ranks with the American Medical Association and oppose health care reform efforts throughout 2009 .
Then TMA President Dr. William Fleming said “ reform is doomed to failure ” without Medicare reform and called Congress ' failure to devise a rational payment plan “ an insult to seniors , people with disabilities and military families . ”
No surprise to senator
U.S. Sen . John Cornyn , R - Texas , said he is n't surprised by the new opt - out numbers , allowing that Congress ' inability to reform Medicare is leaving “ seniors without access and breaking the promise we made to them . ”
“ The problem has been how to eliminate the cuts without running up the deficit , ” said Cornyn , responding to blame U.S. Rep .
Gene Green , D - Houston , placed on the Senate for not passing a House bill that would have provided a longer - term Medicare fix .
“ There has n't been the political will , but we really have no choice but to fix it . ”
Cornyn acknowledged the task is daunting .
The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that eliminating scheduled Medicare payment cuts through 2020 would cost $ 276 billion .
The growth in Texas Medicare opt-outs began in earnest in 2007 , when 70 doctors notified Trailblazer Health Enterprises , the state 's Medicare carrier , they would no longer participate , up from seven in 2006 .
The numbers jumped to 151 in 2008 , fell back to 135 in 2009 and are on pace for 200 in 2010 .
From 1998 to 2002 , by contrast , no more than three a year opted out .
Now , according to a Texas Medical Association new poll , more than four in 10 doctors are considering the move .
“ I 've been in practice 24 years , and a lot of my patients got old right along with me , ” Culpepper said .
“ It 's stressful to tell them you 're leaving Medicare and they 're responsible for payments if they want to stay with you .
You feel like you 're abandoning them . ”

Google inadvertently collected personal data from open WiFi hotspots .
Then it inadvertently stored it .
Now it 's inadvertently refusing to surrender it to regulators .
Privacy laws , it suggests , make it illegal to hand over data on those whose privacy it breached –if nothing else , this would seem an admission that the data was specific and personal enough to fall under the relevant statutes .
" As granting access to payload data creates legal challenges in Germany , which we need to review , we are continuing to discuss the appropriate legal and logistical process for making the data available , " Peter Barron , a Google spokesman in London , said , in a statement .
" We hope , given more time , to be able to resolve this difficult issue . "
It 's never the dump , it 's always the evasive maneuvers that follow it .
I wonder if corporate crisis management 's biggest failure is that it values liability over reputation : lawyers red-penning the PR people , that sort of thing .
Consider , for example , British Petroleum .
One suspects that a clever PR operation from the first moment something went wrong could have made them into heroes when they cap this thing .
But there 's not even the chance of that , now : everything it 's said and done since the disaster is so conniving and alienating that no - one could ever be fooled .
Whatever they say , it sounds a bit like " We will do anything at all to minimize our legal exposure now , even at the ruin of our credibility forever . "

The suit also targets SickBucks.com , which operates KinkyGFS.com , and processor Jettis and its 365 Billing .com unit , as well as NetBilling , calling the companies as " revenue program defendants " so that the plaintiff can seek complete injunctive relief .
It also names Moniker Privacy Services and Whois Privacy Protection .
The plaintiff , named a Jane Doe in the suit because she was 15 at the time she was photographed in numerous sexual poses , claims the commercial adult websites republished the photos after they were widely trafficked on online message board 4 chan.org .
" It is clear the defendant websites published the images of Doe without so much as taking the time to obtain or inspect the 18 U.S.C. § 2257 records , and had they done so photographs of Doe as a minor in actual sexually explicit conduct would not have been published for profit on their commercial websites , " the suit said .
The suit , filed at U.S. District Court in Orlando , also names Nathaniel Fry , who allegedly was involved in shooting the sexually explicit photos .
According to the suit , Doe met Fry on MySpace.com and communicated through AOL Instant Messenger with him .
She later traveled from her home in Seminole County , Fla. , to his home to Sacramento , where the alleged photos were shot .
Fry , who was 18 at the time , took the photos of Doe performing oral sex on him .
Prior to the sex act , Fry wrote the date " 4/1/07 " on his hand , which was later seen in the photographs .
" Plaintiff took a nap and awakened to find that Fry had uploaded the photos to [ a ] section on 4 chan.org and that was , at the time , laughing and exchanging comments , " the suit said .
Later ,
Doe 's co-workers viewed the photos on numerous websites .
They told Doe that they saw her in poses on SeeMyGF.com , which subsequently removed the photographs .
But the photographs made their way to other sites , including the two defendant websites named in the suit .
She filed her claim against the defendants on Friday in Orlando .
The suit seeks an injunction against posting Doe 's material , as well as damages for pain and suffering and attorneys fees .
XRatedJ from SickBucks.com told XBIZ that his company has read the complaint that was served to them .
" The revenue program defendants are not accused of wrongdoing , nevertheless they are included as defendants in this action so that Doe may seek complete injunctive relief , " he said .
" KinkyGFS is 100 - percent 2257 compliant . "
The world ’s oldest stash of marijuana has been found in far western China , according to an article in the Journal of Experimental Botany .
An ancient Caucasian people , probably the Indo - European - speaking Yuezhi whose fair - haired mummies keep turning up in Xinjiang province , seem to have buried one of their shamans with a whopping 789 grams of high - potency pot 2,700 years ago .
That ’s about 28 ounces of killer green bud , worth perhaps $ 8,000 at today ’s street prices , and enough to keep Harold and Kumar happy for a couple of days .
“ It was common practice in burials to provide materials needed for the afterlife , ” lead author Ethan B. Russo , a practicing neurologist and prominent medicinal - marijuana advocate based in Missoula , Mont. , tells the Canadian Press .
“ No hemp or seeds were provided for fabric or food .
Rather , cannabis as medicine or for visionary purposes was supplied . ”
But the researchers could n’t tell if the weed was meant to be smoked or eaten .
No pipes , bongs or rolling papers were found in the tomb .
The ancient Greek historian Herodotus relates how the Scythians , Iranian - speaking nomads who roamed the steppes to the west of the Yuezhi in the first millennium B.C. , liked to throw marijuana onto bonfires to induce trancelike states .
It ’s possible the buried shaman followed similar practices .

Abstract
Phytochemical and genetic analyses of ancient cannabis from Central Asia
The Yanghai Tombs near Turpan , Xinjiang - Uighur Autonomous Region , China have recently been excavated to reveal the 2700 - year - oldgrave of a Caucasoid shaman whose accoutrements included a largecache of cannabis , superbly preserved by climatic and burialconditions .
A multidisciplinary international team demonstratedthrough botanical examination , phytochemical investigation , and genetic deoxyribonucleic acid analysis by polymerase chainreaction that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive component of cannabis , its oxidative degradationproduct , cannabinol , other metabolites , and its synthetic enzyme , tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase , as well as a novel geneticvariant with two single nucleotide polymorphisms .
The cannabiswas presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactiveagent , or an aid to divination .
To our knowledge , these investigationsprovide the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologicallyactive agent , and contribute to the medical and archaeologicalrecord of this pre-Silk Road culture .
More U.S. troops were hospitalized for mental health disorders than any other reason in 2009 .
Mental health hospitalizations throughout the military topped injuries , battle wounds and even pregnancy and childbirth for the first time in 15 years of tracking by the Pentagon ’s Medical Surveillance Monthly report .
USA Today ‘s Gregg Zoroya broke the news Friday .

Mental health care accounted for almost 40 % of all days spent in hospitals by servicemembers last year , the report said .
Of those hospitalizations , 5 % lasted longer than 33 days .
For most other conditions , fewer than 5 % of hospitalizations exceeded 12 days , the report said .
In 2009 , there were 17,538 hospitalizations for mental health issues throughout the military , the study shows .
That compares with 17,354 for pregnancy and childbirth reasons , and 11,156 for injuries and battle wounds .
Psychological issues such as post - traumatic stress disorder exact a toll in lost manpower , the study said .
Four mental health issues Ã¢â‚¬â€ depression , substance abuse , anxiety and adjustment problems such as PTSD Ã¢â‚¬â€ cost the Pentagon 488 years of lost duty in 2009 .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no shame in my game , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Herschel Walker told a group of soldiers from Winn Army HospitalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Warriors in Transition Program in Georgia one day earlier .
The former NFL star overcame dissociative identity disorder at Fort StewartÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Main Chapel and , according to Bryan County News , appealed to those who battle behavioral issues to seek help as he did .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s inspiring for us to have Mr. Walker come , Ã¢â‚¬Â Winn Army Community Hospital Commander Col. Paul R. Cordts said Thursday .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ HeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s of course a Heisman Trophy winner , had a huge NFL football career but he came here to speak to our soldiers about his experiences with a behavioral health diagnosis .
We recognize that combat affects all soldiers .
Some soldiers develop symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder .
We wanted Mr. Walker to come and talk about his experience of going through treatment for his disorder as well as dispelling some of the stigma associated with having a behavioral health disorder .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Obviously PTSD , depression , anxiety and substance abuse are not limited to American soldiers .
According to a new U.K. Ministry of Defense study covered Thursday by The Guardian , troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have a 22 % higher risk of alcohol misuse than their fellow servicemen and women .

Reservists serving in Iraq and Afghanistan were found to be three times as likely to suffer PTSD as other reservists , while regular personnel in combat roles there were found to be twice as likely to report the disorder .
Simon Wessely of the Institute of Psychiatry at King ’s College London thinks alcohol abuse is even more of a concern than PTSD .
“ Our view is that alcohol misuse is actually a greater problem for the armed forces than PTSD , ” he said .
Mental health charity Combat Stress said the surge in alcohol misuse was “ alarming ” and called for support for military personnel to be targeted better .

Another article about the new UK report , from Reuters , points out a “ striking ” difference in mental health between US and UK troops .
US personnel deploy for longer than UK troops Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 15 months compared with six months Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and American troops are younger .
Combined with the numbers from the Pentagon , it is clear that US soldiers are undergoing intense mental pressure .
Walker , who became a college football star at the University of Georgia near where he visited troops said once he realized and accepted something was wrong , the decision to get help was an easy one .
ADVERTISEMENT
He now tours care facilities in support of The Freedom Care ProgramÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s treatment programs target mental health issues and chemical dependency .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ For anyone , including soldiers , it could be embarrassing , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Col. Cordts .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It could be viewed as a sign of weakness to seek help but weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve always said that itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a sign of strength and courage to come forward and ask for help .

The Republican governor of Virginia has quietly changed a state law last month that would teach gun safety to elementary school students , mandating that it use a gun safety program run by the NRA .
The National Rifle Association exerts considerable influence in American politics , and has recently won a series of victories in the US Congress .
Democratic leaders have been reluctant to challenge the powerful lobbying group , in part because they rely on a more conservative bloc of Democrats for their control of the legislative branch .
ADVERTISEMENT
Now , Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell has delivered the NRA another coup : a monopoly on teaching gun safety to schoolchildren from kindergarten to fifth grade .
With the stroke of a pen — or a keyboard — the governor eliminated a provision in a new law allowing gun safety classes which would have given educators the power to choose between an NRA - sponsored program and one offered by the group that promotes McGruff the Crime Dog .
The liberal blog ThinkProgress caught the governor ’s move in a blog post , which was reported by the Associated Press in April .
ThinkProgress ’ Amanda Terkel writes :
Earlier this year , the Virginia legislature passed a bill allowing public schools to Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ offer gun-safety education to students in kindergarten through fifth grade .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Included in the legislation was a provision directing these gun safety programs to use materials from the National Crime Prevention Center as well as the NRA :
The curriculum guidelines shall incorporate , among other principles of firearm safety , accident prevention and the rules upon which the Eddie Eagle Gunsafe Program offered by the National Rifle Association or the program of the National Crime Prevention Center is based .
There is no National Crime Prevention Center .
However , there is a National Crime Prevention Council ( NCPC ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ the group behind McGruff the Crime Dog .
But when McDonnell signed the legislation , he didnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t insert the NCPCÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s name .
Instead he offered this change : Strike or the program of the National Crime Prevention Center .
A spokesman for the governor , when announcing that he was striking the provision allowing the NRA to operate the state ’s sole elementary school gun safety class , said that he ’d deleted reference to the other group because “ the council does n’t have a current stand - alone gun-safety program . ”
The spokesman also referenced the fact that the name of the non-NRA group was incorrect in the bill .

The liberal anti-gun Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence protested McDonnell ’s move in a little - noticed blog posting earlier this month , ThinkProgress notes .
A “ study published in the late 1990s by the Violence Policy Center ( VPC ) noted that Eddie Eagle was like ‘ Joe Camel with feathers , ’ pointing out that : ‘ The primary goal of the National Rifle AssociationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Eddie Eagle program is not to safeguard children , but to protect the interests of the NRA and the firearms industry by making guns more acceptable to children and youth …
The hoped - for result is new customers for the industry and new members for the NRA . ' ”
The mother of a Virginia woman who survived the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre told Fox News in April that the move was a “ freebie ” to a “ special interest group . ”

“ I personally do n’t think firearm safety has a place in the schools , ” Lori Haas , who is also a spokeswoman for Virginia ’s Center for Public Safety , told the network .
“ That ’s up to the parents to teach that at home . ”
“ For the general assembly and governor to dictate to the board of education in writing curriculum is not their area , ” she added .
It ’s a “ freebie to a special interest group . ”

The website for the NRA child gun safety program says their goal “ is n’t to teach whether guns are good or bad , but rather to promote the protection and safety of children . ”

I look forward to watching his uncomfortable interviews and hearing more advice on body maintenance , nutrition and technology .
Adult Swim has compiled a list of Steve Brule 's 10 best moments .
They all crack me up , but the No. 1 pick was easy -- I 'll never forget the wine segment :
Check It Out ! premieres May 16 at 12:30 a.m. on Adult Swim .
I CAN'T WAIT .
I wish Teddy could have been here to see it .
The measure , which passed on a 28 - 10 vote as an amendment to the budget , would bar the state from doing business with any company found to break federal laws barring illegal immigrant hiring .
It would also toughen penalties for creating or using fake identification documents , and explicitly deny in - state college tuition for illegal immigrants …
Democrats had resisted such a sweeping proposal , but spent last evening negotiating today ’s measure , shortly after a new polled showed 84 percent of the liberal - leaning state ’s voters supported tough immigration rules barring state services to illegal immigrants …
The measure would also close what supporters say is a loophole that allows businesses to register cars under a company name , without identifying the owner by Social Security number and federal tax identification number .
It would also crate a toll - free hot line for anonymous reporting of companies that employ illegal immigrants …
Thursday ’s Senate amendment would also authorize the state attorney general ’s office to broker an agreement with federal authorities to help enforce immigration law .
That would be a stark departure for Attorney General Martha Coakley , who has increased outreach to immigrants , encouraging them to file employment complaints , regardless of their legal status .
Scores of immigrants whose bosses allegedly failed to pay their wages have turned to her for help in recent years .
Beijing ’s Most Embarrassing Allies
NORTH KOREA
Beijing ’s interests : Stability , bilateral trade , and a buffer between China and South Korea
The relationship : Chinese support for North Korea dates back to the 1950s , when Beijing loaned military aid and fighters to Kim Il Sung ’s communist government during the Korean War .
China quickly became North Korea ’s primary benefactor and trading partner , a relationship that has continued under the rule of Kim Jong Il .
Ninety percent of North Korea ’s energy imports , 80 percent of its consumer goods , and 45 percent of its food now come from China .
The relationship is n’t all one - sided .
An increasing number of Chinese firms are investing in North Korea to take advantage of its rock - bottom labor costs and large coal and mineral deposits .
Bilateral trade between the two countries reached $ 2.79 billion in 2008 , up more than 40 percent from the year before .
More importantly for Beijing , North Korea provides a friendly buffer zone between China ’s northeast and capitalist , democratic South Korea — as well as the 37,500 U.S. troops based there .
China has frequently used its position on the U.N. Security Council to block harsher sanctions against Kim ’s regime .
Since North Korea began its pursuit of nuclear weapons , Beijing has seemed more exasperated with Kim ’s belligerence and at times , has even supported international sanctions .
Although the support is not as unconditional as it once was , China remains North Korea ’s most important ally , as evidenced by the reclusive Kim Jong
Il ’s recent trip to Beijing , where he met with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao and reportedly suggested once again that he might be willing to return to the negotiating table .
Most embarrassing moment : China was instrumental in cajoling North Korea into participating in the 2003 - 2005 six - party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula , which culminated in a 2005 agreement by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for foreign aid .
So when Pyongyang tore up the agreement and tested a nuclear weapon in October 2006 , it was widely perceived as a “ slap in the face ” to a Chinese government that had repeatedly stuck its neck out for its troublesome southeastern neighbor .
One week after the tests , China agreed for the first time to support U.N. sanctions on North Korea , and the political relationship between the two countries has been strained ever since .
Fearing the chaos and potential refugee crisis that might result if the Kim regime were to fall , however , China is still wary about applying too much pressure , and trade between the countries continues to increase .
IRAN
Beijing ’s interests : Oil and gas
The relationship :
The economic relationship between Iran and China dates back to the days of the Silk Road , but has taken on a new geopolitical importance in the last decade , as China has sought out reliable sources of oil to fuel its growing economy , and an increasingly isolated Iran has looked eastward as relations with the United States and Europe have deteriorated .
Iran is China ’s third - largest source of oil , supplying about 11.4 percent of its oil imports .
Bilateral trade between the two countries totaled $ 21.2 billion in 2009 , up from 10.1 billion in 2005 .
The China National Petroleum Corp. ( CNPC ) has reached deals to develop new oil and natural gas fields throughout the country .
Because Iran lacks the capacity to refine its own oil into gasoline , it ’s also a major importer of Chinese petroleum products .
As Iran has , over strong U.S. and European opposition , continued to develop its nuclear program , China has repeatedly opposed , on the Security Council , international sanctions against its new business partner , generally proposing that diplomatic efforts be given more time .
Most embarrassing moment : China ’s stated position , that the Iranian nuclear issue could be resolved through negotiations , took a hit in November 2009 , when Iran rejected a deal to ship its uranium abroad for enrichment .
China joined with the other members of the Security Council in expressing disappointment with Iran ’s decision and has publicly urged Iran to accept the new agreement .
China welcomed a similar fuel - swap deal negotiated by Brazil and Turkey this May , but it was apparntely too little too late .
The United States quickly announced that China had finally agreed to tougher sanctions , but the devil is in the details , and it ’s still unclear whether Beijing will sign on to the most punitive measures backed by the other big powers .
SUDAN
Beijing ’s interests : Oil
The relationship : As China ’s insatiable demand for energy has led it to invest more and more in Africa , it has come under frequent criticism for its relationship with unstable and unsavory regimes — but none has been more controversial than Sudan .
Cooperation between the two countries began during the 1970s , when Mao Zedong provided the country ’s then - Marxist government with loans and medical aid .
But it was n’t until the 1990s that energy cooperation between the two countries took off , after American oil companies pulled out due to U.S. sanctions .
The international sanctions applied to Sudan following the country ’s bloody civil war and the ongoing violence in Darfur have allowed China overwhelming dominance over the country ’s energy sector .
CNPC is the largest investor in Sudan ’s state - owned oil company , and China purchases 40 percent of the country ’s oil output , accounting for about 6 percent of China ’s imports .
Even more controversially , human rights groups allege that China has sold Sudan more than $ 55 million in small arms — weapons that have been used to kill more than 300,000 people in the Darfur region .
Chinese cooperation with Sudan has continued even as Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir has been charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court .
China , along with Russia , has blocked sanctions against Sudan on the Security Council .
Most embarrassing moment : Next to Tibet , China ’s relationship with Sudan is the most frequent cause of anti-Chinese ire from human rights activists .
In the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics , for instance , Darfur activists disrupted the the Olympic torch relay and then U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton called on President George W. Bush to boycott the opening ceremony .
Bush went , but another high - profile guest , American film director Steven Spielberg , who had signed on as a consultant to the opening ceremonies , pulled out of the project over his objections to China ’s policies in Sudan .
BURMA
Beijing ’s interests : Natural gas and mining
The relationship : Burma has traditionally exported raw materials like timber and gemstones to China , but nowadays Beijing has its eyes on a much bigger prize : Burma ’s estimated 21.19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves .
CNPC signed a 30 - year natural gas deal with Burma in 2008 , and a pipeline carrying gas to China ’s Yunnan province is expected to come online in 2012 .
China has also begun work on an oil pipeline through Burma that will save Chinese tankers a costly trip through the politically sensitive Strait of Malacca .
China gave Burma about $ 2 billion in military aid between 1995 and 2005 , including fighter jets and naval vessels .
Although China has been more than willing to turn a blind eye to Burma ’s crackdowns on political opposition and has stood up for the Burmese junta in the Security Council , there are signs that the relationship has begun to deteriorate .
Burma ’s long - running military campaign against ethnic minorities in its northeast has sent thousands across the border into China , bringing narcotics and HIV / AIDS with them .
China expressed its “ deep concern , “ in August 2009 , prompting the junta to issue a rare apology .
Above all , China is looking for stability from its southern neighbor and energy provider , and the increasingly isolated junta seems unable to provide it .
Most Embarrassing moment : Burma ’s 2007 anti-government protests were a wake - up call to China .
The images of Buddhist monks taking to the streets en masse to challenge the junta ’s authority was not a sight that Chinese leaders particularly wanted to see replicated throughout the region , particularly in Tibet .
Burmese Foreign Minister U Nyan Win was publicly admonished on a trip to Beijing that year by senior Chinese diplomat Tang Jiaxuan , who told him to “ restore internal stability ” and “ push forward a democracy process that is appropriate for the country . ”
Perhaps hedging its bets , China has lately begun to reach out to imprisoned Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
China ’s wavering commitment to the junta will likely be tested again later this year , when the government has tentatively planned to hold elections with Suu Kyi ’s party banned from participating .
ZIMBABWE
Beijing ’s interests : Precious metals
The relationship : Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is a long - time Sinophile , dating back to his days as a rebel leader fighting the white - dominated Rhodesian government , when he received arms , training , and funding from Beijing .
Mugabe made a point of visiting China in 1980 , the first year of his leadership , to thank the Chinese for their support .
The Chinese government has publicly supported Mugabe ’s controversial land - reform policies and has granted the country billions in agricultural aid .
China has also sold Mugabe ’s regime the latest military technology , including FC - 1 fighter jets , 100 military vehicles , and a state - of - the - art radar system at Mugabe ’s mansion in the suburbs of Harare .
In exchange , Mugabe has opened up Zimbabwe ’s vast mineral deposits , including the world ’s second - largest supply of platinum , to Chinese investment .
Chinese companies have pumped millions into rebuilding the country ’s struggling mining sector , expanding economic cooperation as Western governments have slapped increasingly harsh sanctions on Mugabe ’s regime .

The rich die differently .
Prime Ministers weep for them , extolling their contribution to society .
The poor and working class die alone and forgotten .
No politician cries for them .
Refugees risk all and perish at sea .
Australian politicians talk about turning the boats back .
5 Australian mining company executives died in a plane crash in Cameroon a few days ago .
Australia spent a lot of money on the search and will spend even more retrieving their bodies and bringing them back home .
Kevin Rudd , voice trembling , told Parliament that ‘ our thoughts and our prayers are with all these Australian families and other families at this tragic time . ‘
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott joined the commiserations .
He called it a ‘ dreadful disaster . ’
‘ All of us in this house feel for their family and friends at this terrible time , ” he said .
OK , so we are all terribly upset .
One of those to die was Ken Talbot , a mining magnate worth about $ 1.2 billion .
He was to face criminal charges in August of bribing former Queensland Labor Government Minister Gordon Nuttall .
Nuttall is in jail for receiving bribes .
Talbot ’s death preserves his reputation and his innocence .
Now I am not going to belittle Kevin Rudd for commiserating with the family of Talbot and the other mining magnates .
But why is it just the super rich who get the condolences of our politicians ?
Ever since John Howard introduced the Australian Building and Construction Commission in 2005 deaths on building sites have doubled .
In the year before the ABCC was set up there were no deaths on sites in Victoria .
In 2008 there were ten .
According to LaborNet :
Deaths in the construction industry increased , from 3.14 per 100,000 workers in 2004 [ before the ABCC was set up ] to 3.86 in 2005 , 5.6 in 2006 , 4.48 in 2007 and 4.27 in 2008 .
I wonder when Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard will express their regrets for those deaths on site their draconian ABCC – Labor refuses to abolish it – has possibly contributed to ?
Never .
In the Labor Party view of the world workers are expendable ; bosses are indispensable and god - like .
Rudd Labor rushed to organise a search and rescue mission for the lost mining executives .
They do nothing for refugees .
12 died at sea this month .
Estimates are that up to 170 have drowned trying to come to Australia since Rudd Labor came to power in 2007 .
In the mining industry there are up to twenty or more deaths a year .
There are no tears from Kevin Rudd for those workers killed for mining profits .
No apologies , no condolences , no tears , no nothing .
We as a nation would be better off spending our money on safety at work and safe passage for refugees to Australia than wasting it on the likes of Ken Talbot .
Even in death , class matters .
Earlier this week , the Washington Post reported on another little Easter egg in a bill cruising through Congress that would normally have followed Nancy Pelosi ’s policy of discovery ex post facto .
Democrats have pushed hard to get the financial - regulation reform bill unstuck in the Senate , mainly playing on class - warfare themes in painting the GOP as the party of eeeeeeevil Wall Street robber barons .
However , the House version of the bill contains provisions that would put the Federal Trade Commission in position to start issuing rules on Internet transactions that would not only slow down business growth but also have no relevance at all to the financial collapse that prompted the bill :
The Federal Trade Commission could become a more powerful watchdog for Internet users under a little - known provision in financial overhaul legislation that would expand the agency ’s ability to create rules .
An emboldened FTC would stand in stark contrast to a besieged Federal Communications Commission , whose ability to oversee broadband providers has been cast into doubt after a federal court ruled last month that the agency lacked the ability to punish Comcast for violating open - Internet guidelines .
The version of regulatory overhaul legislation passed by the House would allow the FTC to issue rules on a fast track and permit the agency to impose civil penalties on companies that hurt consumers .
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz has argued in favor of bolstering his agency ’s enforcement ability .
…
Major media , telecom and cable companies stand to win or lose greatly from changes at the FTC and FCC .
For example , a proposed rule at the FCC would force carriers to treat all Web traffic equally on their networks .
That has drawn sharp opposition from broadband service providers , who would prefer that Congress mandate such a change .
Comcast has complained that some traffic is so heavy that it slows the entire system .
The proposal to expand the FTC ’s authority has sparked a flurry of lobbying by advertisers , industry groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which are seeking to block it citing concerns about possible overreach by the agency .
This has become a pattern with this Congress and administration .
Despite having large majorities in both chambers , Democrats refuse to use the legislative path to pass regulation — mainly because the regulations they want are too radical to pass .
Instead , they shift the creation of regulation to agencies like the EPA and its “ endangerment ” finding for CO2 , which would then require Congress and the President to undo rather than vote to impose in the first place .
Even considering that pattern , this is something out of the ordinary .
Neither the FTC nor the Internet had anything to do with the Wall Street meltdown in 2008 .
If this financial - regulation bill is so desperately needed , why did House Democrats lard it up with this power grab at the FTC ?
Why does the FTC need any further authority over the Internet , where fraud and abuse regulations apply already ?
The Internet economy has been one of the bright spots throughout a dismal period of recent history .
Do we need to attack the one area that shows growth and promise ?
Nancy Pelosi knows that her Democratic majorities wo n’t last much longer .
She wants to leave behind a Byzantine structure of unaccountable bureaucrats and embedded power to accomplish what she ca n’t get through the legitimate processes of lawmaking , and she ’s hiding those efforts in so - called emergency legislation .
Keep an eye on this during the conference committee on the financial - regulation bill ; it ’s not in the Senate version , but will almost certainly reappear in the conference report .
' They 're ready to die for him ' :
At least 60 dead in Jamaican slum standoff as police storm den of druglord wanted by U.S .
At least 60 people have died in Jamaica in a battle between police and a drug gang after police stormed the stronghold of a powerful druglord wanted by the U.S .
Thousands of police assaulted the Kingston council estate occupied by heavily armed gangsters as a three - day slum standoff over Christopher ' Dudus ' Coke exploded into violence .
Hospital sources told the AFP news agency that at least 60 people had died in the fighting .

Christopher ' Dudus ' Coke : The Jamaica Constabulary Force issued images of the underworld boss as the Prime Minister Bruce Golding agreed to extradite him to the U.S .
Jamaica 's security forces , reeling from bold attacks by masked gangsters loyal to the underworld boss , were in the midst of a nearly daylong assault in the heart of West Kingston 's ramshackle slums , long afflicted by gang strife .
The Jamaican government has already ordered a month - long state of emergency .
Last night the Foreign Office was warning against all but essential travel to the Jamaican capital .
Yesterday was the third consecutive day of unrest .
The U.S. wants to extradite Coke to face cocaine - trafficking and drug- running charges .
It was not clear last night if he was still in Kingston or if he has managed to escape to another part of the country .
Many residents of the island nation 's capital see Coke as a Robin Hood figure , a community leader , and have barricaded the Kingston slums to prevent his seizure by police .
' They say they are prepared to die for him , ' Elizabeth Bennett , a radio reporter for Nationwide 90 FM , told reporters over the weekend .
Gangsters loyal to the underworld boss began barricading streets and preparing for battle immediately after Prime Minister Bruce Golding caved in to a growing public outcry over his opposition to extradition .

WHY WOULD KINGSTON'S POOR FIGHT FOR THIS MAN ?
Christopher ' Dudus ' Coke , right , is described as one of the world 's most dangerous drug lords by the U.S. Justice Department .
He has ties to the governing Jamaica Labour Party and holds significant sway over the West Kingston area represented in Parliament by Prime Minister Bruce Golding , pictured below .
Jamaica 's political history is intertwined with the street gangs that the two main parties helped organise - and some say armed - in Kingston 's poor neighbourhoods in the 1970s and 1980s .
The gangs controlled the streets and intimidated voters at election time .
But in recent years political violence waned , and many of the killings in Kingston now are blamed on the active drug and extortion trade .
Coke was born into Jamaica 's gangland .
His father was the leader of the notorious Shower Posse gang , a cocaine - trafficking band with agents in Jamaica and the U.S. that began operating in the 1980s and was named for its members ' tendency to spray victims with bullets .
The son took over from the father , and expanded the gang into selling marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere , U.S. authorities allege .
As a West Kingston community ' don ' , Coke has acted as an ad hoc civic leader and provides protection and jobs .
It is in this role that he inspired the loyalty of residents turned gangsters in the slums of Kingston .
Though Golding , pictured above , did everything he could for nine months to stall Dudus 's extradition , he finally caved in last week due to growing public outcry and U.S. pressure .
As soon as he did , gangsters began barricading the streets of West Kingston in preparation for the battle that is now ensuing .
Security Minister Dwight Nelson said ' police are on top of the situation , ' but gunfire was reported in several poor communities and brazen gunmen even shot up Kingston 's central police station .
Police spokesman Corporal Richard Minott said that the fighting in West Kingston alone has killed 26 civilians one security official .
Police had reported that earlier fighting killed two officers and a soldier .
Kingston streets outside the battle zones were mostly empty , schools and numerous businesses were closed , hospitals offered only emergency services and the government appealed for donations of blood .
The violence has not spilled into the capital 's wealthier neighborhoods , but gangs from slums just outside the capital have joined the fight , erecting barricades on roadways and shooting at troops .
In Spanish Town , a rough community just outside the areas where the government has installed a state of emergency , police reported that a firefight killed two local people , including a little boy .
In the gang - heavy town of Portmore , police said gunmen sprayed bullets at a minivan ferrying local people .
It was not clear if anyone died .
But West Kingston , which includes the Trenchtown slum where reggae superstar Bob Marley was raised , remains the epicentre of the violence .
The drug trade is deeply entrenched in Jamaica , which is the largest producer of marijuana in the region and where gangs have become powerful organized crime networks involved in international gun smuggling .
It fuels one of the world 's highest murder rates ; the island of 2.8 million people had about 1,660 homicides in 2009 .
A woman in Tivoli Gardens told Radio Jamaica that she and her terrified family were hunkered down in their apartment as a firefight raged outside .
' I really pray that somebody will find the love in their heart and stop this right now .
It is just too much , my brother , ' the woman told the station , the sound of a gunbattle nearby .
' The police is appealing to residents of Tivoli Gardens to desist from blocking the entrance to the community , ' police force spokesman Karl Angell said in a statement .
' We are also appealing to the decent citizens of Tivoli Gardens who wish to leave to contact the police . '
Along the pitted and trash - strewn streets of West Kingston , residents say Coke is feared for his strong - arm tactics , but also is known for helping out slum dwellers with grocery bills , jobs and school fees .
He reportedly owns a company called Presidential Click that throws wild street parties in Tivoli Gardens each week and handles public works contracts in West Kingston 's slums , where flatbed trucks have brought in huge stockpiles of construction materials to build in barricades against the police .

His influence extends well beyond the capital .
Police say gunmen from gangs that operate under the umbrella of his Shower Posse elsewhere on the island have been flocking to his defence .
The normally bustling streets were mostly deserted , as the country marked its Labor Day national holiday and motorists and passersby steered clear of the trouble spot .
Golding said on Sunday the state of emergency would remain in effect for a month and would demonstrate that Jamaica is ' a land of peace , order and security ' where gang - related violence will not be tolerated .
' This will be a turning point for us as a nation to confront the powers of evil that has penalized the society and earned us the unenviable label as one of the murder capitals of the world , ' he said .
In a gritty section of the capital of an island known more for reggae and all - inclusive resorts , the violence erupted after nearly a week of rising tensions over the possible extradition of Coke to the United States .
Golding had stalled the extradition request for nine months with claims the U.S. indictment relied on illegal wiretap evidence .
Lawyers for Coke - who in addition to Dudus is also known as Small Man and President - challenged his extradition in Jamaica 's Supreme Court .
About 10 percent of the capital was cordoned by security .
The violence has not touched the tourist meccas along the Caribbean island 's north shore , but several hotels reported cancellations .
Air Jamaica rescheduled four flights today because of the unrest in Kingston .
Dear Cecil : I have read that turtles can breathe through their bums .
Is this true , and if so , why did they evolve such a talent and what are the mechanics of this trick ?
Steve CarrDear Cecil :
My understanding of physiology is that animals ( including humans ) draw in air by expanding the volume of the chest cavity .
How does a turtle , with a fixed chest cavity determined by its shell , draw in air ?
E. Nolan CooperDear Cecil :
When turtles put their heads in their shells , what happens to their spines ?
Do they buckle or contract ?
Daniel Calarese
Cecil replies :
How turtles breathe , how they pull in their heads — these are worthy topics .
But when you get to whether turtles can breathe through their butts , that ’s when you know you ’re on the cutting edge of science .
We turned to George Angehr , Smithsonian ornithologist and Straight Dope curator of critters .
His reply :
“ With an ancestry going back more than 200 million years to the late Triassic , the 200 or so species of turtles are the most ancient surviving lineage of land vertebrates .
They are also one of the most distinctive life forms on the planet .
My herpetology professor started his ‘ Identification Key to the Reptiles ’ with the couplet : ‘ A. Turtles .
Any damn fool knows a turtle .
B. Other reptiles . ’
“ The most notable turtle characteristic is the rigid shell , which is composed of the flattened and fused ribs and vertebrae , plus bony elements that do n’t exist in other vertebrates .
Also unlike other vertebrates , the shoulder and hip girdles of turtles are located within the rib cage , instead of outside it .
Many turtles partly compensate for the rigidity of the body by having exceptionally flexible necks .
The two main groups of turtles are distinguished by the way they pull the neck back into the body .
Most species belong to the cryptodire ( ‘ hidden - neck ’ ) branch , which can fold the neck in an S - bend in the vertical plane to fully retract the head .
The pleurodires ( ‘ side - neck ’ ) , two families restricted to South America , Africa , and Australia , can only bend the neck back against the body in the horizontal plane , leaving it partly exposed .
“ The rigid rib cage also places restrictions on breathing .
Turtles have two special sets of respiratory muscles .
One set pulls the body contents outward , toward the openings at the front and rear of the shell .
This expands the body cavity and draws air into the lungs , which are located in the top part of the shell .
The other pushes the viscera up against the lungs to expel the air .
This system has the drawback that both inhalation and exhalation require energy — in most vertebrates , elastic energy can be recovered from the rib cage so that exhalation requires little exertion .
“ Turtles have extraordinary anaerobic capacity — they have survived up to 33 hours in a pure nitrogen atmosphere .
( Most reptiles have a high anaerobic capacity compared to mammals , but even they ca n’t survive much more than 30 minutes without oxygen . )
Although basically air - breathing , many aquatic species have developed ways to pick up oxygen even when submerged .
Of these the most remarkable , which some turtles share with dragonfly nymphs , sea cucumbers , and certain televangelists , is the ability to breathe through one ’s butt .
You ’ve heard the expression ‘ Blow it out your after regions ? ’
It ’s no mere figure of speech .
Many species have a pair of sacs ( bursae ) opening off the cloaca ( combined digestive and urogenital chamber ) .
These are heavily vascularized to facilitate the uptake of oxygen .
“ The champion in this regard seems to be the recently discovered ( 1973 ) Fitzroy River turtle Rheodytes leukops ( ‘ white - eyed stream - diver ’ ) , which is confined to its namesake river in Queensland , Australia .
It lives in shallow rapids where the water is highly oxygenated .
One can detect the keen sense of discovery in the account by the scientists who found it , John Legler and John Cann :
‘ One of our vivid early impressions of Rheodytes was that adults of both sexes swam with a widely gaping cloacal orifice ( up to 30 mm in diameter ) .
The orifice remains open when individuals are out of the water .
We first became aware of the large cloacal bursae when a female was examined in bright sunlight ; the carapace transmitted enough light to illuminate the coelomic cavity and produce a spectacular view internally for at least 100 mm , via the cloaca , revealing a large sac lined with vascular , villose mucosa .
. . .
Water is pumped in and out of the bursae of captives and experimental animals at rates of 15 to 60 times per minute ’ ( Legler and Cann 1980 ) .
Only dedicated herpetologists could characterize the vista up a turtle ’s gaping bunghole as a ‘ spectacular view . ’
But you can understand their enthusiasm — since the turtle ’s shell is only 260 millimeters long , a 100 - millimeter - long bursa is relatively enormous .
Up to 68 percent of the turtle ’s oxygen uptake is accomplished through the cloacal bursae , so it rarely needs to come to the surface to bask or breathe .
“ Find the subject of butt - breathers fascinating ?
Then here ’s some more info : Dragonfly nymphs , which are aquatic , take water in through the rectum and absorb oxygen through gill - like structures in the hindgut .
They can also travel by jet - propulsion by expelling a powerful stream of water from their rear end .
Sea cucumbers , related to starfish , have elaborate respiratory trees branching from the end of the digestive tract , through which they breathe .
They also use the anus in self defense .
Some can shoot out sticky threads that can entangle an enemy .
Others actually disembowel themselves when disturbed : they eject the digestive tract and respiratory tract from the anus .
The innards crawl around by themselves for awhile outside the animal , and as they are sticky they can also entangle an attacker .
The sea cucumber then blithely crawls off to regenerate its digestive tract . ”
Things turtles cannot do through their butts
Dear Cecil :
Imagine my thrill to see the Straight Dope venturing fearlessly into my own rather esoteric bailiwick ( turtle physiology ) .
Nice answer from your ornithologist consultant .
The Fitzroy River turtle can indeed breathe through the cloaca — for a recent demonstration , see : physiology.cup.cam.ac.uk/Proceedings/Abstracts/523P/Birmingham/Files/S253.html.
( Link defunct . )
However , I fear a misleading impression has been given that all turtles can do so — not true .
A few “ side - necked ” turtles ( like the Fitzroy River guy ) can , but the vast majority of turtles either do n’t have cloacal bursae , or have them but ca n’t use them for breathing .
I reviewed all available evidence on the topic in a recent paper in the Journal of Experimental Zoology ( see : http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/85006057/START ) , in which I also proved once and for all that , whatever turtles are doing with their butts , they cannot drink through them .
Science marches on .

Hollywood ’s angry with its public .
Sick of all the illegal downloads and the pesky statistics that repeatedly say videogames are making more money , the moguls of Tinseltown have forced us to wear magical glasses while we watch their films .
Ugly , plastic spectacles that make cinema goers look like welders , and force people who already wear spectacles to wear another pair of spectacles over the top of them , pushing the spectacles underneath into the skin around their nose and ears in particularly uncomfortable fashion .

Because Bill Clinton politely asked fringe conservatives to stop encouraging violence against the government on the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing , Michele Bachmann has decided that he wants to " take her out . "
In a killing sense .
Not romantically .
The Minnesota congresswoman is a lot smarter than Sarah Palin , and a bit crazier , placing her not far from Glenn Beck in the " crazy / stupid/dangerous matrix " we have constructed in our head .
So it 's not surprising that she 's borrowing a page from Glenn Beck 's " charismatic cult leader " handbook .
According to research done by James Carville 's polling group , women who watch Glenn Beck 's show share a " common fear " for his " personal safety " and they believe that he 's literally putting his life in danger by revealing the inner secrets of liberals and Barack Obama .
This is why Glenn 's writing a political thriller .
So Michele 's trying this out herself .
It 's a bizarre new addition to the ancient and boring conservative martyr fixation : liberals are not just trying to demean and insult and silence conservative heroes , they are now actually attempting to destroy or kill them .
In reality , Representative Bachmann called our democratically elected president and mostly representative congress a " gangster government , " conjuring images of a violent coup .
( It 's part of the fringe Conservative obsession with " thugs " and " thuggish behavior " and Obama 's " thugocracy " — nothing racially charged about that language ! )
And that led to this fairly mild quote from former president Clinton :
" They are not gangsters , " Mr. Clinton said .
" They were elected .
They are not doing anything they were not elected to do . "
And here 's Bachmann 's response :
" I'm in my second term as a Congresswoman and the former president of the United States decides I 'm important enough to take me out ! "
See , Michele , no one said anything about " taking you out . "
That 's paranoia .
And narcissism !
You should probably be " taken out " to a psychiatric hospital , but that is just this blogger 's opinion , and not the opinion of Barack Obama 's Thuggish Gangsterocracy .
A report released today by the Partnership for a Drug Free America shows that the number of American teenagers who use marijuana has increased for the first time in 10 years , with 25 percent of teens in grades 9 through 12 saying they ’ve used marijuana in the past month , up from 19 percent .
What these numbers show — despite what organizations like PDFA might twist them to say — is that our current marijuana policies have clearly failed to reduce teen marijuana use , and a different approach is necessary .
Right now , teens have easy access to marijuana because it is unregulated and controlled exclusively by drug dealers who do not check IDs .
The solution , therefore — as readers of this blog have heard time and again — is quite simple :
Tax and regulate marijuana , so that it can be sold only by licensed merchants who would be required to check IDs and would face harsh penalties if they failed to do so .
A similar approach has enabled this country to drastically reduce teen cigarette smoking over the past two decades .
It ’s also worked overseas .
In the Netherlands , for example , marijuana is sold in regulated establishments to adults who must show proof of age .
As a result , according to a 2008 World Health Organization survey , the overall rate of marijuana use in the Netherlands is less than half what it is in the United States .
Additionally , only 7 % of Dutch teens have tried marijuana by age 15 .
In the U.S. , as many as 20.2 % of teens have tried marijuana by age 15 , according to government estimates .
If this country is serious about keeping marijuana out of the hands of teenagers , we need to accept the simple fact that prohibition does not work .
Regulation does .

Study :
Teen pot , alcohol use rising
by Jennifer C. Kerr , Associated Press
WASHINGTON — Alcohol and marijuana use among teens is on the rise , ending a decade - long decline , a study being released Tuesday found .
“ I ’m a little worried that we may be seeing the leading edge of a trend here , ” said Sean Clarkin , director of strategy at The Partnership for a Drug - Free America , which was releasing the study .
“ Historically , you do see the increase in recreational drugs before you see increases in some of the harder drugs . ”
The annual survey found the number of teens in grades 9 through 12 who reported drinking alcohol in the last month rose 11 percent last year , with 39 percent — about 6.5 million teens — reporting alcohol use .
That ’s up from 35 percent , or about 5.8 million teens , in 2008 .
For pot , 25 percent of teens reported smoking marijuana in the last month , up from 19 percent .
Until last year , those measures for pot and alcohol use had been on a steady decline since 1998 , when use hovered around 50 percent of teens for alcohol and 27 percent for pot .
The study also found use of the party drug Ecstasy on the rise .
Six percent of teens surveyed said they used Ecstasy in the past month , compared with 4 percent in 2008 .
If parents suspect their teen is using , they need to act quickly , Clarkin said .
Monitor them more closely , talk with them about drugs , set rules and consult outside help , like a counselor , doctor , clergy or other resource , he said .
The researchers asked teens how they felt about doing drugs or friends who did them .
The study found a higher percentage of teens than in the previous year agreed that being high feels good ; more teens reported having friends who usually get high at parties ; and fewer teens said they would n’t want to hang around kids who smoked pot .
Stacy Laskin , now 21 and a senior in college , said marijuana was everywhere during her high school years .
Laskin said she tried pot and drank alcohol in high school , but did n’t make it a habit like other kids she knew .
“ The behavior I saw people go through — and to see how far people can fall — really turned me away more than anything else , ” Laskin said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Her close friend from high school died in 2008 from a heroin overdose .
Laskin , a psychology major at Salisbury University in Maryland , was so torn by her friend Jeremy ’s death that she decided to help others and is working on her second internship at a drug treatment center .
“ Just seeing the negative impact made me want to get involved , ” she said .
Other findings :
- Teen abuse of prescription drugs and over - the - counter cough medicine remained stable from 2008 to 2009 .
About 1 in 7 teens reported abusing a prescription pain reliever in the past year ; and about 8 percent of the teens questioned reported over - the - counter cough medicine abuse in the past year .
- Teen steroid and heroin use remained low at 5 percent for lifetime use .
The Partnership ’s “ attitude tracking ” study was sponsored by MetLife Foundation .
Researchers surveyed 3,287 teens in grades 9 through 12 .
Data were collected from questionnaires that teens filled out anonymously from March to June 2009 .
The study has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Temperatures are rising and so are reports of infants and toddlers dying from being trapped inside sizzling automobiles .
A researcher says 18 children have died of hyperthermia since the beginning of the year , with eight deaths reported since June 13 .
That 's the largest number of fatalities through the first half of a year since Jan Null , an adjunct professor of meteorology at San Francisco State University , began tracking the data in the late 1990s .
Government and safety experts are telling parents that they never should leave children in an unattended vehicle or allow kids to play in cars and trucks .
Many of the recent cases have involved children who climbed inside an unlocked vehicle on a hot day and then could n't get out .
" These really are good parents who love these kids who make a mistake that turns out to be fatal , " said David Strickland , the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
The government 's highway safety agency issued a consumer advisory this week that included a warning for parents not to leave children unattended in or near a vehicle .
Null , who has compiled data on the cases through media reports , said 37 children typically die each year from heat exhaustion in vehicles .
A NHTSA report in June 2009 , based on police reports , estimated that 27 children died in 2003 - 2004 from hyperthermia .
The deaths in June have caught the attention of safety advocates because July tends to be the most deadly month for children trapped in hot cars .
With a week left in June , the number of deaths has topped the previous high of 17 fatalities from January to June 2009 , according to Null 's data .
In 2005 , when Null counted 47 child hyperthermia fatalities , only 12 of the deaths occurred through the end of June .
Since 1998 , Null has documented 463 child deaths involving heat exhaustion inside cars and trucks .
Safety advocates said the deaths have been more prevalent since the mid-1990s when parent - drivers were required to put their children in the back seat , where they are safer in transit but more likely to be forgotten .
Six fatalities have been reported in Texas , including three in the past month , along with two deaths apiece in Tennessee and Missouri .
In Hineston , Ala. , 2 - year - old Hunter Iles was found dead on Monday in the front passenger seat of his family 's car after playing with other children outside his home .
Sheriff 's officials told local media outlets that the child was discovered missing and later found unconscious in the vehicle .
Temperatures were in the 90s that day .
In Portageville , Mo. , 2 - year - old twins Allannah and Alliya Larry were found dead in their grandmother 's car on June 16 as temperatures pushed into the mid-90s .
New Madrid County Sheriff Terry Stevens said the children apparently got into the unlocked car on their own and were locked inside the vehicle for two hours .
When investigators arrived , he said , the temperatures inside the car had surpassed 140 degrees .
Children are particularly vulnerable because they have difficulty escaping on their own and their respiratory and circulatory systems can't handle heat as well as adults .
Safety groups such as Kids and Cars and Safe Kids USA urge parents to check the back seat every time they exit the vehicle and to create a reminder system for themselves .
Some parents leave their cellphone or purse on the floor near the car seat to ensure they retrieve it along with the child .
Others remind themselves by placing a stuffed animal in the car seat when the child is n't using the seat and putting the toy in the front seat when the child is tucked in the car seat .

The G20 detention centre at 629 Eastern Avenue was opened to media today .
Staff Sergeant J McGuire did the honours walking a few dozen reporters through the now vacated maze of a building .
We were told that the facilities had been cleaned up a bit since the last prisoners were released but half eaten cheese sandwiches , toilet paper and paper cups littered the floors and holding cells and the stench of urine was almost ubiquitous throughout .
Before the tour started , one of the cops ( not McGuire pictured above ) waiting with media begged " when is it going to be over ? " to which a 680 news reporter responded " that depends on you .... but .... please , make it stop . "
We soon proceeded to start in the area near the back of the building where prisoners were first unloaded and placed into holding cells .
We saw the portable orange toilets ( with no doors / privacy for security reasons ) and were told the washroom facilities were made available when a prisoner asked to use them .
Many still stank and had toilet paper left on the seats and floors .
Toilet paper was obviously provided to prisoners but only when it was asked for ( in other words , rolls were not automatically supplied in the stalls )
In this first area , it was n't uncommon for prisoners to wait for hours while they awaited to be seen in the prisoner management trailer overseen by two sergeants .
It was here that they were told of their rights and food ( cheese sandwiches , apples , oranges ) and water was made available if asked for .
There clearly was n't a water shortage ( there were plenty of unconsumed cases ) but our tour guide admitted that challenging logistics may have prevented water from being dispensed in a timely manner .
The cells were mostly 10x20 although there were some smaller 10x10 ones .
I was actually quite surprised how many there were .
They seemed to be never - ending as we snaked our way through the facilities .
Inside each had a small bench that maybe one person could lie on or 3 - 4 people could sit comfortably .
Once the prisoners were processed from the initial holding cells they were taken to a separate room where officers met with them in temporary booking trailers .
This is where the " paperwork " was compiled ( all electronic based ) and everyone was subject to a strip search - either a Level 2 ( pat down search ) or Level 3 ( strip search ) .
Contrary to published reports we were told that all female prisoners were strip searched by female officers .
Once this process was complete prisoners were taken to the cells they would remain in for the rest of their stay .
Like the other cells , many were littered with paper cups and half or hardly touched cheese sandwiches and some prisoners created messages by arranging the paper cups into words through the sides of the cells .
A separate room contained pay phones where prisoners were allowed to make a phone call .
Again , we were told that logistics may have prevented everyone from having access to the phone booths in a timely manner ( if at all ) but that they were certainly available .
Overall , of the more than 900 arrested this weekend and brought here , approximately 200 were charged and the remainder ( more than 700 ) were released with no charges .

Idaho does n’t recognize gay or lesbian marriage , but some Republicans want the state to go a step further .
A panel of GOP delegates at the state party ’s convention passed a measure Friday to define marriage as a bond between a “ naturally born ” man and woman , effectively barring transgenders .
Bannock County delegate Ralph Lilling says his amendment to the state party ’s platform will help further protect the traditional family unit .
But Donna Montgomery , a delegate from Kootenai County , argued that the additional language was unnecessary because people from Idaho understand man is a man and a woman is a woman .
The measure still has to go before the full convention for approval .

Foes at the Idaho state GOP convention in Idaho Falls said Friday that encouraging such a plan would put the Republican Party at the forefront of a radical agenda and expose the party to accusations it ’s a radical organization .
Rep. Tom Trail , a Republican from Moscow , is trying to get Idaho in line with states like Colorado and California that are easing restrictions on marijuana as long as it ’s used medically to treat chronic pain or debilitating diseases .
But among traditional Idaho Republicans , there is still deep concern that relaxing restrictions would encourage illegal drug use .

​ Saginaw County , Michigan sheriff ’s department officials claim their “ destruction policy ” will change after a legal medical marijuana grower released photos of his basement grow room following a police “ visit . ”
The Saginaw News .
Edwyn W. Boyke Jr. , 64 , of Saginaw Township , released the sobering photos after the raid conducted by deputies and federal Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) agents in the basement of his home , reports Gus Burns of Deputies will discontinue their policy of destroying all grow room equipment when they serve search warrants at the homes of medical marijuana patients or caretakers , Saginaw County Sheriff ’s Detective Randy P. Pfau claimed .
​ The police raid of Boyke ’s home and the resulting photos raised public concern about police procedures when dealing with legal marijuana patients .
Police claim Boyke violated marijuana laws , and in the raid destroyed equipment which the medical marijuana patient said cost him $ 7,000 .
“ It ’s so new to us , this new law , ” Detective Pfau whined , “ so we ’re acting on protocol that ’s been in place … forever with manufacture of marijuana . ”
Not mentioned by Pfau is the simple fact that Michigan voters legalized the medicinal use of marijuana almost two years ago , which seems to this writer to be adequate time , even for thick - headed , pot phobic cops to learn the damned laws have changed , already .
Pfau claimed the old way of doing things was to “ take a portion ” of the grow equipment to present as evidence and document the rest with photos and inventory sheets .
Because the possession and farming of marijuana is no longer inherently illegal , due to Michigan ’s medical marijuana law , Pfau said deputies will “ adjust their procedures . ”
Now , does that just mean they ’ll smile more while they bust up patients ’ equipment and destroy their medicine ?
Stay tuned .

news Tracy Wright , 1959 –2010
Photo by Guntar Kravis .
On Tuesday morning , Tracy Wright died at home after a battle with pancreatic cancer .
She was fifty years old .
You may or may not recognize her name , but if you ’ve spent any time at all engaging in Canadian film , theatre , and television in the past twenty years , you definitely know her face .
She worked with Daniel Brooks , Daniel MacIvor , Bruce McCulloch , Patricia Rozema , Bruce McDonald , Miranda July , and most frequently , her longtime partner Don McKellar , whom she married earlier this year .
( She founded the Augusta Company with Brooks and McKellar . )
Tracy was an utterly unique performer with an offbeat yet compelling sense of humour that made her memorable even if she only appeared on screen for a matter of minutes .
The loss of such a talented woman is especially sad because , in a way , we feel we were only just really getting to know her .
Sure , we always found her a riot as the cat - obsessed Dizelle on Twitch City , and in this classic Kids in the Hall sketch , and it was fun to see her pop up in bit parts in everything from Last Night to Superstar to the infamous Bubbles Galore .
But it ’s her more recent projects that have really shown us what she was capable of , from her turn as the gallery curator who accidentally begins an online relationship with a small boy in Me and You and Everyone We Know , to her role as a one - time radical in Monkey Warfare opposite McKellar , to her wonderful work with Caroline Gillis in Daniel MacIvor ’s A Beautiful View , she has given performances that are strange , generous , and disarmingly honest .
Despite her declining health , she worked up until the last .
She has a small part in Bruce McDonald ’s Arts & Crafts ode This Movie is Broken as well as his upcoming Trigger .
She had also initially been scheduled to appear in Small Wooden Shoe ’s staged reading of Brecht ’s The Life of Galileo as the titular astronomer ( by the company , she was billed , accurately , as “ a magnetic and powerful performer , bringing forth one of the most complex , challenging and powerful roles in modern theatre ” ) .
She had to remove herself from that project , sadly , which was performed on May 30 , but you might have seen her face on posters for the event around town .
It would have been fascinating to see how she would have tackled it .
Somehow , it seems fitting to leave you with this scene from the end of Me and You and Everyone We Know .
Goodbye , Tracy Wright .
You will be missed .
When this article was first published , the year that Wright was born — 1959 — was correct in the article ’s title , but the text of the article mistakenly noted that she was forty - eight when she died .
She was fifty .
This article also said , incorrectly , that Wright founded the Augusta Company with Daniel MacIvor — in fact , she did so with Daniel Brooks and Don McKellar .
Torontoist regrets the errors .
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says the Labor Party 's boost in the latest opinion polls will not last long .
The first polls since former prime minister Kevin Rudd was deposed show Labor has a healthy lead over the Coalition .
The latest opinion polls show new Prime Minister Julia Gillard holding more than a 20 - point lead as the preferred prime minister over Mr Abbott .
In the latest Herald / Nielson poll Labor 's primary vote has climbed to 47 per cent , while support for the Coalition has fallen 1 point to 42 per cent .
But Mr Abbott told a Liberal party conference in Canberra that Labor still has a set of policies that Australians do not like .
" Right now the new Prime Minister is enjoying a predictable bounce in the polls that was to be expected the Government has tried to fix the headlines , " he said .
" But they can't fix the problems and the headlines wo n't stay fixed unless they fix the problem . "
Mr Abbott says he has already toppled one prime minister and he believes he can claim another scalp at the next election .
" We can do it again because the Australian people are wondering why the Prime Minister of this country should be chosen by the union and the factional warlords rather than by the people themselves , " he said .
Greens leader Bob Brown says the swing towards Labor will not stay once the celebration of the first female prime minister passes .
" We 're not going to see our troops brought home from Afghanistan , we 're not going to see the line held on the $ 12 billion in the budget from the mining boom tax , we 're not going to see the necessary injection of funds into mental and dental health care as the Greens proposed it , " he said .
Downer slams Rudd
This weekend Ms Gillard will be consulting with her colleagues about her new frontbench .
But the former foreign affairs minister , Alexander Downer , said it would not be in Australia 's best interests for Mr Rudd to represent the Government overseas .
There is speculation the Ms Gillard may want to use Mr Rudd 's diplomatic experience in the Foreign Affairs portfolio .
Mr Downer says he would prefer to have Stephen Smith remain in the job .
He also criticised Mr Rudd 's foreign policy record as prime minister .
" He 's not trusted by the Chinese leadership , he 's undermined our relationship with India I think , " Mr Downer said .
" We need to leave Mr Smith and make a fresh start with Julia Gillard .
I think that 's the best way to improve the relationships with our key neighbours . "

Freud Was Right : Mean Mothers Scar for Life On Mother 's Day , psychiatrists say emotional abuse as bad as physical abuse .
May 7 , 2010  --
Leslie was never allowed to call her mother mom .
" We had to call her by her first name and when we were kids , if we tried to climb on her lap , she would move her legs and not let us -- there was no affection whatsoever , " said the now - grown Oregon mother of two .
" She spanked us without warning and pitted my sister and I against each other , " said the 45 - year - old , who now works in a recording studio .
" She was very clever at using emotional abuse to get my sister and I to do what she wanted .
The two emotions I remember growing up were fear and obligation . "
Leslie said she tries not to " embellish " the numerous dark incidents of her childhood , but she is convinced her mother " just liked to take the joy away -- to be mean . "
As Mother 's Day approaches , not all have warm and fuzzy memories of maternal love .
Some adults say they never escaped the scarring clutches of mommy dearest , while others learned to forgive , move on and raise their own children in a far - different way .
Psychiatrists say that good mothering is critical to healthy development and that children carry her voice , good or bad , throughout their adult lives , sometimes repeating the trauma upon their own children .
An estimated 56 percent of all abusers -- physical , mental and sexual -- are women , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The most common form is psychological .
" It happens a lot , " said Dr. Philip R. Muskin , professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University .
" Neglect and emotional abuse are every bit as damaging as sexual abuse . "
Abuse can include name calling ; threatening to kill the victim 's family or pet ; controlling access to finances ; isolating the victim from family and friends ; coercing the victim to perform degrading , humiliating or illegal acts ; interfering with job , medical or educational opportunities ; or making the victim feel powerless and ashamed .
Numerous studies have shown that maternal behaviors like constant criticism , withholding affection or humiliation can take a toll on children , adversely affecting their academic achievement , social growth and self - worth .
" Mother 's Day has always been tough for me as I always just wanted a normal Mom , " said one middle - aged Missouri woman whose mother was a verbal tyrant .
The most vulnerable years are when a child is in infancy and a toddler , when the mother is usually the chief nurturer .
" Freud was right in attributing a major responsibility to mothers in the culture as he knew it , " said Robert E. Simmons , clinical psychologist from Alexandria , Va .
" This of course includes fathers and any others who are caretakers for the child .
The fundamental question is whether the child experiences an environment that is predictable and not chaotic and feels emotionally and physically safe . "
" Freud did not sufficiently emphasize the importance of innate temperament , biological vulnerabilities or the quality of the attachment between child and primary caretaker , " said Simmons .
" But he was reasonably on the mark that very important developmental processes are shaped in the first few years of child 's life . "
Mother 's Abuse Learned From Her Own Mother
At the age of about 5 , Leslie remembers watching her mother fold towels and jumping in to help , hoping she could " earn some attention . "
" She quickly grabbed the laundry basket from her left side and placed it next to me and said , ' Fine , you want to fold them , here you go , ' and walked out of the room , " she said .
" So feeling a knot in my stomach because that was completely not the outcome I was seeking , I kept myself from crying and started folding towels thinking that maybe I could still salvage some attention by finishing folding the towels . "
A minute later , still with no acknowledgement and a lump in her throat , Leslie found a way to do the job faster , folding two towels at once .
But when her mother returned she slapped Leslie across her head and shoulder and undid all the towels .
" The saddest part of this story for me was the moment I was showing her my fancy new folding trick , when I saw her arm coming up out of the corner of my eye , " said Leslie .
" I thought for a split second that she was going to hug me for thinking of something so clever ... I was wrong . "
Leslie says she was lucky to break free at the age of 17 when her mother changed the locks on the door while while she was at her high school job .
Today , she has a loving and close relationship with her own children , 9 and 11 , but Leslie has seen how the abuse can carry through generations .
" My parents did n't speak to their parents , " she said .
She learned to expect the worst and not let herself get hurt emotionally , a survival skill that sent her into counseling later in life when she had trouble in relationships .
Wendy , a single parent from Monterey , Calif. , was raised by a mother who likely had a narcissistic personality disorder , defined by the psychiatric diagnostic manual as " a pervasive pattern of grandiosity , need for admiration , and a lack of empathy . "
" I felt like I grew up with no floor , " said Wendy , who wrote to ABCNews.com but did not want her last name used .
" The attention my mother needs is dumbfounding . "
A pathological liar , her mother told her daughter she was " Queen Maria Theresa of Austria " -- a would - be Hapsburg princess or queen .
She once advised Wendy , " If you say something enough it becomes true . "
She exaggerated her accomplishments and took all the credit for her daughter 's as well .
" I thought there was something wrong with me a lot of the time , " said Wendy , who was talented at art , but never got praise .
Her mother told her daughter to refuse a scholarship to college .
" I loved my mom , " she said .
" I worked to get her love .
I turned down the scholarship . "
Sometimes mental illness plays a role in bad mothering .
Mental Health Disorders Can Trigger Child Abuse
Pamela grew up in the 1950s and 1960s with a mother who had undiagnosed bipolar and multiple personality disorders .
" It was a horrifying experience , " said the Springfield , Mo. , woman who did not want her last name used .
" Many things I have blocked . "
" The embarrassment , the treachery , the verbal and physical abuse left me scarred for many years , " she said .
" I think my greatest fear was growing up to be just like her . "
Pamela , now 52 and the mother of two , remembers her mother screaming that she hated the children , threatening to leave and never come back .
" We formed a human chain against the door but she threw us to the side and left getting in her car and driving away . "
Pamela does n't know how long her mother was gone , but the " record player of her hateful words still play in my mind . "
Her mother died of a stroke in March at the age of 79 , and Pamela was finally able to forgive .
" Suddenly everything fell into place and I can say now that the forgiveness came easily after I knew I was living with insanity , " she said .
" Clearly there are moms that are just not good moms -- they may wish to be , but they do n't get it right , " said Columbia psychiatrist Muskin .
" Often they were n't mothered well themselves . "
Learning to move forward from a painful past is difficult , though not impossible .
And psychiatrists still do n't understand why one sibling fares well psychologically and the other can be destroyed .
" We wish we understood the hearty child concept , " said Muskin .
" Through all the horror of growing up , some move on and marry , have a successful family .
There are psychological factors that enable all of use to put things in perspective , to take responsibility for ourselves and to create the life we want .
It does n't mean we do n't have limitations and issues , but my life is my life . "
" Living in the past does n't work , " he said .
" Some people get it on their own , some get it through therapy and some get it through religion .
But it 's very powerful to be able to say , ' She was what she was , and it was n't good .
But here I am today . ' "
As for Leslie , she tried to reconnect with her mother when she had her own children , but was disappointed when the manipulation began again .
They have since parted ways .
" I do n't feel compassion , maybe because she was the one who was supposed to be taking care of me , " she said .
Leslie said she " broke the chain " of anger that had passed from mother to daughter .
" I love my kids so much and I could n't imagine not feeling any connection with them , " she said .
On Mother 's Day , her children will let her sleep late and try to make her breakfast .
" They will shower me with cute and hilarious stuff they made and dad makes me things for the garden , " she said .
Leslie has also learned not to be a victim and not to dwell on the negative .
" I was born with a great sense of humor , so I was always able to find something funny in even a bad situation and it helped me through , " she said .
" The last and most important thing is that as we become adults we have to move on .
There is some forgiveness there , but in many cases that may be really , really hard to do , but you have to . "

But what about the people who already were poor before the crisis ?
Like women on welfare ?
Oh , them .
The welfare reform bill , pompously titled the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 ( PRWORA ) and signed by Bill Clinton in the run-up to the election , was supposed to pull these hapless folk off the dole with a mix of carrots and sticks aimed at forcing mothers off welfare and into the workforce .
Not only would they find jobs that would allow them to support their children , the theory went ; once single motherhood ceased to be subsidized by the taxpayer , poor women would settle down and marry before having kids .
On its tenth anniversary PRWORA was widely trumpeted as a success : " Pragmatic progress , " declared Newsweek ‘s Robert Samuelson .
" Everything has worked , " Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute told USA Today .
" Welfare reform has been a triumph for the federal government and the states — and even more for single mothers , " claimed Brookings Institution senior fellow Ron Haskins in its newsletter .
On the New York Times op - ed page , Clinton patted himself on the back for a successful triangulation ( " At the time , I was widely criticized by liberals who thought the work requirements too harsh and conservatives who thought the work incentives too generous " ) and for moving millions from " dependence to empowerment . "
True , the widespread disaster — 1.1 million newly poor children , for instance — predicted by some opponents did not come about : child poverty actually went down .
Millions of welfare mothers found work , albeit often casual , low - wage jobs that did not lift them out of poverty .
How much of a triumph is it that in the late 1990s , 65 percent of former recipients in South Carolina were working , earning an average hourly wage of $ 6 ?
Or that in Maryland , in one quarter , about half of former recipients had found work at pay that annualized to roughly $ 9,500 — way below the poverty line for an average family ?
In a New York City study I wrote about in February 1999 , only 126 former recipients out of a sample of 569 even had valid phone numbers , hardly a sign of prosperity and stability ; of the 126 , 58 percent were supporting their families " mainly through work , " and the median wage was $ 7.50 .
But those women were entering the workforce at a moment of labor - force expansion and prosperity in the US economy ; 16 million jobs were created in the 1990s .
And even then — with a good jobs market , well - funded transitional programs and federal and state coffers flush with tax dollars — most welfare mothers stayed poor .
Some , indeed , became poorer than ever , a development that tended to be briefly noted , if at all .
As for the effects PRWORA was supposed to have on sexual mores , teen pregnancy did go down — but that happened for many reasons , and the United States is still way out in front of the other industrialized nations , including those with generous supports for young mothers and their children .
Single motherhood continued to rise , accounting for 41 percent of all births in 2008 , a historic high .
Since single motherhood is rising all over the world , in countries from Ireland to Japan , it is not surprising that it has proved resistant to PRWORA ’s supposed miracle cure .
If the boom years failed to lift poor mothers into the middle class , how are they faring now that the middle class is becoming the new poor ?
The fact that the welfare rolls have risen less than 10 percent since December 2007 while food stamp use has soared by 40 percent — an amazing one in eight Americans now uses them — suggests that welfare is n’t reaching poor families : either women who apply are being turned away , or the programs are so minimal , or so onerous , that people are n’t signing up .
How do they manage ?
Sharon Hays , author of Flat Broke With Children : Women in the Age of Welfare Reform , writes in an e-mail , " They get by in the same way the poor of New Orleans and Haiti are getting by , by cobbling together every available source of aid and support , and then trying to learn how to adjust to constant suffering and insecurity .
Increasing rates of domestic violence are just one hidden story here . "
And what about women who have reached their state ’s time limit — two years , three years , five years — and ca n’t get welfare for the rest of their lives ?
Jane Collins , the author , with Victoria Mayer , of Both Hands Tied : Welfare Reform and the Race to the Bottom of the Low - Wage Labor Market , writes , " In Wisconsin , most people who have used up their time limits are simply out of luck . "
Sounds like the laid - off workers for whom Congress recently capped unemployment benefits at ninety - nine weeks — but their situation , unlike that of welfare mothers , evokes widespread sympathy .
No one sane assumes that today ’s unemployed are loafing , that jobs are " out there " for them or that getting married would solve their problems .
If you think about it , though , given that PRWORA has been in effect for nearly fifteen years , it would not be difficult for a mother to reach the lifetime limit , even in Wisconsin , where it ’s a comparatively generous sixty months .
I asked Collins if she saw anything good in welfare reform .
" It was always a stigmatized program , a football in racial politics .
If it were possible to make unemployment and other entitlement programs gender sensitive — to take account of caregiving , for example , and the need for childcare — and put women into these mainstream programs instead of welfare , that would reconceive poor mothers as economic citizens , as workers with rights .
And that would be good . "
But for that to happen , people would have to care .
Meet Festo , a prototype robotic arm that takes its design inspiration from the way an elephant ’s trunk moves every which way thanks to its series of highly flexible muscle segments .
Clever ?
Yes .
On the way to real robots ?
Probably .
Scary ?…
Festo ’s design is actually a clever halfway house between a fully - articulated robot arm that mimics the musculo - skeletal structure of , say , a human arm ( like Dean Kamen ’s Luke arm , ) and a basic rotating - joint robot arm such as you might find currently in action welding car parts together on a production line .
It ’s intended to perform manipulator tasks –like gripping objects off a production line and popping them into boxes , and it looks to be designed to be more dextrous than a simple jointed arm , while also being more delicate and clever about gripping the objects it finds .
That would seem to make it ideal for manufacturing tasks that current robots might not be so suitable for , such as in the food industry , or possibly to help those armless robo - butlers we showed you recently grip and move things about your home .
The Festo arm is based on an elephant ’s trunk anatomy –with segmented parts that are made of lightweight rapid - prototyped plastic material and air pressure - driven “ muscle ” chambers .
The fact that its triangular in cross-section means it can really reach pretty much everywhere beneath it with ease , to position its gripper for action ( and the gripper itself is designed to gently conform to the object it picks up ) .
Check out the impressive demo in the video below , along with a couple more examples from the company ’s Bionic Learning Network series .
Did that use of the word “ bionic ” send a Steve Austin - like shiver up your spine ?
Well , if it did n’t , then this will : Because the Festo arm is a lot , and we mean a lot , like the tentacular manipulator pods that dangled by the dozen off those vicious robots in The Matrix .
Which makes it look a lot less like a friendly elephant ’s trunk now , does n’t it ?
There , we said it :

While Erik Nielsen is free to provide Goldman clients with a comfortably tabulated and bullish list of last week 's events from the UK countryside , a realistic appraisal of the key events over the past 168 hours really boils down to one thing - central bank intervention .
Whether it is definitive SNB intervention in the Swiss franc or questionable ECB involvement in the euro , the only catalyst that prevented an all out rout of European currencies was outright and blatant market participation by sovereigns and their printers .
Yet something interesting happened on the way to the stick save - decoupling .
As the chart below shows , once it became openly obvious that the SNB / ECB is intervening in the market , the traditionally very tight correlation between the euro and US stocks went up in a puff of ink cartridge smoke .
In their attempt to prevent a disorderly crash in European currencies , the central banks may have killed the only surefire way to push the market higher , which was tacit manipulation of the EUR pairs .
This is no longer the case , and the euro may have now fully decoupled from a direct market linkage .
This is certainly bad news for the correlation desks and programs that feed off the EURXXX signal to a far greater extent than any other inputs .
The question becomes whether this will in turn impair momentum factors once corr desks are forced to seek fundamental / growth opportunities once again ( an event that would likely result in further material market weakness ) , or if momentum will become market defining as an input factor of its own .
In other words , will the market go up just because it is going up ?
With no real drivers left any more , this could easily become the case .
However , just as the slow motion market meltup showed , any sustained low volume push higher always results in a sweeping plunge sooner or later .
A transition to a complete momo market could just be the gating factor to an all out market wipe out in the months ahead .
In a rare public appearance , moonwalker Neil Armstrong warned Congress on Wednesday that the US risks losing its leadership in space flight under President Obama ’s new NASA plan .
Speaking at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation , the first man to walk on the moon expressed worry that the US would have no means of its own to get astronauts into space for a long time to come .
For years , the country could find itself “ limited to buying passage to the International Space Station from Russia ” , he said .
“ [ It ] will be prohibited from travelling to other destinations in low - Earth orbit such as the Hubble space telescope . ”
“ If the leadership we have acquired through our investment is simply allowed to fade away , other nations will surely step in where we have faltered , ” he said .
The remarks echo those in an open letter he sent to the president in April .

Dreams deferred
President Obama ’s proposed 2011 budget for NASA would cancel the agency ’s work on the Ares I rocket , intended to ferry astronauts to orbit after the space shuttle ’s planned retirement at the end of 2010 .
Instead , the new plan would put billions towards helping private companies develop their own rockets and spacecraft , which could then serve as taxis to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station .
But Armstrong cautioned that it would likely be much more expensive and take much longer than space industry companies claim for them to develop such space taxis .
“ The most experienced rocket engineers with whom I have spoken believe that it will require many years and substantial investment to reach the necessary level of safety and reliability , ” he said .
‘ Pledge to mediocrity ’
Eugene Cernan , the last astronaut to walk on the moon and a co-author of the April letter to Obama , spoke of the new plan in harsher terms , calling it a “ blueprint for a mission to nowhere ” .
He said the new plan lacked focus , is short on details , and does not commit enough money to support human space exploration .
He expressed concern that the development of a heavy - lift rocket needed for exploring space beyond low - Earth orbit – which is deferred until 2015 under the new budget – might never come to pass .
“ Now is the time to overrule this administration ’s pledge to mediocrity , ” he said .
Too late
But former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine , who chaired a blue - ribbon panel that in 2009 reviewed NASA ’s human space flight plans , defended the change in course .
Continuing with the development of the Ares I rocket would be very expensive and the rocket itself would be developed too late to be of much use for taking astronauts to the International Space Station , he said .
The review panel has previously estimated that the rocket would be ready only a year or two at most before the station was retired .
He urged that whatever plan is ultimately adopted be properly funded .
“ Otherwise I think we ’ll all be back here 10 years from now having the same discussion , ” he said .

Some of Italy 's most senior police officers have been given jail sentences of up to five years for what the prosecution called a " terrible " attack on demonstrators at the 2001 G8 meeting in Genoa and an attempted cover -up .
Victims of the attack , who included several Britons , expressed delight at the ruling , which overturned many of the conclusions reached by the judges at the original trial in 2008 .
Mark Covell , aged 42 , from Reading , who was beaten into a coma , said : " This is beyond my wildest expectations .
The Italian judiciary has recognised the truth of what happened .
Human rights have finally been respected here .
Italians will now recognise their cops do not have immunity .
But it has taken nine years , and I was at the end of my tether . "
It is highly unlikely that any of the officers will go behind bars .
The case has taken so long that most of the offences of which they were accused have been " timed out " by statutes of limitations .
But several of the most senior defendants were also given five - year disqualifications from public office – sanctions that could prejudice or halt their careers .
None was suspended after being sent for trial .
On the night of 21 July 2001 , at least 150 masked police officers wearing unnumbered uniforms attacked a school being used as a dormitory by protesters against corporate globalisation .
Such was the ferocity of the beatings that followed that one commander said the school was left resembling a " Mexican slaughterhouse " , its walls splattered with blood .
Twenty - eight of the injured were taken to hospital and three were put on the critical list .
The police claimed the Armando Diaz school was the headquarters of the Black Bloc demonstrators who had caused mayhem in Genoa over the previous two days , that they had found Molotov cocktails , and that an officer had been attacked with a knife .
But , as was later accepted by the Italian courts , none of the victims had been involved in violence , the petrol bombs were planted and the knife attack was rigged .
Addressing the appeal judges , the chief prosecutor of Genoa said they could not overlook " the terrible injuries inflicted on defenceless people , the premeditation , the covered faces , the falsification of statements by the 93 anti-globalisation protesters , the lies about their alleged resistance [ to arrest ] " .
Under Italian law , the prosecution as well as the defence can appeal .
Though the reasoning behind the appeal verdict has yet to be published , it is clear from convictions and sentences that the judges accepted the attack was planned , and then covered up , at a high level .
That in turn is an embarrassment for Silvio Berlusconi 's government , which has backed the defendants throughout .
Among those convicted were Francesco Gratteri , the head of police criminal investigation , and Giovanni Luperi , who was subsequently promoted to a senior job in Italian intelligence .
Both men got four years .
The head of the riot squad unit that spearheaded the raid was given five years .
The two policemen who planted the Molotov cocktails were each sentenced to three years and nine months .
The original trial ended in November 2008 .
There was uproar in court and chants of " Shame !
Shame ! " from victims and their relatives as the verdict was read .
The judges handed out sentences of up to four years to some of the operational commanders .
But they acquitted the senior officers , who were filmed standing outside the school as the beatings took place .
The appeal court verdict , delivered shortly before midnight on Tuesday , means 25 of the 27 defendants have now been convicted .
The laysan albatross is a downy seabird with a seven - foot wingspan and a notched , pale - yellow beak .
Every November , a small colony of albatrosses assembles at a place called Kaena Point , overlooking the Pacific at the foot of a volcanic range , on the northwestern tip of Oahu , Hawaii .
Each bird has spent the past six months in solitude , ranging over open water as far north as Alaska , and has come back to the breeding ground to reunite with its mate .
Albatrosses can live to be 60 or 70 years old and typically mate with the same bird every year , for life .
Their " divorce rate " , as biologists term it , is among the lowest of any bird .
When I visited Kaena Point in November , the first birds were just returning .
There are about 120 breeding albatrosses in the colony , and gradually , each will arrive and feel out the crowd for the one other particular albatross it has been waiting to have sex with again .
Once together , pairs will copulate and collaboratively incubate a single egg for 65 days .
Speaking on Oahu a few years ago as First Lady of the United States , Laura Bush – the wife of George W – praised Laysan albatross couples for making lifelong commitments to one another .
But Lindsay C Young , a biologist who studies the Kaena Point colony , told me : " They were supposed to be icons of monogamy : one male and one female .
But I would n't assume that what you 're looking at is a male and a female . "
Young has been researching the albatrosses on Oahu since 2003 ; the colony was the focus of her doctoral dissertation at the University of Hawaii , Manoa , which she completed last spring .
( She now works on conservation projects as a biologist for hire . )
In the course of her doctoral work , Young and a colleague discovered , almost incidentally , that a third of the pairs at Kaena Point actually consisted of two female birds , not one male and one female .
Laysan albatrosses are one of countless species in which the two sexes look basically identical .
It turned out that many of the female - female pairs , at Kaena Point and at a colony that Young 's colleague studied on Kauai , had been together for four , eight or even 19 years – as far back as the biologists ' data went , in some cases .
The female - female pairs had been incubating eggs together , rearing chicks and just generally passing under everybody 's nose for what you might call " straight " couples .
Young would never use the phrase " straight couples " .
And she is adamantly against calling the other birds " lesbians " too .
For one thing , the same - sex pairs appear to do everything male - female pairs do except have sex , and Young is n't really sure , or comfortable judging , whether that technically qualifies them as lesbians or not .
But moreover , the whole question is meaningless to her ; it has nothing to do with her research .
" ' Lesbian , " ' she told me , " is a human term . "
A discovery like Young 's can disorient a wildlife biologist in the most thrilling way – if he or she takes it seriously , which has traditionally not been the case .
Various forms of same - sex sexual activity have been recorded in more than 450 different species of animals by now , from flamingos to bison to beetles to guppies to warthogs .
Within most species , homosexual sex has been documented only sporadically , and there appear to be few cases of individual animals who engage in it exclusively .
For more than a century , this kind of observation was usually tacked on to scientific papers as a curiosity , if it was reported at all , and not pursued as a legitimate research subject .
Biologists tried to explain away what they 'd seen , or dismissed it as theoretically meaningless – an isolated glitch in an otherwise elegant Darwinian universe where every facet of an animal 's behaviour is geared towards reproducing .
" There is still an overall presumption of heterosexuality , " the biologist Bruce Bagemihl told me .
" Individuals , populations or species are considered to be entirely heterosexual until proven otherwise . "
While this may sound like a reasonable starting point , Bagemihl calls it a " heterosexist bias " and has shown it to be a significant roadblock to understanding the diversity of what animals actually do .
In 1999 , Bagemihl published Biological Exuberance , a book which pulled together a colossal amount of previous piecemeal research and showed how biologists ' biases had marginalised animal homosexuality for the past 150 years – sometimes innocently enough , sometimes in an eruption of anthropomorphic disgust .
Courtship behaviours between two animals of the same sex were persistently described in the literature as " mock " or " pseudo " courtship – or just " practice " .
" What Bagemihl 's book really did , " the Canadian primatologist and evolutionary psychologist Paul Vasey says , " is raise people 's awareness around the fact that this occurs in ' nature ' – in animals .
And that it can be studied in a serious , scholarly way . "
But studying it seriously means resolving a conundrum .
At the heart of evolutionary biology , since Darwin , has been the idea that any genetic traits and behaviours that outfit an animal with an advantage – that help the animal make lots of offspring – will remain in a species , while ones that do n't will vanish .
In short , evolution gradually optimises every animal toward a single goal : passing on its genes .
In the past decade , however , Vasey and others have begun developing new hypotheses based on actual , prolonged observation of different animals , deciphering the ways given homosexual behaviours may have evolved and the evolutionary role they might play within the context of individual species .
Different ideas are emerging about how these behaviours could fit within that traditional Darwinian framework , including seeing them as conferring reproductive advantages in roundabout ways .
Male dung flies , for example , appear to mount other males to tire them out , knocking them out of competition for available females .
The point of heterosexual sex , Vasey said , no matter what kind of animal is doing it , is primarily reproduction .
But that should n't trick us into thinking that homosexual behaviour has some equivalent , organising purpose .
" All this homosexual behaviour is n't tied together by that sort of primary function , " Vasey said .
Even what the same - sex animals are doing varies from species to species .
It 's possible that some homosexual behaviours do n't provide a conventional evolutionary advantage ; but neither do they upend everything we know about biology .
For the past 15 years , for example , Vasey has been studying Japanese macaques , a species of two - and - a - half - foot - tall , pink - faced monkey .
He has looked almost exclusively at why female macaques mount one another during the mating season .
" It is n't functional , " he told me ; the behaviour has no discernible purpose , adaptationally speaking .
Instead , it 's a byproduct of a behaviour that does , and the supposedly streamlining force of evolution just never flushed that byproduct from the gene pool .
" Evolution does n't create perfect adaptations , " Vasey said .
About two dozen birds were knocking around when Lindsay Young and I arrived at Kaena Point one afternoon .
" I 'm just writing down who 's here , " Young said , reading the numbers on the birds ' leg bands and marking them on her clipboard .
Young and the biologist Marlene Zuk are now applying for a 10 - year National Science Foundation grant to continue studying the female albatross pairs .
One of the first questions they want to answer is how these birds are winding up with fertilised eggs .
Typically , albatrosses fend off birds who are n't their mates .
So Young has been trying to determine if males who arrive back at the colony before their own partners do are forcing themselves on these females or whether these females are somehow " soliciting " the males for sex .
She was staking out Kaena Point on a daily basis , trying to watch these illicit copulations unfold for herself .
This was Young 's third year ; so far , she 'd only managed to see it happen twice .
Homosexual activity is often observed in animal populations with a shortage of one sex – in the wild , but more frequently at zoos .
That 's basically the situation at Kaena Point : there are fewer male albatrosses than females ( although not every male albatross has a mate ) .
Because it takes two albatrosses to incubate an egg , switching on and off at the nest , a female that can't find a male has no chance of producing a chick and passing on her genes .
Quickly mating with an otherwise - committed male , then pairing with another single female to incubate the egg , is a way to raise those odds .
Still , pairing off with another female creates its own problems : nearly every female lays an egg in November whether she has managed to get it fertilised or not , and the small , crater - like nests that albatross pairs build in the dirt can accommodate only one egg and one bird .
So Young was also trying to figure out how a female - female pair decides which of its two eggs to incubate and which to chuck out of the nest – if the birds are deciding at all , and not just knocking one egg out accidentally .
And these were only preambles to more questions .
With the male of an albatross pair replaced by another female , every step of the species ' normal , well - honed process for fledging a chick seemed suddenly to present a fresh dilemma .
Ultimately , either the rules of albatrossdom were breaking down and the lesbian couples were booting up some alternate suite of behaviours , governed by its own set of rules , or else science had never thoroughly understood the rules of albatrossdom to begin with .
What animals do – what 's perceived to be " natural " – seems to carry a strange moral potency : it 's out there , irrefutably , as either a validation or a denunciation of our own behaviour , depending on how you happen to feel about homosexuality and about nature .
It 's naïve to slap conclusions about a given species directly on to humans .
But it 's disingenuous to ignore the possibility of any connection .
" A lot of zoologists are suspicious , I think , of applying the same evolutionary principles to humans that they apply to animals , " Vasey told me .
There 's an understandable tendency among some scientists to play down those links to stave off ideological misreading and controversy .
" But broadly speaking , research on animals can inform research on humans , " Vasey says .
Since 2003 , Vasey has been studying a particular group of men in Samoa .
" Westerners would consider them the equivalent of gay guys , I guess , " he told me – they 're attracted exclusively to other men .
But they 're not considered gay in Samoa .
Instead , these men make up a third gender in Samoan culture – neither men nor women , they are called fa'afafine .
While there 's no stigma attached to being fa'afafine in Samoan culture , homosexuality is seen as different and often repugnant , even by some fa'afafine .
In a paper published earlier this year , Vasey and one of his graduate students at the University of Lethbridge , Doug P VanderLaan , report that fa'afafine are markedly more willing to help raise their nieces and nephews than typical Samoan uncles .
This offers support for a hypothesis that has been toyed around with speculatively since the Seventies , when the Pulitzer prize - winning biologist EO Wilson raised it : if a key perspective of evolutionary biology urges us to understand homosexuality in any species as a beneficial adaptation ( if the point of life is to pass on one 's genes ) , then maybe the role of gay individuals is to somehow help their family members generate more offspring .
Those family members will , after all , share a lot of the same genes .
Vasey and VanderLaan have also shown that mothers of fa'afafine have more kids than other Samoan women .
And this fact supports a separate , existing hypothesis : maybe there 's a collection of genes that , when expressed in a male , make him gay but when expressed in a woman , make her more fertile .
Like Wilson 's theory , this idea was also meant to explain how homosexuality is maintained in a species and not pushed out by the invisible hand of Darwinian evolution .
But unlike Wilson 's hypothesis , it does n't try to find a sneaky way to explain homosexuality as an evolutionary adaptation ; instead , it imagines homosexuality as a byproduct of an adaptation .
" What we 're finding in Samoa now , " Vasey told me , " is that it 's not an either - or . "
Neither of the two hypotheses , on its own , can neatly explain the existence , or evolutionary contribution , of fa'afafine .
" But when you put the two together , " he said , " the situation becomes a whole lot more nuanced . "
" there 's two mating right there , " Lindsay Young called out .
She read the female 's leg band with her binoculars .
" You just hit the jackpot , " she told me .
The bird was part of a female - female pair .
The male had another mate .
The next morning , Young spotted a female from one of the female - female pairs calling to a male about 15 feet away .
The female was standing right where the male and his partner usually build their nest .
Her head was straight up in the air , and she clapped her beak animatedly .
In Young 's experience , it was rare for a bird to call so determinedly to another that 's not her partner ; this would definitely count as " solicitation " , she said , if the two birds wound up copulating .
We sat on the ground expectantly for a while .
Eventually , the male albatross took a few steps toward the calling female .
Then it stopped and looked around .
" I 'm not sure if he 's taking her up on it , or just going , ' Why are you in my spot ? ' "
Young said .
The male stopped again and tucked his beak into the feathers behind his neck .
Then he turned around and retreated .
" Well , his partner should be very proud of the self - control , " Young said .
More than 4,000 miles across the Pacific , at a place called Taiaroa Head in southeastern New Zealand , two female Royal albatrosses ( a related species ) were building their nest .
Later that winter , those two birds would become one of only a few known female - female pairs to successfully fledge a chick at Taiaroa Head in more than 60 years of continuous observation of the colony .
The tourism board of Dunedin , a gay - friendly region of New Zealand , held a publicity - grabbing contest to name the " lesbian albatross " couple 's chick .
A biologist working with the albatrosses at Taiaroa Head , Lyndon Perriman , seemed to bristle at the idea of naming any albatrosses – " They are wild birds , " he wrote to me in an e-mail message .
He noted that the female - female pair made for an inconvenient tourist attraction because their nest was not visible from any of the public viewing areas .
It seemed fitting : people 's ideas about the couple were riveting enough – it was n't necessary to see the actual birds .

Whitcoulls today launched its own eReader device in Auckland which will not only hold 1000 books ( with a capability of carrying 5000 titles if you load extra memory ) ; but it also kills the top opposition eReaders on price .
The new device – called the Kobo eReader – sells for $ 295 compared to the Amazon Kindle at $ 390 , Kindle DX at $ 735 and Apple iPad at $ 750 - $ 1245 .
New Zealand is the fourth country in the world in which the device has been launched after Canada , the US and Australia .
Books could be instantly downloaded with a range of prices starting at $ 3.95 .
The Kobo eReader comes with 100 free classics including Tolstoy ’s War and Peace , Homer ’s Odyssey , the works of Edgar Allan Poe , Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne , Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland and Nietzsche ’s Beyond Good and Evil .
To buy new eBooks for the Kobo eReader , customers have to go into the Whitcoulls website and - unlike the Kindles which limit buyers to Amazon only and does n’t allow any other eBooks to be read on the platform – they will have access to 2 million titles including a range of New Zealand books .
The applications required to download the eBooks are free from the Whitcoulls site for either a PC or Mac .
Those with eBooks plug into the PC or Mac to get their new book .
A bonus though is that the eBooks can also be read on iPhones , BlackBerrys and Android smartphones , the PC , laptop or iPad .
Applications for those devices are also free .
" This will change the way New Zealanders read forever , " the group managing director of REDgroup Retail , owner of Whitcoulls , said at the launch .
The Kobo weighs 221 grams , has a 15.2 cm easy to read display screen , five adjustable font sizes , battery charge for up to two weeks and a quilted back to make it comfortable to hold .
* To mark the launch of New Zealand 's first eBooks store , Whitcouls will tomorrow unveil a hanging installation , roughly the height of a two storey building .

For the first time , microscopic robots made from DNA molecules can walk , follow instructions and work together to assemble simple products on an atomic - scale assembly line , mimicking the machinery of living cells , two independent research teams announced Wednesday .
These experimental devices , described in the journal Nature , are advances in DNA nanotechnology , in which bioengineers are using the molecules of the genetic code as nuts , bolts , girders and other building materials , on a scale measured in billionths of a meter .
The effort , which combines synthetic chemistry , enzymology , structural nanotechnology and computer science , takes advantage of the unique physical properties of DNA molecules to assemble shapes according to predictable chemical rules .
Until now , such experiments had yielded molecular novelties , from smiley faces so small that a billion can fit in a teaspoon to molecule - size boxes with lids that can be opened , closed and locked with a DNA key .
These new construction projects bring researchers a step closer to a time when , at least in theory , scientists might be able to build test - tube factories that churn out self - assembling computers , rare chemical compounds or autonomous medical robots able to cruise the human bloodstream .

Click here for 3 am.co.uk 's take on Simon Cowell backing the Conservatives
ITV chiefs are bracing themselves for a huge backlash after Britain 's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell publicly backed the Tories .
The multi-millionaire used the pages of a downmarket right - wing newspaper to come out for David Cameron .
Cowell 's decision provoked a storm of protest from BGT fans who blasted him for playing politics and backing a party who plan to slash and burn public services .
They accused him of " selling out " the fans who make his shows , the X Factor and Britain 's Got Talent , such a success
Abigail Kirk , 25 , from Somerset , said : " He 's sold out the working class people who sit down to watch his shows every weekend .
Patricia Finn , from Leeds , said : " Simon Cowell has always said he would n't get involved in politics but he 's gone against his word - and his viewers .
" He 's desperate to be popular but this is a really bad call on his front .
People will see through this as opportunism .
It also provoked a massive anti-Cowell campaign on Twitter .
One said : " What was it that attracted millionaire Simon Cowell to millionaire lovers , the Conservatives ? "
Another said : " What a surprise , Cowell is backing the Tories .
On the advice of his accountant , no doubt . "
It is thought that Cowell , 50 , was strong - armed into making the declaration after signing a megadeal with Rupert Murdoch 's Fox TV in the US for X Factor .
" Simon got paid a lot of money by Murdoch , " said an insider .
" There was a view that he owed them and such is Murdoch 's desperation to get his boy Cameron into Downing Street that they forced Simon into it .
It 's backfired spectacularly for all concerned . "
Now ITV bosses fear some viewers may boycott the Saturday night series which has been a ratings and advertising juggernaut .
One said : " There is a real concern that this will hit ratings .
The golden rule of television is not to align yourself with one party or another .
Not only does it turn off viewers , it turns off advertisers too . "
Cameron had a meeting with Cowell last November in his parliamentary office after dining together the year before at Mayfair restaurant Cipriani .
After the last meeting , his spokeswoman furiously denied they were striking a deal , bleating : " This was a private meeting which was nothing to do with political alignment whatsoever and non-exclusive to the Conservatives .
It was entirely charity related .
" Simon Cowell is not publicly aligned to any political party .
Please do not draw him into these political issues . "
Short feedback cycles are important .
If you edit in openstreetmap you pretty much instantly see your data up there .
You can download it again , as can others .
It ’s instantly integrated .
Some things lag a little , you may have to wait a minute for the tiles to be rerendered correctly and maybe your browser cache needs a flush , but we ’re about there .
When you have a short feedback cycle , it means that your users get a little drop of serotonin .
That makes them happy .
It ’s simple action and reaction .
You get frustrated with your phone when it freezes momentarily because you ’re losing the feedback you expect .
When you get feedback in a creative process like making a map it makes you want to map more .
It ’s addictive .
Consider then the antithesis .
I just got an email from Wolfram Alpha , a very fun site , about feedback I gave about a year ago .
Google Maps is similar .
If you click the little ‘ report problem ’ button then you might get an email in 3 - 6 months that it ’s been fixed .
Perhaps that ’s why Google has recently decided to hire 300 people – to close that loop a bit .
I say that ’s dumb .
Get the hell out of my way .
I do n’t need an appointed faceless employee somewhere to tell me what a good job I did 3 months after I did it .
That falls on deaf ears if for no other reason than I ’ve totally forgotten about it .
Of course , if I get feedback quickly from a real human being then that can be very powerful .
Mahalo does this .
Or at least used to .
If you sign up then multiple hip , perky 20 - somethings will ‘ friend ’ you very quickly and tell you how to get more involved .
That comes across as either automated ( and thus fake ) and too much too soon ( and thus fake ) .
So you need a balance in terms of timing , depth and breadth of feedback .
Waze and Google MapMaker introduce a few layers to try and help .
Instead of submitting to an anonymous employee , you submit to a faintly anonymous area manager .
This sidesteps the cost issue but not really the feedback issue .
They take just as long to respond and do n’t have the same incentive to be nice to you that an employee might .
Voltron was an 1980s American reworking of Japanese anime series Kikou Kantai Dairugger XV and Go Lion into a single , seemingly seamless program .
The mastermind behind Voltron , Peter Keefe , passed away on May 27 .

Voltron was a smash hit , becoming the number 1 ranked kids program during the 1984 and 85 seasons .
There have been plans for a Voltron movie picture ; however , the movie rights for a film are tied up in a legal fight .
The 57 - year - old animation producer succumbed to throat cancer .
According to the Hollywood Report , Keefe was known for his rich vocabulary , cowboy boots and handlebar mustache .
During his career , he produced and sold over 600 half - hours of kid friendly entertainment .

Researchers believe it may be the salt , not the fat , that 's the problem Eating processed meat such as sausages increases the likelihood of heart disease , while red meat does not seem to be as harmful , a study suggests .
A Harvard University team which looked at studies involving over one million people found just 50g of processed meat a day also raised the risk of diabetes .
But there was no such risk from eating even twice as much unprocessed meat , such as beef , lamb or pork .
This was despite the fact the two forms of meat have a similar fat content .
Writing in the journal Circulation , the researchers speculated that given the similar quantities of cholesterol and saturated fats , the difference may be explained by the salt and preservatives added to processed meats .
This is defined as any meat preserved by smoking , curing or salting and includes bacon , sausages , salami and other luncheon meats .
Salt can increase blood pressure in some people , a key risk factor for heart disease .
In animal experiments , nitrate preservatives can promote atherosclerosis and reduce glucose tolerance , which can in turn lead to heart problems and diabetes .
Similar lifestyle
The team from Harvard School of Public Health looked at 20 studies involving more than one million participants from 10 countries .
On average , each 50g serving of processed meat per day - the equivalent of a sausage or a couple of rashers of bacon - was associated with a 42 % higher chance of developing coronary heart disease and a 19 % higher risk of diabetes .
Go for lean cuts and aim to cook from scratch using healthier cooking methods like grilling or baking
Victoria Taylor , British Heart Foundation
" Although cause - and - effect cannot be proven by these types of long - term observational studies , all of these studies adjusted for other risk factors , " said Renata Micha , lead author .
" Also , the lifestyle factors associated with eating unprocessed meats and processed meats were similar , but only processed meats were linked to higher risk . "
Victoria Taylor , senior heart health dietician at the British Heart Foundation , said : " If you like red meat , this can still be included as part of a balanced heart - healthy diet .
" Go for lean cuts and aim to cook from scratch using healthier cooking methods like grilling or baking .
If you need to add flavour , then try using fresh and dried herbs , spices and chillies instead of salt . "
A spokesman for BPEX , which represents pork producers , insisted processed meats could form part of a balanced diet .
He suggested further research was needed before any dietary recommendations could be made .
" Various studies indicate that high consumption of processed meat can be indicative of an overall poorly balanced diet : therefore it could be other aspects of the diet that are contributing to the increase in risk , " he added .

Tricky When You Least Expect It
Here 's a problem :
You 've got a satellite dish that can be rotated to any absolute angle from 0 to 360 degrees .
If you think of the dish as being attached to a pole sticking out of the ground , that 's what the dish rotates around .
Given a starting angle and a desired angle , how many degrees do you rotate the dish by ?
An example should clarify this .
If the initial angle is 0 degrees , and the goal is to be at 10 degrees , that 's easy .
You rotate by 10 degrees .
If you 're at 10 degrees and you want to end up at 8 degrees , then rotate - 2 degrees .
It looks at lot like all you have to do is subtract the starting angle from the ending angle , and that 's that .
But if the starting angle is 10 and the ending angle is 350 ...hmmm .
350 - 10 = 340 , but that 's the long way around .
No one would do that .
It makes more sense to rotate by - 20 degrees .
With this in mind and some experimenting , here 's a reasonable looking solution ( in Erlang , but it could easily be any language ) :
angle_diff ( Begin , End ) -> D = End - Begin , DA = abs ( D ) , case DA > 180 of true -> -( 360 - DA ) ; _ ->
D end .
It seems to cover some quickie test cases , including those listed above .
Now try angle_diff ( 270 , 0 ) .
The expected answer is 90 .
But this function returns - 90 .
Oops .
This is starting to sound like the introduction to a book by Dijkstra .
He 'd have called this problem solving method " guessing , " and it 's hard to disagree with that assessment .
When I run into problems like this that look so simple , and I feel like I 'm randomly poking at them to get the right answers , I 'm always surprised .
So many messy problems are solved as part of the core implementation or standard library in most modern languages , that it 's unusual to run into something this subtle .
In Python or Erlang I never worry about sorting , hash functions , heap management , implementing regular expressions , fancy string comparison algorithms such as Boyer - Moore , and so on .
Most of the time I write fairly straightforward code that 's just basic logic and manipulation of simple data structures .
Behind the scenes , that code is leaning heavily on technically difficult underpinnings , but that does n't change how pleasant things are most of the time .
Every once in a while , though , the illusion of all the hard problems being solved for me is shattered , and I run into something that initially seems trivial , yet it takes real effort to work out a correct solution .
Here 's a version of the angle_diff function that handles the cases the previous version did n't :
angle_diff ( Begin , End ) -> D = End - Begin , DA = abs ( D ) , case { DA > 180 , D > 0} of {true , true} -> DA - 360 ; {true , _} -> 360 - DA ; _ ->
D end .
Do n't be surprised if it takes some thought to determine if this indeed handles all cases .
There 's now a follow - up .

( CNN ) --
A woman sought for questioning in the deaths of two Tampa , Florida , police officers was taken into custody Tuesday , and detectives recovered a vehicle they were looking for in the case , authorities said .
Uniformed and undercover officers , air support and search dogs were being used in a manhunt for another person in connection with the officers ' slayings .
Both officers were shot during an early morning traffic stop .
Florida authorities issued an arrest warrant for Dontae Rashawn Morris in connection with the killings , police said .
A reward of $ 75,000 was being offered for information leading to an arrest , police said .
Officer Jeffrey Kocab was pronounced dead at a Tampa hospital after the incident about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday .
Officer David Curtis was pronounced dead later , although police said he would remain on life support for a few hours , as his family had chosen to harvest his organs .
Both officers were 31 , according to the department .
Kocab 's wife is due to give birth next week , while Curtis leaves behind his wife and four sons , ages 9 , 6 , 5 and 8 months .
" This has been a terribly tragic day in the city of Tampa , " Mayor Pam Iorio told HLN's " Prime News . "
Iorio said she got a phone call from the police chief at three in the morning about the shooting , and went straight to the hospital .
" We have a great deal of respect and love for our law enforcement officers in Tampa and losing two has just been a terrible tragedy and has affected everyone , " she said .
Curtis had pulled over a vehicle and found its male passenger had an outstanding warrant for " minor violations , " Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor told reporters Tuesday .
Kocab responded to back Curtis up , and " as they put their hands on the suspect , the suspect spun around , pulled a firearm and shot both police officers , " she said .
Curtis pulled the car over because it had no license plate , authorities said in a statement .
" Officer Curtis determined the passenger was wanted on a worthless check warrant " out of Jacksonville , Florida , the statement said .
He called for backup and Kocab arrived .
Both officers approached the vehicle on the passenger side .
Officers responding to a 9 - 1 - 1 call from a witness found both officers on the ground and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation , police said .
Both were taken to Tampa General Hospital .
Kocab was pronounced dead shortly after arrival , while Curtis was put on life support and later pronounced dead .
" Officer Kocab and Officer Curtis were outstanding .
They went above and beyond the call of duty and they leave behind families that are just completely devastated by this , " the mayor said .
Tuesday afternoon , police named two people being sought for questioning in the case , saying in a statement that detectives believe they were " at the scene of the shooting . "
The two were identified as Morris , 24 , and Cortnee Nicole Brantly , 22 .
Authorities later said the woman had been taken into custody .
In remarks to reporters before the woman was located , Castor stopped short of calling the two people " suspects , " but said , " both of those individuals should be considered armed and dangerous at this time . "
" If you shoot two police officers in cold blood , you 've got to be considered very dangerous , " the police chief said , " and it 's our goal to get them off the street . "
Both Curtis and Kocab were shot in the upper body , Castor said .
They were shot at close range , she told reporters , and body armor would not have helped them avoid injury .
Authorities set up a perimeter around the shooting scene , which remained Tuesday afternoon as police searched for evidence .
Tampa police were working several leads in the city but were also working on a statewide search , officials said .
" This is an unbelievable tragedy for these families , and for the larger family of TPD , and for the larger family of the city of Tampa , " Iorio said .
" Our hearts are just breaking . "
Kocab had been with Tampa police for 14 months , police said , and moved through the police department 's training program at an accelerated pace " because of his outstanding police skills . "
Castor said he previously was with the Plant City , Florida , police .
Curtis has been with the department for three years and eight months , according to police spokeswoman Laura McElroy .
He previously was a jail deputy with the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office .
Castor described both men as " solid police officers and outstanding individuals " who both worked the midnight shift .
Kocab , she said , was " looking forward to being a father , " and Curtis was devoted to his wife and sons .
Kocab was " quite a storyteller " and had a strong interest in acting , Officer Jason Ward said at a news conference Tuesday .
" It was a shock .
I could n't believe what I was hearing , " Ward said about when he heard the news .
Another officer , Jeremy Larson , said Curtis could be described in one word : dedicated .
" Dedicated to the job , dedicated to the community , but most of all , dedicated to his wife and his boys , " he said .
The officers ' deaths come nearly a year after Tampa police Cpl. Mike Roberts was killed in the line of duty last August , Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said in a statement .
" The safety of Tampa residents was the first priority for Officers Kocab and Curtis , and today they selflessly made the ultimate sacrifice to protect their city , " the attorney general said .
" They will certainly be missed not only by their loved ones , but also by the city they worked to keep safe . "

BBC Newsnight , Afghanistan
Kabul 's Pul - e - Charkhi prison has long been a byword for cruelty and injustice .
In the Soviet era it was notorious for forced disappearances and executions , and for the past three decades it has been the place where the Afghan state has sent its enemies and the men it regards as the most dangerous .
At this moment in Afghanistan 's tortuous history there are many Taliban behind the heavily fortified gates , along with convicted murderers and drug traffickers .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
We were given rare access to the high security jail , which is Afghanistan 's biggest prison , housing about one third of the country 's inmates .
Most Taliban prisoners are kept in areas of tight security on the top floors , in a block called The Zone .
We were able to visit the maximum security area , Block D , which only houses detainees accused of links to the Taliban or al - Qaeda .
As we climbed the stairs in the main prison , guards repeatedly warned us to be careful , cautioning that these inmates were dangerous .
But the only sounds coming from a long corridor lined with cells was the sound of Islamic prayers and the gentle hissing of a teapot on a burner in the hall .
Unchanged message
The cells , which measure about eight feet by eight feet ( 2.5 m by 2.5 m ) , were occupied by either one , two or three prisoners .
No Muslim and no Afghan would accept Jews and Christians on this soil .
Today even Mr Karzai is having problems with them
Taliban inmate Bashir Ahmad Qenahat
A number sat cross -legged on mats doing bead work .
One man , who told me he was in for murder , was threading a red and white bead replica of Islam 's most sacred site , the Kaaba in Mecca .
Visitors are rare and many wanted to talk .
Most of them had the same message - that the war would continue until foreign troops left Afghanistan .
Bashir Ahmad Qenahat , a man with a checkered turban and intense staring eyes who is facing a death sentence , called us over to his cell .
His was the most hard - line of messages : " No Muslim and no Afghan would accept Jews and Christians on this soil .
Today even Mr Karzai is having problems with them . " I asked him about the new approach of talking to the Taliban .
" We Afghans are brothers .
We do n't have a problem with each other .
Even our constitution says Sharia law must be practised . "
Even in prison , the Taliban sense of purpose is palpable .
' Plotting suicide attacks '
In the office of General Abdul Behsoudi , the prison 's director general , we were shown cupboards full of mobile telephones smuggled into the prison , as well as long knives and other weapons made from beds or any other material the prisoners could get their hands on .
" They were using the phones to call many places , including the Pakistani city of Quetta , where their leaders are based , to organise suicide attacks , " said Gen Behsoudi .
Pul - e - Charkhi houses one third of Afghanistan 's prisoners Now security is exceptionally tight .
Visitors must pass through at least five checkpoints to enter .
We saw guards stirring pots of meat stew , prying open shoe heels , even inspecting bread for hidden mobile telephone SIM cards and money .
Last November , a little publicised violent riot ended in a number of deaths and injuries , but the accounts differ .
One official told us seven prisoners were killed in the disturbances , Taliban sources put that figure much higher .
Prisoners say they were protesting for their rights .
Prison authorities say the Taliban and other prisoners have too many freedoms .
Prisoners in charge
On the top floor in The Zone , we met a Taliban commander , Salahuddin , described by other prisoners as one of the leaders .
Exuding confidence , he boasted about his exploits on the battlefield , although he refused to give details .
His discretion seemed to have little to do with the guards who stood around us .
He wanted to make it clear he was still a man in control : " They 're in charge of keeping us here , but we 're in charge of our affairs inside .
We choose how we live and they can't interfere in that , " he said while several guards looked on .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The prison director Gen Behsoudi told us that there was even a Taliban court and a sign for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in one block .
Salahuddin invited us to attend their religious education class .
The prison provides classes , but on the top floor of The Zone the Taliban organise their own .
At dusk they pray together in the open corridor .
Many told us they had also spent time in the US - run detention centre at Bagram , north of Kabul , and complained of abuse there .
However , there were few complaints about physical conditions here .
Their main complaint was not knowing when their cases would be heard , a lament frequently heard in Pul - e - Charkhi .
Many prisoners remain in prison beyond the length of their sentences because of what they condemn as an ineffective and corrupt system of justice .
Renovation under way
The new mantra at the prison itself is reform and rehabilitation .
With the help of foreign aid the buildings are being renovated and expanded to tackle overcrowding .
Inmates can attend classes to study the Koran Inside its walls , behind watchtowers and trenches , there is now everything from aerobics classes to outside recreation - which actually translates as sunbathing .
Some prisoners take that literally , slathering their bare backs with lotion under a hot sun in the courtyard .
A class to study the Koran and a makeshift madrassa spill down the hall across an entire floor of the main prison .
" To have a peaceful society , people who disobey the law and society 's standards must be punished , rehabilitated , and then returned to the community as sound members , " said Gen Behsoudi .
If all this talk of talking to the Taliban prevails , some of the inmates from The Zone may be included in the group being allowed to one day walk free .

Government ’s Role in the Financial Crisis
George Soros is planning to set up an economics institute at Oxford University — in order , apparently , “ to steer the discipline away from the champions of the free market and deregulation who , the billionaire financier believes , share the blame for the global economic crisis . ”
He is frustrated by “ the way global financial markets work on the premise that markets can be left to their own devices . ”
Ian Goldin , director of the James Martin 21st Century School , applauded the move on the grounds that it would “ broaden the debate . ”
We need to broaden the debate , all right .
In particular , we need to broaden it beyond two sides — neoliberals and “ Progressives ” — who agree that the global finance capitalism we ’ve had in recent decades was a “ free market . ”
Just for starters , the market in mortgage - based securities is almost entirely a creation of the federal government .
Before the feds created Freddie Mac to guarantee MBS ’s , they were shunned as too risky by the vast majority of investors .
Until then , derivatives were mainly stodgy investments in commodities futures used by farmers as a form of insurance against a catastrophic fall in prices .
Under the terms of the Basel II Accord , which went into effect in 2004 , a direct mortgage loan by a local bank to a customer with a satisfactory credit rating carries a risk weighting of 35 % .
A mortgage - based security , on the other hand , carries a risk weighting of only 20 % .
So the reserve requirements were set higher for mortgages held by the original issuing bank ( which “ entailed local knowledge , ” as Sheldon Richman points out ) than for MBS ’s purchased from other banks .
The lower reserve requirement for MBS ’s meant a larger amount of money was available to be lent against a given reserve , which created a strong incentive for banks to sell their own mortgages as quickly as possible and load up on MBS’s .
In the words of Les Antman , “ Basel II virtually mandated that banks sell their loans if they wanted to be competitive . ”
But government ’s role goes back a lot further than that .
It includes government intervention to enforce artificial property right that made land and capital artificially scarce and expensive relative to labor , and thereby weakening the bargaining power of labor .
It includes government policies to encourage centralized , capital - intensive mass production using expensive product - specific machinery rather than decentralized production integrating general - purpose electrical machinery into craft methods .
It includes policies promoting over - accumulation of capital and the cartelization of markets , to the point that mass production industry could not dispose of its full product in a free market .
It was because of these prior interventions that we have a plutocratic class with enormous piles of investment money , and a shortage of profitable investment opportunities .
In an economy with wider distribution of wealth and decentralized production capability , where production capacity was driven by local demand and a higher level of purchasing power for labor , most of the preconditions for our bloated FIRE economy would n’t even exist .
Eleven people are dead and the Gulf of Mexico has become ground zero of America 's worst - ever oil spill .
Who 's to blame ?
In the eyes of most commentators , BP tops the list .
More than a month after the Deepwater Horizon blew up and crude began spewing into sea , almost three quarters of Americans say BP is doing a " poor " or " very poor " job dealing with the accident , according to a new USA Today / Gallup poll , and calls to punish the oil giant are gaining in volume .
But what 's the right penalty ?
Here are six disciplinary options that have been floated by pundits and advocacy groups :
1. Make BP pay and pay and pay
Congressional Democrats , worried that BP will leave taxpayers footing the bill for the oil spill , are trying to ensure that BP pays big .
The main event is trying to raise BP 's federal civil liability limit to $ 10 billion , from $ 75 million ( Republicans have blocked the effort ) .
But that may just be the beginning :
The federal government can , and probably will , fine BP $ 4,300 for each barrel of oil spilled .
Add in clean - up and legal costs , and BP's on the hook for " tens of billions , " says University of Michigan environmental law professor David Uhlmann .
That may not be unrealistic :
In the past decade , BP has booked profits of $ 163 billion .
2. Void all its government contracts
Even before the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the Environmental Protection Agency was weighing whether to declare BP ineligible for all U.S. government contracts based on four separate cases of criminal conduct in the past decade .
The most severe form of the penalty , would terminate all BP 's deals with the federal government ( including , for instance , military gasoline purchases ) and potentially bar the company from drilling on public land .
If enacted , this penalty could cost BP up to $ 16 billion annually in lost revenue , according to one estimate .
3 . Kill the company
It 's time to really give BP the " corporate death penalty — being shut down , dissolved , and having their assets sold off , " says progressive talk radio host Thom Hartmann in The Huffington Post .
All this death and destruction result from the company 's reckless and shortsighted desire " to save a little money . "
And killing BP in return would hardly be unprecedented :
In America 's first 100 years , we shut down an average of 2,000 " rogue corporations " each year .
4. Boycott BP , far and wide
Consumer watchdog Public Citizen has launched a rare boycott effort of BP brands — BP , Arco , Castrol , Amoco , Safeway Gas , and AM / PM minimarts — joining a growing " Boycott BP " movement on Facebook and Twitter .
Boycott proponents are especially incensed that BP has touted itself as a " green " company .
" We want to punish BP , " says Public Citizen 's Tyson Slocum .
" We want to send a message that a company cannot just purchase an image that it is socially conscious . "
5 . Throw the executives in jail
BP executives should be prosecuted for the involuntary manslaughter of the 11 dead oil rig workers , says Paul Abrams in The Huffington Post , and " there is sufficient legal precedent " for sending them to jail .
" Had [ someone ] driven a car into a crowded sidewalk and killed 11 people , today that person would be sitting in jail with 11 manslaughter charges against them , " agrees Gary Ater in American Chronicle .
The idea of imprisoning BP decision - makers is also a popular theme on Facebook and blog posts .
6. Execute CEO Tony Hayward
MSNBC host Chris Matthews also called for jail time for BP CEO Tony Hayward — but then he appeared to go one step further : " In China , it 's a more brutal society — a more brutal society , " Matthews said on " Hardball " Monday , " but they execute people for this , major industrial leaders that commit crimes like this , failure like this . "

WHERE YOU SHOULD EAT IN SHEPPARTON
With its blend of olive groves , wineries , cheesemakers , and waterways , Shepparton , in Victoria ’s Goulburn Valley , is a locale to visit for a cut of the good life .
So , here are some of the best cafes in Shepparton :
Prezzo Shepperton
It has taken Prezzo a little more than 10 years to turn into a high road installation .
Presently with more than 150 branches up and down the nation , the affordable chain settles on a keen decision for a midweek meal , early afternoon pick - me - up , or accommodating family get - together .
The eateries generally look quite uncommon , frequently housed in structures of nearby or architectural significance , and the service is appropriately upbeat .
Prezzo has rushed to conform to evolving times , presenting cash - saving vouchers and lighter alternatives , for example , flatbread pizzas and half - size pasta dishes with a serving of mixed greens .
They ’ve additionally acquired lease a - celeb Aldo Zilli to do a ‘ VIPizza ’ range with smart garnishes , for example , red and yellow cherry tomatoes , Calabrese sausage , or tiger prawns .
Liberal servings of mixed greens , barbecues , and scrumptious baked pasta are good for those not in a pizza state of mind .
Lemon Tree Cafe
This is a morning meal / lunch restaurant in central Shepparton .
It is usually stuffed with individuals waiting .
The staff would enjoyably and proficiently situate you at a table and that conduct would proceed all through your stay .

Handmade Cheese at Locheilan Farmhouse Cheese
Known as Australia ’s food bowl , Victoria ’s fruitful Goulburn Valley has been baiting enterprising folk to its fields since the mid-1800s , when European transients perceived its developing potential .
Today , the provincial center point of Shepparton and the encompassing towns keep on the foodie tag , with plantations , olive forests , and canola fields covering the scene .
Among the top - notch activities of olive oil makers Cobram Estate and cannery SPC Ardmona , a large group of boutique administrators has gone to the gathering , building up wineries , dairies , and bread kitchens that are upheld by a developing band of city - brilliant bistros and cafés .
Shepparton local John Marsden is the gourmet specialist and co-proprietor of The Teller Collective café and neighboring bistro / pizza joint Fryers Street Food Store .
We ’ve seen a gigantic move in what individuals eat here .
At the point when we first opened up , we ’d just sell a couple of bits of quail seven days , so we ’d eat the rest for staff feast .
Presently , they experience over ten serves per night .
Gone are the days when coffee shops would just need steak and three vegs ( even though you will even now want praiseworthy rib-eyes and wagyu backsides on the menu ) .
Today , Marsden and his group make their own charcuterie , including rillettes , parfaits , and muscle , combined with house - made pickles and chutneys .
I think TV cooking shows have assumed an immense function in individuals being eager to attempt new dishes .
That has been a tremendous positive for us .
I trust that this encourages you with your café chasing in Shepparton .
Here we go with those trusted sources again .
Edge has it on good authority that Microsoft 's midlife rejuvenator for the Xbox 360 , Project Natal , will cost a cool 149 bucks when purchased as a standalone accessory , or $ 100 when bundled together with the $ 199 Xbox 360 Arcade console .
That 's a mighty steep hill for early adopters to climb , but Microsoft did warn us that Natal will not be an impulse buy .
An October 26 date is also proffered for the official launch , but that might shift , leaving us with the same window of expectation as before .
Interestingly , the Natal name is expected to definitely change for the final retail product , which we should be learning a lot more about at E3 in a couple of weeks .
The Government has introduced new measures to criminalise the sale of legal highs .
Minister for Health Mary Harney announced a criminal ban with immediate effect on a list of these drugs .
The ban makes it illegal to buy or sell mephedrone , spice products and substances which mimic cannabis , cocaine and ecstasy .
These products contain chemicals such as mephedrone , benzylpiperazine , methylone , methedrone , butylone , flephedrone , and MDPV .
Minister for Justice Dermot
Ahern also published the main parts of the New Criminal Law , which makes it illegal to sell hallucinogenic products .
The Psychoactive Substances Bill will also allow gardaí to seek a court order to close head shops suspected of selling drug - like products with the onus on the owners to prove they are not involved in such activities .
Minister Harney brought an order to Cabinet to ban the substances following approval for the measure from the European Commission yesterday .
' These substances are dangerous and their sale and promotion have caused huge anxiety to families and communities throughout the country , ' Minister Harney said .
' Their possession and supply are now illegal and subject to criminal sanction of : up to seven years imprisonment and / or a fine for unlawful possession , and , on indictment , up to a maximum period of life imprisonment for unlawful supply , ' she said .
Minister Pat Carey , minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy , said the measures will send out a ‘ clear message ’ , especially to young people , about the dangers of psychoactive substances sold through head shops .
‘ The controls introduced today constitute a significant measure to tackle the issue of the psychoactive substances currently being supplied here in Ireland via the internet and through head shops . ’
He continued : ‘ Psychoactive products on sale in Ireland will continue to be monitored and any other products with a detrimental health effect will be added to the list of controlled substances ’ .
This working Stirling engine powers a rotating Ferris wheel using the same thermodynamic principles discovered in 1816 by Robert Stirling to create a more efficient alternative to steam engines .
Still taught today in mechanical engineering courses to show the high efficiency , quiet operation , and heat utilization of closed - cycle regenerative heat engines , Stirling engines are powered by the expansion and compression of air .
Two alcohol burners heat the chambers on the Stirling engine , causing the air inside to expand and contract and push the pistons toward the chambers .
This movement displaces some of the warm air , forces the vertical pistons upward , and turns the flywheels .
The Stirling engine 's flywheels are connected by a rubber band to four flywheels on the Ferris wheel , powering its rotation .
Made in Germany , the kit 's parts are made from machine tooled solid brass , stainless steel , and aluminum components on a walnut stained wood base .
Ferris wheel : 9 " H x 5 " W x 4 " D. Stirling engine : 5 " H x 6 " L x 4 1/4 " W. ( 5 lbs . )
Image caption
The red circle indicates where a black hole may be
A supermassive black hole may have been observed in the process of being hurled from its parent galaxy at high speed .
The finding comes from analysis of data collected by the US Chandra space X - ray observatory .
However , there are alternative explanations for the observation .
The work , by an international team of astronomers , has been published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Normally , each galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its centre .
Given that these objects can have masses equivalent to one billion Suns , it takes a special set of conditions to cause this to happen .
High - speed exit
The authors believe this could be the result of the merger of two smaller black holes .
But there are alternative explanations for the bright X - ray source ; it could also be a Type IIn supernova , or an ultra-luminous X - ray source ( ULX ) with an optical counterpart ( which could represent several phenomena ) .
Simulations using supercomputers suggest that when this happens , the larger black hole that results is shot away at high speed .
Image caption Black holes may be expelled from their host galaxies after mergers
However , this depends on the direction and velocity at which the two black holes are rotating before their collision .
Marianne Heida of the University of Utrecht used data in the Chandra Source Catalogue to compare hundreds of thousands of sources of X - rays with the positions of millions of galaxies .
The material that falls into black holes heats up dramatically on its final journey , which often means that black holes are strong X - ray sources .
X -rays are also able to penetrate the dust and gas that obscures the centre of a galaxy , giving astronomers a clear view of the region around the black hole , with the bright source appearing as a star - like point .
Looking at one galaxy in the Catalogue , Ms Heida noticed that the point of light was offset from the centre and yet was so bright that it could be associated with a supermassive black hole .
Ms Heida said : " We have found many more objects in this strange class of X - ray sources .
With Chandra we should be able to make the accurate measurements we need to pinpoint them more precisely and identify their nature . "
The first thing I did was draw up a general plan so I could figure out how everything would fit together .
The outer diameter of the Arc Reactor is 4 " , so if you print the plan photo to that scale it will give you a good guide and help you get everything lined up correctly .
All the measurements used in the drawings are in inches and they are really just to be used as a guide - I really just eyeballed everything as I was making it .
By no means are they meant to be exact measurements .
The most important thing is getting the proportions correct so everything will fit together during the final assembly .
The easiest way I found to cut out all the parts is to draw the patterns on paper and then glue the patterns to my sheet plastic or sheet metal using rubber cement and cut the patterns out with a jeweler 's saw .
Then file all the edges and smooth them with sandpaper .
So let 's start by making the outer ring / backplate assembly .
Begin by cutting a 4 " diameter disc from PCB material .
There are two copper traces cut ( or etched ) into this as well as a couple of solder pads on the center so you can solder down the LED's .
There are 11 LED 's- 10 for the clear ring and one for the center lens .
The LED 's I used are a surface mount type part # NTE 30027 .
Even though they are a surface mount component they are pretty easy to solder to the copper traces .
The LED 's sit directly under a clear acrylic ring and they are spaced 36 degrees apart - just make sure they are all facing the same direction !
I simply connected the LED copper traces to the center solder pads and then drilled two small holes and soldered some wires from the back of the board to go to my 3 v battery .
UPDATE !
Instead of having to make a circuit board and solder all the tiny LEDs you can just get some of these little guys and wire them in parallel -
http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8735
Just glue them down to a back plate and you 're good to go !
The outer ring was cut from some thick plastic sheet - I used Delrin because it cuts well and is pretty durable .
A good substitute would be 1/2 " MDF sheet .
I should have painted the ring silver but I ran out of time ...... maybe I 'll make a machined aluminum ring in the future .
There are 10 2.5 mm allen head bolts evenly spaced at 36 degree intervals around the ring .
I just drilled a pilot hole , then drilled a countersink for the bolt head so it would sit just below the surface of the ring .
I actually threaded the holes for the bolts but you could probably just shove them in there with a bit of glue .
The outer ring is glued to the PCB backplate with a hot glue gun .
Then run a bead of hot glue over the LED 's and the copper traces .
This will protect the LED's , help diffuse the light and keep the circuit from being shorted out when the remaining parts are installed .
Now you need a lens for the center .
I made mine from acrylic sheet , but you could use just about any kind of lens or clear plastic part that would fit .
The thing to remember is that if it is too tall then it will come into contact with other parts later on so watch the height .
I used a scotchbrite pad on the lens to help diffuse the LED light .
Next an old heart rate monitor strap was glued and screwed to the backside of the backplate .
The two screws went through the PCB and into the outer ring , helping to hold everything together .

A Tour through the Visualization Zoo
A survey of powerful visualization techniques , from the obvious to the obscure
Jeffrey Heer , Michael Bostock , and Vadim Ogievetsky , Stanford University
Thanks to advances in sensing , networking , and data management , our society is producing digital information at an astonishing rate .
According to one estimate , in 2010 alone we will generate 1,200 exabytes — 60 million times the content of the Library of Congress .
Within this deluge of data lies a wealth of valuable information on how we conduct our businesses , governments , and personal lives .
To put the information to good use , we must find ways to explore , relate , and communicate the data meaningfully .
The goal of visualization is to aid our understanding of data by leveraging the human visual system 's highly tuned ability to see patterns , spot trends , and identify outliers .
Well - designed visual representations can replace cognitive calculations with simple perceptual inferences and improve comprehension , memory , and decision making .
By making data more accessible and appealing , visual representations may also help engage more diverse audiences in exploration and analysis .
The challenge is to create effective and engaging visualizations that are appropriate to the data .
Creating a visualization requires a number of nuanced judgments .
One must determine which questions to ask , identify the appropriate data , and select effective visual encodings to map data values to graphical features such as position , size , shape , and color .
The challenge is that for any given data set the number of visual encodings — and thus the space of possible visualization designs — is extremely large .
To guide this process , computer scientists , psychologists , and statisticians have studied how well different encodings facilitate the comprehension of data types such as numbers , categories , and networks .
For example , graphical perception experiments find that spatial position ( as in a scatter plot or bar chart ) leads to the most accurate decoding of numerical data and is generally preferable to visual variables such as angle , one - dimensional length , two - dimensional area , three - dimensional volume , and color saturation .
Thus , it should be no surprise that the most common data graphics , including bar charts , line charts , and scatter plots , use position encodings .
Our understanding of graphical perception remains incomplete , however , and must appropriately be balanced with interaction design and aesthetics .
This article provides a brief tour through the " visualization zoo , " showcasing techniques for visualizing and interacting with diverse data sets .
In many situations , simple data graphics will not only suffice , they may also be preferable .
Here we focus on a few of the more sophisticated and unusual techniques that deal with complex data sets .
After all , you do n't go to the zoo to see Chihuahuas and raccoons ; you go to admire the majestic polar bear , the graceful zebra , and the terrifying Sumatran tiger .
Analogously , we cover some of the more exotic ( but practically useful ! ) forms of visual data representation , starting with one of the most common , time - series data ; continuing on to statistical data and maps ; and then completing the tour with hierarchies and networks .
Along the way , bear in mind that all visualizations share a common " DNA " — a set of mappings between data properties and visual attributes such as position , size , shape , and color — and that customized species of visualization might always be constructed by varying these encodings .
Most of the visualizations shown here are accompanied by interactive examples .
The live examples were created using Protovis , an open source language for Web - based data visualization .
To learn more about how a visualization was made ( or to copy and paste it for your own use ) , simply " View Source " on the page .
All example source code is released into the public domain and has no restrictions on reuse or modification .
Note , however , that these examples will work only on a modern , standards - compliant browser supporting SVG ( scalable vector graphics ) .
Supported browsers include recent versions of Firefox , Safari , Chrome , and Opera .
Unfortunately , Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions do not support SVG and so cannot be used to view the interactive examples .
Time - Series Data
Time - series data — sets of values changing over time — is one of the most common forms of recorded data .
Time - varying phenomena are central to many domains such as finance ( stock prices , exchange rates ) , science ( temperatures , pollution levels , electric potentials ) , and public policy ( crime rates ) .
One often needs to compare a large number of time series simultaneously and can choose from a number of visualizations to do so .
Index Charts
With some forms of time - series data , raw values are less important than relative changes .
Consider investors who are more interested in a stock 's growth rate than its specific price .
Multiple stocks may have dramatically different baseline prices but may be meaningfully compared when normalized .
An index chart is an interactive line chart that shows percentage changes for a collection of time - series data based on a selected index point .
For example , the image in figure 1A shows the percentage change of selected stock prices if purchased in January 2005 : one can see the rocky rise enjoyed by those who invested in Amazon , Apple , or Google at that time .
Stacked Graphs
Source : Yahoo !
Finance
Other forms of time - series data may be better seen in aggregate .
By stacking area charts on top of each other , we arrive at a visual summation of time - series values — a stacked graph .
This type of graph ( sometimes called a stream graph ) depicts aggregate patterns and often supports drill - down into a subset of individual series .
The chart in figure 1B shows the number of unemployed workers in the United States over the past decade , subdivided by industry .
While such charts have proven popular in recent years , they do have some notable limitations .
A stacked graph does not support negative numbers and is meaningless for data that should not be summed ( temperatures , for example ) .
Moreover , stacking may make it difficult to accurately interpret trends that lie atop other curves .
Interactive search and filtering is often used to compensate for this problem .
Small Multiples
Source : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
In lieu of stacking , multiple time series can be plotted within the same axes , as in the index chart .
Placing multiple series in the same space may produce overlapping curves that reduce legibility , however .
An alternative approach is to use small multiples : showing each series in its own chart .
In figure 1C we again see the number of unemployed workers , but normalized within each industry category .
We can now more accurately see both overall trends and seasonal patterns in each sector .
While we are considering time - series data , note that small multiples can be constructed for just about any type of visualization : bar charts , pie charts , maps , etc .
This often produces a more effective visualization than trying to coerce all the data into a single plot .
Horizon Graphs
Source : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
What happens when you want to compare even more time series at once ?
The horizon graph is a technique for increasing the data density of a time - series view while preserving resolution .
Consider the four graphs shown in figure 1D .
The first one is a standard area chart , with positive values colored blue and negative values colored red .
The second graph " mirrors " negative values into the same region as positive values , doubling the data density of the area chart .
The third chart — a horizon graph — doubles the data density yet again by dividing the graph into bands and layering them to create a nested form .
The result is a chart that preserves data resolution but uses only a quarter of the space .
Although the horizon graph takes some time to learn , it has been found to be more effective than the standard plot when the chart sizes get quite small .
Statistical Distributions
Source : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
Other visualizations have been designed to reveal how a set of numbers is distributed and thus help an analyst better understand the statistical properties of the data .
Analysts often want to fit their data to statistical models , either to test hypotheses or predict future values , but an improper choice of model can lead to faulty predictions .
Thus , one important use of visualizations is exploratory data analysis : gaining insight into how data is distributed to inform data transformation and modeling decisions .
Common techniques include the histogram , which shows the prevalence of values grouped into bins , and the box - and - whisker plot , which can convey statistical features such as the mean , median , quartile boundaries , or extreme outliers .
In addition , a number of other techniques exist for assessing a distribution and examining interactions between multiple dimensions .
Stem - and - Leaf Plots
For assessing a collection of numbers , one alternative to the histogram is the stem - and - leaf plot .
It typically bins numbers according to the first significant digit , and then stacks the values within each bin by the second significant digit .
This minimalistic representation uses the data itself to paint a frequency distribution , replacing the " information - empty " bars of a traditional histogram bar chart and allowing one to assess both the overall distribution and the contents of each bin .
In figure 2A , the stem - and - leaf plot shows the distribution of completion rates of workers completing crowd - sourced tasks on Amazon 's Mechanical Turk .
Note the multiple clusters : one group clusters around high levels of completion ( 99 - 100 percent ) ; at the other extreme is a cluster of Turkers who complete only a few tasks ( ~10 percent ) in a group .
Q - Q Plots
Source : Stanford Visualization Group
Though the histogram and the stem - and - leaf plot are common tools for assessing a frequency distribution , the Q - Q ( quantile - quantile ) plot is a more powerful tool .
The Q - Q plot compares two probability distributions by graphing their quantiles against each other .
If the two are similar , the plotted values will lie roughly along the central diagonal .
If the two are linearly related , values will again lie along a line , though with varying slope and intercept .
Figure 2B shows the same Mechanical Turk participation data compared with three statistical distributions .
Note how the data forms three distinct components when compared with uniform and normal ( Gaussian ) distributions : this suggests that a statistical model with three components might be more appropriate , and indeed we see in the final plot that a fitted mixture of three normal distributions provides a better fit .
Though powerful , the Q - Q plot has one obvious limitation in that its effective use requires that viewers possess some statistical knowledge .
SPLOM ( Scatter Plot Matrix )
Source : Stanford Visualization Group
Other visualization techniques attempt to represent the relationships among multiple variables .
Multivariate data occurs frequently and is notoriously hard to represent , in part because of the difficulty of mentally picturing data in more than three dimensions .
One technique to overcome this problem is to use small multiples of scatter plots showing a set of pairwise relations among variables , thus creating the SPLOM ( scatter plot matrix ) .
A SPLOM enables visual inspection of correlations between any pair of variables .
In figure 2C a scatter plot matrix is used to visualize the attributes of a database of automobiles , showing the relationships among horsepower , weight , acceleration , and displacement .
Additionally , interaction techniques such as brushing - and - linking — in which a selection of points on one graph highlights the same points on all the other graphs — can be used to explore patterns within the data .
Parallel Coordinates
Source : GGobi
Parallel coordinates ( || - coord ) , shown in figure 2D , take a different approach to visualizing multivariate data .
Instead of graphing every pair of variables in two dimensions , we repeatedly plot the data on parallel axes and then connect the corresponding points with lines .
Each poly - line represents a single row in the database , and line crossings between dimensions often indicate inverse correlation .
Reordering dimensions can aid pattern finding , as can interactive querying to filter along one or more dimensions .
Another advantage of parallel coordinates is that they are relatively compact , so many variables can be shown simultaneously .
Maps
Source : GGobi
Although a map may seem a natural way to visualize geographical data , it has a long and rich history of design .
Many maps are based upon a cartographic projection : a mathematical function that maps the three - dimensional geometry of the Earth to a two - dimensional image .
Other maps knowingly distort or abstract geographic features to tell a richer story or highlight specific data .
Flow Maps
By placing stroked lines on top of a geographic map , a flow map can depict the movement of a quantity in space and ( implicitly ) in time .
Flow lines typically encode a large amount of multivariate information : path points , direction , line thickness , and color can all be used to present dimensions of information to the viewer .
Figure 3A is a modern interpretation of Charles Minard 's depiction of Napoleon 's ill - fated march on Moscow .
Many of the greatest flow maps also involve subtle uses of distortion , as geography is modified to accommodate or highlight flows .
Choropleth Maps
Based on the Work of Charles Minard
Data is often collected and aggregated by geographical areas such as states .
A standard approach to communicating this data is to use a color encoding of the geographic area , resulting in a choropleth map .
Figure 3B uses a color encoding to communicate the prevalence of obesity in each state in the U.S.
Though this is a widely used visualization technique , it requires some care .
One common error is to encode raw data values ( such as population ) rather than using normalized values to produce a density map .
Another issue is that one 's perception of the shaded value can also be affected by the underlying area of the geographic region .
Graduated Symbol Maps
Source : National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
An alternative to the choropleth map is the graduated symbol map , which places symbols over an underlying map .
This approach avoids confounding geographic area with data values and allows for more dimensions to be visualized ( e.g. , symbol size , shape , and color ) .
In addition to simple shapes such as circles , graduated symbol maps may use more complicated glyphs such as pie charts .
In figure 3C , total circle size represents a state 's population , and each slice indicates the proportion of people with a specific BMI rating .
Cartograms
Source : National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
A cartogram distorts the shape of geographic regions so that the area directly encodes a data variable .
A common example is to redraw every country in the world sizing it proportionally to population or gross domestic product .
Many types of cartograms have been created ; in figure 3D we use the Dorling cartogram , which represents each geographic region with a sized circle , placed so as to resemble the true geographic configuration .
In this example , circular area encodes the total number of obese people per state , and color encodes the percentage of the total population that is obese .
Hierarchies
Source : National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion
While some data is simply a flat collection of numbers , most can be organized into natural hierarchies .
Consider : spatial entities , such as counties , states , and countries ; command structures for businesses and governments ; software packages and phylogenetic trees .
Even for data with no apparent hierarchy , statistical methods ( e.g. , k - means clustering ) may be applied to organize data empirically .
Special visualization techniques exist to leverage hierarchical structure , allowing rapid multiscale inferences : micro-observations of individual elements and macro-observations of large groups .
Node - link Diagrams
The word tree is used interchangeably with hierarchy , as the fractal branches of an oak might mirror the nesting of data .
If we take a two - dimensional blueprint of a tree , we have a popular choice for visualizing hierarchies : a node - link diagram .
Many different tree - layout algorithms have been designed ; the Reingold - Tilford algorithm , used in figure 4A on a package hierarchy of software classes , produces a tidy result with minimal wasted space .
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
An alternative visualization scheme is the dendrogram ( or cluster ) algorithm , which places leaf nodes of the tree at the same level .
Thus , in the diagram in figure 4B , the classes ( orange leaf nodes ) are on the diameter of the circle , with the packages ( blue internal nodes ) inside .
Using polar rather than Cartesian coordinates has a pleasing aesthetic , while using space more efficiently .
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
We would be amiss to overlook the indented tree , used ubiquitously by operating systems to represent file directories , among other applications ( see figure 4C ) .
Although the indented tree requires excessive vertical space and does not facilitate multiscale inferences , it does allow efficient interactive exploration of the tree to find a specific node .
In addition , it allows rapid scanning of node labels , and multivariate data such as file size can be displayed adjacent to the hierarchy .
Adjacency Diagrams
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
The adjacency diagram is a space - filling variant of the node - link diagram ; rather than drawing a link between parent and child in the hierarchy , nodes are drawn as solid areas ( either arcs or bars ) , and their placement relative to adjacent nodes reveals their position in the hierarchy .
The icicle layout in figure 4D is similar to the first node - link diagram in that the root node appears at the top , with child nodes underneath .
Because the nodes are now space - filling , however , we can use a length encoding for the size of software classes and packages .
This reveals an additional dimension that would be difficult to show in a node - link diagram .
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
The sunburst layout , shown in figure 4E , is equivalent to the icicle layout , but in polar coordinates .
Both are implemented using a partition layout , which can also generate a node - link diagram .
Similarly , the previous cluster layout can be used to generate a space - filling adjacency diagram in either Cartesian or polar coordinates .
Enclosure Diagrams
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
The enclosure diagram is also space filling , using containment rather than adjacency to represent the hierarchy .
Introduced by Ben Shneiderman in 1991 , a treemap recursively subdivides area into rectangles .
As with adjacency diagrams , the size of any node in the tree is quickly revealed .
The example shown in figure 4 F uses padding ( in blue ) to emphasize enclosure ; an alternative saturation encoding is sometimes used .
Squarified treemaps use approximately square rectangles , which offer better readability and size estimation than a naive " slice - and - dice " subdivision .
Fancier algorithms such as Voronoi and jigsaw treemaps also exist but are less common .
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
By packing circles instead of subdividing rectangles , we can produce a different sort of enclosure diagram that has an almost organic appearance .
Although it does not use space as efficiently as a treemap , the " wasted space " of the circle - packing layout , shown in figure 4G , effectively reveals the hierarchy .
At the same time , node sizes can be rapidly compared using area judgments .
Networks
Source : Flare Visualization Toolkit ( http://flare.prefuse.org)
In addition to organization , one aspect of data that we may wish to explore through visualization is relationship .
For example , given a social network , who is friends with whom ?
Who are the central players ?
What cliques exist ?
Who , if anyone , serves as a bridge between disparate groups ?
Abstractly , a hierarchy is a specialized form of network : each node has exactly one link to its parent , while the root node has no links .
Thus node - link diagrams are also used to visualize networks , but the loss of hierarchy means a different algorithm is required to position nodes .
Mathematicians use the formal term graph to describe a network .
A central challenge in graph visualization is computing an effective layout .
Layout techniques typically seek to position closely related nodes ( in terms of graph distance , such as the number of links between nodes , or other metrics ) close in the drawing ; critically , unrelated nodes must also be placed far enough apart to differentiate relationships .
Some techniques may seek to optimize other visual features — for example , by minimizing the number of edge crossings .
Force - directed Layouts
A common and intuitive approach to network layout is to model the graph as a physical system : nodes are charged particles that repel each other , and links are dampened springs that pull related nodes together .
A physical simulation of these forces then determines the node positions ; approximation techniques that avoid computing all pairwise forces enable the layout of large numbers of nodes .
In addition , interactivity allows the user to direct the layout and jiggle nodes to disambiguate links .
Such a force - directed layout is a good starting point for understanding the structure of a general undirected graph .
In figure 5A we use a force - directed layout to view the network of character co-occurrence in the chapters of Victor Hugo 's classic novel , Les Misérables .
Node colors depict cluster memberships computed by a community - detection algorithm .
Arc Diagrams
Source : Knuth , D. E. 1993 . , Addison - Wesley .
An arc diagram , shown in figure 5B , uses a one - dimensional layout of nodes , with circular arcs to represent links .
Though an arc diagram may not convey the overall structure of the graph as effectively as a two - dimensional layout , with a good ordering of nodes it is easy to identify cliques and bridges .
Further , as with the indented - tree layout , multivariate data can easily be displayed alongside nodes .
The problem of sorting the nodes in a manner that reveals underlying cluster structure is formally called seriation and has diverse applications in visualization , statistics , and even archaeology .
Matrix Views
Source : Knuth , D. E. 1993 . , Addison - Wesley .
Mathematicians and computer scientists often think of a graph in terms of its adjacency matrix : each value in row i and column j in the matrix corresponds to the link from node i to node j .
Given this representation , an obvious visualization then is : just show the matrix !
Using color or saturation instead of text allows values associated with the links to be perceived more rapidly .
The seriation problem applies just as much to the matrix view , shown in figure 5C , as to the arc diagram , so the order of rows and columns is important : here we use the groupings generated by a community - detection algorithm to order the display .
While path following is harder in a matrix view than in a node - link diagram , matrices have a number of compensating advantages .
As networks get large and highly connected , node - link diagrams often devolve into giant hairballs of line crossings .
In matrix views , however , line crossings are impossible , and with an effective sorting one quickly can spot clusters and bridges .
Allowing interactive grouping and reordering of the matrix facilitates even deeper exploration of network structure .
Conclusion
Source : Knuth , D. E. 1993 . , Addison - Wesley .
We have arrived at the end of our tour and hope that the reader has found examples both intriguing and practical .
Though we have visited a number of visual encoding and interaction techniques , many more species of visualization exist in the wild , and others await discovery .
Emerging domains such as bioinformatics and text visualization are driving researchers and designers to continually formulate new and creative representations or find more powerful ways to apply the classics .
In either case , the DNA underlying all visualizations remains the same : the principled mapping of data variables to visual features such as position , size , shape , and color .
As you leave the zoo and head back into the wild , try deconstructing the various visualizations crossing your path .
Perhaps you can design a more effective display ?

The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy , scientific discovery , business strategy , and even our personal lives .
To get the most out of such data , however , users must be able to make sense of it : to pursue questions , uncover patterns of interest , and identify ( and potentially correct ) errors .
In concert with data - management systems and statistical algorithms , analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain - specific significance of the clusters , trends , and outliers discovered in data .

" But when are you going to get to the economics ? "
It was the end of my first day volunteering to teach " basic economics " to a group of fifth graders .
The teacher looked bemused as she asked the question .
" That 's what I 'm doing , " I whispered a little curtly in reply .
Realizing her offense , she quickly explained her meaning : " You know , with all the graphs and big words and stuff . "
I realized this teacher was under the common misperception ( perpetuated by most economics professors ) that economics is about math , models , and strange lands where a complete lack of real competition is called " perfect competition " and it is possible to visualize ( and measure ) human happiness using " utility curves . "
But I had no intention of subjecting these students to economics of this sort .
My goal was far more ambitious .
I wanted to show them that economics stems from ordinary human behavior in the real world we face every day .
So here is what we did .
My approach was painfully modest .
I simply introduced the students to one economic concept per week .
Lesson 1 : " Trade "
The first week 's " word for the day " was trade .
To illustrate trade , I gave each student a very small , inexpensive gift I had purchased at a Dollar General nearby .
I distributed the gifts randomly , then told the students they could trade their gifts ( if they wanted to ) with their immediate neighbors .
Some did .
Then I opened the class up to unrestricted trade and said they could trade with anyone in the whole classroom .
Many more now traded .
When they were finished I asked how many of them had traded because they believed by trading they would be better off .
All said they had .
Once they settled down again , we talked about the concept of trade in general .
I was impressed with how well they already understood this concept ; they seemed to clearly understand that exchange involves giving up something you value less for something you value more and finding someone else with opposite valuations .
For good measure , I ended the day by snatching away the gifts of two students and forcing a trade where none had been performed .
One student was happy with the exchange , the other unhappy .
This allowed us to discuss the idea of a " fair " trade — which I defined as a trade where both parties voluntarily take part .
Again , I was impressed with how easily they seemed to grasp this idea as I replaced the items I had snatched away for my " forced " trade . [ 1 ]
Lesson 2 : " Money "
The second week our economic concept was money — something all of the students had a keen awareness — if only a shadowy understanding — of .
To illustrate the nature of money I wrote a short play and gave the students different roles .
( There was no shortage of volunteers . )
The play was the story , familiar to students of Austrian School economics , of a long - ago egg farmer who had plenty of eggs but desired shoes .
Unfortunately , the shoemaker in his town did not like eggs , but often wanted wheat .
Fortunately , there was a wheat farmer nearby who wanted eggs and was willing to exchange wheat for eggs , which he did .
This gave the egg farmer a supply of wheat that he did not wish to consume but rather to employ as a " medium of exchange " to allow him to obtain shoes .
In other words , he used wheat as a form of money .
Of course the play was embellished with some ( attempted ) humor and silly characters , but the story was basically quite simple and the students seemed to understand its meaning well .
We then talked about what makes some goods better suited as money than others .
For instance , wheat is better than eggs or fish because it lasts longer and is more easily divisible into units of equal quality .
We then discussed things even better suited as money , such as gold or silver .
That was as far as we got , but by the end of the hour , I was at least satisfied that my students had a basic understanding of the nature and origin of " money " — something I was fairly certain none of them had heard before nor perhaps would hear again . [ 2 ]
Lesson 3 : " Savings "
On the third week of my class the economic concept of the day was savings .
In this day 's activity we divided the class into two " villages " — one made up of people who " live for the day " ( believing with Keynes that , in the long run , we 're all dead ) and the other village made up of savers .
Every day the kids in both villages went fishing with their bare hands and caught two fish each .
In the first village each person would eat both fish at a big party and feast .
In the second village , each student just ate one fish and put the second in a small pond located in their village .
Soon an intelligent villager came up with the idea for a net to help catch fish .
The trouble was the net would take a lot of time and effort to make .
Since several days were required , only the kids in the savers ' village had the resources available to abandon daily fishing to devote time to making a net .
Once they had a net , fewer " savers " were required to catch fish , freeing up other villagers to make bows and arrows , huts , and so on .
The " quality of life " in the savers ' village seemed to take off geometrically while life in the other village remained the same .
Interestingly , while at first many students had said they would prefer living in the " party " village , by the end of the class , most said they would prefer living in the savers village .
We ended the class period talking about the role of savings in allowing people to do things aimed at improving their lives : pursuits that also require time , such as attending school or changing jobs .
Lesson 4 : " Competition "
During the fourth week 's class the word for the day was competition and we played a game I call the " gas station game . "
Several students play the role of commuters and , at first , one student plays the role of a filling station owner .
In the first round of the game , the commuters travel from one side of the classroom to the other , but they require gasoline to make the full trip .
I allow the gas station owner to buy a supply of gasoline and then sell it at whatever price he wishes .
The commuters are free to car pool if they want , but must otherwise purchase some gasoline .
During round one , the station owner sold her gasoline for $ 2 per gallon , giving her a healthy profit of $ 1 per gallon sold .
In round two , I allowed a volunteer from the class to open a second gas station and charge whatever price he wanted .
This was repeated a third time until three competing stations were jockeying for the commuters ' dollars and gasoline was selling for an average of $ 1 per gallon ( one student was selling at a loss ) .
When the game was over we talked about what happened to the price of gasoline when competition occurred and even discussed how things would have been different if the " rules of the game " had prevented new competitors from coming along .
Lesson 5 : " Price "
At our final meeting , we talked a little about career choices .
I had the kids take a career - interest test and then discuss jobs they might want to some day have .
We then changed gears completely and discussed the economic concept of price .
To illustrate " prices " we held an auction .
Again I brought small gifts to the class and gave the kids pretend money ( in exchange for points they earned from the previous weeks ' activities ) .
Some kids had a lot of money ; others had less .
Still , each item was auctioned off to the highest bidder .
Items that had several bidders sold for higher prices than items with few bidders — establishing a role for " demand , " and when only one or two units of a particularly appealing item , such as chewing gum , remained , its price had a tendency to sky - rocket , showing that the physical quantity of a good matters in light of the human demand imposed on that quantity .
After this exhilarating exercise we discussed how what we had just learned about prices for goods might apply to salaries for the different careers they had discussed at the beginning of the hour .
We found that the same rules that established prices for the goods in the auction would also establish salaries or wages for different careers .
Demand for a labor service — acting on the available supply of people who can perform that service — will set the " wage " for that service .
Thus supply and demand , we found , could explain both the price of goods and the price of the human factors supplying those goods .
Conclusion
My goal with these fifth graders was not just to introduce them to the basics of economic science , but to inoculate them against future attempts to teach them bad economics .
By showing them that trade , money , savings , competition , and prices all have distinctly human origins and purposes , I hoped to help them make better sense out of the " economics " they will some day be exposed to .
Indeed , the concepts we discussed can easily be shown to relate quite directly to other economic concepts ; for instance , trade is related to opportunity cost as well as profit and loss ; money facilitates trade as well as economic calculation , savings is tied to investment , capital , and production , while competition and prices are related to demand , supply , and relative scarcity .
The constant animating force behind all human action , and the creativity it unleashes , cannot be captured in predictive models or in mathematical formulas .
It is precisely this fact that precludes employing the methods of the natural sciences to solve problems of human action . [ 3 ]
The fifth - grade teacher may have struggled with this understanding of economic science , but fortunately , her students had no trouble with it .
Notes
[ 1 ] According to some economists , we could have determined the appropriateness of this " trade " by subtracting the unhappy student 's loss of utility from the happy student 's increase in utility .
If we reached a positive number , the forced trade should have been allowed to stand .
[ 2 ] Mainstream economics treats money as a " store of value " and a thing whose quantity can be manipulated by monetary authorities in order to maintain " appropriate " interest rates , full employment , consumer confidence , etc .
