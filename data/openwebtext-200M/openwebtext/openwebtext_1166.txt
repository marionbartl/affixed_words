The news this morning that former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge believed that President Bush and his top advisers manipulated the terror threat alert system for their political gain is really -- and it ought to be -- a major story .
Ridge was in a position to know , for certain , whether this was the case .
And though he 's hinted at it before , he now says , in his soon - to - be - released book , that he was pressured into raising the alert level before the 2004 election .
Let 's see what Ridge actually writes before making too many conclusions .
Let 's talk to other Bush officials and try to figure out whether we need to exercise caution about Ridge 's own perspective .
For one thing , Ridge did n't immediately resign .
He resigned after the election .
If he believed at the time that manipulating the terror alert system was damaging to the country , and he said nothing , and when he did resign , he said nothing , then he does n't come off as a particularly sympathetic figure .
Ridge left the White House in 2005 .
He 's joined several corporate boards , has made a lot of money consulting on homeland security , and has been mostly silent .
He 's probably been saving it for the book .
Journalists , including myself , were very skeptical when anti-Bush liberals insisted that what Ridge now says is true , was true .
We were wrong .
Our skepticism about the activists ' conclusions was warranted because these folks based their assumption on gut hatred for President Bush , and not on any evaluation of the raw intelligence .
[ Addition :
That 's a hasty generalization .
Many of the loudest voices were reflexively anti-Bush , but I can't accurately describe the motivations of everyone , much less a majority , of those who were skeptical .
There were plenty of non-liberals who believed that the terror threats were exaggerated . ]
But journalists should have been even more skeptical about the administration 's pronouncements .
And yet -- we , too , were n't privy to the intelligence .
Information asymmetry is always going to exist , and , living as we do in a Democratic system , most journalists are going to give the government the benefit of some doubt , even having learned lessons about giving the government that benefit .
My colleague Justin Miller adds this caution :
My colleague Justin Miller adds this caution :
The question that needs to be asked of the raising the threat level before the election matter is whether there was a ) any intelligence that led people to believing there was a greater risk of attack .
If not , then raising the threat level was unquestionably a political move .
B ) If there was intelligence - and different people had different judgments on whether it was credible or spoke of an imminent threat - and Ridge landed on the side that said it was not so dangerous , that 's another matter .
Maybe " pressure " in that sense was the pressure of an abundance of caution , the " one- percent doctrine " and the example of the pre-election attacks in Madrid several months before our presidential .
It 's not as if the idea that al Qaeda may try to throw the U.S. election or wreak havoc was implausible .
We 'll have a better picture once Ridge 's book is directly quoted .
Rest assured the Cheney team will come out swinging against this too .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

A British hacker accused of infiltrating computers at NASA and the Pentagon has failed in his most recent attempt to evade extradition to the United States .
Gary McKinnon may soon be making his way across the pond to face charges stateside .
For some time McKinnon has been lobbying London 's High Court in a desperate attempt to avoid being extradited to America .
Unfortunately for McKinnon , the High Court has refused to even hear the case , pointing out that it did not meet " points of law of general public importance . "
In other words , the case simply does n't warrant a halt on the extradition .
( Source : crn.com )
McKinnon Case Complicated by Syndrome
McKinnon has been fighting a crusade to stay in the United Kingdom for a few years now .
Although a July 2006 order approved his extradition , a year later the British House of Lords ruled that his case could be heard , but that they could not guarantee he would n't be sent to the United States to face charges of infiltrating almost a hundred computers owned by NASA and the U.S. military .
Much of the reason Scottish - born McKinnon wants to stay in Britain has to do with his recent diagnosis of Asperger 's Syndrome , an autism spectrum disorder that can cause obsessive behavior and have significant impact on communication skills .
It 's not yet clear whether McKinnon 's psychological condition can be blamed in any way for the crimes , which the accused admits to have committed .
McKinnon claims he made the hacks in search of information on UFOs , and did not mean to threaten U.S. national security .
ACLU Supports McKinnon
McKinnon has received considerable support in his fight to stay home , not least of which has been offered by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , which wrote a letter to London 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office asking it to reconsider any extradition order .
" The recent tragic case of Gary McKinnon highlights the need to ensure that an individual 's case is properly judicially reviewed and the courts have the power to bar extradition if the interests of justice require it , " said the ACLU at the time .
McKinnon and his lawyers have been given two weeks by the U.K. government to consider their options moving forward .

The gaming industry has gotten bigger and better with each passing year , but sometimes they just do n’t do things right .
Whether it ’s gameplay , story , pricing , or business practice , sometimes the industry needs a little friendly fire from the gamers to keep it in line .
Other times , developers look down their sight and fire off a well placed bullet right into our unexpected head .
This is Josh & Cameron , and this is Headshots & Friendly Fire .
A Bit of Friendly Fire
Exploding enemies
Now , I ’m not talking about when you shoot an enemy in Fallout 3 and his limbs fly off like a blood & meat firework ; I ’m talking about when an enemy apparently shoves some C4 up his Rectum and suicide bombs you .
Exploding enemies have been everywhere is videogames .
They ’ve been in Real - Time Strategies like Starcraft , First - Person Shooters like Serious Sam , and Third - Person action games like inFamous .
It ’s time for exploding enemies to just die already .
Sure , back in the Doom days the exploding enemy provided a lot of variety between the enemy with gun , enemy with melee attack , and enemy with bigger gun , but we do n’t need exploding enemies anymore .
We have A.I. , gravity guns , and creative environments .
In fact , exploding enemies now seem like more of a punishment for good gameplay .
In Jericho , an exploding enemy can take out you and your whole team in just one blast , so instead of sticking with your team , the smart thing to do is to leave them to die while you run away .
In inFamous , I ’ll be fighting a group of enemies , being very careful to not hit civilians , and then an exploding enemy will kill a bunch of people and I ’ll receive negative karma for it .
While playing multiplayer in Call of Duty , ill win a firefight with somebody only to be blown up because he had the Martyrdom perk .
The only defense against an exploding enemy is to stay away , and at that point any game turns into just a deadly form of “ tag . ”
Lack of Custom Controls
There is nothing worse in a game than the developers forcing presite control schemes on the player .
Everyone plays games differently and are comfortable with certain control schemes so why force a player into 3 or 4 preset controls ?
Two games that have recently been guilty of this have been Mirror ’s Edge and Killzone 2 .
Mirror ’s Edge had one of the weirdest control schemes ever presented and none of the other preset combination ’s really helped .
Killzone 2 was not as bad but still came across very different compared to most FPS ’s on the market .
So please developers , let us set our on control scheme , it will make for a more enjoyable game for everyone .
Mandatory weak spots on enemies
You know , I spent 10 minutes shooting that bat from Resident Evil 5 in the face with a shotgun before I realized you have to shoot it ’s underside to kill it .
Mandatory weak spots make no sense ; I do n’t care how much armor you claim that bat has , a shotgun to the face is going to hurt .
Now , that bat was a boss battle , and boss battles have almost exclusively been a “ shoot the various weak points ” kind of battle in games .
I really have no idea why game developers take this approach for bosses .
Bosses done in this way are not naturally harder than regular bosses ; they are just more annoying .
It also seems like a really uncreative way to make the boss distinct from regular enemies .
If you want to create a unique and fun boss battle , then give the boss unique and powerful attacks .
The final boss in Dark Cloud , the chainsaw boss in RE4 & 5 , the Boss in MGS3 : these are all difficult and fun bosses , not because they make you do some arbitrary sequence of attacks , but because they are strong and ruthless in their attacks .
In fact , having the player fight these enemies in only one way would be disastrous ; these battles require the player to use all the tools at his / her disposal , and to change tactics based on how the fight is going .
I really liked the Lost Planet 2 demo because it does this very same thing .
Although the giant salamander has weak points , the player is n’t forced to attack them , and could use any variety of attacks or just stand there and shoot it in the face ( like me ) .
Hey videogame developers , next time you want to put a boss with mandatory weak points in your game , just put a target on a merry - go - round and have the player shoot it .
It ’ll be just as fun , and make twice as much sense .
Comparison Screenshots and Pixel Counters
Most all of us know the tiny differences between a PS3 and 360 game but that has not stopped websites from posting up comparisons of multiplatform games for flamebait .
The game looks just fine on both consoles , there is hardly any difference between the two yet people love to throw out these comparisons to try and find some major difference .
Then you have the pixel counters who want to make a big deal because a title is lacking just a few pixels that most people will never notice .
People have become so snobby and are hating games simply due to a tiny drop in pixels or the fact that it looks a bit better on this console .
As long as the game is a blast to play , it shouldnt matter if its lacking little pixels here or there .

Groups call on presidential candidates to take a stand on the Reproductive Health bill .
( Photo courtesy of Dodie Lucas , PLCPD )
MANILA - Reproductive health advocates on Friday urged presidential candidates to lay bare their proposals to handle the country 's population growth rate as well as their position on the controversial Reproductive Health and Population Development Bill , also known as the RH bill .
Ramon San Pascual , executive director of the Philippine Legislators ' Committee on Population and Development Foundation , Inc. ( PLCPD ) , said the recent statements made by Catholic leaders threatening the withdrawal of support for Sen. Benigno " Noynoy " Aquino III 's presidential bid has made the reproductive health debate an electoral issue .
" Reproductive health as an issue has matured to the point that the candidates and the electorate have a clear appreciation for it .
It affects mothers and fathers who are having problems raising their kids .
It affects the single people who are planning for marriage .
Family planning and reproductive health are topics that are close to the heart of ordinary people and now that it has been touched on by the Church , it has become a legitimate electoral issue , " San Pascual said in a Quezon City forum .
He added : " The candidates therefore should make their positions very clear .
What are their positions on neonatal health ?
How about maternal deaths and lack of access to family planning services ?
These are issues that should be articulated by the candidates and their parties . "
Aquino recently came under fire from Catholic leaders , particularly Cebu Archbishop Ricardo Cardinal Vidal , after the senator expressed support for House Bill No. 5043 or the RH bill .
San Pascual said Aquino is not the lone potential presidential candidate who has expressed support for the RH bill .
Aside from Aquino , he said Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro and Sen. Francis Escudero , both potential candidates , have also backed the bill .
San Pascual said all candidates should make reproductive health a central issue in the elections by articulating their stand on the proposed law .
" The best way to handle the issue is to be honest about it .
Keeping silent about it shows the kind of character you have .
People are looking for candidates who are forthright , have integrity and who stand by their word , " he told abs - cbnNEWS.com .
He said candidates should also accept the challenge laid down by Catholic leaders that pro-RH legislators would face Catholic pressure in the 2010 elections .
" If certain bishops say they will take away votes from you , there are many other groups who can say that they will vote for you .
The RH bill speaks to a broad constituency and those groups will support those who back the RH bill , " he said .
Elizabeth Angsioco , secretary - general of the Reproductive Health Advocacy Network , also said various women groups are taking up the cudgels for candidates who have been on the receiving end of Catholic pressure because of their stand on the RH bill .
" It is true that the Catholic hierarchy puts pressure on candidates that they oppose .
We have seen it in past elections .
However , the other part of the equation is that pressure does not work .
In relation to Noynoy , Teodoro and the other presidential candidates , women 's groups and nongovernment organizations who support the RH bill will support [ these ] candidates .
This is actually an improvement over the past elections because candidates before would just remain mum on the issue , " she said .
She also said the RH debate is a test of the candidates ' principles and character .
" Kung kaunting pitik lang e uurong ka na , eh it says something also about your principles , " she said .
14 - year delay
San Pascual said the House of Representatives should act now and vote on HB5043 before Congress goes on recess on October 15 .
Angsioco also denied claims made by some Catholic bishops that the RH bill is railroaded in the Lower House .
She said the first bill that covered reproductive health was submitted by then Bukidnon 1st District Rep. Socorro Acosta in July 1995 .
" How can people say that we are railroading when it has been stalled in Congress for the past 14 years ?
Fourteen years is more than enough time for the bill to be discussed , evaluated and finally passed , " she said .
Angsioco said more than 150 congressmen have pledged support for the RH bill including 132 Lower House members who have signed up to be co-authors of House Bill No. 5043 .
She said this means that only about 50 congressmen are undecided or opposed to the bill .
" In terms of numbers , the RH bill already has that .
If they took a vote today , I am certain it will pass , " she said .
On the other hand , she said some legislators have engaged in delaying tactics to ensure that the bill would not be passed before Congress goes on recess .
In a recent House session to discuss the bill , three congressmen stood up and asked for additional time to discuss the merits of HB 5043 .
" It seems that the minority is holding hostage the legislative process , " she said .
Angsioco said that in this Congress , 14 out of the 90 session days were spent on discussing the RH bill .
She said that while Congress continues to dilly - dally on the bill , more families are doing without access to potentially lifesaving procedures such as vasectomies and ligations that would help them plan their families .
Bishop Rodrigo Tano of the Interfaith Partnership for the Promotion of Responsible Parenthood also criticized some Church people for threatening potential candidates that they would lose the support of the Catholic Church if they support the RH bill .
" This is a misuse of religious authority .
As a churchman , I do not agree that we should use our ecclesiastical position to blackmail candidates .
Our Constitution clearly allows freedom of the practice of belief and religion and it upholds the separation of Church and State .
Religious authority should not be used to threaten , " he said .
" It 's really a matter of rights .
Our candidates should be free to make their own judgments on what programs to support without the threat of religious blackmail , " he added .
for a more recent update on Typhoon Lupit , CLICK HERE
The Philippines is still reeling from the effects of two tropical cyclones in as many weeks .
Over 710 have been reported dead so far from the storms and the economy of the country has been severely affected .
Yesterday , I posted the comments of Philippines President Gloria Arroyo that her country was a victim of climate change , not two typhoons , and was therefore entitled for compensation from the culprits , which presumably is the industrialized world .
Well , the president and the rest of the country may have bigger fish to fry in the near term .
They need to prepare for Typhoon Lupin .
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center Typhoon Lupin Forecast
Track takes the storm very near to the same landfall location as Typhoon Parma .
From the forecast , one can ascertain that , unlike Parma or Ketsana before , Lupin will be on the upswing of its lifecycle , meaning that instead of a typhoon that has seen its better days , this one is forecast to be an intensifying tropical cyclone when it makes landfall .
Two things .
The landfall time is still several days away so the forecast is not a sure thing and any deviation of the track over the next 48 hours or so could greatly impact the eventual effect on the Philippines .
Second is that the trend of the forecast was a little farther south than the current thinking .
But , again , the alteration has not been that significant and any impact on the Philippines will be something for the locals to contend with considering the devastation that has occurred and the saturation of mountainous regions in the northern part of the country .
Is is October 11th , yet ?
lol , no you are not blind .
It 's like the tail of a dragon which how much you try to watch its body and face it moves around the frame !
by the way , the more you magnify the more details you encounter .
Fractals are known as untamed monsters or dragons due to their special properties .
TARP , the Troubled Asset Relief Program , is a year old now .
On Sept. 19 , 2008 , former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced the need for a $ 700 billion program to purchase toxic assets held by banks to prevent a financial meltdown , and after some modification Congress rapidly approved TARP on Oct.
3 . Looking back after a year , was TARP necessary ?
Did it work ?
The answers are No , and No .
To look at the first question , consider what TARP was designed to do .
Secretary Paulson said interbank lending had dried up because banks had toxic assets ( mortgage - backed securities ) clogging their portfolios .
Because nobody knew what they were worth , banks were uncertain of the financial security of other banks .
This uncertainty caused a reluctance to lend and prompted the financial markets to lock up .
The solution , Paulson argued , was to approve TARP and use $ 700 billion to buy the toxic assets .
Replacing the assets with Treasury securities would fortify bank balance sheets and interbank lending would resume .
It is easy to say the program wasnt necessary , despite Paulsons arguments , because the TARP money wasnt used to buy toxic assets .
TARP money was instead used to buy preferred stock in banks , shoring up their balance sheets by giving the federal government part ownership of the banks .
Nine of the largest banks were forced to issue stock to the Treasury , paid for with TARP money , even though several of the banks tried to opt out .
Secretary Paulson said that if some of the big banks participated and others didnt , it would identify their varying levels of weakness , which Paulson believed was undesirable .
Instead of buying up toxic assets , the TARP money was used to partially nationalize the banking industry .
It was also used for a federal takeover of AIG ( after it was initially rescued by the Fed ) and the bailout of Chrysler and General Motors .
When the auto companies initially approached Secretary Paulson for a share of the money , he said it was only to be used for the purchase of toxic assets from financial institutions .
But when Congress wouldnt bail out the auto industry , Paulson changed his tune .
Was it necessary to appropriate $ 700 billion to buy toxic assets ?
In hindsight , we can see the answer is No , because the money wasnt used that way .
Are we any better off for having used it instead to partially nationalize financial institutions and manufacturing firms ?
All TARP did for Chrysler and GM was delay their bankruptcies for six months and buy the government its ownership interest .
As for the banks , it may be that some of them would have failed without the money , but that is not a bad thing .
When firms take risks , they must balance the potential profits from success against the potential losses from failure , and the TARP support removes the last part of that balancing act .
There may have been some dislocations in the short run from bank failures , but in the long run allowing them to go under preserves the incentive structure that fuels a market economy .
Banks are financial intermediaries that match up borrowers and lenders .
When a bank goes under , it does not reduce the amount of money available to borrowers , or prevent savers from providing money that can be lent .
Other financial intermediaries are available to borrowers and lenders to replace the activities that failed banks would have performed .
Ultimately , what TARP did was provide funds for the government to take an ownership interest in private firms .
Nationalizing our financial and industrial firms is not in the public interest .
The federal government now owns 80 percent of AIG and 61 percent of GM .
TARP was not necessary .
It didnt work .
And what it actually did was undesirable .
Evil plans do n't come up with themselves , you know ..

Post subject : Strip Club Disaster !!!
I get my $ 20 in ones and another $ 100 for lap dances .
I immediately spot my love , it was lust at first sight .
I got a five song dance for $ 80 and I gotta say it was fantastic .
As we are leaving , me and this girl we were with were waiting outside while my friend was in the bathroom , she looks at my pants ( which were white ) there was a GIANT blood stain on my pants .
Probably the grossest / funniest thing that has happened in a long time .
So I go in to talk to the manager and she WOULD NOT refund my money .
She said I had to call the next morning and talk to the owner and he will handle the situation .
I told her that if I do n't get my money back , my next call is going to be the tampa tribune .
This got her attention and she immediately got her attention but he did n't pick up because it was 5 am .
I 'm posting from my phone but I 'll post up .
What a weird / crazy / disgusting night .
Sorry for any grammar or spelling , I 'm a little under the weather right now .
So last night my buddies and I painted the town red and I have the stain on my pants to prove it .
The night started off at one of my buddies house to watch the Gator game .
The perk of their house is that it is five minutes from the bars so when the game ended , we made our trek .
Already pretty intoxicated , we all decided to switch Jack and cokes instead of beer .
As a tradition , we cap the night off with our favorite strip club , the world famous Mons Venus .

So last night my buddies and I painted the town red and I have the stain on my pants to prove it .
The night started off at one of my buddies house to watch the Gator game .
The perk of their house is that it is five minutes from the bars so when the game ended , we made our trek .
Already pretty intoxicated , we all decided to switch Jack and cokes instead of beer .
As a tradition , we cap the night off with our favorite strip club , the world famous Mons Venus .
I get my $ 20 in ones and another $ 100 for lap dances .
I immediately spot my love , it was lust at first sight .
I got a five song dance for $ 80 and I gotta say it was fantastic .
As we are leaving , me and this girl we were with were waiting outside while my friend was in the bathroom , she looks at my pants ( which were white ) there was a GIANT blood stain on my pants .
Probably the grossest / funniest thing that has happened in a long time .
So I go in to talk to the manager and she WOULD NOT refund my money .
She said I had to call the next morning and talk to the owner and he will handle the situation .
I told her that if I do n't get my money back , my next call is going to be the tampa tribune .
This got her attention and she immediately got her attention but he did n't pick up because it was 5 am .
I 'm posting from my phone but I 'll post up .
What a weird / crazy / disgusting night .
Sorry for any grammar or spelling , I 'm a little under the weather right now .

I wanted to make sure the stain would show up better .
But to clarify the pants , they were just a pair of standard Tommy Bahama khakis .
They were n't like linen pants or white jeans lol .
Like I said we were at my buddies house watching the gator game so no one was dressed up .
I was wearing a two button polo , khakis ( that happen to be more whitish ) and boat shoes .
Hardly strip club attire lol .
What I forgot to mention was that during the dance the girl makes a comment to me about how good my pants feel and how irritating it is ( literally ) giving dances to guys in jeans .
When we were outside , I see the girl that just used my leg as a tampon getting escorted out by the manager saying " get the Bubb Rubb out of here , you 're on Bubb Rubbing drugs and do n't plan on coming back " .
She replies " ok I 'll see you guys in 6 days " .
I did n't know if I wanted to vomit or die laughing when I heard that .
He of course replied with " you are done here , if you want to goto a place where you can act like that , go across the street to 2001 " I wanted to make sure the stain would show up better .

As a little background information by the way , Mons Venus is a world reknown strip club .
They are known for having a good portion of girls there that have posed in playboy and various other fine publications .
For anyone traveling to Tampa on business or when it is one of your boys ( or girls ) birthdays it is just where you end up going .
The girls actually come from all over the country to work there and the selection can meet ANYONES needs .
You want a girl with sleeve tattoos and piercings but with a 10 face , you goto mons .
The club is this tiny place with one circular stage in the center no more than 20 feet in diameter and then there are two rows of one large circular couch that surrounds the club .
There are NO private rooms so at mons a true " friction " dance is no more than that .
The only difference is the sheer number of girls they have in the place compared to the number of customers .
In this small room maybe the size of a store in the mall like The Gap , there are 40 - 50 girls walking around either topless of fully nude already .
All of them are 8 +'s even in the light with I 'd say 25 % true 10s .
Peoples jaws drop when they walk in this place because there really is no other club in the nation like it , and the fact that you can get nothing more than a dance ( allowed to touch anything but the hoo hoo ) does n't bother people in the slightest .
Just google mons Venus and the site will be the first hit .
I 'm not going to link it because of the nudity .

Post subject : Jensen , legally speaking I can't do anything about this .
I actually told my dad about the situation because if anyone could handle getting my money back and a new pair of pants it would be him .
Unfortunately , this place is owned by Joe Redner , a very powerful and very well " connected " man in Tampa .
So it turns out i'm just going to have to eat the $ 80 and the cost of the pants .
He said he is the last person you want to get involved with even in a situation like this , so it turns out all i have is a funny story .
I did n't even really think about it at the time but imagine if I got a dance from another girl after this girl without knowing about the issue .
The girls at mobs are tested every month but 30 days is plenty of time for a stripper to get an STD .
I really liked those damn pants too , legally speaking I can't do anything about this .

A protester threw a shoe at the managing director of the International Monetary Fund at the end of his speech at a university on Thursday in the prelude to I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Istanbul .
The protester , Selcuk Ozbek , a student at Anadolu University , shouted , “ Get out of the university , I.M.F. thief ! ” threw a white sneaker and ran toward the podium where the managing director , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , stood .
But televised images showed Mr. Ozbek being quickly tackled by security guards .
A female student then tried to unfurl a banner but was surrounded by security officials , allowing Mr. Strauss - Kahn to calmly answer a last question before leaving the hall .

Mr. Strauss - Kahn played down the episode .
“ I was glad to meet students and hear their views , ” he said in a written statement released afterward .
“ This is what the I .M.F. needs to do , even if not everyone agrees with us .
One thing I learned : Turkish students are polite .
They waited until the end to complain . ”
Tucked away in an $ 87 billion higher education bill that passed the House last week was a broad new federal initiative aimed not at benefiting college students , but at raising quality in the early learning and care programs that serve children from birth through age 5 .
The initiative , the Early Learning Challenge Fund , would channel $ 8 billion over eight years to states with plans to improve standards , training and oversight of programs serving infants , toddlers and preschoolers .
The Senate is expected to pass similar legislation this fall , giving President Obama , who proposed the Challenge Fund during the presidential campaign , a bill to sign in December .
Experts describe the current array of programs serving young children and their families nationwide as a hodgepodge of efforts with little coordination or coherence .
Financing comes from a shifting mix of private , local , state and federal money .
Programs are run out of storefronts and churches , homes and Head Start centers , public schools and other facilities .
Quality is uneven , with some offering stimulating activities , play and instruction but others providing little more than a room and a television .

A day at the spa is often a luxury we overlook or consider ourselves too busy for .
However , the spa at the The Ritz Carlton , Laguna Niguel it is a rare delight you cannot pass up .
As you turn into the driveway of One Ritz - Carlton Drive , you feel as if you have left reality and entered into a glamorous and serene oasis .
The hotel is situated on a 150 - foot bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean , giving the oversize bay windows lining the hallways of the lobby a 180 - degree view .
Every window presents delightful views of deep blue water framed by rugged cliffs and sandy beach .
Having lived in France for a few years and traveled all through the southern regions , I must say that the Ritz - Carlton , Laguna Niguel was reminiscent of Monte Carlo ; the Pacific Ocean waters outside closely resembled the colors of the French Riviera .
Lining the outside of the lobby and the left wing of the hotel are the gardens where you can grab a book and enjoy the peaceful ocean on a wicker chair or take a romantic stroll at sunset .
As soon as we arrived , we were warmly greeted and taken through the lobby , straight to the luxurious Ritz - Carlton Spa .
With 12 private treatment rooms and an Oceanfront Fitness Center , complete with those same panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean , you find yourself easily slipping into a Zen - like state of mind .
Dimly lit crystal chandeliers combined with the sound of running water from multiple fountains in the women 's lounge all work together to create a peaceful retreat that melts away weeks demanding schedule .
After unwinding with a glass of cucumber / lemon infused water , I was escorted into a private treatment room .
The hour - long custom Ritz - Carlton signature massage that I received , focused on specific " problem areas . "
My therapist was very responsive and worked with deep strokes and various movements that left me in a soothed and rejuvenated state .
The massage was also paired with a Wild Lime Scalp Treatment as well as a Foot Balm Treatment that left me completely relaxed -- and light years from the state of mind I had been in upon arrival .
After leaving the spa , we enjoyed a 3 - course brunch at Restaurant 162 , which , of course also had a perfect ocean view on a beautiful Sunday afternoon .
We enjoyed champagne and pastries as we glanced over the menu and I finally decided on a salmon crepe appetizer followed by a lobster eggs Florentine , finishing with an array of assorted cookies and ice creams .
Chef Garcia , famous for his fresh ingredients and exceptional seafood dishes did not disappoint ; the flavor and presentation was flawless .
For the past two decades the Ritz - Carlton , Laguna Niguel has continually been ranked among the best resorts in the world .
It is not only one of the most luxurious properties , but it is also in one of the most breathtaking destinations in the country .
Their personalized service , award - winning dining and remarkable attention to detail made this a true luxury experience .

If we wanted to know how to cure a sick cow we could ask the scientist known as a veterinarian .
The veterinarian has studied the biology , physiology , anatomy , etc. , of animals and could probably help us with our sick cow .
Veterinarians know about cows and cow diseases .
Vets can back up their knowledge with thousands of experiments and the accumulation of mountains of incontrovertible data . [ i ]
On the other hand , there are people who pretend to be scientists and pretend to have explanations for how certain things work -- things that either do n't exist or are n't anything like the phenomena that the pretend scientist claims that the things are .
Take " ghost hunters " as an example .
What is their science ?
Does it have a name ? [ ii ]
How does one become a ghost - hunting scientist ?
What evidence qualifies for proving that ghosts exists ?
How do ghost hunters cure us of the ghosts ?
( By mumbling some words and then telling their gullible clients that the ghost is gone ? )
Does n't the " science " of ghost hunting presume , without any credible evidence , the existence of ghosts ?
How do these ghost scientists even look for something that probably does n't exist ?
Notice that veterinarians do n't assume that cows are sick and that there is only one cow sickness .
They study the cow for symptoms and then render a diagnosis .
( A diagnosis , I should add , that the vet might change if the symptoms of the cow change . )
Now to our topic :
What about the science of global warming ?
Is it more like the science of healing cows or the " science " of ghost hunting ?
For starters , let me make it clear that the leaders of the AGW movement claim that there is a global warming science .
Al Gore 's official web site is called : " An Inconvenient Truth Official Site : Global Warming Science , Climate Change Science , Facts and Evidence . "
[ Emphasis added . ] [ iii ]
Got that ?
" Global Warming Science . "
Let 's ask ourselves :
What could global warming science possibly be ? [ iv ]
Remember , when we needed a scientist to tell us whether or not a cow was sick -- we asked a vet .
But what scientist do we ask to tell us that the world is " sick " because it is getting warmer ?
And are n't there two huge assumptions in the questions to begin with ?
Namely , ( 1 ) that the world is actually getting warmer ?
And ( 2 ) that warmer means sick .
( " Can you prove to me the world is getting warmer and is sick ? " is much more like asking , " Can you prove to me the noise I hear is a ghost and is scary ? " than it is " Can you show me why this cow is sick and what is the specific disease ? " [ v ] )
When we talk to a global warming " scientist " are we talking to the equivalent of a veterinarian or a ghost hunter ?
And with whom , exactly , are we talking ?
I , for one , have never heard anyone actually make this claim : " I am a global warming scientist . "
So I did a little research .
With a special thanks to Robert Carter , Professor at the Marine Geophysical Laboratory , James Cook University , Australia , here are some candidates for the title of " Global Warming Scientist " :
(1) ENABLING DISCIPLINES :
( a) Mathematics
( b) Statistics
( c) Computer modeling
(2) ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES :
(d) Atmospheric physics
(e) Atmospheric chemistry
( f) Cosmochemistry
(g) Meteorology
( h) Climatology ( partim )
(3) GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES :
( i) Climatology ( partim )
( j) Geochemistry
( k) Geophysics
(l) Geology
( m) Palaeolimnology
(n) Palaeoclimatology
(o) Palaeoecology
( p) Palaeontology ( up to and including - i.e. subsuming - biological studies )
( q ) Stratigraphy
(r) Quaternary geology
(s) Palaeooceanography
(t) Ice core studies
( u) Ocean Drilling Program
( v) Cosmogenic and radiometric dating
Professor Carter in a personal email to me also estimates :
[ T ] hat there are more than 100 expert sub disciplines involved in climate change studies ; my personal filing system recognizes more than 80 alone , and I am sure there are many topics not included .
In other words , I have given AT readers a short list of possible global warming scientist candidates .
So what is a global warming " scientist ? "
The answer could be one of two things :
One : there is no such thing as a global warming scientist .
There is , instead , a consensus among a number of scientists in differing fields that the planet is warming at an alarming rate .
This is the usual explanation that we hear .
There are a couple rational criticisms of this position that need to be understood .
Science is not in the business of consensus .
It is ( usually ) in the business of collecting specific facts and then creating abstract principles and general conclusions from those specific facts . [ vi ]
Now this does not mean that these facts cannot be collected and shared by different scientists from different disciplines -- in fact , science is becoming so complex that such cross-disciplinary accumulation and exchange of data is now the norm , rather than the exception .
Here is the problem with this approach as summarized by Professor Carter :
Nobody , including Jim Hansen , is truly expert across more than one or two of these topics .
It follows that no scientist " understands " climate change ; rather , tens of thousands of scientists each understand , to a greater or lesser degree , those small parts of the climate change miasma that they have personally studied .
Sharing on this level of minutia would be okay but for ( as Carter so masterfully puts it ) the " climate change miasma . "
The fact is that the specific facts are not leading in a highly probable way to any general conclusions about global warming , CO2 , and our ( human ) part in it .
Induction just is n't working to prove the catastrophic theory of man made global warming ... and most scientists know it . [ vii ]
This is why those of us who have carefully studied the IPCC reports detect the numerous discrepancies between the logic of the scientists ' articles in the body of the reports ( and in any outside peer reviewed materials that disagree with the IPCC findings and are therefore spurned ) and the rhetoric of doom and gloom in the political summaries of the reports .
Scientists that complain about the polarization and the politicizing of the scientific process at the IPCC are routinely ignored , demoted , fired , or quit .
Here are 50 ( that 's right FIFTY ) articles that prove this internal dissension within the IPCC and between the leaders of the IPCC and the rest of the scientific community .
All of the talk about " healing the planet " should n't be fooling anyone .
Global warming science is mostly about grant money , about keeping the myth alive , about buying fancy new equipment to prove that there really are ghosts ... er ... global warming .
All of this talk of global warming is n't about healing anything .
It is about stretching out the process of proving the unprovable and getting paid for it -- as long as the public can be suckered into coughing up the money for the ongoing studies .
If the history of our human fascination with ghosts is any indication , the " science " of global warming is just getting started .
Two ( and more hopefully ) : maybe all of this confusion is finally teaching us that there is no science , none at all , of global warming .
Maybe the earth warms and then it cools .
Maybe there are sick cows and healthy cows .
Maybe some ghosts are just a loose window , or rats in the attic , or someone 's vivid imagination and the need to believe in something greater ( and spookier ) than the self .
It is not that we have learned nothing by focusing on the " problem " of global warming -- we have learned many things .
I would hope that the most important thing that we have learned is that we should not take a half baked theory by Al Gore and jump to the conclusion that we must drastically reduce our output of CO2 or human beings will lay waste to the planet as the world exponentially heats beyond our ability to stop the carnage .
And the only way to seriously reduce the human contribution of CO2 [ viii ] is to completely ( on a worldwide basis ) revamp our system of energy production , delivery , and consumption -- by utilizing the full coercive power of the each nation state and the United Nations to enforce Draconian laws and regulations on the lifestyles of every human being on this planet .

The proponents of global warming have been trying to shift the terms from the conclusory " global warming " to the more open and objective sounding " climate change . "
I have written about that elsewhere and will not go into their terminology scam here .
[ iv ]
I recently published an article on AT showing that the probability of human beings as the major cause of any type of the heating of our planet is very low .
But in this article let 's focus on another question : is there is such a thing as a " science " of global warming .
[ v ]
Here is the logic :
Some things are cows , some cows are healthy and some are sick .
It is hard for an untrained person to always tell the difference .
The scientist who specializes in animals can , perhaps , tell us whether the animal is ill and what that sickness is .
The ghost " scientist , " like the global warming scientist , assumes the existence of the subject matter .
( The ghost hunter assumes the existence of the ghost ; the global warming scientist assumes a world that is getting warmer and sicker . )
The faulty logic of these people is sometimes argumentum ex silentio and sometimes argumentum ad verecundiam -- although the dead polar bears and drowning cities arguments we hear from Al Gore fall under argumentum ad baculum .
[ vi ]
This is called inductive reasoning .
And it is the form of reasoning most often used in science .
I have written about inductive reasoning and global warming here .
Those who have been convinced by Thomas Kuhn that science is driven by consensus need to read David Stove 's " The Jazz Age in the Philosophy of Science . "
This devastating essay ( devastating for the followers of Kuhn anyway ) has been reproduced in a number of works , most recently it appeared in Against the Idols of the Age , Transaction Publishers , 2001 , edited by Roger Kimball .

This is why those of us who have carefully studied the IPCC reports notice the almost indescribable discrepancies between the rhetoric of the scientists in the body of the reports when contrasted with the fatalistic prophecies in the summaries of the reports .

Four Billion Little Brothers ?
Privacy , mobile phones , and ubiquitous data collection
Participatory sensing technologies could improve our lives and our communities , but at what cost to our privacy ?
Katie Shilton , University of California , Los Angeles
They place calls , surf the Internet , and there are close to 4 billion of them in the world .
Their built - in microphones , cameras , and location awareness can collect images , sound , and GPS data .
Beyond chatting and texting , these features could make phones ubiquitous , familiar tools for quantifying personal patterns and habits .
They could also be platforms for thousands to document a neighborhood , gather evidence to make a case , or study mobility and health .
This data could help you understand your daily carbon footprint , exposure to air pollution , exercise habits , and frequency of interactions with family and friends .
At the same time , however , this data reveals a lot about your regular locations , habits , and routines .
Once such data is captured , acquaintances , friends , or authorities might coerce you to disclose it .
Perhaps worse , it could be collected or reused without your knowledge or permission .
At the extreme , mobile phones could become the most widespread embedded surveillance tools in history .
Imagine carrying a location - aware bug , complete with a camera , accelerometer , and Bluetooth stumbling , everywhere you go .
Your phone could document your comings and goings , infer your activities throughout the day , and record whom you pass on the street or who engaged you in conversation .
Deployed by governments or compelled by employers , 4 billion " little brothers " could be watching you .
Whether phones engaged in sensing data are tools for self and community research , coercion , or surveillance depends on who collects the data , how it is handled , and what privacy protections users are given .
As these new forms of data begin to flow over phone networks , application developers will be the first line of defense for protecting the sensitive data collected by always - present , always - on mobile phones .
I should mention that I 'm not one of the developers on the front lines .
I work in science and technology studies ( STS ) , a social science interested in the ways people , technologies , and data interact and affect each other .
The developers I work with might say STS is about telling them what they should be doing — which I must admit is the goal of this article .
I worry about the consequences of mobile phones as sensors , and have a number of opinions about what programmers , as well as social scientists , might do to make this sort of data collection work without slipping into coercion , surveillance , and control .
Participatory sensing
Research that uses mobile phones to collect data for personal or social projects is called mobile , urban , or participatory sensing .
2- 4 Participatory sensing is meant to enable ( and encourage ) anyone to gather and investigate previously invisible data .
It tries to avoid surveillance or coercive sensing by emphasizing individuals ' participation in the sensing process .
Applications designed to enable participatory sensing range from the very personal and self - reflective to shareable data meant to improve an individual 's health or a community 's experience .
This article examines three applications from UCLA 's CENS ( Center for Embedded Networked Sensing ) to illustrate the diversity of possibilities , as well as suggest data collection and sharing concerns .
PEIR ( Personal Environmental Impact Report ) .
Participants in PEIR carry mobile phones throughout their day to calculate their carbon footprints and exposure to air pollution — both big concerns in smoggy Los Angeles , where the project is based .
By referencing GPS and cell towers , the phones upload participants ' locations every few seconds .
Based on these time - location traces , the PEIR system can infer participant activities ( walking , biking , driving , riding the bus ) throughout the day .
The system maps the combination of location , time , and activity to Southern California regional air quality and weather data to estimate individual carbon footprint and exposure to particulate matter .
Sensing a participant 's location throughout the day enables more accurate and previously unavailable information about environmental harms people face , as well as the harms they create .
To participate , individuals need to record and submit a continuous location trace .
Biketastic .
This project improves bike commuting in Los Angeles , a city notoriously unfriendly to cyclists .
Bikers carry a GPS - enabled mobile phone during their commutes .
The phone automatically uploads bikers ' routes to a public Web site .
The phone also uses its accelerometer to document the roughness of the road , and takes audio samples to analyze volume of noise along the route .
Participants can log in to see their routes combined with existing data , including air quality , time - sensitive traffic conditions , and traffic accidents .
They can also use the system to share information about their routes with other riders .
By combining existing local conditions with biker - contributed data , Biketastic will enable area bikers to plan routes with the least probability of traffic accidents ; with the best air quality ; or according to personal preferences , such as road - surface quality or connections with public transportation .
Biketastic shares location data through a public map , though individuals use pseudonymous user names .
AndWellness .
Currently under development , AndWellness is a personal monitoring tool designed to encourage behavioral change .
It helps clients work independently or with a coach to document places and times when they stray from a healthy eating or exercise plan .
During an initial week of documentation , AndWellness prompts users to input personal assessments throughout the day .
These assessments ask users when they last ate and whether they were on plan .
After a week of tracking and data analysis , users can see places and times where they tend to stray from their plan , and plan interventions to combat unwanted variations .
AndWellness collects not only location , but also sensitive data about diet and habits .
Individuals might choose to share this data with a support group , coach , therapist , doctor , family , or friends .
Taking participatory sensing from a possibility enabled by the mobile - phone network to a coordinated reality is rife with challenges .
Among these challenges are the ethics of repurposing phones , now used as communication tools , for data collection and sharing .
How can individuals determine when , where , and how they wish to participate ?
How much say do they get over what they wish to document and share ?
Privacy in Participatory Sensing
Privacy — the ability to understand , choose , and control what personal information you share , with whom and for how long — is a huge challenge for participatory sensing .
Privacy decisions have many components , including identity ( who is asking for the data ? ) , granularity ( how much does the data reveal about me ? ) , and time ( how long will the data be retained ? ) 7,10,11 Location traces can document and quantify habits , routines , and personal associations .
Your location might reveal your child 's school , your regular trips to a therapist or doctor , and times when you arrived late or left early from work .
These traces are easy to mine and difficult or impossible to retract once shared .
Sharing such granular and revealing digital data could have a number of risks or negative consequences .
Safety and security threats are obvious : thieves , stalkers , etc. are possible dangers .
Perhaps less obvious — and probably more likely — are other social consequences .
Think about how frequently you beg off a social engagement with a little white lie , or keep your location and activities secret to surprise a friend .
Much like Facebook 's ill - fated Beacon service , participatory sensing could disrupt the social boundaries we have come to expect .
What if someone with authority over you ( your employer , the government ) collects or accesses your location data ?
It 's easy to imagine a chilling effect on legal , but stigmatized , activities .
Would you be as likely to attend a political protest , or visit a plastic surgeon , if you knew your location was visible to others ?
Large databases of location data accessible by subpoena also could become evidence for everything from minor civil disputes to messy divorce cases .
Maybe most importantly , privacy is an important part of your identity and self - presentation .
Deciding what to reveal to whom is part of deciding who you are .
I might want to track when and where I tend to overeat , but I see no reason to share that information with anyone but my doctor .
Similarly , I might take part in a political data collection project on the weekend , but that does n't mean my parents need to know .
Respecting the many gradations between public and private , and giving people the ability to negotiate those gradations , are integral to respecting individual privacy .
In the United States and Europe , fair information practices are one standard for protecting the privacy of personal data .
Originally codified in the 1970s , the Code of Fair Information Practices outlines data - management principles to help organizations protect personal data .
12,13
These codes are still considered a gold standard for privacy protection .
14
But the principles , designed for corporations or governments rather than many distributed data collectors , are no longer enough .
Data gathered during participatory sensing is more granular than traditional personal data ( name , Social Security number , etc. ) .
It reveals much more information about an individual 's habits and routines .
Furthermore , data is no longer gathered solely by large organizations or governments with established data practices .
Individuals or community groups might create participatory sensing applications and begin collecting personal data.15
Enabling participation in privacy
This is where the responsibility of developers comes into the equation .
How can developers help individuals or small groups launching participatory sensing projects implement appropriate data - protection standards ?
To create workable standards with data so granular and personal , systems must actively engage individuals in their own privacy decision making .
At CENS , we call this participatory privacy regulation — the idea that systems can help users to negotiate disclosure decisions depending on context ( who is asking , what is being asked for , etc . ) .
We need to build systems that improve users ' ability to make sense of , and thereby regulate , their privacy .
Building such systems is a major , unmet challenge .
6
As the first steps toward meeting this challenge , we propose three new principles for developers to consider and apply when building mobile data - gathering applications .
These principles are purposefully broad , because " acceptable " data practices might vary across applications ( a medical project might be justified in collecting much more personal data , with stringent protections , than a community documentation project ) .
These principles are thinking tools to help developers adapt privacy protections to participatory sensing applications .
Participant primacy
The goal of participatory privacy regulation is to give participants as much control over their location data as possible .
GPS traces or the secondary traces created by geotagged media should belong to individuals .
Participants should be able to make and revoke decisions to share subsets of the data with third - party applications .
Framed this way , participants are not just subjects of data collection , but take the role of investigators ( when they collect data to participate in self - analytic applications ) or co-investigators ( when they contribute their data to larger research initiatives ) .
As such , they should have input into how data is collected , processed , stored , and discarded .
Developers can enable participants to own and manage their data by tailoring access - control and data - management tools for use by individual participants .
Users collecting revealing sensing data are going to need secure storage and intuitive interfaces to manage access and sharing .
As an example , CENS researchers are developing a PDV ( personal data vault ) to give individuals private and robust storage for their sensing data .
The PDV provides services such as authentication and access control , allowing participants not only to collect all of their sensing data in one place , but also to specify which individuals and groups in their social network can see which datasets .
Similar tools are in development in research labs at Stanford8 and AT&T, 1 and are not unlike commercial applications such as Google Health5 and Microsoft's HealthVault.9
As developers build data - management tools to put personal data control back in the hands of individuals , they will need to think about which controls users will need to make privacy and sharing decisions .
At a very basic level , sharing decisions should take into account identity ( who 's asking ? ) , time ( send data only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ) , location ( send data only when I 'm on campus ) , and data type ( share only geotagged photos ) .
More advanced techniques for developers to consider include access controls based upon activity ( share only driving routes ) or routine ( do n't share anomalous routes ) .
Application developers can further protect participant primacy by limiting the amount of raw data a participant is required to share outside of the vault .
When privacy is at stake , more data is not always better .
For example , participants in Biketastic may collect their location data 24/7 to the PDV , but share data with Biketastic only during days and times when they regularly commute by bike .
Biketastic does n't need to know where the participants are during working hours , when they take their lunch breaks , or what they do during their evenings .
A different example of collecting minimal data is requesting processed , rather than raw , data .
Developers could build applications such as PEIR to request only inferred activity data ( time spent driving , walking , and indoors ) and ZIP code , rather than granular location data .
PEIR does n't need to know what street a participant was on — only what carbon - generating activity they were engaged in .
By collecting the minimum amount of information needed for a service , application developers can help participants maintain control over their raw data .
Data legibility
Participatory sensing systems can help participants make sense of , and decisions about , their data by visualizing granular , copious data in ways individuals can understand .
Methods to improve data legibility include visualization using tools such as maps , charts , icons , pictures , or scales .
Data legibility also includes showing users who has accessed their data and how frequently , and showing participants where their data goes and how long it remains accessible .
System features should increase participants ' understanding of complex risks and help them make better decisions about data capture , sharing , and retention .
Developers should get creative about what legibility might mean .
An application 's user interface , for example , could help users not only set data - sharing policies , but also see the results of their policies .
Imagine a Facebook pop-up that asks , " Do you really want to share the album � Party Pics ' with your father ? "
Developing features either for data vaults or for sensing applications that illuminate who can see what data will help users better understand the consequences of data sharing .
Another approach is to show multiple interpretations of collected data .
The AndWellness interface , for example , uses both maps and timelines to help users draw conclusions about when and where their eating habits strayed from their plans .
Developers might also experiment with natural language , helping translate numerical data or complex algorithms into something easier to understand .
Natural language might make inferences from data points ( e.g. , this bike route has a few hills in the middle , most of them easy , and one difficult hill at the end ) ; or plain text descriptions can explain how calculation and processing works ( e.g. , clicking on a route in PEIR takes the participant to a " Trip Journal " with a step - by - step breakdown of how the system calculated the impact and exposure for that route .
Longitudinal engagement
Finally , developers will need to consider time as a factor that affects privacy in participatory sensing .
You may end participation in a carbon footprint calculator when you start taking public transit to work , but enroll in a new health program after receiving a surprising diagnosis .
Personal habits and routines change over time , altering the data collected into personal data vaults .
Because time is such a critical factor , application interfaces should encourage participants to engage with the data from the point of collection through analysis , long - term retention , or deletion .
Systems should enable continued engagement to allow participants to change their data practices as their context changes .
The crux of engaging individuals with decisions about their data is refusing to put that data in a black box .
Instead , analyzing , learning from the data , and making ongoing choices about the data become the goals of sensing .
We offer several suggestions for how developers can encourage long - term engagement .
Policies that require users to check back in with a vault or application on a regular basis can remind them to update their sharing preferences as their needs change .
A data vault could remind users to update their sharing preferences every time they add new contacts or applications .
Building adaptive filters can also enable participants to change their data sharing as their preferences change .
Such filters could learn from user behavior to respond to privacy preferences .
For example , the vault could learn never to share a certain route or could learn to check with users before sharing any routes recorded after 9 p.m .
A TraceAudit is another idea that helps users engage with their data over time .
The TraceAudit builds on the idea of an Internet traceroute and relies on careful logging procedures .
An interface that allows users access to logs can let them trace how their data is used by an application , where the data has been shared , and who has had access to it .
For example , a TraceAudit of data use in PEIR can show participants exactly how their raw location traces become calculations of impact and exposure , and how data is shared during that process .
A log could show users that their PDV sent PEIR raw data on weekdays between the hours of 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. PEIR performs activity classification based on this raw data ( minutes spent walking , driving , etc. ) and sends a summary of the activities and the ZIP codes in which they occurred to the California Air Resources Board .
PEIR receives back PM2.5 ( fine particle ) pollution exposure and CO 2 emission values to correspond with these activities and ZIP codes .
PEIR then saves and displays these total calculations for users .
The TraceAudit provides transparency and accountability , helping individuals to see how PEIR has used and shared their data .
Challenges beyond technology
System design that pays attention to participant primacy , longitudinal engagement , and data legibility will help users make data - sharing decisions and protect their privacy in participatory sensing .
Technical decisions , however , wo n't be enough to ensure privacy for sensing participants .
Participant engagement in privacy decision making needs to be fortified by supporting social structures , as well .
Participatory sensing opens the door to entirely new forms of granular and pervasive data collection .
The risks of this sort of data collection are not always self - evident .
Even if we give people options for managing their data , they may not understand the benefits of doing so .
Data literacy must be acquired over time through many avenues .
Public discussion and debate about participatory sensing will be critical to educating participants about the risks and possibilities of sensing data .
Discussion forums and blogs play an important role , as do traditional media and even community groups .
Further , participants in participatory sensing are going to need to understand what happens with their data once it leaves their personal vault and is used by third - party applications .
Diverse and plentiful applications for participatory sensing data can help to achieve the potential usefulness of participatory sensing , but will also make it difficult for participants to understand which applications are trustworthy and abide by acceptable data practices .
Participants need to know what they are signing up for — and cryptic , fine - print EULAs ( end- user license agreements ) are n't the answer .
Users should know how long an application will retain their data and whether it will pass the data on to other parties .
A voluntary labeling system , much like " Fair Trade " labels on food , could help consumers distinguish applications that abide by a minimum set of responsible data practices .
These might include logging data use and keeping audit trails , and discarding location data after a specified period of time .
Such measures could help to increase transparency of participatory sensing applications .
Finally , enhanced legal protections for unshared vault data can encourage participation in participatory sensing .
Ongoing work is investigating the possibility of a legal privilege for personal - sensing data .
Such a privilege could be enabled by statute and modeled on attorney - client or doctor - patient privilege .
Conclusion
While lawyers and social scientists work on structural changes to help ensure privacy in participatory sensing , many of the initial and critically important steps toward privacy protection will be up to application developers .
By innovating to put participants first , we can create systems that respect individuals ' needs to control sensitive data .
We can also augment people 's ability to make sense of such granular data , and engage participants in making decisions about that data over the long term .
Through attention to such principles , developers will help to ensure that 4 billion little brothers are not watching us .
Instead , participatory sensing can have a future of secure , willing , and engaged participation .

Traditional RFID tags and bar codes use a public identifier as a means of authenticating .
A public identifier , however , is static : it is the same each time when queried and can be easily copied by an adversary .
Holograms can also be viewed as public identifiers : a knowledgeable verifier knows all the attributes to inspect visually .
It is difficult to make hologram - based authentication pervasive ; a casual verifier does not know all the attributes to look for .

It 's Thursday , so Goldman Sachs raked in billions with taxpayer help while you 're still unemployed .
The bank announced $ 3.1 billion in third - quarter profits today , and set aside $ 5.3 billion for bonuses .
Help us find out how they spend it .
Goldman 's third - quarter take is down slightly from its record - breaking $ 3.4 billion second - quarter earnings , and the amount set aside for bonuses declined by roughly 20 % .
But so far this year , the firm has socked away $ 16.7 billion to compensate its young masters of the universe , and analysts believe that before the year is over Goldman will skim $ 23 billion off the top to keep its employees preposterously rich .
Bully for them .
The downside of Goldman 's remarkable resurgence in the wake of the near - collapse of the financial system is that you financed it .
There was the $ 10 billion in TARP funds Goldman got last fall — it 's since been repaid to the feds with interest , but that 's probably little consolation for people who could n't get a loan in the past year to buy a house or a car last fall despite excellent credit and documented income .
There was the $ 13 billion pass - through bailout from AIG , wherein the taxpayer funds ostensibly directed to prop up AIG were simply forwarded to Goldman and other banks that had purchased insurance from AIG in the form of credit - default swaps on their bad investments .
The AIG bailout is particularly noxious in light of an op -ed Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in the Financial Times earlier this week ( in a clear bid to prebut an avalanche of anti-bankster rage at today 's results ) :
" An institution 's assets must also be valued at their fair market value — the price at which willing buyers and sellers transact — not at the ( frequently irrelevant ) historic value . "
The irrelevant historic value of Goldman 's credit - default contracts with AIG was $ 13 billion .
The fair market value was whatever a hemorrhaging AIG could afford to pay .
But instead of getting pennies on the dollar in bankruptcy proceedings , Goldman got the federal government to spend your money to pay them off in full .
Fair - market - value for me , but not for thee .
The other ways in which Goldman has benefited — in many instances uniquely — from the federal intervention into the financial industry have been illustratively rehearsed by Matt Taibbi : Banks that want to repay TARP money are forced by the feds to raise capital , and Goldman is there to underwrite the debt and equity offerings at a reasonable 7 % commission .
It has access to low - cost FDIC - backed debt through the Temporary Loan Guarantee Program , saving it an estimated $ 600 million per year .
It has access to the Fed 's discount window , where it can borrow money a .5 % interest .
Our credit card company charges us 13 % , and we did n't lose $ 2 billion in the fourth quarter of last year , as Goldman did .
All of this is quite objectionable .
But what makes it eye - stabbingly , brain - searingly blood - boiling is the fact that Goldman 's employees are personally reaping the benefits of these subsidies to the tune of an average of $ 700,000 per staffer .
Being unjustifiably wealthy in boom times is not enough — when market forces of their own creation brought their company low , they turned to the taxpayers both to rescue the firm and prop up their obscenely acquisitive lifestyles .
Blankfein pronounced that Financial Times op - ed that " to avoid crises , we need more transparency . "
We agree .
What we'd like to render transparent is the precise ways in which people fortunate or connected enough to be employed by Goldman Sachs are deploying the $ 23 billion in windfall bonuses that they 've managed to skim off the top of a massive taxpayer - financed bailout of their firm .
Oddly , Blankfein does n't seem to value transparency when its directed at his own employees — he's made clear that he wants Goldmanites to keep their lavish discretionary spending to a minimum for fear of enraging the people who made it possible until this whole thing blows over .
At the same time , he 's floating the idea of making a $ 1 billion - plus charitable donation as public penance for the aforementioned sins .
Why not all $ 23 billion , Lloyd ?
You did n't earn it , right ?
And if you did earn it , why would you attempt to shame your employees into not spending it ?
To facilitate Blankfein 's call for transparency , we 're launching the Goldman Project , an ongoing attempt to track and publicize the multi-million second homes , $ 50,000 cars , $ 500 bottles of wine , and ostentatious living that we are subsidizing .
And we need your help :
Are you Facebook friends with a Goldmanite who just posted photos of his lavish bachelor party ?
Post them to our fancy new tag page , # GoldmanProject , or e-mail them to us .
Are you a realtor who just sold a $ 4 million duplex a Goldman banker ?
Is your ex-boyfriend Goldman banker planning a year - end trip to Cabo to blow his bonus wad ?
Shoot us an e-mail .
Likewise , if you catch any references to Goldman employees living large in the media , post them to # GoldmanProject to keep a running clipfile .
And if you know anything about why Goldman made so much from its fixed - income , currency and commodity trading division in the past two quarters — a phenomenon about which one analyst told Bloomberg , " A lot of us struggle with just the size of the FICC line and understanding exactly how they make as much money as they do " — posit your theory at # GoldmanProject .
Seems interesting that Goldman made a killing on currency trading at a time when dollar is plummeting .
To get you started , here 's what Goldman chief financial officer David Viniar 's $ 24 million second home in Carpinteria , Calif. , looks like via Google Maps :
Looks nice !
Viniar forfeited his bonus last year out of some misplaced sense of propriety .
We wonder if he 'll partake in December or early next year , when the 2009 bonuses will be distributed .
Viniar is a big fish at Goldman , but there are all sorts of emerging stars — like 40 - year - old Michael Swenson , the trader who made Goldman billions by betting that the subprime lending market would collapse , thereby allowing the firm to profit doubly from the calamity , both directly and through the government 's efforts to mitigate it — that we intend to learn more about .
Here 's a list of Goldman 's managing directors , and here 's a smaller list of the most recent batch to be named — guaranteed to contain a bunch of eager young comers just dying to make a killing and spend it like gangsters .
So have a look and run some names if you 're feeling mischievous , and let us know what you find .
We 'll be looking , too .
If this sounds like a creepy exercise in crowd - sourced surveillance to you , understand that we 're not looking interested in digging up private details about private citizens .
We just want to catalog how are tax dollars have been spent , and see where $ 23 billion goes .
If Goldman 's employees earned those bonuses , they should spend them with pride .
Own it .
Barack Obama : Change We Can Deceive In * -- A critique from the Left
By Lori Price , www.legitgov.org 19 Aug 2009
President Barack Obama is selling out the left wing of his party - those who contributed $ 750 million to his campaign for ' change ' - quicker than a Blue Cross rate rise in August .
Mr. Obama won the Democratic nomination -- and the presidency -- on a wave of anti-Bush sentiment and the promise of ' change we can believe in . '
But when the assertions and actions of the Obama Administration are critically examined , a conclusion can be drawn that the key difference -- thus far -- between Barack Obama and George W. Bush is their choice in breed of White House pet .
' Bipartisanship , ' the bane of Obama 's first eight months as president , is providing the groundwork for an extended ( albeit educated , charming ) Bush - light Administration .
Those of us on the left are fearing a Bush - ultra Administration , wrapped in populist rhetoric , and disguised as everything but the same .
Barack Obama : Meteorological Nightmare
Nuclear Leaks and Response Tested Obama in Senate By Mike McIntire 03 Feb 2008
When residents in Illinois voiced outrage two years ago upon learning that the Exelon Corporation had not disclosed radioactive leaks at one of its nuclear plants , the state ’s freshman senator , Barack Obama , took up their cause .
Mr. Obama scolded Exelon and federal regulators for inaction and introduced a bill to require all plant owners to notify state and local authorities immediately of even small leaks .
He has boasted of it on the campaign trail , telling a crowd in Iowa in December that it was “ the only nuclear legislation that I ’ve passed ... ”
A close look at the path his legislation took tells a very different story .
While he initially fought to advance his bill ...
Mr. Obama eventually rewrote it to reflect changes sought by Senate Republicans , Exelon and nuclear regulators .
The new bill removed language mandating prompt reporting and simply offered guidance to regulators , whom it charged with addressing the issue of unreported leaks .
Those revisions propelled the bill through a crucial committee .
But , contrary to Mr. Obama ’s comments in Iowa , it ultimately died amid parliamentary wrangling in the full Senate .
Sound familiar ?
Just replace the words ' Exelon Corporation ' with ' insurance companies ' and the words ' Senator Obama ' with President Obama ' and here we are .
' Mr. Obama scolded Exelon and federal regulators for inaction , ' we learned in 2008 , regarding Obama 's reaction to the undisclosed radioactive leaks .
In 2009 , the president condemned the insurance companies for their record - breaking profits and role in the U.S. health care situation : Obama says insurance companies holding U.S. hostage , ' Reuters , 14 August .
In 2006 , the Obama admonishment preceded the sellout , just as it likely will in 2009 .
Yup , those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it .
The Exelon incident should have set off alarms in every progressive 's brain from Portland , Oregon to Portland , Maine .
The corporate - owned media , determined to see the ' better ' liberal -- Hillary Clinton -- lose the Democratic primary , waged a Hillary - bashing campaign , 24 - 7 .
This media bias was couched and defended in the enthralling possibility of the election of the first African - American U.S. president .
And so , the Exelon incident passed as insignificant -- the unnoticed fluffy cloud on a bright summer day .
But to those of us in the meteorological know , we 're aware of the path that a singular cumulus cloud can take .
More cumulus clouds appear , then populate the horizon .
Soon , cumulonimbus clouds form -- which lead to thunder , lightning and a nightmarish end to the day .
My Exelon - Obama umbrella has been with me since February of 2008 , when New York Senator Hillary Clinton co-sponsored legislation to boot Blackwater and other mercenaries from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Candidate Obama remained silent .
Under President Obama , the mercenary industry is flourishing .
President Obama :
They 're toting assault rifles and you 're toting ' bipartisanship . '
All of this pandering to the GOP , and the elusive quest for ' bipartisanship , ' is not entirely the fault of Barack Obama .
As soon as a Democrat is elected , the corporate - owned media begins the ' bipartisanship ' brainwashing of the public , to elevate the GOP .
Indeed , Obama was ' conditioned ' to select a political moderate to the Supreme Court , despite the fact that the lack of political balance on the Court clamored for a left - leaning Justice .
Even though George W. Bush stole two elections , the media never chided Bush for not acting in a bipartisan fashion .
Apparently , Obama the Conciliator chooses to live and breathe to please everyone -- well , every Republican .
How did Bush force his pharma - terrorist giveaway aka Medicare Modernization Act through Congress in 2003 ?
Drug Industry and HMOs Deployed an Army of Nearly 1,000 Lobbyists to Push Medicare Bill , Report Finds -- Study Shows Special Interests Spent $ 141 Million in 2003 , Hired 431 Lobbyists With " Revolving Door " Connections to Congress and the White House 23 Jun 2004
In the final push for Medicare prescription drug legislation , the pharmaceutical industry , HMOs and related interests spent more money and hired more lobbyists in 2003 than ever before , according to a report issued today by Public Citizen .
The bill came to a vote at 3 a.m. on November 22 .
After 45 minutes , the bill was losing , 219 - 215 .
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Majority Leader Tom DeLay sought to convince some of dissenting Republicans to switch their votes , as they had in June ...
In a highly unusual move , the House leadership held the vote open for hours as they sought two more votes .
Then - Representative Nick Smith ( R - MI ) claimed he was offered campaign funds for his son , who was running to replace him , in return for a change in his vote from " nay " to " yea . "
I can just see the Fox heads exploding -- and more AR - 15s waving -- if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pulled such a stunt !
In 2003 , the mainstream media -- owned by the same corporations who financially benefit from corporate profits -- did not demand that the White House ' work with the Democrats ' on the ' Patriot ' Act , Medicare , Iraq or any other Bush - Cheney disaster forced upon the United States .
True , the day after his Inauguration , President Obama signed legislation to close the U.S. detention center at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , by January 2010 .
He has also pushed for some popular programs , such as ' Cash for Clunkers . '
Although his rhetoric is with the left , his actions are serving the rightwing .
Obama is allowing his detractors to call the shots .
The Obama Administration 's acts of appeasement merely serve to embolden the gun-toting critics and snarly Congresscritters who would do anything to destroy the Obama presidency .
Herewith is the running list of Barack Obama 's supplications and fabrications .
After having endured eight months of an Obama presidency , a case can be made that Barack Obama was ' allowed ' to win the election so that he would provide the relief valve for the rising anger over predatory capitalism in the U.S .
Thus far , Obama has out - Bushed Bush .
This list is under construction !
http://www.legitgov.org/Obama-has-out-Bushed-Bush
Are Obama 's most virulent critics open to ' bipartisanship ? '
Well , they would have to drop their assault rifles , first .
Obama should simply jettison them , and abandon his ' Bush - light ' agenda .
If he does n't , leftists and liberals need to back an actual progressive candidate for the 2012 presidential elections .
Now , that would be ' change we can believe in . '

From the above , it is obvious that Israel wants war in the Mideast , a war that someone else will have to fight for them .
Is that why we are in Iraq ?
Because Israel wanted it ?
Is that why we are preparing to invade Iran ?
Because Israel wants it ?
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , speaking through his creation Sherlock Holmes , said , " When you eliminate the impossible , whatever remains , however unlikely , must be the truth .
So , let us take a closer look at the current war in Iraq , a war we were told was fought over weapons of mass destruction , to avenge 9 - 11 , and to punish Saddam for supporting Al Qaeda .
First off , there never were any weapons of mass destruction .
Bush and his Neocon ( i.e. pro-Israeli ) advisors openly admit that now , and try to claim it was all an honest mistake .
Yet the recently leaked Downing Street Memo makes it clear that Bush simply issued an order to go to war , and ( as the memo put it ) " fixed " the intelligence around that decision .
So , the war in Iraq is not about weapons of mass destruction .
There were n't any .
Saddam was not in defiance of United Nations Resolutions .
The claim that he was was a lie .
As for 9 - 11 , no evidence has surfaced linking Saddam to 9 - 11 .
Even if one accepts the official story of 9 - 11 , none of the named suspects were Iraqi or had links to Iraq .
So , the war in Iraq is not about 9 - 11 .
It never was .
Was it necessary to invade Iraq to punish Saddam for supporting Al Qaeda ?
In point of fact , Al Qaeda and Saddam were political enemies , with Al Qaeda favoring theocratic rule while Saddam 's was a secular government .
And , at least some of Al Qaeda are really Mossad agents playing deception games .
So , the war in Iraq had nothing to do with Saddam 's supposed links to Al Qaeda .
Was it oil ?
A very popular theory is that Iraq is an oil war , brought about by declining supplies and the inability of the US to meet rising prices ( having lost much of its manufacturing capability over the last 30 years ) .
Yet this explanation for Iraq is also deeply flawed , for Bush is spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq to extract out only $ 150 million in oil .
Were oil the true objective , it would have been far cheaper to simply buy it from Iraq .
So , what is left ?
We have eliminated the impossible , Dr. Watson !
What is left ?
Look above the statements made by Israel 's supporters !
Who wanted this war ?
According to Philip Zelikov , a senior Bush aide , the war in Iraq was fought for Israel .
That was the real reason all along .
A foreign government wanted the US Government to send YOUR children off to fight in the deserts of Iraq .
And the US Government agreed to , and worse , still does !
Recently , representatives Abercrombie and Kucinich introduced legislation into the US Congress to set an end for the Iraq war .
One would assume that with the official reasons for the war lying in tatters that such legislation would pass immediately , but in a quite revealing move , the US House of Representatives voted down the measure , voting in essence to continue the war in Iraq which has cost so many lives .
Why ?
What could motivate them to continue a war whose official reasons for being have been so thoroughly discredited ?
Perhaps the following might prove enlightening .
It is a list of many of the representatives who voted against ending the Iraq war , paired with the amount of money they have accepted from pro-Israeli PACS , including AIPAC , the group at the heart of the Israeli spy scandal .
MIT is playing host to Technology Review 's EmTech conference , which focuses on up - and - coming companies and the new technology they 're bringing to market .
Steve Perlman , the founder and CEO of the OnLive gaming service , was given the chance to demonstrate his company 's cloud gaming service , and took some time to explain the technology backing it .
OnLive is gaming 's answer to cloud computing : the applications run on hardware in a server farm , while users only need low - end hardware ( including OnLive 's own mini-console ) and broadband Internet to connect in and play .
The service will have some limitations , however , and your experience may vary with network speed .
For starters , Perlman gave some indication of the network requirements for it .
Anyone with a 1.5 Mbps connection should be able to run the service at standard definition ; 5 M bps will be required for HD content .
Although bandwidth will be critical , low latency connections will be necessary to avoid hitting the user with perceptible lag .
OnLive has found that the server has to be within about 1,000 miles of the end user in order to avoid this .
As such , it will be launching the service with four server farms .
Another impressive tech demo
For the purposes of his demo , Perlman connected to a server farm in Virginia .
MIT clearly has access to some pretty significant pipes , but the quality of the demos , which included some time showing off an arena in Crysis , was very impressive , given that it was running on a standard MacBook Pro .
All sorts of environmental features , from bubbles generated while swimming to crabs scuttling along the beach , were fluid , and provided a very immersive experience .
Perlman joked repeatedly about his poor gaming skills as he rushed to show the audience as much as possible before one of the experienced beta testers blew him away .
He also gave a short rundown of the service 's additional features , like the ability to save clips of games that can be shared with others .
There 's also an arena , where people can enter a game environment that someone else is playing and watch how they experience the game .
Although these are presented as end - user features , Perlman pointed out that they could provide significant benefits for game developers that could follow along as users flail through problem areas or expose bugs in the software .
Perlman was willing to talk briefly about the hardware that powers things at the server level .
The basic functional unit is a standard PC motherboard .
Casual games get by on built - in video , while they 'll be using motherboards with high end hardware from NVIDIA and AMD for the current generation of games .
The only custom hardware is a single add - on board that handles both compressing the video for transmission to the end users and smoothing over the inevitable network hiccups .
Beyond the broadband connection , all the end user needs to be able to do is handle input from controllers and display video , neither of which is especially demanding .
That goes a long way towards explaining why OnLive can get away with a miniconsole that appeared to be somewhere around the size of a portable laptop hard drive .
PC gaming 's audience could be broadened
The pitch to the gaming audience is obvious : no more platform exclusives and a step off the perpetual upgrade treadmill .
Whatever you happen to be using , it 'll be good enough for OnLive 's service .
But Perlman also pointed out that there are significant advantages for game makers .
A single game can now run on any platform out there , greatly increasing the audience and eliminating porting issues .
Since the actual software never goes out to the end users , piracy is essentially a nonissue .
Perlman also noted it could kill the secondhand game market — although users might not appreciate that , the publishers will .
The porting process is also extremely simple .
Perlman said it typically takes OnLive three weeks and one engineer to handle the process , most of which involves eliminating dialogs and keyboard commands that assume the user is running the game locally on their own hardware .
So far , OnLive has nine major game publishers , including EA , THQ , and UbiSoft , on board .
Will it actually work ?
The basic principles seem solid , and Perlman was apparently involved in developing the QuickTime video platform , so he appears to have the right experience to put things together .
But the ultimate determinant may not be the technology that OnLive has control over .
Instead , the local ISPs and home network may have a tremendous impact on whether the games are even playable , much less immersive .
You can sign up for beta access to the service right now , although OnLive gently told Ars that journalists are not , at the moment , being extended invitations .
Some athletes fail miserably hocking products and services .
Michael Phelps would fall into that category , although he did wonders for bong sales across the globe , so he does n’t totally suck .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan
April 3 , 2009 -- Clad in a dark blue burka , she is held down by two different men , her face rubbed in the dirt .
A third man in a black turban whips her lower back more than 30 times in a minute and a half , her teenage voice screaming out in terror and pain .
" Stop .
It 's killing me . "
" For God 's sake , stop , " she sobs .
" I swear on my father and grandmother I wo n't do it again . "
Across this country today Pakistanis listened to her screams and watched her writhing on national television .
The young woman , 16 - or 17 - years - old , is a resident of northern Swat , the Pakistani valley where the local government is negotiating with the Taliban .
Her crime , according to the Taliban and local residents , was hosting a man in her house and supposedly having a physical relationship with him .
No evidence of such a relationship was ever given , but the rumor of such a relationship , according to the local Taliban spokesman , was actually enough to be stoned to death .
The punishment in this case , he told a local TV channel , was " lenient . "
For the last seven weeks the provincial government that oversees Pakistan 's volatile Northwest Frontier Province has been using a former militant to negotiate with a Taliban that , over the last year and a half , has blown up more than 200 schools and killed more than 100 police and soldiers in Swat .
The deal the government hopes to implement would restrict the military to their barracks , allow the Taliban to implement sharia , or Islamic law , and remove armed Taliban in the streets .
But critics have seized on the video as evidence that men who whip teenage girls in front of cell phone cameras are not to be negotiated with .
And , they say , the provincial government has virtually handed over a third of Pakistan 's northwest to its enemies , choosing to do so from a position of weakness after the Taliban terrorized the most peaceful and liberal part of northwest Pakistan .
The incident in the video took place months ago , according to local journalists , long before the peace negotiations began .
But Swat 's residents say nothing has changed for the better since the peace deal , and even if this video was n't filmed in the last 7 weeks , the Taliban continue to administer their cruel forms of justice in the streets and continue to keep themselves heavily armed .
' There is No Law ' in the Swat Valley
" Nobody can walk around at night .
Very few people can even walk around during the day , " said one resident of Mingora , describing a terrified population .
" There is no law .
Police are still restricted to the police station . "
" The militants are patrolling on the roads and they are occupying some people 's homes … and even they are threatening the girls who go to school , " said Zubair Torwali , a human rights activist from Swat .
" There is no government writ .
The writ of the Taliban can be seen through the whole valley . "
The video of the incident , which has been distributed widely in the last day thanks to an Islamabad - based filmmaker , is now on sale in Swat 's bazaars , according to local residents .
Some journalists in the area said they had the tape long before it went on sale late last month , but were simply too afraid of retribution to broadcast it .
Even a senior member of the provincial government admits that if the Taliban are going to continue to terrorize and threaten the people of Swat , the peace negotiations should be questioned .
" Nowhere in this process has anyone said or accepted that individuals can stand up and start this kind of activity , " says Bushra Gohar , the Awami National Party 's senior vice president .
"
So long as the Taliban spokesman calls this type of act " lenient , " she said , " then there 's no need for the continuing for the peace talks .
If human rights are going to be violated with impunity , what is the purpose being served ? "
In two separate media interviews , Muslim Khan , the spokesman for the Taliban in Swat , admitted that the man whipping the girl was a member of the Taliban .
He also said that the people holding her down were members of her own family , a claim that could not be confirmed .
He added that had Islamic judges recently installed in Swat as part of the peace negotiations been present at the scene , she would have been ordered stoned to death .
" She had to be punished , " Khan told Geo News .
" The punishment administered by local Taliban was in our knowledge and they did the right thing , but the method was wrong , " he added , saying the punishment should have been carried out inside .
Human Rights Acitivists Say the Taliban Getting Stronger
Still , the provincial government maintains that it has no plans to abandon the peace deal and try and defeat the Taliban with the military , who had been fighting in Swat on and off for more than a year .
" I personally have concerns about this whole process , but of course I have more concerns when the military was there , " Gohar said .
" Once the development process has started , then the people will stand up .
But they 're still in a state of trauma .
What we need to do is create a bit of peace for them and they can recover . "
But locals are far more pessimistic .
Angered by civilian casualties from the military campaign and a corrupt , slow court system , they had hoped the peace deal would bring calm and swift justice to the valley .
But instead , they fear the Taliban is getting stronger and that the fighting will resume in a few weeks .
" Swat has fallen to the Taliban , " Towali said .
" It 's the truth .
Everyone knows that . "
Asked about the Taliban and whether they can be trusted , one resident mentioned a Pashto saying : " If you let a snake in the room with people and expect the snake not to bite the people , you 'd be a fool .
Because the snake 's job is to bite . "
Asked if the snake was biting again , the resident said , " Whenever it can , it does . "
Politicizing the terror alerts
Tom Ridge confirms a long - held suspicion among Bush critics , writing in his new autobiography that he " was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush 's re-election , something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over . "
Weigel adds :
If Ridge really quit DHS because it became so politically rotten , good for him ; his successor Michael Chertoff , however , somehow managed to hold the job for four years without issuing a conveniently timed alert .
And it ’s worth remembering that the idea that Ridge might do this was seen , in 2004 , as political conspiracy - mongering .
An abuse so gross — if Ridge is right — shows , among other things , what a powerful influence on the all - important tracking polls terror alerts must have had .
And it suggests that Obama 's efforts to keep terror arrests out of the national news are good politics too .
Nicole Kidman conceded on Wednesday that Hollywood has probably contributed to violence against women by portraying them as weak sex objects .
The Academy Award - winning Australian actor says she is not interested in those kinds of demeaning roles , adding that the movie industry has also made an effort to contribute to solutions for ending the violence .
Campaigning for women 's rights ... Nicole Kidman .
Kidman told a congressional hearing in Washington , DC , that violence against women and girls was " perhaps the most systematic , widespread human rights violation in the world " .
Kidman , a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Fund for Women ( UNIFEM ) , testified before a US House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that is considering legislation to deal with violence against women overseas through humanitarian relief efforts and grants to local organisations .
“ Like a locomotive with a mouth full of butcher knives . ”
That is how a shark expert , Matt Hooper , described Carcharodon megalodon to the police chief in Peter Benchley ’s novel “ Jaws . ”
He was referring to the 50 - foot - long , 50 - ton body and enormous six - to seven - inch - long teeth that made the extinct megalodon shark perhaps the most awesome predator that has ever roamed the seas .
Hooper had just gotten his first glimpse of the massive great white shark that was terrorizing the residents of Amity Island .
Hooper explained that the Latin name for the great white was Carcharodon carcharias and that “ the closest ancestor we can find for it ” was megalodon .
So maybe , he speculated , this creature was n’t merely a great white , but a surviving sea monster from an earlier era .
Hooper was toying with a simple and long - established idea : that the most feared predator in the ocean today , the great white shark , evolved from megalodon , the most fearsome predator of a few million years ago .
That is how the two species had been viewed , until recently , when new ways of looking at shark teeth , and new shark fossils from a Peruvian desert , convinced most experts that great whites are not descended from a megatoothed megashark .
Rather , they evolved from a more moderate - size , smooth - toothed relative of mako sharks .

W E RARELY bother to check who is leaving comments in Boycott Novell , but moments ago someone left a comment to police the image of Bing .
It took him only a couple of hours to find the post .
A quick glance at his blog shows that the about page says absolutely nothing about his job at Microsoft , but a little more sniffing reveals the “ evangelist ” tag ( the blog is all about Microsoft , which is the top tag ) .
Looking deeper inside the posts , we find only this one post from 2008 where Wong writes : “ And since Monday , I have started a new and exciting role with Microsoft as part of their Developer and Platform Evangelism Team in Singapore . ”
“ Neither the blog nor the E - mail address ( or even the comments ) say anything about his job at Microsoft .
” Nice disclosure there , eh ?
Neither the blog nor the E- mail address ( or even the comments ) say anything about his job at Microsoft .
In fact , he leaves comments with a GMail address and one common theme among Microsoft “ TEs ” is that “ Google is evil ” ( Jonathan Wong ’s blog shows it too , explicitly ) .
Look at the blog .
Look at what he does around the Web ( e.g. regarding “ Bing ” alone ) .
That ’s his job as a Microsoft " TE " ( another term for AstroTurfers , whose roles are borderline criminal ) .
We wrote about one colleague of his last month because they are policing individual FOSS people and even FOSS companies in that one particular case .
Wong calls all this “ social media marketing ” , but we call it AstroTurfing and there are laws against it .
No wonder people who negatively review Vista 7 get attacked so viciously [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .
They are probably being stalked because they cover particular products to which Microsoft assigns “ perception management ” [ 1 , 2 ] . █

An Israeli Arab man on a business trip to Jordan was arrested by the state 's authorities for speaking ill of King Abdullah II .
During his visit to Jordan , the businessman allegedly made public statements against the king .
This was made known to the Jordanian authorities .
At the behest of the Israeli 's family , a hearing will be held Sunday in a Jordanian court during which it will be ruled whether he will be allowed to return to Israel .
The man 's family claimed that he must return to Israel in order to receive medical treatment .
The man is being represented by a local lawyer and is staying with relatives in the country .
Foreign Ministry officials said that at least 10 Arab - Israelis have been arrested in Jordan for criminal offenses , such as auto theft .
However , the ministry admitted that this case is exceptional and cannot remember a similar one taking place .
The ministry estimated that the Israeli citizen will be released soon and said they are doing everything in their power in order to help the businessman return to Israel .
This is the not the first time that action has been taken against people speaking out against the king in Jordan .
Two years ago , a guest of the royal family was sentenced to two years imprisonment after being convicted of sending emails to international destinations that contained " false reports " and damaged the country 's honor .

We 've all seen the videos ( and some even got access to a developer 's preview ) of Google 's latest product - Wave .
Although not " ground - braking " and " revolutionary " as we 've imagined ( wonder why " over - hyped " comes to mind ) it still features some great UI that will surely inspire at least a few developers to implement some of it in their works .
I , being one of those inspired people , am going to show you how to create a Google Wave - like history slider .
Using it , we will enable our visitors to go back and forth in time to view the changes that take place on a comment thread .
So take a look at the demo ( maybe even keep it open in a separate tab ) , download the example files and keep on reading .

We are keeping it online only as a reference .
Step 1 - XHTML
The technologies we are using include PHP as a back - end , MySQL as data storage , jQuery , CSS and XHTML for the front - end with AJAX in between .
The slider itself is a component created with jQuery UI .
First lets take a look at the body section of demo.
php
demo.php
< div id =" main " > < p id =" orig " >

Showing each comment } ?> </div> < input type=" button " class= " waveButtonMain " value =
" Add a comment " onclick = " addComment ( ) " /> < div id =" bottomBar " > </div> </div > </div >
This is pretty much all the layout we are using .
The main reason why the code is so short is that we are using CSS to style it , and that the outputting of the comments is handled by a special PHP function , both of which will be explained in a minute .
Step 2 - CSS
The great thing about jQuery is that , thanks to Google 's CDN , you can directly include it in your site , without having to worry about downloading and storing it on your server .
This also aids your page loading time .
The same is true for jQuery UI , which contains our slider .
Not only that , but the CDN also holds the styling and images needed to display it properly .
However , we still have to include our own custom styles .
In the example files you can find them in demo.css .
Here only the more interesting bits are shown :
demo.css
#orig{ /*
The link that float to the right of the title */ float : right ; font - family : " MyRiad Pro " , Arial ; font - size : 10 px ; letter - spacing : 1 px ; text - transform : uppercase ; padding - top:10 px ; } .clear { /*
Clearfix , needed by IE6 */ clear : both ; } #main { /*
The main container */ width :600 px ; margin:30 px auto ; } #wave { /* CSS rounded corners */ - moz - border - radius : 6 px ; - khtml - border - radius : 6 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 6 px ; border - radius : 6 px ; background : white ; width : 100 % ; overflow : hidden ; } # topBar{ background : url ( img / bg.jpg ) repeat - x ; font - size : 12 px ; color : white ; height : 20 px ; overflow : hidden ; padding : 5 px 0 0 10 px ; border - bottom : 1 px solid # e4f1 ff ; -moz-border - radius:6px 6px 0 0 ; /* A Firefox fix , for once */ } # bottomBar{ height :40 px ; background - color : #c9e2 fc ; - moz - border - radius:0 0 6 px 6 px ; border - top: 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; } # subBar{ background - color : # c9e2 fc ; padding - left :10 px ; } #subBar img{ /*

Styling the slider */ background : #FFFFFF ; border : 1 px solid # CCCCCC ; } .comment{ margin:5 px 10 px ; padding : 8 px 10 px ; border : 2 px solid #cccccc ; /* Rounding the comment */ - moz - border - radius : 6 px ; - khtml - border - radius : 6 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 6 px ; border - radius : 6 px ; overflow : hidden ; } span.name{ font - weight : bold ; color :#999999 ; } .commentAvatar{ width:30 px ; height :30 px ; float : left ; margin - right : 10 px ; }
Step 3 - PHP
There are four main PHP files that handle the back - end :
demo.php - outputs the comments ; ajax / saveComment .
php - adds new comments , it 's reached by AJAX requests ; functions .
php - holds some functions used by demo.
php ; connect.php - handles the DB connection .
We 'll be looking only at the first three files here .
demo.php
define ( " INCLUDE_CHECK " ,1 ) ; require ' connect.php ' ; require ' functions.php ' ; //
Including the files for the DB connection and our custom functions // Removing comments that are older than an hour .
mysql_query ( " DELETE FROM wave_comments WHERE id >5 AND dt < SUBTIME ( NOW ( ) , '0 1:0:0 ' ) " ) ; $ comments_result = mysql_query ( " SELECT * FROM wave_comments ORDER BY id ASC " ) ; //
Selecting all the comments ordered by id in ascending order $ comments=array ( ) ; $ js_history = ' ' ; while ( $row=mysql_fetch_assoc($comments_result ) ) { if ( $row [ ' parent ' ] ==0 ) //
If the comment is not a reply to a previous comment , put it into $ comments directly $ comments [ $ row [ ' id ' ] ] = $ row ; else { if (!$comments [ $row [ ' parent ' ] ] ) continue ; $ comments [ $row [ ' parent ' ] ] [ ' replies ' ] [ ] = $row ; //
If it is a reply , put it in the ' replies ' property of its parent } $ js_history.='addHistory ( {id : " '.$row [ ' id ' ] . ' " } ) ; '.
PHP_EOL ; //
Adds JS history for each comment } $ js_history = '< script type = " text / javascript " > '.$ js_history . ' </ script >'; //
This is later put into the head and executed on page load
The comments are ether parents ( they are added directly to the thread ) or children ( added as a reply to a parent ) .
Only two levels of ancestry are allowed ( meaning that replies are disabled for the children ) .
The comments are later outputted by the showComment function ( you can see it in the XHTML step above ) .
ajax / saveComment.php
define ( " INCLUDE_CHECK " ,1 ) ; require '../connect.php ' ; if ( empty ($ _POST [' comment ' ] ) ) die ( " 0 " ) ; //
If there is n't a comment text , exit $ comment = mysql_real_escape_string(nl2br(strip_tags ($ _POST [' comment ' ] ) ) ) ; $ user= ' Demo ' ; //
This would be a nice place to start customizing - the default user //
You can integrate it to any site and show a different username .
$ addon= ' ' ; if ( $ _POST [ ' parent ' ] ) $ addon= ' , parent= ' .( int ) $ _POST [ ' parent ' ] ; mysql_query ( " INSERT INTO wave_comments SET usr= ' " . $user . " ' , comment= ' " .$ comment . " ' , dt=NOW ( ) " .$ addon ) ; if( mysql_affected_rows ( $ link ) ==1 ) echo mysql_insert_id( $link ) ; //
If the insert was successful , echo the newly assigned ID else echo ' 0 ' ;
And lastly , there is functions .
php
functions.php
if (!defined ( ' INCLUDE_CHECK ' ) ) die (' You are not allowed to execute this file directly ' ) ; function showComment ( $ arr ) { echo ' < div class = " waveComment com -'.$ arr [ ' id ' ] . ' " > < div class= " comment " > < div class= " waveTime " >'. wave Time ( $ arr [ ' dt ' ] ) .'</div > < div class=" commentAvatar " > < img src=" img /'.strtolower ( $ arr [ 'usr ' ] ) .'. png " width = " 30 " height = " 30 " alt= " '.$ arr [ 'usr ' ] . ' "
/> </div> < div class=" commentText " > < span class = " name " >'.$ arr [ 'usr ' ] .':</ span > '.$ arr [ ' comment ' ] . ' </div> < div class =" replyLink " > < a href= " " onclick = " addComment ( this , '.$ arr [ ' id ' ] .' ) ; return false ; " > add a reply »</a> </div > < div class= " clear " ></div > </div >'; //
Output the comment , and its replies , if any if ( $ arr [ ' replies ' ] ) { foreach ( $ arr [ ' replies ' ] as $ r ) showComment ( $r ) ; } echo '< / div > ' ; } function wave Time ( $t ) { $t = strtotime ( $t ) ; if ( date ( ' d ' ) ==date ( ' d ' , $t ) ) return date ( ' h : i A ' , $t ) ; return date ( ' F jS Y h:i A ' , $t ) ; //
If the comment was written today , output only the hour and minute // if it was not , output a full date / time }
The last step is the trickiest one - in this case the jQuery code .
Step 4 - jQuery
All the JS code is located in script.js .
I will split it into two parts :
script.js - part 1
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
//
Executed once all the page elements are loaded lastVal = totHistory ; // Create the slider : $ ( " #slider " ) . slider ( { value : totHistory , min : 1 , max : totHistory , animate : true , slide : function ( event , ui ) { if( lastVal>ui.value ) $ ( buildQ(lastVal,ui.value ) ) .hide ( ' fast ' ) .find('.addComment ').remove ( ) ; //
Using buildQ to build the jQuery selector //
If we are moving the slider backward , hide the previous comment else if ( lastVal<ui.value ) $ ( buildQ(lastVal, ui.value ) ) .show ( ' fast ' ) ; //
Otherwise show it lastVal = ui.value ; } } ) ; } ) ; var totHistory=0 ; // Holds the number of comments var positions = new Array ( ) ; var lastVal ; function add History ( obj ) { /*
Gets called on page load for each comment , and on comment submit */ totHistory ++ ; positions.push ( obj.id ) ; } function build Q ( from , to ) { /*
Building a jQuery selector from the begin and end point of the slide */ if ( from > to ) { var tmp=to ; to =from ; from=tmp ; } from ++ ; to ++ ; var query ='' ; for ( var i=from ; i < to ;i++ ) { if ( i!=from ) query+= ' , ' ; query +='.com -'+positions [ i-1 ] ; } /* Each comment has an unique com -( Comment ID ) class that we are using to address it */ return query ; }
As you remember , we generated a special PHP string , which holds calls to the addHistory function .
Each time it runs , it increments the totHistory counter .
After all the comments are loaded the $ ( document ) .
ready runs and the slider is initialized with totHistory as the maximum value of the slider .
The minimum value is 1 , because we want to have at least one comment visible .
Now lets take a look at the second part of the file .
script.js - part 2
function addComment ( where , parent ) { /*
This functions gets called from both the " Add a comment " button on the bottom of the page , and the add a reply link .
It shows the comment submition form */ var $ el ; if ( $('.waveButton ').length ) return false ; //
If there already is a comment submition form // shown on the page , return and exit if (! where ) $el = $ ( ' # commentArea ' ) ; else $el = $ ( where ) .closest('.waveComment ' ) ; if (! parent ) parent=0 ; //
If we are adding a comment , but there are hidden comments by the slider : $ ( '.waveComment ' ) .
show ( ' slow ' ) ; lastVal = totHistory ; $ ( '# slider ' ) . slider ( ' option ' , 'value ' , totHistory ) ; //
Move the slider to the end point and show all comments var comment = ' < div class = " waveComment addComment " >\ \ < div class= " comment " >\ < div class=" commentAvatar " >\ < img src=" img /demo.png " width = " 30 " height = " 30 " />\ </div>\ \ < div class=" commentText " >\ \ < textarea class =" textArea " rows = " 2 " cols = " 70 " name= " " />\ < div >< input type=" button " class = " waveButton " value =
" Add comment " onclick = " addSubmit ( this , '+parent + ' ) " /> or < a href= " " onclick=" cancelAdd ( this ) ; return false " > cancel</a></div>\
\ </div>\ </div>\ \ </div >' ; $ el.append( comment ) ; // Append the form } function cancelAdd( el ) { $ ( el) .closest('.waveComment ').remove( ) ; } function addSubmit ( el , parent ) { /*
Executed when clicking the submit button */ var cText = $ ( el).closest('.commentText ' ) ; var text = cText.find ( ' textarea ' ).val ( ) ; var wC = $ ( el) .closest('.waveComment ' ) ; if ( text.length <4 ) { alert ( " Your comment is too short ! " ) ; return false ; } $ ( el ) .parent ( ) .html ( '< img src="img/ajax_load.gif " width = " 16 " height = " 16 " />' ) ; //
Showing the loading gif animation // Send an AJAX request : $.ajax ( { type : " POST " , url : " ajax/saveComment.php " , data : " comment= " +encodeURIComponent( text ) +" &parent= " + parent , /* Sending both the text and the parent of the comment */ success : function ( msg ) {
/* PHP returns the automatically assigned ID of the new comment */ var ins_id = parseInt ( msg ) ; if ( ins_id ) { wC.addClass ( 'com -'+ins_id ) ; addHistory ( {id: ins_id} ) ; $ ( '# slider ' ) . slider ( ' option ' , ' max ' , totHistory ) . slider ( ' option ' , ' value ' , totHistory ) ; lastVal=totHistory ; } transForm ( text , cText ) ; //
Hiding the form and showing the newly - added comment in its place } } ) ; } function transForm ( text , cText ) { var tmpStr ='< span class = " name " >
Demo :</ span > '+ text ; cText.html(tmpStr ) ; }
The functions in this part of the code handle the comment submission via AJAX to the PHP back - end .
I believe that further clarification is needed for the success function in the AJAX .
As you know , it is called when we have successfully executed the AJAX request ( in this case it is called if the comment was written to the MySQL database ) .
Inside this function we check whether a proper insert ID is returned , which corresponds to the internal MySQL id that was given to the auto - increment field ( see below for the MySQL part or take a look at table.sql in the example files ) .
If everything is OK , we call the addHistory function with the new data and update the maximum value of the slider .
This ensures that the newly - added comment is history - scrollable with the rest of them .
Step 5 - MySQL
This step is only required if you want to run the demo on your own server .
If you run into problems , read through the comments below or write a new one if your problem is not addressed there .
To be able to run the demo , you 'd have to create the MySQL table wave_comments with the following code ( also available in table.sql in the example files ) :
CREATE TABLE `wave_comments` ( `id` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL auto_increment , `parent` int ( 11 ) NOT NULL default ' 0 ' , `usr` varchar ( 16 ) collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL default '' , `comment` text collate utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL , `dt` datetime NOT NULL default ' 0000-00-00 00:00:00 ' , PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) , KEY `parent` ( `parent` , `id` ) ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci ;
With this our Google Wave - like History Slider is complete !

It was difficult to find something quick , healthy , and cheap .
This is one standby that fits the bill !
Breakfast Burritos
These are easy to make in bulk on the weekends , so you have a quick breakfast on weekday mornings .
And breakfast burritos are very versatile , so you can mix up the taste from one batch to the next .
Here ’s the basic version .
Layer some scrambled eggs , cheese , and salsa on a tortilla , fold it up , wrap it in plastic , and throw it in a freezer bag in the freezer .

Cost Breakdown
1 dozen eggs : $ 1.32
2 lb block Cheddar Cheese : $ 4.99
16 oz .
Salsa : $ 2.00
12 ct. flour tortillas : $ 2.49
Assuming each breakfast burrito uses 1 tortilla , 2 eggs , and 2 tablespoons each of cheese and salsa , the price of each burrito comes out to just 57 cents !
Add an apple or banana for some fruit , and a cup of milk , and you have a well rounded breakfast !
To make it even healthier , you could add veggies in season .
Change the type of cheese you use to vary the taste .
Both of these options would raise the total cost a bit , but with a base cost of 57 cents , it wo n’t break the bank !
That ’s my Tightwad Tuesday tip !
What ’s yours ?

When it comes to larger - scale structural components , however , fiber - reinforced plastics have had less of an impact .
They have mostly been used in bridge decking , where corrosion resistance is critical and the lighter weight allows for a higher “ live ” load of vehicles .
Only a handful of bridges have major support beams made from them .
One reason F.R.P. components have n’t caught on , experts say , is that engineers and contractors have little experience with the materials , and full standards guiding their use in highway construction have not been developed .
Engineers “ have to deal with life - safety issues , ” said John P. Busel , director of the composites growth initiative of the American Composites Manufacturers Association .
“ They have a desire to understand how materials fully develop and how they fully last before they specify them . ”
The materials also do not always interact well with others .
One problem with F.R.P. bridge decks , for example , is that the road surface  asphalt or concrete , applied as an overlay  can wear out quickly , said Lijuan Cheng , an assistant professor of engineering at the University of California , Davis .
But the main argument against using fiber - reinforced plastics has been economic .
“ No. 1 is the upfront cost issue , ” said Paul Ziehl , an associate professor of engineering at the University of South Carolina .
“ That ’s a tough one to get around . ”
Dr. Ziehl , who helped design and test F.R.P. beams used on a small bridge in Texas , said the problem was that no two projects were the same .
“ If you ’re going to design things that really make sense from an optimized engineering standpoint , they are going to be one - of - a - kind items at first , until economies of scale kick in , ” he said .
The beams for the Texas bridge , for example , were custom designed and built using a labor - intensive method .
“ The construction industry is very persnickety about cost , ” Mr. Busel said .
With F.R.P. decks , he added , “ we ’re more expensive , sometimes twice as expensive , ” as conventional ones .
What contractors need to understand , he said , is that there are transportation , labor and equipment savings from using lighter components , and potential maintenance savings , too .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The federal government and states are girding themselves for the next foreclosure crisis in the country ’s housing downturn : payment option adjustable rate mortgages that are beginning to reset .
A home sits for sale in Lemont , Illinois , July 27 , 2009 .

“ Payment option ARMs are about to explode , ” Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said after a Thursday meeting with members of President Barack Obama ’s administration to discuss ways to combat mortgage scams .
“ That ’s the next round of potential foreclosures in our country , ” he said .
Option - ARMs are now considered among the riskiest offered during the recent housing boom and have left many borrowers owing more than their homes are worth .
These “ underwater ” mortgages have been a driving force behind rising defaults and mounting foreclosures .
In Arizona , 128,000 of those mortgages will reset over the the next year and many have started to adjust this month , the state ’s attorney general , Terry Goddard , told Reuters after the meeting .
“ It ’s the other shoe , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t say it ’s waiting to drop .
It ’s dropping now . ”
The mortgages differ from other ARMs by offering an option to pay only the interest each month or a low minimum payment that leads to a rising balance in the loan ’s principal .
When the balance of the loan reaches a certain level or the mortgage hits a specific date , the borrower must begin making full payments to cover the new amount .
The loan ’s interest rate also may have been fixed at a low level for the first few years with a so - called teaser rate , but then reset to a higher level .
Because the new monthly payments can be five or 10 times what borrowers are accustomed to paying , they “ threaten a much greater hit to the consumer than the subprimes , ” Goddard said , referring to the mortgages often extended to less credit - worthy
borrowers that fed the first wave of the financial crisis .
Miller said option - ARMs were discussed at Tuesday ’s meeting on mortgage scams , which brought state attorneys general from across the country together with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , Attorney General Eric Holder , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan , and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz .
The mortgages tend to be “ jumbo , ” or for significantly large amounts , Goddard said , making it even harder for borrowers to sidestep foreclosure .
He said he expected to see an increase in scams as distressed homeowners become more desperate to refinance big debts .
Goddard said his office is investigating hundreds of cases where companies have made fraudulent promises , and charged large fees , to mortgage defaulters .
The U.S. housing market has suffered the worst downturn since the Great Depression , and its impact has rippled through the recession - hit economy .
Some signs of stabilization emerged recently , with sales rising and home price declines moderating in many regions of the country .
Home prices in some regions have risen .
However , many economists say there is still a huge supply of unsold homes lingering on the market and that , coupled with a frenzy of more foreclosures ahead , should depress home prices for the rest of 2009 .
Real estate data firm RealtyTrac , in its August 2009 U.S. Foreclosure Market Report , said foreclosure filings -- default notices , scheduled auctions and bank repossessions -- were reported on 358,471 U.S. properties during the month , a decrease of less than 1 percent from the previous month , but an increase of nearly 18 percent from the same month a year ago .
The report said one in every 357 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing last month .
Lada may be a well - known brand , but sales have dropped 40 % this year Russia 's largest carmaker , Avtovaz , is to cut up to 27,600 jobs as it tries to cope with the global slump in demand .
The job cuts are more than a quarter of the 102,000 - strong workforce at Avtovaz , which makes Lada cars .
Reports had suggested that 36,000 job losses were considered , but the company said that it managed to " significantly lower the initial figure " .
Russia had the fastest growing car market in Europe until the financial crisis hit demand .
Overhaul " Today , 102,000 people work at Avtovaz , " the carmaker said .
" Such a number cannot guarantee effective and profitable production , therefore we have agreed to reduce the personnel by 27,600 people . "
This includes 5,000 job cuts in " white collar " jobs announced last week , it said .
Of the workers being eliminated , Avtovaz said 13,000 employees would retire with pensions while another 5,500 would be forced to take early retirement .
The remaining 9,100 employees would leave the firm , but Avtovaz said 6,000 of those would have the option to work at the carmaker again in 2012 .
Sales have dropped 40 % this year as consumers , hard hit by the financial crisis , have shunned the carmaker .
Production freezes Avtovaz , which is 25 % - owned by French automaker Renault , had imposed month - long production freezes while it tried to reduce levels of its unsold stock .
No cars were built in August and the plant will work two weeks in four from September to February , which meant that the workers will have to survive for six months on half pay of $ 300 ( £ 176 ) a month .
The decision led to large worker protests .
The carmaker was set up with Italy 's Fiat during the Soviet years .
It is a key employer in the southern city of Togliatti based by the Volga River , which has a population of 700,000 .
In April , the company was on the verge of bankruptcy .
It was only after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin stepped in with a 20bn rouble ( £ 400 m ; $ 600 m ) rescue package that the company survived .
Yet the package did not cover even half of the 44bn roubles that Avtovaz owed to its creditors .

Understanding design
To understand the meaning of design is … to understand the part form and content play … and to realize that design is also commentary , opinion , a point of view , and social responsibility .
To design is much more than simply to assemble , to order , or even to edit ; it is to add value and meaning , to illuminate , to simplify , to clarify , to modify , to dignify , to dramatize , to persuade , and perhaps even to amuse .
Design is both a verb and a noun .
It is the beginning as well as the end , the process and product of imagination .
— Paul Rand
If the insider trading case against Galleon Management co-founder Raj Rajaratnam ever gets to trial , expect a vigorous defense strategy built around the difference between information that ’s considered insightful “ market color ” versus top secret , market - moving trading tips .
The hedge fund manager ’s lawyer will probably argue that the handful of trades that prosecutors say were the result of illegal tips were cherry - picked from the tens of thousands of clearly legitimate trades Galleon ’s funds made over the last three years .
And the lawyers can note that the questionable transactions often were part of a complex trading strategy that can look more incriminating when taken in isolation .
Rajaratnam ’s defense team may contend a tip about a company ’s upcoming earnings report is nothing more than helpful insight , especially if the executive passing on the information fails to provide specific details like figures for revenues and net profits .
To buttress this point , the lawyers will no doubt point to things like today ’s article in The New York Times , which notes that Galleon lost $ 30 million on the allegedly illegal trades .
But the problem for Rajaratnam is that by the time this case comes to trial a year or two from now , the charges against him could be even more serious .
There ’s a good chance that new allegations of insider trading could be lodged against Rajaratnam as other potential co-conspirators come forward in the coming weeks to cut deals with federal prosecutors .
The criminal complaint against Rajaratnam and his co-defendants is just the opening salvo — even though the investigation began two years ago .
One white - collar defense lawyer called the complaint a “ warning shot ” to other traders not yet identified who may have benefited from the same trading tips Galleon got .
Lawyers say a number of hedge fund traders not named in the criminal complaint are already “ lawyering up , ” largely out of fear they may be the next ones to fall within the gun-sights of federal prosecutors .
There ’s an expectation among lawyers and those in hedge funds that prosecutors will quickly secure guilty pleas from several other traders who may have made similar bets with inside information .
None of this , of course , is good news for Rajaratnam and his co-defendants .
And some of the evidence the federal government has unearthed looks pretty damaging for Rajaratnam .
It will be hard for Rajaratnam to explain away recorded conversations in which he is trying to give advice to others on how to trade on information without raising suspicions .
Especially troubling is the evidence Rajaratnam , who says he is innocent , directed his fund to make a big upside bet on Hilton Hotels in July 2007 after he is said to have received information from a Moody ’s Investors Service analyst that Blackstone Group was on the verge of buying out the hotel chain .
Prosecutors say that the Moody ’s analyst was paid $ 10,000 for his helpful tip .

" This new system will allow Australians to download digital books quickly and simply via participating bookstores , " she said in a statement on Sunday .
All booksellers using an APA program called TitlePage will be able to access the system .

EXCLUSIVE : Sony Pictures and Sony Music Entertainment have already trumpeted record - breaking sales around the world for the upcoming movie compiled from Michael Jackson ’s high - def concert rehearsal footage .
( Photo above show Paris lines outside The Grand Rex , which sold out shortly after tickets went on sale . )
But execs with the concert promoter AEG also capitalizing on the singer ’s death are now openly predicting that This Is It will make a staggering “ $ 250 million in its first 5 days ” .
And they claim the pic is already $ 5 million in the black even after Sony Pictures paid $ 60 million for the movie rights .
* UPDATE :
The film is already # 1 in ticket sales on big online movie ticketseller Fandango two weeks from release , outselling all of even this weekend ’s new releases .
This Is
It has already sold out more than 1,000 showtimes on Fandango alone , and is outselling the previous bestselling limited - run concert film , Hannah Montana 3D , by a factor of 2 x1 at the same point in that film ’s sales cycle .
before its release date ) .
Rick Butler , COO for Fandango , says theater owners are posting additional showtimes on multiple screens to meet the demand .
“ At this point in the film ’s sales cycle , This Is It is outpacing Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince , Transformers 2 : Revenge Of The Fallen , and Star Trek as one of our top pre-sellers of the year . ” *
This Is
It debuts in some markets with special advance showings the evening of Tuesday , October 27 , and will open worldwide on Wednesday , October 28 , in a normal wide release of over 3,000 North American runs , plus day and date in all territories including China or 8,000 foreign screens .
When I relayed AEG ’s $ 250 M - in - 5 - days figure to my Sony sources for their perspective , I received this response from one insider : “ I dont know what they ’re talking about .
That would be bigger than Spider - Man and Harry Potter .
It ’s an event , but it ’s still a movie . ”
Meanwhile , Sony execs are worried that moviegoers think all the shows are already sold - out because of the hype surrounding advance ticket sales .
“ We hope they know you can still go to the theater and get a ticket .
It ’s not like a concert . ”
Both AEG and Sony execs maintain they ’re really only going to release the pic into theaters for a 2 week only run .
But AEG sources are letting the cat out of the bag that plans are to bring This Is It back at a later date .
But this may be my favorite AEG revelation : that the rehearsal footage including meetings and auditions and other behind - the - scenes was only shot in the first place because Michael Jackson wanted it for his personal archive .
And that when the whole pre-concert production began running wildly over its $ 25 M budget , AEG almost stopped the HD crews from filming the rehearsals to cut costs .
“ Michael had no concept of budget , ” an AEG insider reveals .
“ So the thought was we might as well fire the HD crew because there was no real plan to use the footage . ”
Let ’s not forget that as soon as AEG executives involved in organizing Michael Jackson ’s 50 - night schedule of shows at London ’s O2 arena learned of the performer ’s death , they met at Staples Center in Los Angeles and secured all of the 100 hours of rehearsal footage which Michael Jackson had done there with the intent to turn it into live albums , a movie , and TV special .
As Randy Phillips , president and CEO of AEG Live , has ghoulishly boasted to the media , “ He was our partner in life and now he ’s our partner in death . ”

The game creators , which include 40 - year - old Brooklyn resident Michael Russotto , tell Mother Jones magazine they ’re not trying to capitalize on “ anti-Obama paranoia , ” but rather get “ the most publicity . ”
In this virtual world , the magazine notes that players can also add to their fun by making up news headlines about events like Michelle Malkin writing the Second Declaration of Independence or Hillary Clinton using children to shield herself from attacks .
Russotto told the magazine , “ There ’s a lot going on with Fox , the White House , and we wanted to capitalize on that . ”
In the game ’s premise , the GOP is about to regain control of both houses of Congress , but Obama decides he will not swear in the new members of Congress , he ’d rather have a North American Union instead and ban firearms .
And the revolutionaries ( or online players ) are fed up and attempting to regain control — even though a few counties are now in the hands of groups like the “ Cong ” aka former Democratic Congressional leaders and the Federal Reserve .

However , promotional information on the website reads “ It does seem our biggest enemies are not from outside our borders .

2009 NBA Mock Draft Version 2.0
It has been about two weeks since I published my first mock draft , so it ’s a good time to check back in with all the news and rumors and take another stab .
Like I said in the intro of my first mock , it ’s tough for me to make predictions about what teams will do because I ’m constantly thinking about what they should do .
These are obviously two very different things .
For this go - around , I ’m going to try something a little different .
I ’ve compiled the picks for four mock drafts from sites that I respect — ESPN ( Chad Ford ) , Dime Magazine , DraftExpress and NBADraft.net — and then I ’ll provide my own picks taking their picks into account , to form some sort of consensus .
Let ’s get on with it …
# 1 LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS
All signs seem to point to the Cliippers keeping this pick and taking Blake Griffin .
They have a need at power forward — sorry , Zach Randolph is not the answer — and Griffin is the closest thing to a “ sure bet ” as there is in this draft .
Ford says that the Clippers will find a way to get rid of Randolph and / or Chris Kaman , but Randolph ’s contract ( two years , $ 33 million ) will be unmovable for another year .
Kaman is an effective center when healthy , so there ’s no reason the Clips ca n’t move forward with Baron Davis , Eric Gordon , Al Thornton , Griffin and Kaman .
Davis may understandably want to move on from this young team to play for a contender .
Pick : Griffin , PF
# 2 MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES
The consensus says that Hasheem Thabeet is going to be the pick here , so I see no reason to change my pick .
Ricky Rubio ’s name keeps coming up , but it sounds like he ’s not too excited about buying out his contract in Spain to play in Memphis , where two Spaniards — Pau Gasol and Juan Carlos Navarro — have had a bad time .
The Grizzlies already have a center in Marc Gasol , who seems to be thriving there , but is he really a starting caliber center on a playoff team ?
The other issue is Mike Conley .
If the Grizzlies go point guard here , they ’re effectively giving up on him , and it ’s probably too soon to make that call .
Pick : Thabeet , C
# 3 OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER
The buzz of late is that James Harden may be headed to OKC and the consensus bears that out .
This pick is more about what the Thunder think of Russell Westbrook than it is about any player they might take here .
Is he a point guard or an off guard ?
He definitely has a shoot - first mentality ( as evidenced by this study that I did a few weeks back ) , and his A / TO ratio of 1.59 is unimpressive .
But the Thunder seem to think he ’s a point guard , so Harden may very well be the pick here .
Pick : Harden , SG
# 4 SACRAMENTO KINGS
The Kings could use a point guard , and according to the consensus , Ricky Rubio just fell into their proverbial laps .
I ’m not sure he ’s destined to be a star , but the scouts love his vision and overall feel for the game , and if he ’s able to improve his jumper , he could be a very good NBA point guard .
It ’s interesting to note that Ford believes the Kings will take Jrue Holiday , though the other three mocks have him going ( on average ) with the # 18 pick .
Pick : Rubio , PG
#5 WASHINGTON WIZARDS
If Harden is still there , he ’s a real possibility , and Dime seems to think that they ’ll go with Tyreke Evans to give Gilbert Arenas an upgrade in the backcourt ( from DeShawn Stevenson ) .
I think there ’s a great chance that the Wizards trade this pick as part of a deal to get some immediate help , as Jordan Hill is probably too much of a project for the Wizards to deal with at this point .
They need to win now , and the # 5 pick still holds a lot of value , even in this somewhat thin draft .
Pick : Hill , PF
#6 MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
The T - Wolves face the same dilemma as the Thunder .
Randy
Foye does n’t look to have the same upside as Russell Westbrook , but they ’re both combo guards .
The consensus says that Evans is the pick , but in his draft , Ford contradicts himself a bit by putting Evans ahead of Stephen Curry , who has really helped his draft stock with a great showing at the combine .
With the success the Magic are having by surrounding Dwight Howard with a bunch of shooters ( the ol ’ Hakeem Olajuwon - era model in Houston ) , I could see the T - Wolves going with the best shooter ( Curry ) .
He and Foye are both versatile enough to share the ball - handling duties .
A pure point guard like Jonny Flynn is also a possibility .
Pick : Curry , PG
# 7 GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS
The consensus says that the Warriors will take Brandon Jennings , but Ford ’s GM quiz indicates that the overall feeling on Flynn is much better , since he ’s more of a known quantity .
But is Monta Ellis a point guard or an off guard ?
It would have been nice had he stayed off the moped so that the Warriors would have had a year to figure that out .
Curry and Evans are also strong possibilities .
Pick : Flynn , PG
#8 NEW YORK KNICKS
The Knicks have been long linked to Curry , but with his fine showing in the combine , he might be gone by the time the Knicks pick at # 8 .
How about sending Nate Robinson and the # 8 pick to Washington for their # 5 pick ?
( Just throwing it out there . )
If Curry is gone and the Knicks keep their pick , look for Flynn , Jennings , Evans or Holiday to be their guy .
Right now , Holiday ’s stock seems to be the highest , assuming Flynn goes # 7 .
Pick : Holiday , PG
#9 TORONTO RAPTORS
Tyreke Evans ’ camp seems certain that he ’s going in the top 10 , but it would seem strange for the Raptors to draft a combo guard to play alongside Jose Calderon , who is one of the most efficient point guards in the league .
DeMar DeRozan and DeJuan Blair are possibilities here , but I ’ll go with Evans , since three of the four mocks in the consensus have him drafted by this point .
Pick : Evans , G
# 10 MILWAUKEE BUCKS
Full disclosure : I ’m a longtime Bucks fan ( since the days of Sidney Moncrief and Bob Lanier ) , so it ’s hard to distance myself from this pick .
Two of the mocks in the consensus have the Bucks selecting Jordan Hill , and I ’d be happy with that pick .
The other two have the Bucks taking point guards ( Flynn and Evans ) .
Since all three players are gone in my mock , I think Milwaukee will take DeJuan Blair to give the team some toughness alongside Andrew Bogut up front .
There was some concern about his height , but he has a monster wingspan to give him the 10th highest overall reach in the draft .
The Bucks have to decide if they ’re keeping Ramon Sessions and Charlie Villanueva , and regular readers know that I am sky high on Sessions .
I think a lineup of Sessions , Michael Redd , Richard Jefferson , Blair / Mbah a Moute and Bogut , if healthy , puts the Bucks in the playoffs next season , assuming Blair does n’t turn into Robert “ Tractor ” Traylor , Jr. and pack on a bunch of pounds .
DeMar DeRozan is a possibility as well .
Pick : Blair , PF
# 11 NEW JERSEY NETS
The consensus says Blair , and the Nets could really use his toughness and inside scoring , but my beloved Bucks just took him .
New Jersey is set at point guard and center with Devin Harris and Brook Lopez , so DeRozan , Gerald Henderson , James Johnson and Chase Budinger are all possibilities .
Three of the four mocks have DeRozan gone by now , so let ’s go with the USC frosh .
Pick : DeRozan , GF
# 12 CHARLOTTE BOBCATS
This is the first pick where the four mocks have the team taking four different players .
I still think that Gerald Henderson has a ton of upside and will bring the consistent defense to make Larry Brown happy .
If this guy can develop a consistent jumper , he will be a star .
Pick : Henderson , SG
# 13 INDIANA PACERS
Again , there is no consensus .
The Pacers are set at small forward with Danny Granger , but that ’s about it .
Austin Daye has a lot of upside , but at 190 lbs , it ’s unclear whether or not he ’ll ever be able to play power forward , though Indiana could conceivably move Granger to the four .
This is what makes Earl Clark interesting for the Pacers .
He ’s a versatile forward who could could play the four and set Granger up with his fine passing .
Plus , Rick Pitino thinks he ’s a good kid that needs a solid mentor , and Granger could be that guy .
The Pacers could also go point guard here with Jeff Teague , Eric Maynor or Ty Lawson .
Pick : Clark , F
# 14 PHOENIX SUNS
I think it ’s safe to say that the writing is on the wall that Amare Stoudemire is not long for Phoenix .
He ’s already talking about his next destination ( the Knicks ) , so the Suns may look to try to replace him with a power forward like James Johnson .
The Suns could also go point guard with Maynor , Teague or Lawson , but that would n’t send a very good message to Steve Nash , who has said all the right things the last few months .
What the Suns do with this pick could tell us a lot about their long term plans .
Pick : J. Johnson , F
# 15 DETROIT PISTONS
Again , no consensus here .
The Pistons need more help up front than on the perimeter , but they could still go with a guard with this pick .
Someone like Tyler Hansbrough could help right away ( as a rotation player off the bench ) or the Pistons could go with upside like Austin Daye or B.J. Mullens .
They could also go point guard ( Maynor , Teague or Lawson ) to give Rodney Stuckey a backup or maybe eventually play him at the two if Rip Hamilton leaves .
What the hell — let ’s go with Mullens .
The Pistons ’ biggest need is center and here ’s a seven - footer with a ton of upside , and those do n’t grow on trees .
Pick : Mullens , C
# 16 CHICAGO BULLS
Two of the mocks have the Bulls going with Mullens here , which makes sense because Chicago needs some low post scoring .
Aaron Gray has been disappointing and Joakim Noah is n’t a post scorer .
The team is set at point guard with Derrick Rose , has a nice swingman in Luol Deng and Noah can play power forward or center .
They might go with a guy like Chase Budinger or Wayne Ellington in case they do n’t re-sign Ben Gordon .
Hansbrough and James Johnson are possibilities , if available .
Budinger ’s stock seems to be the highest of the bunch , so we ’ll go with him .
Pick : Budinger , GF
# 17 PHILADELPHIA 76ERS
The Sixers could really use a true point guard .
They might keep Andre Miller around for another season or two , but he ’s getting pretty long in the tooth and Louis Williams is more of a combo guard than a pure point .
This is where the oft - mentioned triumvirate of Jeff Teague , Ty Lawson and Eric Maynor come in .
Of the three , I think Lawson is the best fit with the Sixers , because Andre Iguodala does n’t have a great handle .
According to Ford , Maynor and Teague are ranked higher at this point , but I do n’t know how the Sixers turn down Lawson ’s experience and toughness at this point in the draft .
Pick : Lawson , PG
# 18 MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
The more I think about the T - Wolves , the more I think that they might look at the depth at the point guard position in this draft and elect to go with another position at # 6 and then grab whomever is left ( Lawson , Maynor or Teague ) here .
The main problem with that theory is that good point guard play is getting more and more important , so you ’d rather use a high pick there than on the wing .
Assuming they do go Curry ( or another PG ) at # 6 , I think Austin Daye is a real possibility here .
That would give the team a core of Curry , Foye , Daye , Love and Jefferson to build around .
The mocks say that Mullens , Budinger and Terrance Williams are possibilities here as well .
Two of the mocks do n’t even have Daye going in the first round , so we ’ll go with Williams since his stock seems to be higher , even though I think I ’d rather have Sam Young on my team .
Pick : T. Williams , SF
# 19 ATLANTA HAWKS
The Acie Law pick has n’t panned out , so the Hawks are still looking for a point guard to take over whenever Mike Bibby finally leaves .
I still like Lawson the most , but Maynor and Teague are both interesting picks .
Two of the mocks say Teague , but I think Maynor might be the better pro .
He seems to be the better all around player .
Pick : Teague , PG
# 20 UTAH JAZZ
Three mocks have the Jazz going with a power forward , with Hansbrough going in two .
His measurements ( specifically his reach and agility scores ) were better than expected , and his non -stop motor and work ethic will keep him in the league for a long time .
Besides , he just looks like a Jerry Sloan kind of guy , and with Carlos Boozer likely on the way out , the Jazz will need a power forward to backup Paul Millsap .
Pick : Hansbrough , PF
# 21 NEW ORLEANS HORNETS
Two of the four mocks project the Hornets to take a point guard ( Maynor or Patrick Mills ) , and while the team could use a backup for Chris Paul , finding a good wing or two is a much bigger priority .
Julian Wright should be a good player , so a sharpshooting off guard might do the trick .
Budinger would be good if he were available , but the Bulls took him at # 16 .
How about Wayne Ellington , Austin Daye or Sam Young ?
I think Young could potentially be the Josh Howard of this draft , but Ellington had a great tournament and fills a need at off guard .
Pick : Ellington , SG
# 22 DALLAS MAVERICKS
The Mavs could really use a point guard , which is why Maynor might be the pick here .
Though it would be tempting to draft Austin Daye for his apparent upside .
Maynor is probably too good to pass up here and the four mocks agree that he ’s a first round talent —
Daye , not so much .
Pick : Maynor , PG
# 23 SACRAMENTO KINGS
The Kings are another team that have both an early and a late pick , and they might pass on point guard at # 4 if they think they can get their guy with this pick .
Two of the mocks have the Kings taking Israel ’s Omri Casspi , but how about two - time Big East first teamer Sam Young ?
He ’s a great defender , a good spot up shooter and can finish at the rim .
He needs to work on his ball handling and his off - the - dribble jumper , but he projects to be a James Posey - type player , and the Kings could use a few of those .
Pick : Young , SF
# 24 PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS
Two of the mocks have Portland drafting a point guard here ( Lawson and Holiday ) , but I doubt either guy lasts this long .
The position is definitely the biggest need for the Blazers , and while they are one of the teams rumored to be looking to move up in the draft , in this mock they have the option of drafting the speedster / sharpshooter ( Patrick Mills ) or a defensive stopper / floor general ( Darren Collison ) .
Mills stock seems to be higher , so we ’ll go with him , but UCLA guards have done pretty well of late ; Jordan Farmar and Russell Westbrook both turned out to be better than expected .
Pick : Mills , PG
# 25 OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER
Assuming they go with Harden , a shooting guard , at # 3 , it likely means that they view Westbrook as their point guard of the future .
Fine .
What the Thunder needs now is shotblocking and rebounding .
Center is more of a priority than power forward , but the pickings are slim at this point of the draft .
Gani Lawal is a good rebounder , a capable scorer , and at just 20 years old , he has some upside .
Pick : Lawal , PF
# 26 CHICAGO BULLS
This is when things get really dicey .
Whether or not a player that is still on the board is a “ first round talent ” depends entirely on the teams drafting at the end of the round .
The Bulls need some size and low post scoring and Georgetown ’s DaJuan Summers fits the bill .
Pick : Summers , PF
# 27 MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES
If the Grizzlies go with Thabeet at # 2 instead of a point guard , they may look to grab Collison here as a backup plan for Mike Conley if he does n’t pan out .
They could also use a power forward , so Summers , Casspi , DeMarre Carroll , Taj Gibson , Derrick Brown , Damion James , Dante Cunningham , etc. are all options .
I think they ’ll go with the proven Collison and try to add a power forward through free agency .
Pick : Collison , PG
# 28 MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES
The T - Wolves went point guard at # 6 and guard / forward at # 18 , so they will probably try to get some size here .
Minny can afford to wait , so how about Israel ’s Omri Casspi ?
They can let him play overseas for a few years before bringing him over .
All four mocks think he ’s a first round talent .
Pick : Casspi , F
# 29 LOS ANGELES LAKERS
Two of the mocks have the Lakers taking Toney Douglas here .
He ’s undersized for a shooting guard , but in the Lakers ’ system , he could play point because he wo n’t have to handle the ball that much .
He fits the L.A. mold — he can shoot and play good defense .
The team is also likely to lose either Lamar Odom unless he ’s willing to take a big pay cut to stay , so they could go with a forward here as well .
Pick : Douglas , G
#30 CLEVELAND CAVALIERS
The Cavs ’ front line is in flux , and there are a number of power forward types available at this point in the draft .
Cleveland found PF J.J. Hickson late in last year ’s first round , so maybe they ’ll try their luck with a center and draft Gonzaga ’s Josh Heytvelt who is a polished offensive player , but needs a little work fundamentally on the glass and defensively .
He could be a weapon in the pick - and - roll with LeBron .
Honestly , it ’s a crap shoot at this point .
Pick : Heytvelt , C

Let 's face it : Atheism is in .
Not since Nietzsche have disbelievers enjoyed such a ready public reception to their godless message and such near - miraculous royalties .
But even that has n't put them in a good mood .
Snaps Christopher Hitchens , who wrote God Is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything ( although not , presumably , the pronouncements of atheists ) , " Many of the teachings of Christianity are , as well as being incredible and mythical , immoral . "
A feuding Richard Dawkins suggests that believers " just shut up . "
Apparently , they did n't get the tolerance memo .
Other authors including Douglas Wilson and Francis Collins have quite capably refuted the new atheist shtick .
But remembering Bertrand Russell 's famous essay , " Why I Am Not a Christian , " here is a Reader 's Digest version of why I am .
Creation :
The universe , far from being a howling wasteland indifferent to our existence , appears to be finely tuned through its estimated 13.7 billion years of existence to support life on this planet .
Tinker with any one of scores of fundamental physical laws or the initial conditions of the universesuch as gravity or the cosmological constant and we would not be here .
As physicist Paul Davies has admitted , " I have come to believe more and more strongly that the physical universe is put together with an ingenuity so astonishing that I cannot accept it merely as a brute fact . "
Beauty : Beethoven 's Ninth , a snowflake , the sweet smell of a baby who has been sleeping , and a sunset beyond the dunes of Lake Michigan all point to a magnificent and loving Creator .
And is n't it interesting that we have the capacity unlike mere animals to gape in awe , to be brought to tears , before them ?
Truly did David say , ...

Har - Prakash Khalsa – Given that , in your own words , “ enlightenment is a multi- faceted jewel ” , is there a description of enlightenment that you like ?
Shinzen Young –
In this regard I tend to go towards my Buddhist background .
Scholastic Theravada Buddhism says that three things go away at the initial experience of enlightenment .
It ’s very significant that it ’s put in terms of an elimination process ; something goes away , rather than an attainment , a “ getting ” of something .
So enlightenment is not yet another thing that you have to get .
And meditation as a path to enlightenment could be described as merely setting the stage for Nature / Grace to eliminate from you what needs to be eliminated .
The technical terms in Pali for the three things that go away are “ sakkaya - ditthi ” , “ vicikiccha ” , and “ silabbata - paramasa ” .
Sakkaya - ditthi is the most important .
Sakkaya - ditthi is the perception that there is an entity , a thing inside us called a self .
That goes away .

It may seem that nowadays , when unemployment is high , and we ’re in a worldwide recession where millions of people are out of work and things may get bleaker before they improve , it may seem the wrong time to talk about hiring staff .

Tom Limoncelli , author of “ The Practice of System and Network Administration ” suggests that there are two types of job openings .
One is for the position , the other the person .
If you need someone to do a specific task , then you would hire someone who has the required skills .
Other skills and experience that are possessed by that person are less relevant , because you need someone to perform the specified tasks , and it is essential to success that they are done well .
On the other hand , you may need someone to run a department , or to perform an array of less - well defined tasks .
In that case , you would do better to hire a person who is capable of the flexibility that is required by such a role .
Finding a qualified candidate is going to be less clear - cut and will require more finesse from the hiring team .
There is a good chance that the process will take longer as well , because it takes time to vet a candidate carefully .
Your pool of applicants is likely to be smaller but more competitive , and salary requirements for this type of opening are generally higher .
Whichever sort of opening it is , one must define the position ’s parameters .
Be specific about variables such as skill level , and ensure that you have explicitly listed the achievements and qualifications that you require from the candidates .
This includes certifications , degrees , experience in a similar position , and even experience in an organization of a certain size if that is important to you .
If these are outlined and decided upon early , the next step becomes much easier .
Do n’t make the common mistake of assuming that any position seeking an inexperienced person is unimportant .
Every position is vital , and should be treated as such .
In my own experience , pre-defining the range that you ’re willing to pay is a two sided affair , particularly if you are upfront about the range when you create the job posting .
I consider it preferable to post the salary range , with the caveat “ commensurate with experience ” .
Unfortunately , being forthright in this manner has the drawback that individuals with more advanced skills may overlook your posting when they might be otherwise tempted to apply .
While your budget is likely to be fixed , skilled candidates may be lured by other benefits :
At the same time , it helps to prevent disappointment from overqualified prospects who apply if you dictate the range early in the process .
Determine who will participate in the hiring process and at what stages .
There should be a defined interview team who remains somewhat constant throughout the process .
This is essential to ensure that you compare apples to apples .
Changing this team in the middle off the process may do a disservice to the candidates , who are almost certainly going to be viewed differently by different people .
The number of people on this team , and the departments they represent , will vary according to your organization , but for positions that affect the company as a whole ( and there are few who do n’t ) , buy - in from stake holders is essential .
Execution
Work with your hiring team to develop a job description that will be distributed to the various job boards and websites .
In my case , the description simply consisted of the required skills and the responsibilities that the successful candidate would assume when hired .
Many organizations use far more complex documents .
Your Human Resources representative will be the best person to contact for more information .
Once you ’ve got a completed description for the position , you can submit it to the job sites .
but you need to make sure that you use the appropriate sites .
The technical skill level of the ideal candidate should be taken into account .
While an entry level candidate could be found easily enough on Monster.com or even Craigslist , a more precise search would improve the signal to noise ratio for highly specialized technical appointments .
In the past , I ’ve recommended the job boards on various professional organizations ( IEEE , USENIX / SAGE , LOPSA ) as well as high profile commercial sites .
The serverfault.com job boards in particular attract very intelligent people , for the most part .
Once you commit your posting , applicants will begin to pour in immediately .
Even in the best of times , it ’s possible to get deluged with applications , but with a large segment of the workforce displaced , the onslaught can be especially overwhelming .
I would recommend that you stick to your guns and use the requirements you put together in the previous step ( as well as any personnel you have at your disposal ) to filter through the applications .
How many are you likely to receive ?
Of course , it depends on your local area and the available position itself ..
After the filtering has been completed , you presumably have a pool of candidates to select from , and chances are very good that you ’ve got more candidates than you could reasonably interview in a short span .
I have several interviewing guidelines , but no real instructions on how to interview a candidate , because I feel like it ’s a very individual sort of endeavor .
Your company ’s culture and your team will dictate the particulars of the interviewing process , just as mine did , but if I can pass along a few general tips , the first and most important would be to listen more than you talk .
Ask open ended questions and see where the candidate goes with it .
Do n’t interrupt unless they ’re floundering .
A great bit of advice I got from “ Hiring Smart ” , by Dr. Pierre Mornell , was that a few minutes before the end of the interview , give the candidate a warning that their time is almost up .
This gives them a chance to air anything that has been nagging at them , and can sometimes be very enlightening .
Dr. Mornell related a tale of one applicant who waited until the five minute warning to let the interviewer know that he was unable to take the job !
As late as that is , it ’s certainly better to find out before the offer letter phase .
After the interviews have been completed , meet with the hiring team to discuss and decide upon a candidate .
Review your interview notes , as well as the requirements you laid out in the planning phase .
Once you ’ve decided on a candidate , call them to congratulate them , and while you ’re on the phone , verify their physical mailing address to ensure that the offer - letter reaches them .
An Experience in Hiring .
In part because of the state of the financial services sector and in part because of the organic growth of the company , I recently found myself in the position of needing to hire another IT administrator to help share the load .
The hiring process opened my eyes to the real state of the economy
I explicitly stated that this was an entry - level position , and that I was looking for candidates who did n’t necessarily have administration experience .
In spite of that , I had someone apply who had spent 20 years at their previous company .
Many people spent over 5 years as senior administrators at their last company .
That ’s the sort of thing that happens in this economy .
In my case , I knew that I was looking for a certain type of person .
My budget dictated that whomever I hired had to be inexperienced .
This made the selection process more difficult , as “ systems administrator ” would be a new role to most of my candidates .
I received several hundred applications in the span of only a week or two .
It started only 5 minutes after the posting went live and did n’t stop until a week after the posting expired
I selected individuals having experience supporting technology in some measure and I sought out people who had experience using platforms similar to those my critical systems are built on .
Most importantly , I selected those people who demonstrated a thirst for knowledge and for trying new things .
It was from a pool such as this that I selected the junior systems administrator
I emailed each of the potential candidates and scheduled a telephone interview with them .
It was n’t a long , detailed interview ; ten minutes was sufficient to tell me whether I wanted to bring a person in to interview them in person .
I was thankful that I took the time to conduct the telephone interview .
There were a few cases where I talked to people who had impressive resumes , but upon questioning admitted things , such as , “ well , no , actually I did n’t implement that VPN connection , but I was there when someone from the vendor came and did it ” .
These are things it ’s good to know before you waste several hours interviewing someone in person .
My interviews took , on average , two and a half hours .
This seems like a long time , but it took about a half an hour before the candidates really relaxed and their personalities showed .
At the same time , I wanted to extract a large sampling of their knowledge , and more importantly , introduce subjects new to them , to observe their learning process .
Existing knowledge was n’t as important as the ability to acquire more of it , for my position .
I was upfront in the job posting with the salary range that we were prepared to pay for the candidates .
When I performed the phone interview , I made sure to discuss pay with the candidates , and to get their thoughts on where in the posted range they fell .
I was really surprised to hear that most of the candidates I talked to evaluated themselves very honestly , and for the most part , they suggested pay rates which were close to my mental target .
During the interview , I openly discussed the question of pay with the candidates , because I wanted the major negotiation to happen in person .
Your organization may have different customs and policies , so again , make sure to discuss your plans with Human Resources beforehand .
Evaluation
The hiring process does not end when someone is hired .
It does n’t really end until the person ’s first annual review .
All of the processes that we take part in can stand to be reviewed , and hiring is no exception .
Although this length of time has n’t passed for me yet with the IT Administrator , I intend to review the hiring process with my interviewing team after the new admin has been with us for a quarter .
I want the emphasis to be on the process , and whether or not we succeeded in our goals , and what we could have done better .
These sorts of occasional self - evaluations can lead to increased performance the next time I , or one of my teammates , is in the position to hire another employee .
Time will tell , but from what I ’ve seen , everything is going to be great .
Amanda Sutton looks over a wheat field in northern Colorado and sees a potential project that could help curb greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming .
“ This is a patch of highly - cultivated land that could provide potential carbon offsets , ” she said , standing by the field which is owned by the city of Fort Collins and the surrounding county .
“ What we would do is take this wheat field and restore it to a native grassland which would sequester carbon from the atmosphere which we could potentially sell , ” said Sutton , an environmental specialist with the city .
( See more Sutton comments in the video below )
Potential projects in the emerging carbon market are sprouting like wheat after a good rain across the United States in anticipation of “ cap and trade ” provisions in a climate bill that has narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives but could see significant revision in the Senate .
They could be part of a strategy to meet the bill ’s current target to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent of 2005 levels by 2020 .
A cap and trade inspired market in Europe has been in place since 2005 and is the biggest by far .
Carbon trading and projects are already underway in various versions in the United States and contribute to a global voluntary market that last year saw turnover more than double to $ 705 million , according to Ecosystem Marketplace and New Carbon Finance , which track such trends .
Three regional U.S. groups are trading or in the process of creating regulated carbon trading markets .
To trade on such markets , a project must reduce greenhouse gas emissions or , in the case of converting a cultivated field to its natural state or reforesting a patch of land , act as a “ carbon sink ” to absorb emissions spewed elsewhere .
Once a project is certified and its “ carbon offset ” is measured in tons , it can sell them as “ credits ” to polluters unable to meet their emission targets , or even to groups that want to say they have cut their “ carbon footprints . ”
Some experts say carbon sinks are increasingly important because the world is failing to curb greenhouse gases from power plants , planes and cars fast enough , and so needs to buy more time to avoid dangerous climate change .
‘ GET OUT OF JAIL FREE ’
But some environmentalists feel trading in pollution is ultimately a ruse .
“ By using offsets , industry will be able to sidestep emissions reductions .
It is a get out of jail free card , ” says Damon Moglen , the Global Warming Campaign Director for environment group Greenpeace .
Trees store carbon while they grow and release it back into the atmosphere when they rot .
So in the vocabulary of carbon markets a healthy forest is a “ carbon sink . ”
Tree growth in the United States currently sucks up about 12 percent of the country ’s greenhouse gas emissions — a huge total .
The U.S. climate bill may provide an economic windfall to land owners including non-profit organizations , cities , farmers and forest owners who can turn farmland or cleared land back into forests .
It may also reward “ sustainable forestry ” practices , though their carbon benefit will be tough to gauge .
“ We see emerging carbon markets as a every exciting revenue source for small family forest owners , ” said Bob Simpson , vice president for the Center for Family Forests .
But the cost to a small family landowner of having their offsets measured and certified remains unclear .
GROUPS BAND TOGETHER
Groups like Woodlands Carbon in Oregon are forming around the country to reduce the costs of market entry by joining several forest owners into one portfolio .
Many investments currently being made are essentially “ bets ” on the bill that ultimately emerges from Congress , according to Mary Grady , a director at the American Carbon Registry .
“ The current legislation is very favorable … It is a wonderful first step and it is sending the first signals to the market .
But the general feeling is that the legislation is not going to pass in its current form , ” she said .
Once the bill passes , a billion tons of carbon could accumulate in the market by 2012 or 2013 , when the regulations are supposed to take effect The American Carbon Registry currently has 22 projects worth about 30 million tons .
Grady also said carbon traders worried that the legislation currently says that the “ administrator ” , which depending on the project could be the Environmental Protection Agency or the U.S. Department of Agriculture will approve programs — but it does not name the programs yet .
“ If it was clear people would have lots of confidence in making their investments but people do n’t know where to place their bets , ” she said .
Getting a project verified has spawned a whole new industry that could create some of the “ green jobs ” President Barack Obama has said will go with the new green economy .
These include independent , third party project verifiers who apply financial accounting techniques while also using gadgets like gas analyzers to measure carbon tonnage .
The American National Standards Institute accredits firms as third party verifiers but it is all so new that there is no official university degree to train in the profession .
Back at the field in Colorado , Sutton says if this project were to become a reality — a big if — it would have to meet the stringent standards of the voluntary market and show it is removing more carbon from the atmosphere than would have happened naturally .
For now , the wheat will remain .

I thought I had heard just about every conceivable “ explanation ” from the Birthers about why President Obama has not released the documents that they claim would prove he was born in the United States .
But apparently I was wrong , because last week Joseph Farah of WorldNetDaily appeared on the right - wing radio program “ Crosstalk ” and offered a new one : Obama ’s maternal grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , was really his mother .
In response to a caller who said that Obama ’s decision to briefly suspend his presidential campaign last year in order to visit his ailing grandmother was really a plot by Obama to get his hands on key documents in order to perpetrate a cover - up of his ineligibility , Farah responded :
Well , Madelyn Dunham is a very interesting person .
As you know , Barack … the … and I want to be careful when he identify people as “ mother , ” “ father , ” “ grandmother , ” and so forth because honestly I do n’t think we know with any certainty whatsoever who those players are in Barack Obama ’s life .
And perhaps he does n’t either .
I suspect he does , but it ’s possible he does n’t know .
And it is entirely within the realm of possibility that Madelyn Dunham was his mother and there ’s a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that . ”
Aside from the obvious insanity of that statement , I just want to ask one question : if this were in fact true , would n’t it demolish the Birther movement ’s foundational claim that Obama in ineligible to be president because was born in Kenya ?

There 's More Than One Way to Fail a Listen Check
Government plans to store ID card biometrics data on a controversial system used by thousands of public workers might be scrapped .
The Home Office has confirmed it is reconsidering plans to use the Customer Information System system to store biometric data for the ID card scheme .
The Customer Information System ( CIS ) - which is run by the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) - has yet to meet the Cabinet Office 's latest standards on IT security , Computer Weekly has learned .
Computer Weekly revealed in August that thirty four council staff accessed the CIS database to snoop on the personal records of celebrities and acquaintances .
Nine of the council workers were sacked .
The CIS database holds information on 85 million citizens , and is the government 's main citizen database .
It is available to 140,000 users from eight government departments , and to 445 local authorities .
But it is proving difficult for the Department of Work of Pensions to allow thousands of public workers and local authorities to access the CIS Oracle - based database , yet keep it demonstrably secure .
The Home Office revealed plans to use the CIS system for ID cards in December 2006 in its Strategic Action Plan for the National Identity Scheme .
In the Strategic Action Plan for the National Identity Scheme , the Home Office said : " We plan to use DWP 's Customer Information System ( CIS ) technology , subject to the successful completion of technical feasibility work , " for National Identity Register biographical information .
It added : " DWP 's CIS technology is already used to hold records for everyone who has a National Insurance number - i.e. nearly everyone in the UK . "
The Home Office planned to separate DWP 's citizen data on the CIS information from the biometrics store being built up on the National Identity Register .
Now the government plans to avoid using CIS for the ID card scheme , if possible .
A spokesman for the Home Office said using CIS is no more than an option for the future .
He said the possibility of using CIS will not be considered until the system has full security accreditation , which is due in 2010 at the earliest .
The Home Office will store biometric information for ID cards on a database run by Thales , one of the main contractors for the ID card scheme .
Officials had planned to use CIS for the ID card scheme to save money .
It would have allowed the government to avoid building an entirely new system and security architecture .
But Computer Weekly has learned that the security of the CIS has been so discredited that officials are keen to distance the ID card scheme from it , even if this means paying for a new system from scratch .

Obscene Bible comments reflect ‘ failure ’ of church
Obscene comments written into a Bible on display as part of an art exhibition reflect the failure of the church to demonstrate the message of God ’s reconciliation with man through Jesus Christ , says the head of Wycliffe Bible Translators .
The Bible was put on display at the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow beside some pens and a notice by Metropolitan Community Church telling visitors : “ Are there any gay people in the Bible ?
Out of the tens of thousands of people who appear in the Old and New Testaments , there must have been .
“ Same - sex love , such as that between Ruth and Naomi , existed , but has been written out over time .
“ If you feel you have been excluded from the Bible , please write your way back into it . ”
Some visitors responded to the invitation by scribbling abuse onto the pages of the Bible , including “ F*** the Bible ” and “ I do n’t want a fascist God ” .
Exhibition organisers have since removed the most offensive pages .
Eddie Arthur , Executive Director of Wycliffe Bible Translators , said : " It 's disappointing that people feel the need to deface a Bible when offered the opportunity .
“ But it is understandable that people who feel excluded would react to that exclusion .
However , it is not the Bible that has marginalised people .
“ Sadly , it is a failure of the wider Christian church to adequately live and demonstrate the message of God 's reconciliation which is the issue . ”
Andrea Minichiello Williams , director of the Christian Legal Centre , was quoted by The Telegraph as saying : “ We have got to a point where we call the desecration of the Bible modern art .
“ The Bible stands for everything this art does not : for creation , beauty , hope and regeneration . ”
Ever since its launch in November 2006 , the PS3 has received a significant amount of criticism over its software lineup , much of which was justified .
During its first six months of availability , the PS3 had only received two titles worthy of praise , Motorstorm and Resistance : Fall of Man .
Overall software quality was just one of many complaints regarding the fledgling platform , but has become the leading topic in regards to why the PS3 has managed to make so many inroads over the past three years .
During the first year or so of the PS3 ’s initial release , many game developers were criticized for merely “ porting ” multiplatform titles , instead of actually taking the time to work with the PS3 ’s architecture ( being comprised of the Cell Broadband Engine and the RSX Reality Synthesizer ) .
Expectations of the PS3 ’s graphical output were very high , particularly because of some of the comments
Sony executives were making ( 1 ) ( 2 ) .
However , Sony ’s next - gen rival , Microsoft , got their system out of the gates first .
They released their console to North American audiences November 22nd , 2005 , almost a full year ahead of the PS3 ’s North American and Japanese release dates .
This gave developers ample time to develop and work , albeit for a short time , exclusively on the Xbox 360 in terms of next - generation consoles .
When the PS3 came onto the scene , many developers were either unaware of the technology the mighty behemoth possessed , or were too ignorant to appreciate it .
This in turn led to PS3 titles that were noticeably inferior to their 360 counterparts .
For the first full year of release , critics and gamers alike were quick to point out the noticeable gameplay issues and graphical flaws that plagued many multiplatform games .
Milk , eggs and bacon have expiration dates and so , delightfully , does debt .
Creditors and third - party debt collectors typically have around six years to track down consumers and sue them .
They do n't typically go that far when the magic date arrives , but if they do , consumers can ask a judge to dismiss their cases based on their state 's statute of limitations .
Pat O'Connor was n't aware of the timeline until her husband , John Miller , received a letter recently from a debt collection agency asking him to pay a " settlement offer " of $ 68.19 , graciously cut down from a $ 136.38 balance once owed to AT&T Broadband .
The problem , O'Connor ranted to The Desk , is that they 'd never been customers .
The Desk suggested O'Connor ask the collector , Credit Bureau Collection Services Inc. , to attach a date to the account .
The year , 2000 , it turns out , was a debtor 's equivalent to a darn stinky pint of sour cream .
In Oregon and Washington , the statute of limitations on debt from written contracts is six years from the account 's last activity .
Statutes vary state to state ; for instance , the limit on credit card debt is three years in Washington and six in Oregon .
O'Connor might be dealing with what folks in the credit counseling community call a zombie or scavenger debt collector .
These bill collectors buy up old , typically charged - off accounts for a fraction of the original amount and try to track down the debt -- often after it has or is about to expire and sometimes , even after it 's already been paid .
Receive a collections letter that does n't compute ?
Jog your memory with a look at your credit reports ( access free reports from Equifax , Experian and Transunion yearly at annualcreditreport.com ) .
If the debt is n't listed , that 's an indicator that something may be fishy , said Jan Safley , director of Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Southern Oregon .
Questionable mail ?
If you receive something suspicious in the mail — say an offer for an auto warranty or mortgage insurance — contact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service .
The federal agency accepts consumer complaints and can provide the complaint history of a mailing that ’s potentially fraudulent : Details : postalinspectors.uspis.gov/ or 877-876-2455 .
If the debt is listed , check the date noted as the account 's last transaction .
" This is just a huge issue right now , " said Safley .
She notes that consumers feel particularly vulnerable in this economy and that people who have good credit or who are attempting to repair a low score may pay off an outstanding account just to be safe .
" That just encourages these guys who buy up all this debt real cheap , " she said .
" If they can get just a few people to send them money , it 's pretty lucrative . "
And , like in the movies , zombies can be tricky .
Debt collectors may be able to reset the timeline if they can get consumers to admit the debt is theirs or persuade them to pay some small amount of it .
Safley and others recommend that you write -- do n't call -- to dispute a claim and ask for proof of the debt .
For a sample of what such a letter might look like , search online for " debt validation letter . "
If consumers know the debt is theirs and decide to pay a portion of it , make sure to get the deal in writing , she said .
Sometimes another collector will buy up the remaining debt and come back asking for the full amount .
Also , she said , know that paying partial amounts will hurt your credit score and means you must report the gift -- yep , that 's the wording for the difference between what you owed and what you agreed to pay -- to the IRS .
To be sure , in O'Connor 's case , CBCS simply may have gone after the wrong person for a valid debt .
The Desk 's calls to CBCS to get at why it was looking to collect on a nine - year - old bill were not returned .
O'Connor informed the firm in writing within 30 days of receiving the letter that CBCS had the wrong person and that the contact should end there .
If not , a tweak to the state 's debt collection laws will allow the Oregon attorney general to follow up with the company if it makes repeated attempts to contact O'Connor after being notified it had the wrong person .
Although the Columbus , Ohio - based company is legitimate , it has racked up a raft of consumer complaints in recent years .
The Ohio attorney general 's office has collected 516 consumer complaints against CBCS since September 2004 , while the national Better Business Bureau has received 652 in the past 36 months , of which 586 pertained to billing and collection issues .
Oregonians have filed 16 complaints with the state 's AG office , all with similar issues as O'Connor's .
Online , dozens of consumers compare stories about receiving similar letters -- all with balances from companies with which they 've never done business .

Muldrow men accused of playing porn on Walmart TVs in Fort Smith
FORT SMITH , Ark. ( AP ) —
Two Oklahoma men have been arrested for allegedly playing a pornographic DVD on display televisions at a Fort Smith Walmart .
Sebastian County jail records show 20 - year - olds Cody Allen Sexton and Kenny Dean Andrews — both of Muldrow — were arrested on a felony obscenity complaint .
Police say the two put the pornographic DVD into a player that was connected to six televisions on Sept.
3 . The DVD was removed after a customer notified a store manager .
It was n't clear whether the two have an attorney .
Police Sgt. Levi Risley says the two thought they were just pulling a prank .

The book is not due until mid-November , but some of the complaints that Palin had about the management of the McCain Campaign was warranted and he was the top gun , so any criticism will be focused on him front and center .
As part of the Aspen Institute ’s Washington Ideas Forum in Washington , DC this morning , Steve Schmidt was asked about Sarah Palin ’s upcoming book , “ Going Rogue , ” and about her 2012 potential .
" I think that she has talent , " Schmidt said , " but my honest view is that she would not be a winning candidate for the Republican Party in 2012 , " according to the Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein .
Schmidt added that it was not " inconceivable that she could be Republican nominee for president of the United States . "
But , according to Stein , Schmidt said it would be " fairly inconceivable " that she could end up being president .
" In fact , were she to be the nominee we could have a catastrophic election , " said Schmidt .
Catastrophic ?
We knew if she was Vice - President in 2008 after her television performances and lack of knowledge that she would be catastrophic as " one heart beat " away from the presidency .
So , dumping on her now is kind of hypocritical to me , because Schmidt knew who he got when he convinced McCain to pick her and that is .
And now , he wants to dump on her prior to her book coming out ?
Remember Schmidt , it was your campaign decision to pick her and put her in the spot she is in now , not the other way around .
And Palin 's book ?
It will be a hot mess , she did not write jack , but gave a lot of hot button one - liners that the ghost writer jumped on to make a memoir .
She will talk about everyone , it wo n't depend on which party you are in , if you made her an enemy she will call you out .
In other words , nothing new from her .

A bright light in the darkness of the criminal justice system
Nicole got my federal case assigned to her and from the very first day in bond hearing she ripped the prosecutiona and agents to pieces – not with just being aggressive bu by being logical , quick and very cutting .
i was denied bond at first do to my own actions but 87 days in federal custody she got me out .
She got one of my counts waived and i did the leg monitor for 8 months awaiting sentencing in which she guided me through with everything I needed to get a lighter sentence .
In the court before the judge she spoke more eloquently than anyone in the room and it was her efforts and passion that got me probation – i owe her my new life .

* Karzai accuses United States of trying to undermine him
* Deadly NATO airstrike was terrible error of judgment
* Election fraud " inevitable " - Karzai
PARIS , Sept 7 ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai has accused the United States of denouncing his friends and family in an effort to undermine his own position and make him more malleable .
In a wide - ranging interview with Le Figaro daily , released on Monday , Karzai also condemned a NATO airstrike last week on hijacked fuel tankers , and said he supported a mooted shift in U.S. military tactics in Afghanistan .
Karzai , who is closing in on a first - round victory in last month 's presidential election , revealed strained relations with the United States and said U.S. criticism of his running mate , Mohammad Qasim Fahim , was actually aimed at him .
" The Americans attack Karzai in an underhand fashion because they want him to be more tractable .
They are wrong .
It is in their interest ... that Afghanistan 's people respect their president , " he said , referring to himself in the third person .
" It is in no - one 's interest to have an Afghan president who has become an American puppet , " he added .
The New York - based watchdog Human Rights Watch has called Fahim one of the most notorious warlords in the country , while Le Figaro said Washington had branded him a drug smuggler .
Karzai also said accusations that his own brother was corrupt were unfounded , adding that the United States embassy in Kabul had twice failed to answer his written requests for proof .
" That said , I am not going to deny that there is a serious problem of corruption in the heart of our administration .
My priority is to fight that .
But I am also going to ask for more transparency from our foreign partners , " he said .
ELECTION FRAUD " INEVITABLE "
He also said there might have been fraud in last month 's disputed presidential elections , but indicated he did not think it was important .
His main challenger Abdullah Abdullah has said there was large scale cheating .
" As far as the elections are concerned , there was fraud in 2004 , there is today , there will be tomorrow .
Alas , it is inevitable in a nascent democracy , " he said .
Karzai said that if his re-election was confirmed , he would seek national reconciliation talks with the Taliban within the first 100 days of his new administration .
He said the Taliban would first have to renounce any ties with al Qaeda and recognise the Afghan constitution .
Karzai told le Figaro that he welcomed a recent review of military strategy in Afghanistan , undertaken by U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal , which has yet to be made public .
The Afghan president said McChrystal had showed him the proposals which emphasised protecting the Afghan population rather than killing Taliban .
" I approve of this 100 percent , " he said , adding , however , that the general was wrong to confuse the Afghan insurrection with terrorism .
" The insurrection is something that is totally different from terrorism .
It 's an internal Afghan affair . "
Karzai also said that McChrystal had assured him that he had not personally ordered an airstrike last Friday on hijacked fuel tankers .
Afghan officials said the attack killed many civilians .
" What an error of judgment !
More than 90 dead all because of a simple lorry that was , moreover , immobilised in a river bed .
Why did n't they send in ground troops to recover the fuel tank ?
By the by , General McChrystal telephoned me to apologise and to say that he himself had n't given the order to attack . "

California has a special place in the American psyche .
It is the Golden State : a playground of the rich and famous with perfect weather .
It symbolises a lifestyle of sunshine , swimming pools and the Hollywood dream factory .
But the state that was once held up as the epitome of the boundless opportunities of America has collapsed .
From its politics to its economy to its environment and way of life , California is like a patient on life support .
At the start of summer the state government was so deeply in debt that it began to issue IOUs instead of wages .
Its unemployment rate has soared to more than 12 % , the highest figure in 70 years .
Desperate to pay off a crippling budget deficit , California is slashing spending in education and healthcare , laying off vast numbers of workers and forcing others to take unpaid leave .
In a state made up of sprawling suburbs the collapse of the housing bubble has impoverished millions and kicked tens of thousands of families out of their homes .
Its political system is locked in paralysis and the two - term rule of former movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen as a disaster – his approval ratings having sunk to levels that would make George W Bush blush .
The crisis is so deep that Professor Kevin Starr , who has written an acclaimed history of the state , recently declared : " California is on the verge of becoming the first failed state in America . "
Outside the Forum in Inglewood , near downtown Los Angeles , California has already failed .
The scene is reminiscent of the fallout from Hurricane Katrina , as crowds of impoverished citizens stand or lie aimlessly on the hot tarmac of the centre 's car park .
It is 10 am , and most have already been here for hours .
They have come for free healthcare : a travelling medical and dental clinic has set up shop in the Forum ( which usually hosts rock concerts ) and thousands of the poor , the uninsured and the down - on - their - luck have driven for miles to be here .
The queue began forming at 1 am .
By 4 am , the 1,500 spaces were already full and people were being turned away .
On the floor of the Forum , root - canal surgeries are taking place .
People are ferried in on cushions , hauled out of decrepit cars .
Sitting propped up against a lamp post , waiting for her number to be called , is Debbie Tuua , 33 .
It is her birthday , but she has taken a day off work to bring her elderly parents to the Forum , and they have driven through the night to get here .
They wait in a car as the heat of the day begins to rise .
" It is awful for them , but what choice do we have ? "
Tuua says .
" I have no other way to get care to them . "
Yet California is currently cutting healthcare , slashing the " Healthy Families " programme that helped an estimated one million of its poorest children .
Los Angeles now has a poverty rate of 20 % .
Other cities across the state , such as Fresno and Modesto , have jobless rates that rival Detroit's .
In order to pass its state budget , California 's government has had to agree to a deal that cuts billions of dollars from education and sacks 60,000 state employees .
Some teachers have launched a hunger strike in protest .
California 's education system has become so poor so quickly that it is now effectively failing its future workforce .
The percentage of 19 - year - olds at college in the state dropped from 43 % to 30 % between 1996 and 2004 , one of the highest falls ever recorded for any developed world economy .
California 's schools are ranked 47th out of 50 in the nation .
Its government - issued bonds have been ranked just above " junk " .
Some of the state 's leading intellectuals believe this collapse is a disaster that will harm Californians for years to come .
" It will take a while for this self - destructive behaviour to do its worst damage , " says Robert Hass , a professor at Berkeley and a former US poet laureate , whose work has often been suffused with the imagery of the Californian way of life .
Now , incredibly , California , which has been a natural target for immigration throughout its history , is losing people .
Between 2004 and 2008 , half a million residents upped sticks and headed elsewhere .
By 2010 , California could lose a congressman because its population will have fallen so much – an astonishing prospect for a state that is currently the biggest single political entity in America .
Neighbouring Nevada has launched a mocking campaign to entice businesses away , portraying Californian politicians as monkeys , and with a tag - line jingle that runs : " Kiss your assets goodbye ! "
You know you have a problem when Nevada – famed for nothing more than Las Vegas , casinos and desert – is laughing at you .
This matters , too .
Much has been made globally of the problems of Ireland and Iceland .
Yet California dwarfs both .
It is the eighth largest economy in the world , with a population of 37 million .
If it was an independent country it would be in the G8 .
And if it were a company , it would likely be declared bankrupt .
That prospect might surprise many , but it does not come as news to Tuua , as she glances nervously into the warming sky , hoping her parents will not have to wait in the car through the heat of the day just to see a doctor .
" It is so depressing .
They both worked hard all their lives in this state and this is where they have ended up .
It should not have to be this way , " she says .
It is impossible not to be impressed by the physical presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger when he walks into a room .
He may appear slightly smaller than you imagine , but he 's just as powerful .
This is , after all , the man who , before he was California 's governor , was the Terminator and Conan the Barbarian .
But even Schwarzenegger is humbled by the scale of the crisis .
At a press conference in Sacramento to announce the final passing of a state budget , which would include billions of dollars of cuts , the governor speaks in uncharacteristically pensive terms .
" It is clear that we do not know yet what the future holds .
We are still in troubled waters , " he says quietly .
He looks subdued , despite his sharp grey suit and bright pink tie .
Later , during a grilling by reporters , Schwarzenegger is asked an unusual question .
As a gaggle of journalists begins to shout , one man 's voice quickly silences the others .
" Do you ever feel like you 're watching the end of the California dream ? " asks the reporter .
It is clearly a personal matter for Schwarzenegger .
After all , his life story has embodied it .
He arrived virtually penniless from Austria , barely speaking English .
He ended up a movie star , rich beyond his dreams , and finally governor , hanging Conan 's prop sword in his office .
Schwarzenegger answers thoughtfully and at length .
He hails his own experience and ends with a passionate rallying call in his still thickly accented voice .
" There is people that sometimes suggest that the American dream , or the Californian dream , is evaporating .
I think it 's absolutely wrong .
I think the Californian dream is as strong as ever , " he says , mangling the grammar but not the sentiment .
Looking back , it is easy to see where Schwarzenegger 's optimism sprung from .
California has always been a special place , with its own idea of what could be achieved in life .
There is no such thing as a British dream .
Even within America , there is no Kansas dream or New Jersey dream .
But for California the concept is natural .
It has always been a place apart .
It is of the American West , the destination point in a nation whose history has been marked by restless pioneers .
It is the home of Hollywood , the nation 's very own fantasy land .
Getting on a bus or a train or a plane and heading out for California has been a regular trope in hundreds of books , movies , plays , and in the popular imagination .
It has been writ large in the national psyche as free from the racial divisions of the American South and the traditions and reserve of New England .
It was America 's own America .
Michael Pollan , author of The Omnivore 's Dilemma and now an adopted Californian , remembers arriving here from his native New England .
" In New England you would have to know people for 10 years before they let you in their home , " he says .
" Here , when I took my son to his first play date , the mother invited me to a hot tub . "
Michael Levine is a Hollywood mover and shaker , shaping PR for a stable of A - list clients that once included Michael Jackson .
Levine arrived in California 32 years ago .
" The concept of the Californian dream was a certain quality of life , " he says .
" It was experimentalism and creativity .
California was a utopia . "
Levine arrived at the end of the state 's golden age , at a time when the dream seemed to have been transformed into reality .
The 1950s and 60s had been boom - time in the American economy ; jobs had been plentiful and development rapid .
Unburdened by environmental concerns , Californian developers built vast suburbs beneath perpetually blue skies .
Entire cities sprang from the desert , and orchards were paved over into playgrounds and shopping malls .
" They came here , they educated their kids , they had a pool and a house .
That was the opportunity for a pretty broad section of society , " says Joel Kotkin , an urbanist at Chapman University , in Orange County .
This was what attracted immigrants in their millions , flocking to industries – especially defence and aviation – that seemed to promise jobs for life .
But the newcomers were mistaken .
Levine , among millions of others , does not think California is a utopia now .
" California is going to take decades to fix , " he says .
So where did it all go wrong ?
Few places embody the collapse of California as graphically as the city of Riverside .
Dubbed " The Inland Empire " , it is an area in the southern part of the state where the desert has been conquered by mile upon mile of housing developments , strip malls and four - lane freeways .
The tidal wave of foreclosures and repossessions that burst the state 's vastly inflated property bubble first washed ashore here .
" We 've been hit hard by foreclosures .
You can see it everywhere , " says political scientist Shaun Bowler , who has lived in California for 20 years after moving here from his native England .
The impact of the crisis ranges from boarded - up homes to abandoned swimming pools that have become a breeding ground for mosquitoes .
Bowler 's sister , visiting from England , was recently taken to hospital suffering from an infected insect bite from such a pool .
" You could say she was a victim of the foreclosure crisis , too , " he jokes .
But it is no laughing matter .
One in four American mortgages that are " under water " , meaning they are worth more than the home itself , are in California .
In the Central Valley town of Merced , house prices have crashed by 70 % .
Two Democrat politicians have asked for their districts to be declared disaster zones , because of the poor economic conditions caused by foreclosures .
In one city near Riverside , a squatter 's camp of newly homeless labourers sleeping in their vehicles has grown up in a supermarket car park – the local government has provided toilets and a mobile shower .
In the Los Angeles suburb of Pacoima , one in nine homeowners are now in default on their mortgage , and the local priest , the Rev John Lasseigne , has garnered national headlines – swapping saving souls to saving houses , by negotiating directly with banks on behalf of his parishioners .
For some campaigners and advocates against suburban sprawl and car culture , it has been a bitter triumph .
" Let the gloating begin ! " says James Kunstler , author of The Long Emergency , a warning about the high cost of the suburban lifestyle .
Others see the end of the housing boom as a man -made disaster akin to a mass hysteria , but with no redemption in sight .
" If California was an experiment then it was an experiment of mass irresponsibility – and that has failed , " says Michael Levine .
Nowhere is the economic cost of California 's crisis writ larger than in the Central Valley town of Mendota , smack in the heart of a dusty landscape of flat , endless fields of fruit and vegetables .
The town , which boldly terms itself " the cantaloup capital of the world " , now has an unemployment rate of 38 % .
That is expected to rise above 50 % as the harvest ends and labourers are laid off .
City officials hold food giveaways every two weeks .
More than 40 % of the town 's people live below the poverty level .
Shops have shut , restaurants have closed , drugs and alcohol abuse have become a problem .
Standing behind the counter of his DVD and grocery store , former Mendota mayor Joseph Riofrio tells me it breaks his heart to watch the town sink into the mire .
His father had built the store in the 1950s and constructed a solid middle - class life around it , to raise his family .
Now Riofrio has stopped selling booze in a one - man bid to curb the social problems breaking out all around him .
" It is so bad , but it has now got to the point where we are getting used to it being like this , " he says .
Riofrio knows his father 's achievements could not be replicated today .
The state that once promised opportunities for working men and their families now promises only desperation .
" He could not do what he did again .
That chance does not exist now , " Riofrio says .
Outside , in a shop that Riofrio 's grandfather built , groups of unemployed men play pool for 25 cents a game .
Near every one of the town 's liquor stores others lie slumped on the pavements , drinking their sorrows away .
Mendota is fighting for survival against heavy odds .
The town of 7,000 souls has seen 2,000 people leave in the past two years .
But amid the crisis there are a few sparks of hope for the future .
California has long been an incubator of fresh ideas , many of which spread across the country .
If America emerges from its crisis a greener , more economically and politically responsible nation , it is likely that renewal will have begun here .
The clues to California 's salvation – and perhaps even the country as a whole – are starting to emerge .
Take Anthony " Van " Jones , a man now in the vanguard of the movement to build a future green economy , creating millions of jobs , solving environmental problems and reducing climate change at a stroke .
It is a beguiling vision and one that Jones conceived in the northern Californian city of Oakland .
He began political life as an anti-poverty campaigner , but gradually combined that with environmentalism , believing that greening the economy could also revitalise it and lift up the poor .
He founded Green for All as an advocacy group and published a best - selling book , The Green Collar Economy .
Then Obama came to power and Jones got the call from the White House .
In just a few years , his ideas had spread from the streets of Oakland to White House policy papers .
Jones was later ousted from his role , but his ideas remain .
Green jobs are at the forefront of Obama 's ideas on both the economy and the environment .
Jones believes California will once more change itself , and then change the nation .
" California remains a beacon of hope …
This is a new time for a new direction to grow a new society and a new economy , " Jones has said .
It is already happening .
California may have sprawling development and awful smog , but it leads the way in environmental issues .
Arnold Schwarzenegger was seen as a leading light , taking the state far ahead of the federal government on eco-issues .
The number of solar panels in the state has risen from 500 a decade ago to more than 50,000 now .
California generates twice as much energy from solar power as all the other US states combined .
Its own government is starting to turn on the reckless sprawl that has marked the state 's development .
California 's attorney - general , Jerry Brown , recently sued one county government for not paying enough attention to global warming when it came to urban planning .
Even those , like Kotkin , who are sceptical about the end of suburbia , think California will develop a new model for modern living : comfortable , yes , but more modest and eco-friendly .
Kotkin , who is writing an eagerly anticipated book about what America will look like in 2050 , thinks much of it will still resemble the bedrock of the Californian dream : sturdy , wholesome suburbs for all – just done more responsibly .
" We will still live in suburbs .
You work with the society you have got .
The question is how we make them more sustainable , " he says .
Even the way America eats is being changed in California .
Every freeway may be lined with fast - food outlets , but California is also the state of Alice Waters , the guru of the slow - food movement , who inspired Michelle Obama to plant a vegetable garden in the White House .
She thinks the state is changing its values .
" The crisis is bringing us back to our senses .
We had adopted a fast and easy way of living , but we are moving away from that now , " she says .
There is hope in politics , too .
There is a growing movement to call for a constitutional convention that could redraw the way the state is governed .
It could change how the state passes budgets and make the political system more open , recreating the lost middle ground .
Recently , the powerful mayor of Los Angeles , Antonio Villaraigosa , signed on to the idea .
Gerrymandering , too , is set to take a hit .
Next year Schwarzenegger will take steps to redraw some districts to make them more competitive , breaking the stranglehold of party politics .
He wants district boundaries to be drawn up by impartial judges , not politicians .
In previous times that would have been the equivalent of a turkey voting for Christmas .
But now the bold move is seen for what it is : a necessary step to change things .
And there is no denying that innovation is something that California does well .
Even in the most deprived corners of the state there is a sense that things can still turn around .
California has always been able to reinvent itself , and some of its most hardcore critics still like the idea of it having a " dream " .
" I believe in California .
It pains me at the moment to see it where it is , but I still believe in it , " said Michael Levine .
Perhaps more surprisingly , a fellow believer is to be found in Mendota in the shape of Joseph Riofrio .
His shop operates as a sort of informal meeting place for the town .
People drop in to chat , to get advice , or to buy a cold soft drink to relieve the unrelenting heat outside .
The people are poor , many of them out of work , often hiring a bunch of DVDs as a cheap way of passing the time .
But Riofrio sees them as a community , one that he grew up in .
He is proud of his town and determined to stick it out .
" This is a good place to live , " he says .
" I want to be here when it turns around . "
He is talking of the stricken town outside .
But he could be describing the whole state . ★

Things to worry about on a lazy August Sunday :
Abdullah Abdullah , the leading rival to incumbent Hamid Karzai in the Afghanistan presidential elections , told a gathering of hundreds of his campaign workers from the southern provinces that he would not accept an outright victory by Karzai as legitimate .
With 35 % of the votes counted , Karzai has a little over 46 % , with Abdullah trailing at 31 % .
Karzai needs 50 % to avoid a run-off , though the Afghan press thinks that outcome is increasingly unlikely .
But if his luck turns up in the remaining ballots , Karzai could find himself facing a major rebellion .
Abdullah is favored by the Tajik ethnic group that predominates in the north of the country , which speaks Persian and is largely Sunni .
Karzai is most popular among the Pashtuns whence his own small tribe , the Popolzai , derives .
Afghanistan is a tinderbox , and a major Iran - style post-election struggle between Tajiks and Pashtuns could completely destabilize the country .
Any such conflagration would embroil US and NATO troops in a new round of fierce fighting .
The US is denying a report that it is pressing Karzai to create a coalition government .
The Iranian news agency Farsnews said that the US had pressured Karzai to hold a run-off election ( even if he gets 50 % ? ) and also to then form a national unity government by offering cabinet posts to rivals Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani .
( Presumably a Dari Persian - speaking member of Karzai ’s staff leaked this report to the Iranian press ) .
Given the dangers facing the country of ethnic divisions , maybe a government of national unity would n’t be such a bad idea , whether the US is pressing for it or not .
Meanwhile , British PM Gordon Brown was in Afghanistan Saturday , where he pledged more troops and more support , according to ITN :
Nearly two - thirds of Britons want UK troops to return from Afghanistan .
Wondering why you do n’t hear much genuine news from Afghanistan despite the fact that the US military is fighting a war there ?
Russia Today covers the Stars and Stripes report that it is having the Rendon Group ( a civilian contractor propaganda firm ) to vet embedded journalists for how positive they might be in their coverage of Afghanistan .
The Rendon group was used by the CIA in the early 1990s to run asset Ahmad Chalabi , who helped fabricate the case for a war on Iraq .

Programming languages are used to express one 's idea in a way that machines understand .
Computers need to be told accurately what we have in mind .
They do not understand nuances and body language like we humans .
Consequently programming languages need a lot of precision and painstaking effort to be told exactly what we want .
Humans work differently .
The same thing when told to different people will be interpreted differently and you will get unpredictable reactions .
Whereas in the case of computers , you will get the exact same answer .
There is a great deal of predictability and convenience in programming languages as opposed to natural languages like English or Tamil .
In the case of natural languages , we find that there is a lot of cultural symbolism associated with language since language forms a vehicle for expression and communication .
Consequently different races come with different approaches towards life .
And the language they speak clearly mirrors this natural leaning .
I will explain .
In India you find that different states are divided on the basis of the language they speak .
Each linguistic group has a corresponding culture and tradition associated with them .
We have a lot of similarity in the computer world too .
You find that C programmers belong to a certain category of hackers .
I think without a doubt you all will agree that the smartest programmers on earth today are not assembly programmers or Java programmers but C programmers .
I know that people get religious about programming languages but I want to transcend petty differences and arrive at the truth .
There is no use fighting over which language to use to solve a problem .
We sometimes find that we know only certain languages and we can think only in those terms .
This is fine but in the long run we may want to pickup other skills and languages that make us more efficient .
After all there is always the idea of the best tool for the job in hand .
We can use any tool that serves the purpose but programming languages determine how efficiently and quickly we solve the problem at hand .
I find that the best programming language when applied to a wide variety of challenging problems on the Internet is C .
It is called a middle level language as you can do object oriented event based programming for designing user interfaces with it .
You also run BGP on Internet 's core routers by writing UNIX daemons in C .
But this article is not about C . This article is about perl .
But I wish to give C its rightful place .
C is the most powerful language that attracts the smartest minds into its fold .
As simple as that .
I am sure nobody will get annoyed at the above observation no matter how political you are with languages .
But this statement may cause trouble .
I will still say it .
C++ is different from C .
It is very different from C and I have good reason not to comment about it .
I will leave it at that .
Having said all that we will deal solely with perl for the remaining part of this article .
Perl is the greatest language for all tasks that C complicates .
C gives fine grained control and power , but it is also time taking to develop and error prone .
We need high level languages for most commonly encountered problems .
Perl works admirably well here .
Sometimes it works much better than we can imagine .
Python and lua are excellent languages too and I am sure that Python is much better than perl in many many respects but there is one key difference .
The difference is CPAN .
You do n't have half as many modules as you have in perl in Python .
Sure , python lets you do things yourself far easier and elegantly compared to perl .
And you also have modules in python and repositories similar to CPAN .
But I repeat .
There is no CPAN in any language other than perl .
What is the big deal about CPAN ?
CPAN is not just a repository of perl modules .
It is much more than that .
It is a cultural entity with a powerful backend for searching , mirroring and developing modules .
The sheer energy and commitment that goes into CPAN is phenomenal .
It is also grand testimony to the power of open source .
And it clearly shows how much people care about sharing the result of their toil with others .
You do n't have CPAN in python .
You do n't have it in C or any other language .
There may be free libraries in Java and C ++.
But as I said , it is not about the availability alone .
It is about the ecosystem built around it .
CPAN has everything and much more .
I think you are getting the drift of my article .
Perl is great not just because of its intrinsic features , syntax or semantics .
Perl is great because it brought about the CPAN culture .
CPAN modules help you quickly prototype or validate your business idea .
You can write anything from quantum physics to file modification with 10 lines of perl code with the right CPAN module .
At least for the sake of tapping into the power of code reuse and open source code sharing , please learn perl .
And get comfortable with CPAN .
You will never have reason to look back after that .

The Bush administration invaded Iraq in March 2003 with a force of approximately 130,000 troops .
Top White House and Pentagon officials like Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz were convinced that , by August , those troops , welcomed with open arms by the oppressed Iraqis , would be drawn down to 30,000 - 40,000 and housed in newly built , permanent military bases largely away from the country ’s urban areas .
This was to be part of what now is called a " strategic partnership " in the Middle East .
Almost five and a half years later , the United States still has approximately 130,000 troops in Iraq .
Top administration officials are now talking about " modestly accelerated " rates of troop withdrawal , if all goes well .
By August 2010 , the Obama administration expects to have only 30,000 - 50,000 troops housed mainly on American mega - bases largely away from urban areas , part of a special American / Iraqi strategic partnership in the region .
This passes for progress in Iraq .
A History of the Bicycle in Iraq
In imagistic terms , the Bush administration biked into Iraq .
Back in its salad days , when all was green and upbeat , its top officials loved the idea that they were training the eager Iraqi kid in how to ride the bike of democracy .
President George W. Bush liked to talk about the moment when we might take the " training wheels " off the Iraqi bike and let the little fella ride into the democratic sunset on his own .
His Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , ran with an allied image — the difficult moment when a parent has to decide whether to take that steadying hand off the bike seat and let the tyke pedal on his own .
" [ Y ] ou ’re running down the street , " as he put it in 2004 , " holding onto the back of the seat .
You know that if you take your hand off they could fall , so you take a finger off and then two fingers , and pretty soon you ’re just barely touching it . "
Some years later , after kid and parent had made it around one of those " corners " they were always turning — on the way to various " tipping points " in the Iraq War — and found themselves instead at the " precipice , " after Rumsfeld had , in fact , been asked to resign by his president , he wrote a final memo , the last of his famed " snowflakes , " to the White House , on " new options " in Iraq .
In it , he suggested : " Begin modest withdrawals of U.S. and Coalition forces ( start ‘ taking our hand off the bicycle seat ’ ) , so Iraqis know they have to pull up their socks , step up and take responsibility for their country . "
His tenure could qualify as the longest biking lesson in history and still , it seemed , the Iraqis could n’t do without that hand on the seat .
Even when his president followed him two years later , their imagery of choice remained behind .
This March , for instance , the chief American military spokesman in Iraq , Major General David G. Perkins , discussing a possible draw - down of American forces , said : " We need to take our hands off the handlebars , or the training wheels , at some point . "
And then , two weeks ago , Colonel Timothy R. Reese , an American adviser to the Iraqi military ’s Baghdad command , created a front - page New York Times stir when a memorandum he had written was leaked .
In a distinctly imagistic mode , he began : " As the old saying goes , ‘ Guests , like fish , begin to smell after three days . ’
Since the signing of the 2009 Security Agreement , we are guests in Iraq , and after six years in Iraq , we now smell bad to the Iraqi nose . "
While the official Obama - era target for an American withdrawal remains ( as it was in the last months of the Bush era ) the end of 2011 , Reese urged that all U.S. forces be pulled out on an expedited schedule by August 2010 — the moment by which , according to present plans , only American " combat brigades " are to be removed .
Resurrecting a Vietnam - era suggestion of Vermont Republican Senator George Aiken ( ignored then , as it will be now ) , he headlined his memo : " It ’s Time for the US to Declare Victory and Go Home . "
And there , in the midst of a generally scathing assessment of the deficiencies of the Iraqi military ( and the Iraqi government ) , was that bicycle again :
" The SA [ Bush - era Security Agreement between the U.S. and Iraq ] outlines a series of gradual steps towards military withdrawal , analogous to a father teaching his kid to ride a bike without training wheels …
We now have an Iraqi government that has gained its balance and thinks it knows how to ride the bike in the race .
And in fact they probably do know how to ride , at least well enough for the road they are on against their current competitors .
Our hand on the back of the seat is holding them back and causing resentment .
We need to let go before we both tumble to the ground . "
It just goes to show .
Under the pressure of war , images that wo n’t go away , like people , have the capacity to change .
The Iraqi child with the training wheels is now , according to Reese , old enough to enter an actual bike race .
Who exactly will bike out of Iraq under the Obama withdrawal plan , however , still remains to be defined .
After all , at the end of his memo , the most urgent call for withdrawal from Iraq yet to emerge from the higher levels of the U.S. military , Colonel Reese offers his version of a full - scale American withdrawal .
" During the withdrawal period , " he writes , " the USG [ United States government ] and GOI [ government of Iraq ] should develop a new strategic framework agreement that would include some lasting military presence at 1 - 3 large training bases , airbases , or key headquarters locations .
But it should not include the presence of any combat forces save those for force protection needs or the occasional exercise . "
And keep in mind : his proposal has , with rare exceptions , been rejected out of hand by all and sundry , in and out of the military high command and in Washington .
In other words , even the most Xtreme American biker of this moment still imagines us in Iraq forever and a day .
A History of Experts on Iraq
Once upon a time , the playing field , the stadium , and sports events were regularly compared to war , even considered suitable preparation for actual battle .
Ever since the First Gulf War , this has been reversed .
Now , war — or at least its coverage — is based on sports .
Just as , sooner or later , the smoothest players and savviest coaches depart the " field of battle " for the press box and the TV spotlight , for pre-game , game , and post - game commentary , so the commanders of the last war now leave the battlefield for the TV booth and offer us their expertise on the next war .
As former Houston Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy has had to discuss the decisions of his brother Stan , coach of the Orlando Magic , in ESPN playoff commentary , so the commanders of our previous wars cover next wars and their commanders , possibly even officers once under their own command .
We now live with the ESPN version of war , including slo - mo replays , and the logos , interactive charts , and fabulous graphics of the sports world .
And once anointed as experts , our John Maddens of war , like their sports counterparts , never go away .
Back in April 2008 , for instance , New York Times journalist David Barstow wrote a front - page exposé focused on the many retired military officers who had been hired as media consultants for the Iraq War .
As a group , they made up , he suggested , a " kind of media Trojan horse , " because most of them were marching to a carefully organized Pentagon campaign of disinformation on the war .
In addition , most of them had ties , not acknowledged on the air , " to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess . "
Barstow ’s piece concluded :
" To the public , these men are members of a familiar fraternity , presented tens of thousands of times on television and radio as ‘ military analysts ’ whose long service has equipped them to give authoritative and unfettered judgments about the most pressing issues of the post - Sept. 11 world .
Hidden behind that appearance of objectivity , though , is a Pentagon information apparatus that has used those analysts in a campaign to generate favorable news coverage of the administration ’s wartime performance . "
Barstow named names and made connections .
Those names included , for example , retired Air Force general and Fox News senior military analyst Thomas G. McInerney , retired Army general and NBC / MSNBC military analyst Montgomery Meigs , retired Army general and NBC / MSNBC military analyst Barry R. McCaffrey , and retired Marine Colonel and Fox News military analyst William V. Cowan .
After the exposé appeared , they seem to have just carried right on with their media duties .
Some of the print media has similarly adhered to the principle of once - an - expert - always - an - expert .
For instance , on the fifth anniversary of Bush ’s disastrous invasion of Iraq , the New York Times decided to ask a range of " experts on military and foreign affairs " to look back on that fiasco — and then rounded up the usual suspects .
Of the nine experts it came up with , six were intimately involved in that catastrophe either as drumbeaters for the invasion , instigators of it , or facilitators of the occupation that followed — Kenneth Pollack , Danielle Pletka , and Frederick Kagan ( enthusiasts all ) , Richard Perle ( aka " the prince of darkness " ) , L. Paul Bremer ( the administration ’s first viceroy in Baghdad ) , and General Paul D. Eaton ( who trained Iraqi troops in the early years of the occupation ) .
Notably absent was anyone who had seriously opposed the invasion .
The closest was Anne- Marie Slaughter , a " liberal hawk " who wrote a supportive New York Times op - ed on March 18 , 2003 , two days before the invasion began , headlined , " Good Reasons for Going Around the U.N . "
The Times anniversary spread appeared in March 2008 .
Jump ahead a year - plus and the Times once again launched what undoubtedly was a mighty search for experts who might consider Colonel Reese ’s suggestion that we take our hand off that Iraqi bike — and came up with a typical crew of seven :
One , retired Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl , is president of the Center for a New American Security , and was an advisor to General David Petraeus , former top U.S. commander in Iraq , now Centcom commander overseeing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A second , Stephen Biddle , senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations , was also an advisor to Petraeus and most recently on the " team " that advised General Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan under Petraeus , in his recent review of Afghan War strategy .
A third , Anthony Cordesman , Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , was on the same McChrystal team .
A fourth , Thomas Ricks , former Washington
Post military reporter and now senior fellow at Nagl ’s Center , is the author of the bestselling book The Gamble , a highly complimentary account of Petraeus ’s role in Iraq in which Nagl is , of course , a figure .
( Ricks , by the way , has long made it clear that he believes we will be in that country for years to come . )
A fifth , Kori Schake , now at the Hoover Institution , was a former national security adviser on defense issues to President George W. Bush .
A sixth , Jonathan Morgenstein , is a senior national security policy fellow at Third Way , another Washington think tank , and just recently returned from Iraq where " he was a military transition team adviser to the Iraqi Army . "
Not surprisingly , all six of these experts , with the most modest of caveats , dismissed Reese ’s suggestion out of hand ( " The pace of progress in Iraq will be slow , but we ca n’t throw up our hands and walk away … " ) , agreeing that it was in no one ’s interest to expedite an American departure .
Only a seventh expert , author and retired Colonel Douglas Macgregor , agreed with Reese .
Consider that a little history of expertise about our recent wars .
There ’s a corollary .
If you ’re not anointed an expert , you ’re never likely to be .
Among those automatically disqualified for expertise on Iraq : just about anyone who bluntly rejected the idea of invading Iraq or predicted any version of the catastrophe that ensued before it happened .
Disqualified above all are any of those antiwar types who actually took to the streets of American cities by the hundreds of thousands before the invasion to raise homemade placards to its un-wisdom .
They obviously knew nothing .
Their very stance indicated a bias that evidently disqualified them on the spot .
Someone — I ca n’t claim to remember who — once made the point that within any administration you could afford to be a hawk and be wrong , just not a dove and right .
When it comes to TV war commentators , that seems to hold true as well .
It would , of course , be possible to imagine the antiwar equivalent of those generals - as - analysts .
From the ranks of the last antiwar movement ( all still active anti-warriors ) , you could , for example , choose Tom Hayden , Daniel Ellsberg , and Howard Zinn to offer commentary on our ongoing wars .
Only you know as well as I do that that fantasy will never turn into media reality .
In our world of expertise , it ’s unthinkable .
A History of the Iraqi Air Force
Recently , while Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was visiting Iraq , the top American commander in that country , General Ray Odierno , indicated that the Iraqis would not be able to defend their own airspace for the foreseeable future .
Essentially , they have no air force — or rather , at this point they have helicopters , C - 130 transports , and some smaller Cesna trainers and the like , but no jet fighters .
Despite the fact that a U.S. Air Force " assessment team " is being rushed to Baghdad to look for " some creative solutions " to the problem , it ’s clear that the Iraqi air force will remain the U.S. Air Force for some time to come ( which undoubtedly means manning the giant U.S. airbase built at Balad as well ) .
The Iraqis now want American F - 16s .
Unfortunately , according to New York Times reporter Elisabeth Bumiller , General Odierno pointed out a sad truth : " it would be impossible to build and deliver them by the end of 2011 , even if the Iraqis were able to afford them . "
And do n’t forget this : Iraq has no trained pilots to fly them either !
Sigh… much work remains on the horizon for the U.S.A.F .
Fortunately , Aviation Week reported in April that the Iraqis have a plan to overcome their problem .
It ’s a " three - phase , 11 - year improvement plan " that will move their air force from T - 6 trainers to a few dozen F - 16s by " the middle of the next decade " ( in case you were wondering just how long the U.S.A.F. is likely to be filling in ) .
Here , then , is the true tragedy of our moment .
We want to leave Iraq .
Maybe not as quickly as Colonel Reese would like , but really we do .
President Obama has made that clear .
Unfortunately , the Iraqis just wo n’t let us .
Imagine !
They were n’t even thinking about an air force until recently — and what would a country in the Middle East be if , as Bumiller points out , it had " no way to intercept another jet that invades the country ’s airspace . "
Just who might invade Iraqi airspace remains a subject for speculation :
The Israelis on their way to bomb Iran ?
( Not likely the U.S.A.F. would start shooting those planes down . )
The Iranians on their way to bomb … ?
Well , who ?
After all , the present government in Iraq is essentially an ally of Iran .
The Turks ?
Not really an issue when you think about it .
Their planes have been invading Iraqi airspace for a while to attack Kurdish rebels and the U.S.A.F. has n’t exactly been shooting them down either .
Since it ’s so easy to obliterate the past , just for a moment let ’s recall the history of the Iraqi air force .
Now that Iraq essentially has no air force , who remembers that Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq once had a very large and active one — up to 950 planes in the 1980s .
In 1990 , according to the website GlobalSecurity.org , it still had the sixth largest air force in the world , and plenty of trained pilots to go with it .
During the First Gulf War , nearly half of that air force fled to neighboring Iran ( on which Iraqi planes had dropped more than their share of bombs and even poison gas in the 1980s ) .
Those planes were never returned .
Of the relatively small force that remained , many were destroyed in the First Gulf War and some of the rest , at Saddam ’s orders , were buried in the desert as the invasion of 2003 began .
The history that ’s really been forgotten , though , is even more recent .
Put in a nutshell , the Iraqis do n’t have an air force because Washington did n’t want them to .
Much attention has been paid to the Bush administration ’s lack of planning for the occupation of Iraq , but relatively little to what it did plan .
Let ’s start with the fact that , in May 2003 , L. Paul Bremer ’s Coalition Provisional Authority in a burst of blind pride disbanded the Iraqi Army .
Pentagon plans for rebuilding it called for a future , border - patrolling Iraqi military ( lite ) of perhaps 40,000 men with minimal armaments and no air force to speak of .
In the Middle East , this had only one meaning : from a series of newly built mega - bases already on Pentagon drawing boards as American troops crossed the Kuwaiti border in 2003 , the U.S. Army and Air Force would fill in as the real Iraqi military for eons to come .
Under the pressure of a fierce Sunni insurgency , the army part of that plan was soon jettisoned .
But " standing up " the Iraqi military —
" As Iraqis stand up , we will stand down , " was long President Bush ’s mantra — has meant just that : two feet on the ground .
Until relatively recently , the Iraqis were functionally not permitted to take to the skies .
Now , the lack of that air force will surely come to the fore as an excuse for why any American " withdrawal " will have to have caveats and qualifications — and why , if ours proves to be a non-withdrawal withdrawal , it will be their fault .
A History of Devastation in Iraq
Until the U.S. arrived in Baghdad , things seemed bad enough .
There was Saddam Hussein , the megalomanic dictator — he of the endless Disney - esque palaces and giant sculpted hands — with his secret prisons , torture chambers , and helicopter gunships .
There were the international sanctions strangling the country .
There were the mass graves in the north and the south .
There was an oil industry held together by scotch tape and ingenuity .
It was a gruesome enough mess .
That was before the invasion to " liberate " the country .
Since then hundreds of thousands , possibly a million or more Iraqis have died ( depending on whose figures and studies you believe ) .
Saddam ’s killing fields have been dwarfed by a fierce set of destructive American military operations as well as insurgencies - cum - civil - wars - cum - terrorist - acts ; major cities have been largely or partially destroyed , or ethnically cleansed ; millions of Iraqis have been forced from their homes , becoming internal refugees or going into exile ; untold numbers of Iraqis have been imprisoned , assassinated , tortured or abused ; and the country ’s cultural heritage has been ransacked .
Basic services — electricity , water , food — were terribly impaired and the economy , in the process of being privatized by the neocon overseers of the occupation , was simply wrecked .
Health services were crippled .
Oil production , upon which Iraq now depends for up to 90 % of its government funds , has only relatively recently surpassed the worst levels of the Saddam era .
Iraq , in other words , has been devastated .
The American invasion and the occupation that followed acted like whirlwinds of destruction , unraveling a land already bursting with problems and potential animosities .
What men begin , the gods end .
If such a saying does n’t exist , it should , since the American catastrophe now seems to be morphing into an unparalleled natural disaster as well .
In what once was the breadbasket of civilization , Iraqi agriculture , ignored by the occupiers , is withering and the country is desertifying at a frightening pace under the pressure of a several - year - old drought .
So fierce is the process that , according to Liz Sly of the Los Angeles Times , who has written an apocalyptic account of all this , the country received only 20 % of its normal rainfall in 2008 , and so far in 2009 but half the usual amount .
Rivers are drying up , wells are disappearing , and desperate Iraqi farmers are deserting the land for the city ( where unemployment rates remain high ) .
Everywhere dust gathers , awaiting the winds which create the monstrous duststorms that carry the precious land of Iraq into the fragile lungs of urban Iraqis .
" Now , " writes Sly , " the Agriculture Ministry estimates that 90 % of [ Iraq ’s ] land is either desert or suffering from severe desertification , and that the remaining arable land is being eroded at the rate of 5 % a year . "
Expecting the worst harvest in a decade and with the wheat crop at 40 % of normal , the government has been forced to buy enormous amounts of grain abroad at a time when oil prices , dropping precipitously from 2008 highs , left it with far less money available .
However overused the image may be , the Bush administration created the perfect storm in Iraq , a " mission accomplished " version of hell on Earth .
And it ’s because Iraq is in such desperate shape that , of course , we , as the protectors of its fragile " stability , " ca n’t leave .
A History of Justifications
When we invaded Iraq , serial justifications were offered .
There was the grim dictator to rid the world of .
There were his killing fields .
( Never again ! )
There was 9/11 and his " support for terrorism . "
( Top Bush administration officials long claimed a link between Saddam and al - Qaeda , despite convincing evidence to the contrary . )
There was liberation for the Shiites and the ending of what Wolfowitz called " criminal treatment of the Iraqi people . "
There was the reestablishment of an American version of order in the region .
There were those heavily emphasized , if nonexistent , weapons of mass destruction the dictator supposedly had squirreled away , as well as his ( also nonexistent ) program to get his hands on a nuclear weapon .
( As Wolfowitz put it in May 2003 : " The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason … " )
Later , when things began to take a turn for the worse and another reason was needed , there was the propagation of democracy ( a great guiding principle to which the Bush administration arrived rather late in Iraq and only under pressure from Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani ) .
Even later , when things were going far worse , there was the idea that it was far better to fight the terrorists over there than here .
And , of course , as the president liked to confide to foreign leaders , there was God Himself commanding him to strike Saddam and so thwart Gog and Magog .
Among the cognoscenti , of course , there were other expectations and justifications , caught best perhaps in the neoconservative quip of 2003 , " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran . "
After all , the neocons in and around the Bush administration truly did believe that a Pax Americana in what they liked to call " the Greater Middle East " was within their shock - and - awe grasp , and possibly even a global version of the same .
As for oil — or what President Bush referred to , on the rare occasion when he mentioned it , as Iraq ’s " patrimony " — mum was the word , even though that country had the world ’s third largest proven petroleum reserves and sat strategically at the heart of the energy heartlands of the planet .
Now , with those 130,000 troops still there , not to speak of the scads of rent - a - guns and private contractors , with that overstuffed , overstaffed embassy the size of the Vatican built for 1,000 " diplomats , " with that series of major bases ( which the Pentagon used to call , charmingly enough , " enduring camps " ) still well - occupied , with significant numbers of Iraqis and small numbers of Americans dying each month , with millions of Iraqis still internal or external refugees , with the land devastated , and basic services hardly restored , with ethnic tensions still running high , and a government quietly allied to Iran in place in Baghdad backed by a 250,000 - man military , with an American withdrawal still officially years off , and " withdrawal " itself a matter of definition , no one even bothers to offer the slightest justification for being in Iraq .
After all , why would explanations be necessary when we ’re getting ready to leave ?
If you do n’t believe me , go hunting for an official explanation today .
Why are we in Iraq ?
Because we ’re there .
Because the Iraqis need us .
Because something terrible would happen if we left precipitously .
So we still occupy Iraq and no one even asks why .
A History of Withdrawal from Iraq
There is no history of withdrawal from Iraq .

( CNN ) --
A suspect has been arrested in the 1990 abduction and attempted murder of an 8 - year - old Texas girl , a spokeswoman for the FBI 's Houston , Texas , office said .
Jennifer Schuett speaks at a news conference , urging other victims of violent crime to use their voices .
The victim , Jennifer Schuett , is now 27 .
She recently shared her story with CNN in hopes of someday bringing her attacker to justice .
Schuett fought tears as she spoke at a news conference in Dickinson , Texas .
" This event in my life was a tragic one , " she said .
" But today , 19 years later , I stand here and want you all to know that I am OK .
I am not a victim , but instead , victorious . "
Watch Schuett 's teary remarks »
She continued , " I hope that my case will remain as a reminder to all victims of violent crime to never give up hope ...
With determination and by using your voice to speak out , you are capable of anything . "
Dennis Earl Bradford , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested at 6:50 a.m. Tuesday in Little Rock , Arkansas , authorities said .
He was on his way to work , and his wife was in the car with him .
DNA and other forensic testing led to him , authorities said .
His DNA profile was in the FBI database due to a 1996 arrest in Arkansas .
Watch police announce the arrest »
Schuett was abducted from her bedroom , raped and left for dead August 10,1990 .
She spoke with CNN two weeks ago .
CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults .
But Schuett decided to go public with her story -- and her name -- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker .
" It 's not about me anymore , " she told CNN in September .
" It 's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night .
I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt .
You have to fight back . "
" I remember everything ; I 've always wanted to remember everything so I can find the person that did this , " Schuett said .
" If I had blocked this out of my memory , the investigation would n't have come this far .
I 'm a fighter . "
Schuett says she was alone in her bed when a man crept in through a window .
She remembers waking up in a stranger 's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot .
She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family .
He drove her through the streets of Dickinson , Texas , pulling into a mechanic 's shop next to her elementary school .
" Watch the moon .
The moon will change colors , and that is when your mom will come to get you , " she recalled him saying .
" Oh , it looks like she is not coming . "
Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and sexually assaulted her .
She passed out .
When she regained consciousness , she was lying naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear , and her voice box torn .
She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day after lying in the field for nearly 12 hours .
She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition .
" Three days after the attack , I started giving a description .
The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again , but I proved them all wrong , " Schuett said .
She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story .
Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case , along with Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie .
Read the affidavit
Both men were discussing the case when Rennison received a memo from the FBI 's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment ( CARD ) team seeking child abduction cases that had gone cold and could be retested for DNA evidence .
Schuett 's was one of the cases selected .
Rennison , who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases , said he has never seen a case like Schuett's .
" This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived , " he said , " The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive .
In cases of child abduction , it is rare that the child is recovered alive .
Frequently , you recover a body .
And most times , you never find them . "
The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago , which was retested .
It included the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing , as well as a man 's underwear and T - shirt , which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead .
The clothes were tested in 1990 , but the sample was n't large enough for conclusive results .
But now , modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell .
They were still awaiting the results when CNN featured Schuett 's story in late September .

Let 's see ---
Sanchez says he covered the " thousands " who protested the war .
Slight understatement there , no ?
Or maybe that 's how he does n't " promote " it .
* sigh *
But yeah , nice smackdown of Fox .

Right .
Sigh .
This is not a victory , you guys .
Fox just totally conned Sanchez into re-airing a full 5:13 more minutes of full coverage of their Stupid - Con , Fiction - Fest , Loony - Baloney , 9/12 hooey .
I 'm sure Fox is thrilled .
Great investment when a full page ad in the Washington Post yields five times it 's return in eyeballs exposed by sucking up all the oxygen on every other network .
And then ( FREE BONUS ! ) watch it subsequently trickle - piss it 's way down to the best blogs on the internet at no additional charge .
( Great new model for the new media paradigm , everyone . )
And all it took were ginormous sums of money and a little twist of Sanchez ' little - bitty ego - testicles - apparently it 's just that easy to get your main competetor to air your bullshit propaganda in full .
Of that entire 6:42 minute CNN " rebuttal " only 1:20 of it was Sanchez actually telling Fox off .
( Tho ' yes , ' twould be Heaven most Pure to see Obama / Congress buck up and shut them up for even half that long . )
I see this as another way Dems are self - defeating , another noteworthy broken spoke in our collective failure to fight this teabagger bullshit effectively .
Something I do n't see being discussed anywhere : why are we using our hard - won microphones to do nothing but amplify their crazy ?
And what are some alternatives ?
As for the Dems , I am no longer surprised by their willful intent to forfeit .
What I wonder now , mostly , is how much longer they 'll mount the effort to pretend to try ?
The 2 party country our Farfurthers gave their wealth and sacred honor to defend - the socialist ball - less ball - licking billionaires , and the riot - inciting , race - bating paranoid fringe billionaires .
( Brad : very much looking forward to your Acorn piece .
I am most sincerely devastated by this disgusting turn of human tide .
The other day in Westwood I was mortified to see a graffitied street sign spray - painted on an city cable box with even , stenciled font across the bottom that read : " ACORN FREE PROSTITUTION ZONE " or something to that effect .
Holy ...!
Does FreedomWorks have goons in the OC that have ACORN stencils at the ready for this shit and drive to liberal university enclaves at night prepared to deface city property with their corporate propaganda ?
My heart is braking for what Acorn is facing . )

Has CNN exposed the background of the " players " in the ACORN video and the subsequent " players " who gave them the media vehicle to megaphone it ?
Media Matters ( not CNN / Rick Sanchez ) : Still , the story at this point really has a lot more to do with Fox News and conservative media activism than with ACORN .
The undercover videos first appeared on BigGovernment.com , founded by Andrew Breitbart , a protégé of Matt Drudge and a conservative with a long record of highly partisan and inflammatory statements .
Giles , daughter of conservative blogger Doug Giles , attended the National Journalism Center in Washington , one of the many right - wing institutions conservatives have established to flood the field with young , motivated , and rabidly partisan " reporters . "
For his part , O'Keefe has been a far - right activist since college .
Breitbart has developed a direct line to Glenn Beck , and so it was n't long before the videos were being presented breathlessly on his TV and radio programs .
This week , following his 9/12 rally , Beck escalated the attacks over ACORN .
Including false claims such as : - the conservative pimp was n't thrown out of any offices
- an ACORN employee murdered her husband http://mediamatters.org/columns/200909180055
Where 's the great Rick Sanchez and CNN on those investigative stories ?
The people above are right : it just gave the teabaggers even MORE publicity .

For CNN to call out Fox News for lies is the equivalent of the pot calling the kettle black .
Fox , CNN and their ilk are engaged in a far more effective method of news reporting than merely lying about it .
Not reporting news which does not fit their agenda allows them to ignore facts without mentioning them .
This is more useful and comfortable for them than the outright lie because , when one lies , there is always the possibility of being discovered and called out on it which means that the liar then has to concoct an explanation as to why the lie occurred .

It blows my mind how many people think Fox News is real news .
MSNBC leans a bit left , Fox News leans way to the right .
CNN seems to be the closest to political neutral largely because , in my opinion , they seem to want to avoid in depth reporting if it steps on the toes of what Fox is " promoting " .
Fox is fascist , right wing propaganda .
Fascism by definition is extreme reactionary right wing politics .
Fox is in the bash Democrats , liberals , Acorn , and Obama , and anything that 's progressive and liberal business .
That may be your politics , and that 's OK , it 's a free country and right wingers may have some points on some issues , but you 're not fooling anyone if you 're going to try to pass Fox 's constant " promotional " right wing propaganda off as " fair and balanced " .
Yeah , right ... That 's like saying only right wingers who support right wing politics and who vote for right wing Republicans are true Americans ..
Democrats and anyone who does n't agree with you , Bush , Sarah Palin , Gingrich , Beck , Hannity , etc. should be kicked out of the country for being communist leftists .
People should only be taught creationism , and most of what people learn in college about history should be rewritten to make sure everything America has done in the past is written in the best light possible so people do n't get " leftist " ideas from studying history .
Ignorance is bliss , ai n't it .. Wave the flag , beat up leftists , war against anything you 're told is unAmerican .
You 're right , right , Right ?..

Israel is accused of bombing civilian buildings without military necessity The Palestinians have urged the UN to act to punish Israel for its offensive in the Gaza Strip last winter .
The move reverses a Palestinian decision to defer action on a UN report that accuses both Israel and Hamas of war crimes during the conflict .
Israel rejected the report as biased during a UN Security Council debate .
Meanwhile , UN chief Ban Ki-moon urged " credible " investigations by Israel and the Palestinians into allegations of war crimes during the conflict .
Palestinian U - turn
" The world has for too long witnessed Israel 's impunity , knowing well that this has been repeatedly fuelled by the lack of punishment and accountability , " Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al - Malki said during a Security Council debate on the Middle East on Wednesday .
UN condemns ' war crimes ' in Gaza Israel condemns UN Gaza report Key excerpts : UN Gaza report " The tragic consequences have been suffered by generations ...
We must break this obscene cycle , " the minister added .
Mr Malki's comments represent a sharp policy reversal , says the BBC's Barbara Plett at UN headquarters in New York .
Under US pressure , the Palestinians had earlier agreed to defer action on the UN report by veteran South African judge and war crimes prosecutor Richard Goldstone , but that led to a public outcry , our correspondent says .
Meanwhile , Israel 's envoy to the UN , Gabriela Shalev , said the UN report was biased and favoured terrorism .
" For those of us who seek to resume the peace process in the Middle East , debating the Goldstone in the Security Council is but a tale full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .
" If Israel is asked to take further risks for peace , the international community must recognise our right to self - defence , " Ms Shalev said .
The Americans also said the report had an unbalanced focus on Israel , and opposed it being taken up by the Security Council , our correspondent says .
Separately , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged " credible " investigations by both sides into the conduct of the Gaza conflict " without delay " .
" He [ Mr Ban ] hopes that such steps will be taken wherever there are credible allegations of human rights abuses throughout the world , " UN Undersecretary General Lynn Pascoe told the Security Council .
Libya , a rotating member of the 15 - seat Council , had been seeking a special session of the UN 's top decision - making body to discuss the report , but agreed to bringing the monthly session on the Middle East ahead by one week .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is seeking a special session of the UN Human Rights Council to vote on the report .
Report 's findings
The Goldstone report accuses Israel of using disproportionate force and deliberately harming civilians during the 22 - day conflict which began on 27 December 2008 .
Hamas militants are accused of indiscriminate rocket fire at Israeli civilians .
The report urges the Security Council to refer allegations to the International Criminal Court if either side failed to investigate and prosecute suspects .
Israel has rejected the evidence , saying it has already investigated its troops ' conduct , clearing most of the subjects of wrongdoing .
Hamas also denied committing war crimes .
Israeli military action destroyed thousands of homes , hundreds of factories and 80 official buildings in Gaza .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 people were killed in the violence between 27 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 , more than half of them civilians .
Israel puts the number of deaths at 1,166 - fewer than 300 of them civilians .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .

Climate change will be the focus of international talks in Copenhagen Japan 's next leader has promised a big cut in greenhouse gas emissions , saying he will aim for a 25 % reduction by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
Democratic Party leader Yukio Hatoyama is due to take over as prime minister on 16 September , after a resounding election victory in August .
His predecessor , Taro Aso , had pledged cuts of only 8 % .
Mr Hatoyama said the plan was dependent on other nations agreeing targets at December 's climate talks in Copenhagen .
ANALYSIS Richard Black , BBC environment correspondent Mr Hatoyama 's target puts Japan alongside the EU in pledging substantial greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 .
Japan 's plan is conditional on achieving a deal at the UN summit in December , so it presents an additional " carrot " to negotiators ; the new Japanese leadership has not spelled out what will happen if a deal is not reached .
The ambitious target amounts to an emissions cut of about one - third from current levels in just 11 years , in a country that already uses energy efficiently .
The new government now has some serious thinking to do about how to turn rhetoric into reality .
Blog : Hatoyama 's golden carrot Analysts say the targets - announced by Mr Hatoyama at a climate change symposium in Tokyo on Monday - are more ambitious than those of many other industrialised nations .
They won praise from the climate change chief of the UN , which is recommending developed countries commit to a 25 - 40 % reduction by 2020 .
" With such a target , Japan will take on the leadership role that industrialised countries have agreed to take in climate change abatement , " Yvo de Boer , head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat , told the conference .
Japan is the world 's second - largest economy and fifth - largest emitter of greenhouse gases , which are a major contributor to climate change .
Correspondents say some Japanese business groups , including parts of the automotive industry , are expected to lobby against the plans .
The head of business lobby Keizai Doyukai ( Japan Association of Corporate Executives ) told the climate symposium the new government needed to spell out the policies in more detail .
We think developing countries are also required to make an effort to reduce greenhouse gases
Yukio Hatoyama
Japan's Prime Minister - elect
Japan 's break with the past Send us your comments " We basically welcome [ the target ] , but we want to ask what policies and steps will be taken to achieve this 25 % target , " Masamitsu Sakurai told the forum , according to Reuters news agency .
Japan 's new government envisages the plans will be achieved by bringing in emissions trading , renovating housing , subsidising solar panels and introducing low - energy technologies in cars .
Without mentioning China or India by name , Mr Hatoyama said : " We think developing countries are also required to make an effort to reduce greenhouse gases , as a global effort is needed on the issue of climate change , " reports AFP news agency .
December 's UN - backed climate talks in Copenhagen in Denmark will try to work out a deal on reducing emissions to succeed the current Kyoto Protocol , the first phase of which ends in 2012 .
Japan has been under pressure to introduce tougher policies on climate change after its emissions rose last year to 16 % above the Kyoto target , which it played a leading role in agreeing in 1997 .

The Obama ‘ Thesis ’ Hoax
Created : October 23 , 2009 16:03 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
If you did n’t listen to Rush Limbaugh ’s radio show today , you missed the news that an obscure blogger had gotten his hands on ten pages of Barack Obama ’s college thesis , thanks to Joe Klein of Time magazine .
Michael Ledeen had jumped on the news , publishing an excerpt that revealed how the president had “ doubts ” about the “ so - called founders . ”
And Limbaugh ran with it .
The problem :
It was a hoax , actually marked as a satire , as Klein blogged earlier today .
Ledeen apologized .
[ H ]e got me , and lots of others .
It worked because it ’s plausible .
Here ’s some of what Ledeen and Limbaugh considered plausible :
The subject of this paper , which totaled 44 pages , was American government .
Entitled , this paper chronicled the long struggle of the working class against , as Obama put it , “ plutocratic thugs with one hand on the money and the other on the government . ”
In the paper , in which only the first ten pages were given to the general media , Obama decries the plight of the poor : “ I see poverty in every place I walk .
In Los Angeles and New York , the poor reach to me with bleary eyes and all I can do is sigh . ”
Without spending too much more time on this , it seems a piece of the persistent rumors that , surely , the young Barack Obama must have relied on smarter white radicals to write his first memoir .
UPDATE : Via Media Matters , I see that Limbaugh discovered the hoax midway through the show , and used what used to be known as the “ fake but accurate ” defense .
Looks :
This is the first Bertolli meal I ’ve had that did n’t look almost exactly like its packaging .
The noodles are off - color ( if they were a movie , they ’d be rated PG - 13 … ba dum bum ) , and the chicken and mushroom pieces shown on the bag are most definitely not that size .
2.5 out of 5
Taste :
Although it does n’t look as expected , it tastes fantastic .
I used to call the Bertolli Chicken Florentine & Farfalle my favorite Bertolli meal , but my wife and I both agree that this dish tops it .
The noodles have just the right amount of bite and texture , and the sauce is a nice light alfredo ( admittedly , our favorite kind of sauce ) .
The chicken is most , as Bertolli always manages .
( You might be thinking , “ Man , this guy is in love with Bertolli . ”
You would not be incorrect to think this . )
I cannot think of enough things to say in praise of this meal .

The National Debt Clock displays the U.S. National Debt in New York , August 24 , 2009 .

Dems seek cover to boost debt limit
The Senate must soon increase the national debt limit to above $ 13 trillion — and Democrats are looking for political cover .
Knowing they will face unyielding GOP attacks for voting to increase the eye - popping debt , Democrats are considering attaching a debt increase provision to a must - pass bill , possibly the Defense Department spending bill , according to Democratic and Republican sources .
Advertisement
Adding it to the defense bill would allow Democrats to argue that they voted for the measure to help troops in harm ’s way — and downplay that their vote also expanded the limit for how much money the country can borrow .
The strategy has not yet been finalized , aides and senators said .
The House already approved a debt limit increase of $ 925 billion — above the $ 12.1 trillion ceiling Congress approved as part of the economic stimulus package last February — but Democrats may seek to increase the limit further so they do n’t have to revisit the politically treacherous issue until after the 2010 midterm elections .
As of Tuesday , the debt stood at $ 11.95 trillion , staring at senators amid a roiling health care debate in which critics have seized on the potential costs of the overhaul .
Unlike those of the House , the Senate ’s rules do not allow it to automatically increase the debt with its adoption of the annual budget resolution .
That puts senators in a tough position politically .
And if the Senate balks at the increase , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has warned that the slow economic recovery could collapse , as investors around the world would sharply lose confidence in America ’s abilities to meet its credit obligations .
“ This president inherited , in some ways , an economic fiasco , ” said conservative Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana .
“ It ’s not going to be a pleasant vote , but it may be necessary until we can get back on track . ”
Indeed , Democrats are quick to point out that President George W. Bush left President Barack Obama with a $ 10.6 trillion debt — and that the debt limit was increased seven times in the Republican ’s eight years in the White House .
But now Democrats are in charge of Congress and the White House ; and the Treasury Department reported last week that the annual deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 stood at a record $ 1.4 trillion , with that number likely to balloon under Obama ’s policies .
With the debt limit about to be eclipsed , Republicans are eager to force Democrats to find the votes to increase it among themselves , putting the majority party in a lose - lose situation and searching for a way to minimize public backlash .
“ Regardless of the political treachery , I ’m more worried about the economic treachery and the monetary aspects of it with devaluing the dollar , ” said Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb . ) .
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) and the committee ’s ranking member , Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , both told POLITICO that appropriators may add the language to must - pass spending legislation .
Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , whose committee is in charge of the debt increase , said “ oh yeah , it ’s a possibility ” of adding the debt - ceiling increase to the spending legislation .
“ I care less how it ’s done so long as it is done , ” Baucus said .
And Conrad said he wants any debt increase to be coupled with language that would create a “ comprehensive ” process to force Congress to begin making tough choices to cut the debt — something akin to legislation he and Gregg proposed that would establish a commission to study ways to cut the deficit , whose recommendations would be fast - tracked through Congress .
Sen .
Evan Bayh of Indiana , a centrist Democrat , said he would n’t support an increase in the debt limit “ unless there ’s some mechanism to start getting the deficit under control . ”
Bayh and nine other Democrats sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) last week that called on Congress to approve a “ special process ” to control the deficit — warning that adding trillions more dollars to the country ’s credit card could force a sharp rise in interest rates and cause the price of goods and services to decline while limiting the country ’s ability to act on a range of pressing issues .
But if that language is attached to a stand - alone bill to increase the debt limit , the House would be forced to vote on the amended version — a vote that House Democratic leaders are eager to avoid .
Folding a method to control the deficit — with an increase in the debt limit — into a much larger bill seems to be a more politically palatable solution , several aides said .
“ Sen .
Reid agrees about the importance of dealing with our long - term fiscal challenges and has been talking with Sen.
Conrad , the administration and others in the Democratic leadership about the best way to proceed , ” said Jim Manley , senior communications adviser to Reid .
“ Those discussions are ongoing , and the administration is evaluating what they may want to recommend . ”
Republicans are keenly aware that Democrats may try legislative maneuvering to avoid political fallout , with one senior GOP aide saying the defense appropriations route was under “ active consideration . ”
Three Republicans — Reps. Jerry Lewis and Buck McKeon of California and Rep. Bill Young of Florida — sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey ( D - Wis. ) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . )
Wednesday asking Democrats to keep the defense bill clean of extraneous items , including the D.C. Voting Rights Act and an increase in the national debt limit .
A spokesman for Obey , Ellis Brachman , said he “ could n’t speculate on what will be in the final defense appropriations package , ” which is awaiting action by a House - Senate conference committee .
Rob Blumenthal , a spokesman for Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) , declined to comment .
Since conference reports cannot be amended , the GOP would n’t be able to offer amendments to a debt ceiling increase if it ’s added to the defense bill .
And GOP Senate leaders — who expect their 40 members to unite against the debt limit increase and force Democrats to find the necessary 60 votes on their own — are eager to have a protracted amendment process on the floor .
“ My guess is that we will try to offer some amendments to [ the increase ] because I think it ’ll be a good opportunity for us to have a debate on spending and borrowing , and that ’s obviously a debate that we want to engage in , ” said Sen .
John Thune ( R - S.D. ) , No. 4 in the GOP leadership .
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , the Senate ’s biggest swing vote , said she was uncertain how she ’d vote on a debt limit increase .
“ You absolutely have to make government run , ” she said , “ but I have to look at it . ”

President Obama said this week that his health care plan wo n’t cover illegal immigrants , but argued that ’s all the more reason to legalize them and ensure they eventually do get coverage .
He also staked out a position that anyone in the country legally should be covered - a major break with the 1996 welfare reform bill , which limited most federal public assistance programs only to citizens and longtime immigrants .
“ Even though I do not believe we can extend coverage to those who are here illegally , I also do n’t simply believe we can simply ignore the fact that our immigration system is broken , ” Mr. Obama said Wednesday evening in a speech to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute .
“ That ’s why I strongly support making sure folks who are here legally have access to affordable , quality health insurance under this plan , just like everybody else .
Mr. Obama added , “ If anything , this debate underscores the necessity of passing comprehensive immigration reform and resolving the issue of 12 million undocumented people living and working in this country once and for all . ”
Republicans said that amounts to an amnesty , calling it a backdoor effort to make sure current illegal immigrants get health care .

“ It is ironic that the president told the American people that illegal immigrants should not be covered by the health care bill , but now just days later he ’s talking about letting them in the back door , ” said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee .
“ If the American people do not want to provide government health care for illegal immigrants , why would they support giving them citizenship , the highest honor America can bestow ? ” Mr. Smith said .
But immigrant rights groups see the speech as a signal that Mr. Obama is committed to providing health care coverage for anyone in the United States legally , regardless of their citizenship status .
“ It ’s the first time I ’ve certainly heard , publicly , him talking more about legal immigrants , ” said Eric Rodriguez , vice president for research and advocacy at the National Council of La Raza ( NCLR ) .
“ I think that was certainly positive progress .
We were absolutely concerned about not hearing that . ”
On Wednesday , hours before Mr. Obama ’s speech , the NCLR had given the administration a public scolding , demanding that Mr. Obama needed to make “ a public commitment … to ensure that those who are here legally are covered . ”
A White House spokesman did not respond to questions about where the White House would make the cutoff for eligibility , and Mr. Rodriguez said he ’s still waiting for an answer from the administration .
“ We do n’t know where they mean to draw the line , ” he said .
“ Our biggest concern is that most people do n’t realize legal immigrants are currently barred from receiving health care benefits for the first five years in the country . ”
Under the 1996 welfare overhaul , most federal aid programs are restricted to citizens and legal immigrants who have been in the country for at least five years .
Democrats have tried this year to chip away at that rule .
Immigration has dogged Mr. Obama in the health care debate .
Rep. Joe Wilson , South Carolina Republican , shouted , “ You lie , ” when the president , in an address to Congress last week , said his plans would n’t cover illegal immigrants .
Lawmakers - who got an earful from constituents back home during August - have insisted on extra checks to make sure illegal immigrants do not have access to taxpayer - funded programs .
Senators have worked on language that would prevent illegal immigrants from buying insurance through a proposed insurance exchange envisioned in the health care reform package .
But the NCLR said that could lead to situations where some members of a family would be covered and others , including children of illegal immigrants , would n’t be .
Mr. Obama said legalizing illegal immigrants is a way to take the sting out of the entire issue .
But Republicans said by pushing to legalize illegal immigrants , Mr. Obama is signaling that those here illegally eventually will get access to taxpayer - funded benefits .
Still , the push to pass a legalization bill is beginning to gain steam , even as advocates fret that the White House is moving too slowly .
On Thursday , Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez , Illinois Democrat and an outspoken advocate for legalization , agreed to take leadership in writing a new , more generous bill .
“ We simply cannot wait any longer for a bill that keeps our families together , protects our workers and allows a pathway to legalization for those who have earned it , ” Mr. Gutierrez said .
“ Saying immigration is a priority for this administration or this Congress is not the same as seeing tangible action , and the longer we wait , the more every single piece of legislation we debate will be obstructed by our failure to pass comprehensive reform . ”

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australia ’s Great Barrier
Reef , the world ’s largest living organism , is under grave threat from climate warming and coastal development , and its prospects of survival are “ poor , ” a major new report found on Wednesday .

While the World Heritage - protected site , which sprawls for more than 345,000 square km ( 133,000 sq miles ) off Australia ’s east coast , is in a better position than most other reefs globally , the risk of its destruction was mounting .
“ Even with the recent management initiatives to improve resilience , the overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is poor and catastrophic damage to the ecosystem may not be averted , ” a government reef management body said in the report .
The five - yearly reef outlook report , aimed at benchmarking the health of the reef , found climate change , declining water quality from coastal runoff , development and illegal fishing were the biggest dangers to the reef .
The study echoed findings by scientists belonging to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the Great Barrier Reef could be “ functionally extinct ” within decades , with deadly coral bleaching likely to be an annual occurrence by 2030 .
The reef was one of the most diverse and remarkable ecosystems in the world , and populations of almost all marine species were still large , the government ’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in the report .
But some ecologically important species , such as dugongs , marine turtles , seabirds , black teatfish and some sharks had declined significantly , while coral diseases and pest outbreaks like crown - of - thorns starfish appeared to be increasing and becoming more serious .
CHALLENGE AHEAD
A separate report by the Australian Institute of Marine Science , also released on Wednesday , found ocean temperatures on northern parts of the reef had been a degree above average through winter , pointing to a bad year for coral bleaching .
“ We know that a failure to act on dangerous climate change puts at risk significant places like the Great Barrier Reef and this report confirms the scale of the challenge ahead , ” Australia ’s Environment Minister Peter Garrett said .
Bleaching occurs when the tiny plant - like coral organisms die , often because of higher temperatures , and leave behind only a white limestone reef skeleton .
Garrett and Queensland state Premier Anna Bligh unveiled a plan to improve water quality on the reef .
It followed a report last year which found agricultural run-off was killing the reef , with some sections already irreversibly damaged .
The plan aimed to halve the runoff of harmful nutrients and pesticides by 2013 and ensure 80 percent of agricultural enterprises and 50 percent of grazing operations were taking steps to reduce runoff .
The World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said the report added urgency to a debate in Australia ’s parliament on laws to curb carbon emissions , rejected last month by the upper house Senate and due for a second vote in mid-November .
“ We can not sit back and let the world ’s largest and most iconic reef system die on our watch , ” said WWF reef campaigner Nick Heath .
Potato fruit
Here ’s something I have n’t seen before in my , uh , six years of growing potatoes : green , tomato - like , walnut - sized potato fruit .
Bob had n’t seen ’em either , in 40 plus years of farming .
I hit the web for education .
These are genuine fruit , but not that common .
Usually , potato flowers just drop off .
When fruit do form , they ’re more likely found on certain varieties , like Yukon Gold .
This year , there were fruit on just about every Chieftain plant , here and there on the Kennebec , and none that I noticed on the Yukon Gold …
Each fruit contains 300 - 500 seeds that do n’t come true : planting them does n’t result in the same potatoes as the parent plant , there ’s lots of genetic variation .
Potato breeders plant out thousands of seeds , check out the results , then keep replanting the most desirable potatoes for many years or so to get new commercial varieties — apparently , this is the way new potatoes are bred .
Meanwhile , it apparently only takes only two seasons and one generation to breed genetically stable new potatoes , so for the small farm or home garden , as opposed to the big potato breeder , this seems like a viable way to go .
Harvest seed one season — you can hand - pollinate to cross two varieties — plant out the next and select your favorites .
Those tubers should be stable and ready to go , you just have to build up a quantity , which takes another season , unless you need hardly any at all !
And , the fruit are poisonous , rich in solanine , not for eating ( potatoes , tomatoes , peppers , eggplant and tobacco are all members of the “ deadly nightshade ” family , all prone to having toxic parts ) .
Interesting !
Since they suddenly appeared this year on two varieties , I ’d guess it was about the weather !
Since this is such a popular post , being dug up over and over via Google , I ’ve started to update the article as I discover more .
I ’m not marking the changes .
This is unusual .
In general , I do n’t edit old blog posts , and clearly mark the updates when I do !
A truly major change in the global monetary system is beginning to materialize .
The dollar is starting to be dethroned .
Foreign governments and central banks are going to do the dethroning .
I have no prediction as to how slowly or quickly this process will take .
The major dethroners , the Chinese , are on record as favoring a slow process .
The transition is already occurring , however .
Now that attitudes have shifted among the dethroners , they are likely to keep at it .
The transition will be away from the dollar ’s use in international exchange and toward the use of stronger and / or more stable currencies .
International deals are being made already in non-dollar currencies or through barter .
The catalyst for reducing the dollar ’s role is the insolvent U.S. banking system combined with the massive government and FED efforts to reflate the system .
The weakness of the emperor has been fully revealed .
Foreign players are going to press their advantages .
The U.S. monetary system has failed .
This is not just another stumble .
The world is not going to be led forward by a country with problems as large as have surfaced in America .
There may not be any viable heir to the throne , and the present king may remain seated for quite some time .
There will be many intervening ups and downs of currencies and gold .
But the nobles and court are going to be busy forming new coalitions and jockeying for becoming # 1 .
This movement is going to be BIG .
Entire economies are going to restructure .
But my focus here is on one part of the financial side of things , namely , central banking and gold .
Many foreign central banks have supplied credit to the U.S. government .
As they move away from that policy , U.S. interest rates will rise and the dollar decline .
The dollar price of gold depends on two factors : the dollar exchange rate against other currencies and the world price of gold in those currencies .
A dollar decline raises the price of gold in dollar terms .
An increase in the world price of gold , other things equal , increases the dollar price of gold .
The world price of gold rises or falls with the extent of inflation of all the world ’s currencies .
The world price of gold has risen in the last few years , but gold investors should realize that it is not a one - way street .
If the most important dethroning central banks add gold to their reserves while stemming their production of their own currencies , the world price of gold will stabilize and fall .
The dollar price of gold reflects both exchange rates and the world gold price .
I believe and argue below that the foreign governments and central banks have intentionally pursued dollar policies for decades that were exactly the opposite of what you or I as rational profit - maximizers lacking in political power would have done .
WHY ?
Apparently they were rational from the point of view of those who did possess political power and certain of their supporters that included exporters .
The Dollar Meltdown : S... Goyette , Charles Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 4.00 ( as of 04:10 EST - Details )
It is highly pertinent to the price of gold to understand what has been going on and how it now appears to be changing .
Why it ’s changing now is , in my opinion , partly a matter of political competition .
That ’s a polite way of saying that other states may be starting to see their way clear to shaking off U.S. superpower dominance .
They may be starting to feel their oats .
They may feel that power lies in combining against the U.S. in certain ways while cooperating in others .
Secretly , they may have tasted blood and be licking their chops .
They may be gloating at the American difficulties .
I do n’t think that " statesmen " are nice guys .
They do n’t build up massive armies and navies with nuclear weapons because they are nice guys .
It is also partly a matter of economic necessity .
Manipulations of economies have resulted in serious economic dislocations and inefficiencies .
How did foreign central banks do the opposite of what you and I , who lack power , would have done ?
We will need to understand inflation to grasp that .
In popular articles these days , there is massive confusion over inflation ( and deflation ) .
I will aim for utter clarity on this matter .
The Federal Reserve Bank in America has to turn its earnings on its U.S. securities back to the U.S. Treasury ( in excess of its costs of running the bank . )
This means that the government bonds carried as assets have no value to the FED .
The present value of an asset with zero cash flows is ZERO .
These bonds do NOT back the currency that the FED issues .
( Foreign central banks that carry U.S. bonds as assets may be in a different situation , depending on their laws . )
Federal Reserve notes are backed , for all practical purposes , only by the GOLD that the FED carries , which is 261.5 million oz .
The following discussion is aimed at understanding the price of gold in a currency issued by a central bank .
This will then illuminate the mystery of what central banks have done over the past 40 years to place the dollar on a throne and in what ways they behaved opposite to what a profit - maximizer would have done .
Suppose that we have a central bank that has a single asset : 250 oz. of gold .
It has a single liability .
It has issued 750 notes per oz .
Each note is dubbed a " dollar . "
In this scenario , the dollar is defined as the piece of paper , the note , and not as a weight in gold .
The total number of notes issued is 187,500 = 750 x 250 .
Suppose , further , that the bank stands ready to convert any note into gold if a note holder wishes to redeem it .
1,000 notes bring 1.3333 oz .
if this is done .
The price of gold in this situation , expressed in dollars , is and has to be $ 750 per oz .
Actually , the situation is really the reverse .
The value of $ 750 is 1 oz . , since it is the oz . of gold that gives value to the notes issued against it .
I define a new concept called the Zero Discount Value ( ZDV ) of gold .
The ZDV of gold in a specific currency is the total number of currency notes issued divided by the total number of oz .
of gold held as an asset against that note issue .
Bank reserves that are fully convertible into currency notes also enter the total of bank notes .
This definition will help us to define inflation with precision and it will help us to understand the pricing of gold .
It will also lead to an understanding of the dollar policies of foreign central banks .
Our hypothetical central bank has 187,500 notes ( dollars ) and 250 oz . , so that the ZDV is $ 750 per oz .
The ZDV of gold is the value of gold expressed in bank notes under the assumption that all outstanding notes are converted into the bank ’s holdings of gold .
Even if there is no convertibility , the ZDV is still the same number .
It is the value of gold under the assumption that all the notes are exactly 100 percent backed by gold .
The ZDV for a bank changes through time .
Why ?
Because the bank ’s holdings of gold and its issue of notes change through time .
I define inflation as an issue of central bank money ( notes and reserves ) not secured by additional assets of equivalent worth .
Inflation is a note issue that is made without additional asset backing , in this case , gold .
Inflation is an increase in bank notes issued relative to the gold held as backing .
Let the bank issue another 12,500 notes with no change in gold holdings and no other asset entering the bank ’s possession .
This issue is inflation .
The ZDV is now $ 200,000/250 oz . = $ 800 / oz .
The zero discount value of gold rises to $ 800 because of the inflation .
Inflation of notes , which is the inflation defined here , has many effects not discussed here such as inflation of various kinds of prices .
The single effect being emphasized is that the ZDV of gold , by definition , has to go up when the bank inflates the number of notes that it issues .
By the same token , deflation is a reduction in bank notes relative to gold held as backing .
In this case , the ZDV declines .
There is no economics or finance in this calculation .
It is all definition , but it is clear definition .
The economic reasoning comes in when we try to understand how the ZDV of gold and its market price are related .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
Suppose we are back to the situation where the bank has 187,500 notes outstanding and holds 250 oz . of gold .
The ZDV is $ 750 / oz .
Now let us change the scenario .
Let us say that the bank no longer allows note holders to convert the notes at the bank and get gold in return from the bank ’s tellers .
The bank is still in operation .
It does not close its doors and repudiate its notes .
It suspends convertibility for an indefinite period of time .
Let us suppose that private people can trade notes outside the bank , and that a market springs up on the curb outside , or that down the street is a tavern exchange .
The question is this :
What is the price of bank notes ?
Or the same question put in another way :
What is the price of gold expressed in these notes ?
If people think that the bank has stopped conversion because it intends to issue more notes or even repudiate the notes altogether , then people will try to rid themselves of these notes .
In other words , if they expect inflation of the notes and a rising ZDV , they may bid the price of gold up above the ZDV , which is the same as bidding down the note value by selling notes .
This produces a premium for gold .
Any premium that may arise will depend in a complex way on expectations and on other factors such as interest rates and other prices .
I discuss this case no further .
Let us address the question of the price at which gold will sell when there is no conversion and without this inflation effect which we know raises the ZDV .
In other words , let us analyze one thing at a time .
Leaving inflation aside , several factors at a given moment in time restrain the price rise of gold from rising above its ZDV .
If the notes are forced to be legal tender by government law , then such a law will tend to sustain their value even if there is no conversion .
The notes will be useful to pay taxes and debts .
This factor has an important implication .
If the legal tender law is rescinded when a bank is not allowing conversion , the notes are likely to lose value and gold go higher .
The bank might resume convertibility , in which case all those who bought gold at greater than $ 750 would lose .
Central banks do resume convertibility , although it can take a good many years .
Buying gold at prices above ZDV near the time when the suspension ends is a losing proposition .
Let gold ’s price be $ 1,000 , which is above its ZDV of $ 750 .
The bank itself has the incentive to sell out enough of its gold at a rate of 1,000 notes per oz .
to absorb all the notes outstanding .
Since 187,500 /1,000 = 187.5 , that will take 187.5 oz .
The bank can then own the remaining 62.5 oz .
free and clear with no liabilities against them .
The bank can put a lid on the price of gold by selling gold , and that will be profitable for the bank but only when gold ’s price exceeds the ZDV .
In reality , ZDV serves as an effective moving ceiling on the price of gold .
It certainly rises with inflation , but market prices rarely get above the ceiling at any given time .
Going above the ZDV is not impossible .
Gold did just that in 1980 for a brief time .
It appears that when this happened , there was an incentive for arbitrageurs to borrow and sell gold ( or simply to sell gold they owned ) to receive more dollars than the hypothetical conversion price ( the ZDV ) warranted .
How does this work ?
Suppose gold has a price of $ 1,000 / oz .
when the ZDV is $ 750 and the bank owns 250 oz . of gold as backing .
By selling 1 oz . at $ 1,000 , the speculator receives notes that are more than worth their weight in gold ( if there were convertibility ) .
He receives the equivalent of 1.33 oz . of gold for a sale of 1 oz . of gold .
The speculator has a strong incentive to sell gold when its market price exceeds its ZDV .
This completes the discussion of gold selling at above the ZDV .
We saw that inflation causes the ZDV to rise over time .
We saw that at a given instant in time , the ZDV at that moment acts as a ceiling to the market price of gold .
Will the ZDV also act as a floor ?
The Flight Of The Barb ... Smith , George Ford Best Price : $ 11.99 Buy New $ 10.95 ( as of 06:40 EST - Details )
Let ’s now consider the possibility of gold selling below its ZDV .
In fact , this is what has happened to gold priced in dollars for MANY years since 1980 when gold entered its long bear market and this situation STILL prevails today even after 8 years of price increases .
In U.S. dollars , gold ’s ZDV today is over $ 7,000 an oz .
and rising .
The ZDV has not provided a floor to the market price of gold , and yet there are arbitrage forces that are at work to drive market price up to the ZDV .
Suppose gold is $ 250 an oz . in the market but the ZDV is $ 750 .
Let us attempt an arbitrage .
We borrow $ 250 ( or use our own capital ) and buy an oz . of gold .
We take the gold to the bank and try to redeem it for $ 750 .
If we could do that , we could then repay the loan and keep a profit of near $ 500 .
This shows that there should be some economic incentive that prevents the gold price from falling too far below its ZDV .
Is there ?
If so , why has n’t it operated ?
There are years when gold has been 85 percent below its ZDV !
What ’s the impediment ?
The central bank itself could borrow $ 250 , buy an oz . of gold , and then issue 750 notes without raising the ZDV .
It could then repay the loan ( I neglect interest . )
Its balance sheet would then have 251 oz .
gold plus 500 notes as assets and 188,250 notes outstanding .
Netting out the notes , it has 251 oz .
gold and 187,750 notes .
The ZDV falls to $ 748.008 .
Deflation occurs .
The bank has a profit by this arbitrage .
If it offers to redeem at $ 750 / oz. , that will use up 250.33 oz . of gold .
Its profit is the other 0.67 oz. worth $ 500 .
The FED did not do this arbitrage , despite the fact that gold was very much below its ZDV , or conversely , that dollar notes were much above their fully convertible price in gold .
There was and is a strong profit incentive to deflate that the FED spurned .
The FED wanted gold dethroned and the dollar placed on the throne .
Profits from the source I have outlined were not an incentive for it .
It did not want deflation .
It wanted inflation .
No speculator could get $ 750 for an oz .
either , because the FED refused to redeem .
That is part and parcel of an intentional policy of inflation .
It is an essential part of such a policy .
Otherwise , private parties will turn in the notes and seek a different money .
So that avenue for profit also was blocked .
The private entrepreneur has another option .
Use gold to start a competing bank .
Issue a competing currency .
For $ 750 in central bank notes , the new banker buys 3 oz . of gold in the market .
He keeps 2 oz . as profit .
He then issues 750 notes of his own , called the DOLAR , convertible into gold at 750 per oz .
As he buys up the gold and sells the central bank notes , he drives the gold price in dollars up .
He keeps doing this until the ZDV is reached .
Hence , here is another economic force that operates to make gold ’s price converge to the ZDV .
Obviously , this avenue has been largely but not entirely blocked .
There are barriers to entry that are significant in the form of getting an entire system that uses dollars to use DOLARS .
Nevertheless , people like James Turk and his GoldMoney venture are pursuing this option .
Another way is for ordinary people to buy gold and sell the dollar .
To spend $ 250 to buy an oz .
of gold when one knows that the ZDV of a note is $ 750 is to get something worth three times more than the weight in gold of what one has given up .
Still , this is not a riskless arbitrage .
It relies on the prospect that others will eventually exploit the profit potential that exists when gold is well below its ZDV .
There is another way to arbitrage the difference between the market price of gold and its ZDV when the market price is less than the ZDV .
Other central banks can borrow dollars , buy gold , and then issue currencies against it .
With these currencies , backed by gold , they can repay the dollar borrowings and still have a profit .
They can gain the arbitrage profits in precisely the same way that the FED might have or that private entrepreneurs might have .
MANY foreign central banks have done the opposite .
They sometimes have sold gold .
They have usually accumulated dollars in substantial amounts in the form of dollar loans .
They have not only not competed with the FED and taken advantage of this arbitrage opportunity , they have gone the other way and supported the FED and the U.S. government by their loans .
This was one part of the financial side of government - run economic policies .
So when we run through the arbitrage possibilities , we find that most of them have been blocked or spurned .
Central bankers dethroned gold , never fully , by not taking advantage of the profitable opportunity to issue solid currencies that compete with the dollar by buying gold and selling the dollar when gold ’s price is far below its ZDV .
Instead they chose to act as satellites of the U.S.
The central bankers cooperated with governments that geared a major part of their economy ’s production for the American market and took dollars in exchange .
They lent to the American consumer to finance his consumption of their goods .
They weakened and inflated their own currencies intentionally .
This is the situation that appears to be changing .
It started changing at least six years ago in Asia , for China has been accumulating gold secretly for at least six years .
China recently began a campaign encouraging its citizens to hold wealth in gold and silver .
But the situation began changing as early as 1979 with the European Exchange rate mechanism .
The euro came into being between 1992 and 2002 , and that competes with the dollar .
The arbitrage opportunity pointed out above is a manifestation of an overvalued dollar compared to gold and a world economy with serious distortions in product , labor , and capital markets .
They are two sides of the same coin : the financial side and the real economy side .
These distortions have built up over decades as many countries manipulated their economies while their central bankers aided and abetted the dollar .
A great deal of restructuring lies ahead .
America is down .
Is she out ?
America is capable of putting her house in order .
She has great strengths lodged in her people .
It is not too late to resuscitate the American economy and revive its vitality .
Will the proper policies and radical system changes be instituted to accomplish that challenge ?
Unfortunately , there are no current signals to that effect being given off by America ’s ruling elite .
We are seeing the very opposite .
Foreign leaders can read these negative signals as well as we can .
They are acting accordingly .
They are starting to dethrone the dollar .

Signatures do n't do what you think they do Security people tend to think that we live in a secure world , one in which everyone is constantly auditing the behavior of everyone else , and the end result is widespread mutually ensured honesty .
We do n't even vaguely live in that world .
We live in a trusting world , where most people are mostly good , and the need for auditing is much lower than it would be if everyone were greedy sociopathic automatons .
I would not want to live in a world which worked that way , and it would probably not only be an unpleasant place to live , but an extremely unproductive one as well , as every attempt by anyone to get anything done would be destroyed by theft and corruption .
I say this not to engage in broad philosophizing but because I have a very concrete point to make about a very specific thing : signatures .
People think of signatures as being a strong form of physical evidence , useful in court proceeding for proving that a particular person really did sign a particular thing .
While this belief being widespread does a good job of denying that things they signed are actually their signature , which is a good thing , the claimed difficulty of forging signatures is simply not true .
Anyone can practice forging a signature from a few samples for a few hours and be able to do a passable replica .
Anyone with decent skill who practices a bit can get quite skilled .
And people are n't very consistent about how they sign their own signatures , making even legitimate matches sometimes look fake .
Thumbprints would be far better as a piece of evidence .
Despite that , signatures are still very important and good at what they 're used for .
What is that ?
It 's to make it clear that someone knows when they 're entering into a binding agreement .
You can't be forced into an effective contract just because you said ' yeah , whatever ' when asked if you want to participate , and you can't be forced into a contract by being tricked into signing a document which says something different than what you think it says .
The theory of contracts is based on parties mutually agreeing to be contractually bound , and requires they all go through sufficient ceremony that it 's clear when a contract has been entered into ( sometimes merchants can get into binding contracts much more easily , but that 's because they 're expected to be more savvy , the law is big on protecting little old ladies from being suckered ) .
For example , take the use of signatures for receiving packages .
There is n't even a contract entered into when a package is signed for , but the reasoning behind it is the same - it's to make clear that the person receiving the package knew they were receiving a package , and not claim later that there was a misunderstanding .
To the extent that the signature has any evidenciary power in this case , it 's mostly in that people generally by default put down their real name , and since the delivery person generally does n't even know what the potential name of a recipient might be , it 's hard for someone to lie later and claim that no package was delivered at all .
The hoopla around cryptographic signatures is largely misplaced .
Having signatures which were on a web page which clearly stated what was being indicated and the signature was done by moving the mouse like a pen in a drawing area would do a much better job of indicating what signatures are supposed to indicate , and probably be much easier to back up in court later .

What you say about written signatures above is entirely correct .
However , I do n't know a single security professional who " [...] think [s ] that we live in a secure world , one in which everyone is constantly auditing the behavior of everyone else [ ... ] " .
Security professionals tend to be the most paranoid people around , and are critically aware of the flaws in most of the systems we depend upon .
I guess the big problem is one of naming .
Cryptographic " signatures " do something far stronger than what signatures can do , hence the confusion a few years ago when Congress passed a bill to allow " electronic signatures " -- electronic representations of your John Hancock , and nothing more .
It 's too late to change the name , but really what we talk about in crypto are " authenticators " or " verifiers " .
The interesting thing with the world today is that we now have to tools to inexpensively improve security , and yet there is no interest in doing so .
For example , modern cryptography could easily make credit card number theft a thing of the past ... and yet , when the credit card companies adopted a contactless smartcard standard they designed one where the secret number is still passed off the device where it can be intercepted .
Mechanical keys are woefully insecure , yet there is widespread denial that this problem exists .
Electronic voting systems could be designed to protect against tampering , and yet the common ones today are more easily tampered with than anything ever seen in the past .
In security , the standard to which new technology is held is entirely based on what the previous generation technology could do .
This is in conflict with nearly every other area of technology , where constant improvement ( in speed , accuracy , or cost ) is demanded .
Perhaps this is because near - perfect security has been so rare in the past , or perhaps it is because humans are absolutely terrible at assessing risk .
Far more valued than security is accountability -- we do n't care if someone can steal our identity information as long as we can track them down and hold them accountable later .
I wonder if this ongoing lack of mathematically enforced security helps prevent us from becoming a society of " greedy sociopathic automatons " ?
That a lack of rigor in enforcing the social contract allows us to weed out the bad eggs that might be lurking among us ?
Probably not , I imagine social reciprocity runs much deeper than that , but it's an interesting thought .

bramcohen Digital signatures do a great job of producing evidence , but a relatively lousy one of making clear that the person knew what they were doing when they did the signature .
The credit card companies have an entrenched interest in keeping things the way they are .
They expressly do n't want later systems to be more secure , because that would directly cut into the need for the service they provide , and hence their profits .

Yeah , it 's weird how many contracts people sign which it would clearly be completely impractical for them to actually read and understand .
Their are implied contracts for standard purchases which are well thought out and do what you 'd expect , but the state of house , car , employment , and internet service contracts lags far behind .
Particularly internet service , which there is n't even much legal and regulatory history of .
Those other ones if there 's something really egregious it 's just plain not enforceable .

There has been a big push towards " chip and PIN " ( an EMV implementation that requires the customer to enter a 4 digit PIN rather than sign a voucher ) verification for point of sale credit and debit card transactions here and in the UK in the last 3 years .
It was argued on
" Sales vouchers [ for credit cards ] were governed by laws that evolved for cheques [ that 's " checks " in American ] , of which the most important is that a forged signature is completely null and void .
This gives the customer strong protection against abuse of a stolen card .
Although some argument can be made about card terms and conditions , and about possible negligence by a customer , in practice the banking industry paid the costs of fraud . "
Incidentally , it was also argued that chip and pin amounted to little more than what Schneier would call " security theatre " .
You say " To the extent that the signature has any evidenciary power in this case , it 's mostly in that people generally by default put down their real name , and since the delivery person generally does n't even know what the potential name of a recipient might be , it 's hard for someone to lie later and claim that no package was delivered at all . "
I 'd suggest that a bigger problem in practice is people having no record or recollection of having received goods , and claim falsely , perhaps in good faith or perhaps in wilful ignorance , that they never received anything .
As you say , most people wo n't steal at the first opportunity , if only because their reputation is worth more to them than what can be immediately stolen .
That 's not to say that I believe that good will and morality do n't play a large role , but having your reputation harmed in the event of being caught is an obvious deterrent that accounts for why many sociopaths are n't outwardly sociopathic .
Prison is another one .
I 've often thought that the way in which I 'm regularly asked by delivery men to sign a touch screen PDT while vouching for goods somewhat trivialises the whole notion of a signature .
Firstly , my " signature " invariably ends up being an illegible , pixelated scrawl packed into an area the size of a business card .
Secondly , it 's a 1 - bit per pixel image that can easily be copied digitally .
The use of PDTs in this way is widespread practice here in Ireland , and probably is in most other western countries too .

The Economist reports that we have the ' most positive influence ' on the world :
I suspect that if we ever tried to use it , it would disappear .
Porsche tuner GEMBALLA has been taking quite a few passes lately at customizing the superlative Porsche Carrera GT and none have really knocked us off our feet or done this car true justice .
First out of the starting blocks was the GEMBALLA Mirage GT Carbon Edition with its white and black color scheme and carbon - fiber everywhere humanly possible .
Ho hum …
Then came the GEMBALLA Mirage GT Gold Edition , a car that would make conspicuous consumption connoisseurs the world over very proud …
But now we have the GEMBALLA Mirage GT Matt Edition , a stellar exotic that we would be proud to park in our driveway .
The guts are still the same as they are in the other models using a modified version of Porsche ’s V10 engine rated at 670 hp , with 3.7 - second runs from 0 - to - 60 mph and a nut of 208 mph .
We ’ve seen the GEMBALLA Mirage GT Matt Edition offered in matte black with blue or red interior and exterior accents as well as a matte gun metallic finish with yellow trim .
But our guess is that for the additional $ 350,000 + you ’ll pay along with roughly $ 440,000 for the base Carrera GT , GEMBALLA will probably hook you up with whatever combo your heart desires .
If it was me , I ’d grab the one with the matte black paint job with red highlights .
In any case , this company has finally found a winning combination of performance and aesthetic enhancements that really take the stellar Porsche Carrera GT to another level .
This is n’t the last variation we ’ll see from GEMBALLA as this is a pretty popular car for them to tweak .
As it currently stands they have like 5 different iterations .
Since the Carrera GT is no longer manufactured by Porsche and , consequently , scarce in the marketplace , we just wonder where GEMBALLA keeps finding a steady supply of base models for their Mirage GT editions .

To look at Rams top wide receiver Donnie Avery brings a litany of questions :
Will he be able to progress from his rookie season and assume the pressures as the team ’s top receiver ?
Will his QB be able to get him the ball ?
How will missing the majority of the preseason affect his performance ?
Will he even be able to take the field for Week 1 ?
A second round draft pick in 2008 , Avery was second on the Rams in 2008 with 53 receptions and 674 yards , trailing just Torry Holt in both categories .
With Holt now calling Jacksonville home , Avery was thought to enter 2009 as the team ’s prime target but injuries have derailed those plans a bit .
He had been sidelined since August 7 after suffering a stress fracture in his foot during a scrimmage .
It was questionable if he would recover in time to open the season , but he was in the line - up for Thursday ’s final preseason game .
He was only in the game for the first two series and did n’t have a single pass thrown his way , but being able to take the field was a huge victory .
While it is possible that he ’s still hindered by the injury for a week or two into the regular season , the fact that he will be able to take the field gives him a chance to be productive .
Marc Bulger has also been limited this preseason , just helping fuel the questions about his potential success in 2009 .
Once regarded as one of the elite quarterbacks in the game , he has been mired with injuries only once starting all 16 games in a season .
Last year he did manage to play in 15 games , but still had just 2,720 yards .
Over the past two seasons he ’s thrown just 22 touchdowns compared to 28 interceptions .
His completion percentage has n’t exceeded 58.5 % each of the past two years .
Even this preseason , he ’s been sidelined with a fractured pinkie .
Considering that the projected second - string quarterback is Kyle Boller , with a career passer rating of 71.9 , there is reason to worry that Avery could suffer this season from poor quarterback play .
Will Bulger be healthy ?
Can he rediscover his Pro bowl status ?
What if Boller is forced into duty ?
With that said , let ’s take a look at what I would expect from Avery this season :
Receiving – 61 catches , 835 yards , 5 TD
When looking for a wide receiver , you want someone who you can count on .
With Avery , I do n’t think you get that .
He proved to be good last season , but he was far from elite .
Throw in the questions about his QB and the fact that the Rams are going to be a team to ride Steven Jackson into the end zone at any time possible , and you get a WR with more questions then answers .
He has upside , however , considering he will be his teams top receiver .
He ’s worth getting , but too me I do n’t want to be depending on him as one of my top three receivers .
While he could prove worthy of a starting spot , he ’d look better on my bench as a # 4 who I can reap the benefits from if he outperforms my projections .
What do you think ?
Do you think Avery will be a must start fantasy WR option or is he better as your fourth option ?
Did Lancaster bombers that killed 600,000 in German cities deliberately target civilians ?
A new book says YES ...
To the RAF aircrews , the sight of the eastern German city ablaze looked like a terrifying vision of hell .
As the vast stream of 796 four - engined Lancaster heavy bombers swept over Dresden on that night of February 14 , 1945 , almost 2,000 tons of explosives and incendiaries were dropped onto the inferno .
One Lancaster pilot recorded in his diary : ' The glow could be seen 50 miles away .
The target area was almost like day .
Down below , the town was a mass of flames , a pool of fire .
It was awe - inspiring . '
The scenes in Dresden were Biblical in the scale of devastation .
The merging of the fires sucked oxygen from the air and created a ferocious , howling tornado .
Trees were pulled from their roots , buildings destroyed and people flung through the air like ragdolls .
Fearsome : A Lancaster bomber in action during the Second World War
Soaring temperatures turned the asphalt streets into a deadly , molten quagmire .
Thousands suffocated or burned to death in the cellars of their homes .
As the blaze intensified , huge crowds made for the city 's reservoir and dived into the water .
But the sheer numbers , combined with the roaring heat and the lack of oxygen , made the place unbearable .
People desperately tried to clamber out , yet the smooth cement edges made it impossible .
Far from being a refuge , the reservoir turned into a sweltering graveyard .
The raid on Dresden is one of the most notorious episodes of Britain 's war effort , a symbol of the ruthlessness of the RAF 's strategic bombing offensive .
It has been estimated that around 25,000 people were killed that night - compare that to the 568 deaths in the assault on Coventry by the Luftwaffe in November 1940 , by far the worst individual raid that any British city endured during the Blitz .
Yet , for all its infamy , the attack on Dresden was by no means the most savage of the RAF 's bombing campaign .
In July 1943 , a series of raids on Hamburg killed at least 45,000 people in a gigantic firestorm .
Little more than a week after Dresden , 362 Lancasters dropped 1,551 tons of bombs on the small town of Pforzheim in 22 minutes .
The central area became a blazing crematorium , with the death toll reaching 17,600 , a quarter of the population .
In total , at least 600,000 civilians are thought to have lost their lives in the RAF 's remorseless pounding of German cities .
Because of the epic slaughter , the campaign has always provoked controversy .
During the war , the urban bombing had its detractors , not just from pacifists but even from figures within the Government itself , such as Tory Minister Lord Salisbury , who warned in 1943 that ' we are losing some of our moral superiority to the Germans ' .
In the decades since 1945 , the debate has continued to rage .
Some have accused the British Government of war crimes .
Others have drawn an emotionally charged parallel between the urban firestorms and the horrors of the Nazi gas chambers .
Defenders of the bombing offensive have long argued that such criticism is a gross injustice .
The aim of the RAF , they maintain , was to destroy German industry and the military infrastructure .
Civilian deaths were a regrettable consequence of this strategy , not its central goal .
The town centre became a blazing crematorium
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
' We have always adhered firmly to the principle that we attack none but military objectives , ' declared Sir Archibald Sinclair , the Air Secretary , in the Commons in October 1943 .
In one post - war lecture , Sir Charles Portal , the Chief of the Air Staff throughout the campaign , said it was 'a fallacy that our bombing of the German cities was intended to kill Germans , and that we camouflaged this intention by the pretence that we would destroy industry .
The loss of life was purely incidental ' .
The truth is that such claims were dishonest .
Unpublished papers I have unearthed for my new book on the Lancaster bomber reveal that the mass , indiscriminate killing of Germany 's urban population was indeed the key goal of the RAF 's campaign .
During my research on the Lancaster - the heavyweight plane that enabled the RAF to mount the bomber offensive - I uncovered a wealth of archival material which exposes the truth about the Government 's policy .
Typical was one paper from the Air Ministry , written in August 1941 , which urged that the focus of attacks must be ' the people in their homes and factories ' .
Warming to this theme , the Directorate found inspiration in the Luftwaffe 's bombing of Coventry , 'one of the most successful raids carried out by the German Air Force on this country ' , with a ton of incendiaries for every 800 citizens .
' If Bomber Command could carry out a raid on the Coventry scale every month , the result would be a complete state of panic in the industrialised west of Germany ' , and ' considerable loss of life ' .
Another 1941 Ministry report called for ' saturation by incendiaries ' to break ' the morale of the population ' and leave the German people ' conscious of constant physical danger ' .
At the same time , the RAF 's chief Sir Charles Portal privately promised Winston Churchill that a significant expansion in the heavy bomber force would ultimately bring about ' the destruction of six million homes ' and ' civilian casualties estimated at 900,000 ' .
Indeed , senior RAF planners did not hesitate to use the term ' terror - bombing ' to describe some of their raids .
The most passionate enthusiast of the strategic offensive was , of course , Sir Arthur Harris , head of Bomber Command from 1942 .
' What we want to do is to bring masonry crashing down on top of the Boche , to kill the Boche and to terrify the Boche , ' he said .
So relentless was his determination to hit the German cities that he regarded any other operations as a distraction .
He even regarded the famous Dambusters Raid of May 1943 as a waste of time , privately claiming that it ' achieved nothing ' .
Aftermath : Death and devastation in Dresden after the allied bombing in February 1945
The son of a civil engineer based in imperial India , Harris had developed his spirit of aggressive independence while at English boarding schools .
A grizzled veteran of World War I , he had risen through the ranks of the RAF through his dynamism and natural authority .
Churchill regarded him as a philistine , but he was not without humour and could poke fun at his own image as a bloodthirsty autocrat .
Once , driving fast in his Bentley towards Whitehall , he was stopped by a police officer .
' You should be more careful .
You could kill someone , ' said the constable .
' Young man , I kill thousands of people every night , ' he replied .
Harris 's complaint against the RAF top brass , highlighted in archive papers which have never been published before , was that the Government should be far more candid about its policy of deliberately targeting Germany 's civilians .
He never had any time for Portal 's and Sinclair 's denials , as he explained in a letter to them in October 1943 : ' The aim of Bomber Command should be . . . publicly stated : the destruction of German cities and the killing of German workers . '
In another memo , two months later , he stated that the ' working populations are literally the heart of Germany 's war potential .
That is why they are being deliberately attacked ' .
But neither Portal nor Sinclair abandoned their rhetorical deceit as the campaign continued .
' Young man , I will kill thousands of people every night '
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
It was a campaign that would never have been possible without either the brilliance of the Avro Lancaster or the heroism of the aircrews .
Created by the visionary Avro designer Roy Chadwick and first entering RAF service in December 1941 , the Lancaster transformed the performance of Bomber Command .
Its huge bomb bay , stretching twothirds of the fuselage , allied to the strength of its ultra-reliable Merlin engines , meant it could carry far greater loads than any other bomber in the European theatre .
Its average load was 12,000lb , but towards the end of the war it was lifting the Grand Slam bomb weighing over 22,000lb , or ten tons .
Thanks to this capacity , the Lancasters dropped 51 million incendiaries and 607,000 tons of high explosives during the war .
For all its weight , the Lancaster was also a highly manoeuvrable aircraft , capable of reaching more than 300 mph in a shallow dive .
It was also resilient , capable of absorbing large amounts of punishment and even of returning to England on just two engines .
But none of these virtues would have mattered without the bravery and selfsacrifice of the heavy bomber crews .
No other part of the armed forces had consistently to endure such mortal dangers .
Of the 125,000 men who served in the Command , 55,700 - or 44 per cent - were killed in action , 8,400 seriously wounded and 9,800 taken prisoner .
' All war is brutal , ' Harris - once warned .
' If there are any weaker brethren who cannot stomach it , the sooner we dispose of them , the better . '
Remarkably few airmen flinched in battle , despite the risks of flying through the German flak and fighters .
A rare few gloried in the slaughter , seeing it as revenge for the Blitz .
' The filthy Hun .
Let the bastards die like the rats they are , ' wrote Lancaster wireless operator John Byrne in late 1944 .
Others had qualms about pounding residential areas .
Bill Utting , an Australian who took part in the Dresden raid , said he ' felt disgust when I learnt of the numbers that had been killed .
I was very , very sorry , but it was too late then ' .
But the overwhelming attitude of the airmen was that they were helping to destroy the Nazi war machine .
They were right to feel that way .
I would argue that , for all the ethical condemnation it has attracted , the bombing offensive was essential in defeating Germany .
The greatest moral crime of all would have been to abandon the campaign to hit back at the Reich , for that would have prolonged the war , and consequently the Nazis ' genocidal oppression .
' Fires in the sky meant the end of
war must be near '
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The strategic air offensive brought the war to German homeland , weakening its ability to carry on the fight .
Thanks to the RAF 's heavy bombers , the Reich was forced to divert colossal resources into air defences .
By 1944 , two million Germans were engaged in anti-aircraft duties , while a third of all artillery production was devoted to antiaircraft guns , when such weaponry was in desperately short supply .
A fifth of the non-agricultural German workforce was required to deal with consequences of bombing , such as clearing rubble , laying railway tracks or repairing damaged structures .
One Nazi study in January 1945 revealed that , due to the bombing , the German economy had produced 25 per cent fewer tanks than planned , 31 per cent fewer aircraft and 42 per cent fewer lorries .
The air campaign also meant deepening misery for Germany 's population .
' The people are beginning to suffer what is called bunker fever and inability to work , ' revealed a report by the intelligence branch of the SS in January 1945 .
As the attacks persisted , support for the Nazi regime crumbled .
Interrogated by the Allies after the Nazis ' surrender , Hermann Goering , head of the Luftwaffe , admitted that the attack on Dresden was the most demoralising raid of the war .
Alternatively , the bombing by Lancasters brought hope to the victims of German tyranny .
' The fires in the sky , a huge red glow - it was like heaven for us .
We knew the end of the war must be near , ' recalled Ben Halfgott , a Jew imprisoned in a concentration camp near Dresden .
The RAF 's Lancasters gouged out the industrial heart of Germany .
The campaign spelt ruin for the Reich's war economy and military capability .
And in the end , despite the civilian death toll , that was the greatest moral triumph of all .

How would it be , for example , to relate to a machine that is as intelligent as your spouse ?
— The Times .
Do n’t get me wrong ; my wife is great .
I bristle when I overhear someone say that my DVR is smarter than she is .
Chloe went to SUNY - Binghamton .
She ’s plenty smart .
My DVR knows French , but so what ?
It ’s not like I go to French restaurants with my DVR .
. . . O.K. , one time I went to Le Pescadou with my DVR .
Chloe and I were going through a weird time .
I was hungry .
There was nothing on TV .
No , that last part about TV is a joke .
Get it ?
Because I was with my DVR ?
Does n’t matter .
Point is —
No , actually , it does matter .
My DVR would have got it .
My DVR is very funny .
Not funny ha- ha , not like my A.T.M. , but funny .
It loves that movie “ My Dinner with Andre . ”
Between you and me , I have no idea if that movie is funny or not .
I try to laugh in the right places , but who knows ?
And , well , sometimes it ’s nice to not always be the person who “ knows ” when to laugh , to be with someone — O.K. , not someone , your DVR , or a G.P.S. system — and learn something .
I ’m not being fair .
Chloe can walk ; she reads constantly .
Mostly manuals , but still .
Over all , she ’s very . . . present .
Anyone who says she ’s not more intelligent , or at least more emotionally intelligent , than most of my appliances does n’t know her .
Chloe knows to give me some space when I ’m having a bad day .
Not like the copy machine at work .
That thing is such a bitch .
It is sharp , though .
Last year , during the primaries , when everyone was talking politics all the time , I admit I ’d kind of wait to know what it was thinking before I ’d offer my own opinion .
Without it , I ’m not sure if I ’d have supported Obama .
Chloe gave money to Chris Dodd .
So , funny story , not meant to be a dig at Chloe , but funny ( full disclosure : my DVR told it to me ) .
The other night , she ’s home watching “ Gossip Girl . ”
My DVR wants to turn to Jim Lehrer but agrees to give Chloe ’s show a shot .
After a few minutes , my DVR comments that it ’s “ high camp . ”
Chloe chuckles , says the show has nothing to do with summer camp and “ most of the kids are not high . ” Classic .
I know it can be hard for her .
There are certain types of machines out there — retina scanners , those really complex remote controls — that , to be honest , can be pretty caustic .
I do n’t think Chloe will ever forget the time she said “ irregardless ” in front of the ticket kiosk at the Angelika .
But , on the upside , she wo n’t make that mistake again .
And , I admit it , I get a charge ( non-electrical ) just from being around the really clever ones , hearing their opinions about the world , about places they ’ve been .
Like China , and Taiwan .
These machines have expanded my world .
I would n’t have started doing yoga if it had n’t been for my toaster .
Now I do yoga with my toaster .
Chloe , though , can be inflexible .
A few weeks ago , my smartphone and I wanted to take a drive up the coast , just the two of us .
There ’s a clam bar we both like , and Chloe is allergic to shellfish anyway .
But she got upset .
My phone gave me a look like “ This is all you , bro . ”
So , just to calm her down , I told her she probably did n’t want to come , because there ’d been a spate of attacks by giant prehistoric coastal birds .
Then my phone , so quick , made up some name for the birds .
After we left , Chloe went on Wikipedia and pieced together the truth .
I blamed my phone for everything , tried to make a joke , something like “ So much for having a smartphone , right ?
No pun intended . ”
She did n’t get the pun .
I ’ll always love her , though .
Ca n’t imagine life without her smile .
Of course , now I do n’t have to , because of my new digital camera .
It ’s feather light ( unlike Chloe ) , cynical but still somehow idealistic , and has ten megapixels .
Chloe has , what , maybe one ? ♦

Those readers who have ever wondered in an idle moment how a couple of Daleks would respond to the presence of three naked lesbians romping in their Mothership might recently have found the answer in the shape of a sci- fi smutfest entitled " Abducted by the Daleks " .
Sadly , however , you 'll have to wonder on because the BBC and the estate of Dalek creator Terry Nation have moved swiftly to pull the plug on the the trundling salt - cellars ' intergalactic rumpy - pumpy .
The 1,000 - disc limited edition DVD recently popped up on eBay but has now been removed at the Corporation 's behest .
The blurb stated :
ABDUCTED BY THE DALEKS : A brand new limited edition release ( 1000 ( numbered ) discs ) .
For obvious reasons this is going to become a very collectible item especailly with the resurgence in the interest in Dr. Who .
The DVDs will be sold on an incremental basis ( eg : Lowest number first ) .
The disc contains a 56 minute main feature plus a 40 minute outake / alternative version plus a trailer .
Yes yes , but what about the hot Dalek - on - girl - on - girl action ?
Here 's more :
The story centers around three sexy young disco babes who have met the mysterious Anna .
As they journey through the woods they discuss the legend of The Serial Skinner not knowing that they are already being observed by a more ambitious and ruthless species of Alien .... the daleks !!!
To cut to the chase - literally - here 's how UK tabloid the Sun describes it : " Dr Who 's foes capture three naked ' disco babes ' in the 18 - rated DVD .
They chase the girls around their spaceship and grope them with their plungers . "
Oh dear , oh dear .
The director of Terry Nation 's estate , Tim Hancock , told the paper : " The reason the Daleks are still the most sinister thing in the universe is because they do not make things like porn .
They were n't ever intended to be sexual creatures .
It 's simple , Daleks do not do porn . "
Well they do down at the Sun which has stills from the offending film here . ®

Nice try , lads , but we reckon you 're going to get your Daloids roasted for this one .
Tomgram : A Military That Wants Its Way
How to Trap a President in a Losing War
Petraeus , McChrystal , and the Surgettes
By Tom Engelhardt
Front and center in the debate over the Afghan War these days are General Stanley " Stan " McChrystal , Afghan war commander , whose " classified , pre-decisional " and devastating report -- almost eight years and at least $ 220 billion later , the war is a complete disaster -- was conveniently , not to say suspiciously , leaked to Bob Woodward of the Washington Post by we - know - not - who at a particularly embarrassing moment for Barack Obama ; Admiral Michael " Mike " Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who has been increasingly vocal about a " deteriorating " war and the need for more American boots on the ground ; and the president himself , who blitzed every TV show in sight last Sunday and Monday for his health reform program , but spent significant time expressing doubts about sending more American troops to Afghanistan .
( " I 'm not interested in just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in Afghanistan ... or sending a message that America is here for the duration . " )
On the other hand , here 's someone you have n't seen front and center for a while : General David Petraeus .
He was , of course , George W. Bush 's pick to lead the president 's last - ditch effort in Iraq .
He was the poster boy for Bush 's military policies in his last two years .
He was the highly praised architect and symbol of " the surge . "
He appeared repeatedly , his chest a mass of medals and ribbons , for heavily publicized , widely televised congressional testimony , complete with charts and graphs , that was meant , at least in part , for the American public .
He was the man who , to use an image from that period which has recently resurfaced , managed to synchronize the American and Baghdad " clocks , " pacifying for a time both the home and war fronts .
He never met a journalist , as far as we can tell , he did n't want to woo .
( And he clearly won over the influential Tom Ricks , then of the Washington Post , who wrote The Gamble , a bestselling paean to him and his sub-commanders . )
From the look of it , he 's the most political general to come down the pike since , in 1951 in the midst of the Korean War , General Douglas MacArthur said his goodbyes to Congress after being cashiered by President Truman for insubordination -- for , in effect , wanting to run his own war and the foreign policy that went with it .
It was Petraeus who brought Vietnam - era counterinsurgency doctrine ( COIN ) back from the crypt , overseeing the writing of a new Army counterinsurgency manual that would make it central to both the ongoing wars and what are already being referred to as the " next " ones .
Before he left office , Bush advanced his favorite general to the head of U.S. Central Command , which oversees the former president 's Global War on Terror across the energy heartlands of the planet from Egypt to Pakistan .
The command is , of course , especially focused on Bush 's two full - scale wars : the Iraq War , now being pursued under Petraeus 's former subordinate , General Ray Odierno , and the Afghan War , for which Petraeus seems to have personally handpicked a new commanding general , Stan McChrystal .
From the military 's dark side world of special ops and targeted assassinations , McChrystal had operated in Iraq and was also part of an Army promotion board headed by Petraeus that advanced the careers of officers committed to counterinsurgency .
To install McChrystal in May , Obama abruptly sacked the then - Afghan war commander , General David McKiernan , in what was then considered , with some exaggeration , a new MacArthur moment .
On taking over , McChrystal , who had previously been a counterterrorism guy ( and is n't about to give that up , either ) , swore fealty to counterinsurgency doctrine ( that is , to Petraeus ) by proclaiming that the American goal in Afghanistan must not be primarily to hunt down and kill Taliban insurgents , but to " protect the population . "
He also turned to a " team " of civilian experts , largely gathered from Washington think - tanks , a number of whom had been involved in planning out Petraeus 's Iraq surge of 2007 , to make an assessment of the state of the war and what needed to be done .
Think of them as the Surgettes .
As in many official reassessments , the cast of characters essentially guaranteed the results before a single meeting was held .
Based on past history and opinions , this team could only provide one Petraeus - approved answer to the war : more -- more troops , up to 40,000 - 45,000 of them , and other resources for an American counterinsurgency operation without end .
Hence , even if McChrystal 's name is on it , the report slipped to Bob Woodward which just sandbagged the president has a distinctly Petraeusian shape to it .
In a piece linked to Woodward 's bombshell in the Washington Post , Rajiv Chandrasekaran and Karen DeYoung wrote of unnamed officials in Washington who claimed " the military has been trying to push Obama into a corner . "
The language in the coverage elsewhere has been similar .
There is , wrote DeYoung a day later , now a " rupture " between the military " pushing for an early decision to send more troops " and civilian policymakers " increasingly doubtful of an escalating nation - building effort . "
Nancy Youssef of McClatchy News wrote about how " mixed signals " from Washington were causing " increasing ire from U.S. commanders in Afghanistan " ; a group of McClatchy reporters talked of military advocates of escalation feeling " frustration " over " White House dithering . "
David Sanger of the New York Times described " a split between an American military that says it needs more troops now and an American president clearly reluctant to leap into that abyss . "
" Impatient " is about the calmest word you 'll see for the attitude of the military top command right now .
Buyer 's Remorse , the Afghan War , and the President
In the midst of all this , between Admiral Mullen and General McChrystal is , it seems , a missing man .
The most photogenic general in our recent history , the man who created the doctrine and oversees the war , the man who is now shaping the U.S. Army ( and its future plans and career patterns ) , is somehow , at this crucial moment , out of the Washington spotlight .
This last week General Petraeus was , in fact , in England , giving a speech and writing an article for the ( London ) Times laying out his basic " protect the population " version of counterinsurgency and praising our British allies by quoting one of their great imperial plunderers .
( " If Cecil Rhodes was correct in his wonderful observation that ' being an Englishman is the greatest prize in the lottery of life , ' and I 'm inclined to think that he was , then the second greatest prize in the lottery of life must be to be a friend of an Englishman , and based on that , the more than 230,000 men and women in uniform who work with your country 's finest day by day are very lucky indeed , as am I . " )
Only at mid-week , with Washington aboil , did he arrive in the capital for a counterinsurgency conference at the National Press Club and quietly " endorse " " General McChrystal 's assessment . "
Whatever the look of things , however , it 's unlikely that Petraeus is actually on the sidelines at this moment of heightened tension .
He is undoubtedly still The Man .
So much is , of course , happening just beyond the sightlines of those of us who are mere citizens of this country , which is why inference and guesswork are , unfortunately , the order of the day .
Read any account in a major newspaper right now and it 's guaranteed to be chock - a- block full of senior officials and top military officers who are never " authorized to speak , " but nonetheless yak away from behind a scrim of anonymity .
Petraeus may or may not be one of them , but the odds are reasonable that this is still a Petraeus Moment .
If so , Obama has only himself to blame .
He took up Afghanistan ( " the right war " ) in the presidential campaign as proof that , despite wanting to end the war in Iraq , he was tough .
( Why is it that a Democratic candidate needs a war or threat of war to trash - talk about in order to prove his " strength , " when doing so is obviously a sign of weakness ? )
Once in office , Obama compounded the damage by doubling down his bet on the war .
In March , he introduced a " comprehensive new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan " in his first significant public statement on the subject , which had expansion written all over it .
He also agreed to send in 21,000 more troops ( which , by the way , Petraeus reportedly convinced him to do ) .
In August , in another sign of weakness masquerading as strength , before an unenthusiastic audience at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , he unnecessarily declared : " This is not a war of choice .
This is a war of necessity . "
All of this he will now pay for at the hands of Petraeus , or if not him , then a coterie of military men behind the latest push for a new kind of Afghan War .
As it happens , this was never Obama 's " war of necessity . "
It was always Petraeus's .
And the new report from McChrystal and the Surgettes is undoubtedly Petraeus 's progeny as well .
It seems , in fact , cleverly put together to catch a cautious president , who was n't cautious enough about his war of choice , in a potentially devastating trap .
The military insistence on quick action on a troop decision sets up a devastating choice for the president : " Failure to provide adequate resources also risks a longer conflict , greater casualties , higher overall costs , and ultimately , a critical loss of political support .
Any of these risks , in turn , are likely to result in mission failure . "
Go against your chosen general and the failure that follows is yours alone .
( Unnamed figures supposedly close to McChrystal are already launching test balloons , passed on by others , suggesting that the general might resign in protest if the president does n't deliver -- a possibility he has denied even considering . )
On the other hand , offer him somewhere between 15,000 and 45,000 more American troops as well as other resources , and the failure that follows will still be yours .
It 's a basic lose - lose proposition and , as journalist Eric Schmitt wrote in a New York Times assessment of the situation , " it will be very hard to say no to General McChrystal . "
No wonder the president and some of his men are dragging their feet and looking elsewhere .
As one typically anonymous " defense analyst " quoted in the Los Angeles Times said , the administration is suffering " buyer 's remorse for this war ...
They never really thought about what was required , and now they have sticker shock . "
Admittedly , according to the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll , 51 % of Americans are against sending in more troops .
( Who knows how they would react to a president who went on TV to announce that he had genuinely reconsidered ? )
Official Washington is another matter .
For General Petraeus , who claims to have no political ambitions but is periodically mentioned as the Eisenhower of 2012 , how potentially peachy to launch your campaign against the president who lost you the war .
A Petraeus Moment ?
In the present context , the media language being used to describe this military - civilian conflict of wills -- frustration , impatience , split , rupture , ire -- may fall short of capturing the import of a moment which has been brewing , institutionally speaking , for a long time .
There have been increasing numbers of generals ' " revolts " of various sorts in our recent past .
Of course , George W. Bush was insistent on turning planning over to his generals ( though only when he liked them ) , something Barack Obama criticized him for during the election campaign .
( " The job of the commander in chief is to listen to the best counsel available and to listen even to people you do n't agree with and then ultimately you make the final decision and you take responsibility for those actions . " )
Now , it looks as if we are about to have a civilian - military encounter of the first order in which Obama will indeed need to take responsibility for difficult actions ( or the lack thereof ) .
If a genuine clash heats up , expect more discussion of " MacArthur moments , " but this will not be Truman versus MacArthur redux , and not just because Petraeus seems to be a subtler political player than MacArthur ever was .
Over the nearly six decades that separate us from Truman 's great moment , the Pentagon has become a far more overwhelming institution .
In Afghanistan , as in Washington , it has swallowed up much of what once was intelligence , as it is swallowing up much of what once was diplomacy .
It is linked to one of the two businesses , the Pentagon - subsidized weapons industry , which has proven an American success story even in the worst of economic times ( the other remains Hollywood ) .
It now holds a far different position in a society that seems to feed on war .
It 's one thing for the leaders of a country to say that war should be left to the generals when suddenly embroiled in conflict , quite another when that country is eternally in a state of war .
In such a case , if you turn crucial war decisions over to the military , you functionally turn foreign policy over to them as well .
All of this is made more complicated , because the cast of " civilians " theoretically pitted against the military right now includes Karl W. Eikenberry , a retired lieutenant general who is the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan , Douglas Lute , a lieutenant general who is the president 's special advisor on Afghanistan and Pakistan ( dubbed the " war czar " when he held the same position in the Bush administration ) , and James Jones , a retired Marine Corps general , who is national security advisor , not to speak of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
The question is : will an already heavily militarized foreign policy geared to endless global war be surrendered to the generals ?
Depending on what Obama does , the answer to that question may not be fully , or even largely , clarified this time around .
He may quietly give way , or they may , or compromises may be reached behind the scenes .
After all , careers and political futures are at stake .
But consider us warned .
This is a question that is not likely to go away and that may determine what this country becomes .
We know what a MacArthur moment was ; we may find out soon enough what a Petraeus moment is .

Last season the fantasy baseball world was abuzz over Matt Wieters and the potential impact he could make .
Of course , all the hype caused his value on draft day to rise exponentially , costing owners who gambled on him dearly .
In 2010 , we could see a similar situation developing with phenom Stephen Strasburg .
Strasburg , the first overall selection in the 2009 entry draft is already very well known .
Many have projected him to be a must start fantasy option right from Opening Day and while I will look at him closer as the offseason progresses and give a projection for him , his performance in the Arizona Fall League , his first true professional experience , is something that needs to be noted .
While he threw 3.1 innings of two - hit baseball in his first start , he got rocked in his second outing just a few days ago .
He allowed eight runs ( seven earned ) , including three home runs , over just 2.2 innings .
Among the hitters to take him deep were :
Russ Mitchell , a Los Angeles Dodgers 1B prospect who hit just 13 HR over 456 AB in Double - A in 2009
C.J. Retherford , a Chicago White Sox 2B prospect who hit 10 HR over 478 AB in Double - A in 2009
Casper Wells , a Detroit Tigers OF prospect who hit 15 HR over 311 AB in Double - A in 2009
While this was just one start and should not be given too much credence in what too expect from Strasburg moving forward , facing off against prospects who are far from elite , you would want to see better results .
Obviously , people are going to have bad days .
It happens to everyone .
It ’s to be expected .
Still , I hope this type of performance gives fantasy owners a bit of a wake - up call .
If the struggles of Wieters early in 2009 , not even debuting until late May and then not really producing much until September , was not enough this hopefully gives a bit more reason for owners to be cautious .
It is just one start .
He could go out there for the next few weeks and strikeout the ballpark , posting impressive rates across the board .
Still , let the lessons of our past as well as this start serve as a bit of a wake - up call .
Outside of those in dynasty formats , do not get too caught up in the hype of a player who has never stepped foot on a major league diamond .
There will be owners in your leagues who are ready to pounce on him well before many pitchers who we have already ranked in to Top 35 ( click here to view ) .
Do n’t let them force your hand into drafting him earlier than you are comfortable .
It ’s too big of a risk , and while it is one that could bring tremendous rewards , it could also sink your season .
We ’ll get a better idea in a few months as to where he ’s going in drafts , but I can already tell you it is likely too early .
We ’ll soon see , but do not throw caution to the wind when analyzing where to draft him .
He is still a rookie .
He is still no guarantee to start the season in the majors ( like Wieters or David Price ) and he certainly is no guarantee to perform up to expectations .
What are your thoughts on him ?
Is he a pitcher you are willing to reach for or will you let someone else take on the risk ?

I am sure by now you have seen splashed on the pages of Variety and echoed in most blogs and news sites that there is a chance that the graphic novel " The Strange Adventures of H.P. Lovecraft " may be made into a movie .
So I ask the lurkers ... what do you think ?
Will Ron beat del Toro to the punch and be the first to make a major Hollywood Lovecraft based production ?
Having gone to ComicCon for the last 4 years I was n't sure if they were ever going to finish the graphic novel .
So hats off .
Here is a link to an interview with the graphic novel creators on MTV : MTV Interview / Preview
Hello fellow bleacher creatures ... I 'm back .
I 've been away on a short holiday to escape from all the transfer B.S. , but it was impossible really .
Once you got the football bug , its over , you 're finished ... there 's no escape .
This article was originally supposed to be a short comment in response to this article .
The article by Salaar Shamsi was a brilliant preview of the Man Utd v Arsenal clash this Saturday .
However , I got so carried away with my comment that I decided to reproduce it as an article .
I will tell you about the 10 key events that will happen at Old Trafford so that you can place your bets accordingly .
I 'll make this short and sweet .
This is what will happen at Old Trafford on Saturday .
1 ) Arsenal will spank Man Utd 5 - 0 in front of their local fans ... most of them from China .
2 ) Nemanja Vidic will ask Sir Alex Ferguson not play him as " he 's mentally not ready . "
Apparently he 's pushing for a deadline day move to Barcelona .
3 ) Patricia Evra will be kicked by every Arsenal player from the first minute to all the way to his native Senegal , where he eventually brakes down and cries like the Patricia he really is .
4 ) Wayne Rooney will also brake down in tears midway through the second half as finally it dawns on him that his boyfriend Ronaldo left him and will never come back .
5 ) Rooney will be admitted to a mental health clinic shortly after the game .
His teammates will find him sitting alone in the shower , holding a picture of Ronaldo , and wearing nothing but a tin hat .
6 ) After the match , Sir Alex Ferguson will be struck in the face with a lasagna and slice of Pizza .
7 ) An inside source will claim that the lasagna was thrown by a middle - aged Spanish man with a dodgy goatee .
8 ) Shortly afterwards , the police will release photos of possible suspects .
9 ) Andrey Arshavin will score four goals again in a man of the match performance .
Mikael Silvestre , who comes on as late substitute , will score the fifth and kisses the badge right in front of the home fans .
10 ) Michael Owen will miss a hatrick of chances ( absolute sitters ) and , as a result , he 's murdered by Alex Ferguson after the game .
Months later , Ol ' red nose pleads in court that it was a crime of passion .
If you are offended by the content of this article , please feel free to sue me at any time .
My lawyer is Mohamed Eldin and he 'll answer everything in due course .
If you 've seen the new movie Public Enemies , you already know how John Dillinger died ( and if you have n't seen it , you probably knew anyway - Neatoramanauts are smarter than the average bear ) .
What you may not know is that the incident that finally took down Public Enemy # 1 happened on July 22 , 1934 .
Since today 's the anniversary of Dillinger 's demise , I thought it would be appropriate to revisit how some of America 's most notorious gangsters were finally brought down .
We 'll start with Mr. Dillinger himself .
John Dillinger
In 1934 , Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point , Indiana , county jail by holding up the guards there with a gun he whittled out of wood ( some accounts say it was soap ) .
He boldly stole the sheriff 's car and hightailed it from Indiana to Chicago .
Because he had crossed state lines with a stolen vehicle , the FBI got involved and started to relentlessly pursue Dillinger .
He laid low for a few months , holing up with his girlfriend in a St. Paul apartment under the alias of " Mr. Hellman . "
The landlady got suspicious , though , when " Mr. and Mrs. Hellman " refused to let the apartment caretaker in to make routine repairs and checks .
The police were called and a shootout ensued .
Dillinger escaped , but sustained a gunshot wound that needed to be treated .
From there , the duo went back to Indiana and stayed with his father for a while , then Dillinger robbed another bank in Indiana , then moved on to upper Michigan , then settled down at the Little Bohemia Lodge near Rhinelander , Wisconsin .
Another shootout occurred at the Little Bohemia , but Dillinger evaded them yet again .
It was n't until July 21 , 1934 , that the infamous woman in red ( who was actually wearing orange ) contacted officers with the information that she and a “ girlfriend of hers , ” according to the FBI , although the “ girlfriend ” was probably a fellow prostitute , would be attending the movies with Dillinger on July 22 .
She offered the information in exchange for assurance that they would try to stop her deportation , which was currently under way .
They also told her that she would receive a $ 10,000 reward if he was captured , which was clearly stated on the wanted poster .
This deal sounded good to her , and she followed up with agents the next day to let them know that they would be attending one of two theaters : either the Biograph or the Marbro .
Agents were set up to stake out each place , and at 8:30 p.m. on July 22 , as promised , the trio strolled into the Biograph Theater to see Manhattan Melodrama starring Clark Gable .
J. Edgar Hoover instructed his men not to follow them in because of all of the innocent bystanders that could be hit , so they waited until the movie got out at 10:30 .
As soon as they exited the building , Melvin Purvis , Special Agent in charge of the Chicago office , lit a cigar to signal to his men that it was time to close in .
Well , he tried to – he had trouble getting it to catch , but luckily , his men realized what he was trying to do .
Unfortunately , so did Dillinger .
He saw the men descending on him and went to pull a gun from his pants pocket .
Preferring to fire than be fired upon , Purvis ’ men fired off five shots , three of which were direct hits .
Dillinger collapsed face - down on the cement and was pronounced dead at hospital 20 minutes later .

Pretty Boy Floyd
Charles Arthur Floyd , AKA Pretty Boy , was bestowed the “ Public Enemy Number One ” title upon Dillinger ’s death , largely because he was wanted for the murder of two policemen and two FBI agents in an event known as the Kansas City Massacre .
Knowing he was next on the FBI ’s checklist , he was trying to lay low in Buffalo , New York , where he and his girlfriend shared an apartment with Adam Richetti , a member of his gang , and his moll .
By October , 1934 , the rumor is that Floyd wanted to gather up his mother and family in Oklahoma and head for Mexico .
The gang bought a car and headed for Sooner country on October 18 , but only made it as far as Ohio before Floyd wrecked the car by skidding it into a telephone pole .
The two gangsters armed themselves and prepared to wait outside of town while the women took the mangled vehicle into Wellsville , Ohio , for repairs .
Someone reported two suspicious men loitering , and when the police came to investigate the situation , Floyd and Richetti shot at them .
A gun battle ensued , and Floyd managed to escape into the woods .
He spent days hiding in the woods , living off of berries and fruit , before he managed to scrape up a final meal at a farmhouse .
Shortly thereafter , he was discovered .
At least three different stories as to how he was discovered and killed exist , but I ’ll give you the FBI ’s version first : they had been patrolling the area looking for Floyd and talking to people about any suspicious activity they may have seen when they saw a car inch out from behind a corn crib on a farm .
They were headed to question the vehicle when the vehicle crept back behind the crib , apparently deciding that it was n’t a good time to leave .
As the officers approached the car , Floyd jumped out of it with a gun , so they shot at him .
“ I ’m done for , you ’ve hit me twice , ” he reportedly told them when they closed in on him .
He was right – he died 15 minutes later .
At least one other account says that story is total bunk , created to give the FBI all the credit for bringing down the newest Public Enemy Number One .
Chester Smith , a retired policeman and skilled sharpshooter , said that he was called in to help them capture Floyd .
When Floyd appeared from behind the corn crib , Smith says he shot him twice in the legs , enough to bring him to the ground but not kill him because Melvin Purvis had specifically requested that he wanted to speak with Floyd .
Purvis questioned the wounded Floyd , and when he was done , he told agent Herman Hollis to finish the job .
Hollis then shot Floyd at point - blank range .
So , that ’s the story according to Chester Smith , which has been verified by several witnesses .
But the FBI never changed their report , so you can choose your own ending .

Baby Face Nelson
A member of Dillinger ’s gang , Baby Face Nelson had only been on the FBI ’s radar for a couple of weeks before the raid at Little Bohemia .
His actions during the shootout – taking hostages and killing officers - earned him a spot on the top five most wanted list and took him right up to # 1 after Pretty Boy Floyd ’s death .
After Dillinger died , Baby Face , his wife , and fellow gangster John Paul Chase basically roamed the country freely , going to California , New York and even back to an old hideout in Wisconsin .
The FBI finally caught up with him in Barrington , Illinois , not too far from Chicago .
The three outlaws were headed through town when Nelson passed a car with plates he recognized .
He hated law enforcement so much that he memorized the license plates of certain
Feds so he could be sure to take shots at them or vandalize their cars if he saw them .
The plates he spotted on this fateful day happened to belong to FBI agents Thomas McDade and William Ryan , who had spotted Baby Face at the same time he spotted them .
Like something out of a cartoon , they both did U - Turns in preparation to give chase and passed each other again .
After a few back - and - forth moments like that , it ended up with Nelson , his wife , and Richetti chasing after the Feds .
He did n’t know that they had called in backup , though , and soon he was being chased by a car containing agents Herman Hollis and Sam Crowley .
When he spotted them , he veered off into a nearby park and stopped , peppering the agents ’ car with bullets when they came in right after him .
Hollis and Crowley both died .
Nelson was also shot – nine times , to be exact - and died at about 7:35 that evening .
His body was dumped in the ditch in front of a Catholic church and “ someone , ” probably Helen Gillis , tipped off the police as to its whereabouts .

Ma Barker
Kate Barker – better known as “ Ma ” – probably did n’t have much to do with the crimes her sons and their friends committed .
She was definitely an accomplice and was very much aware of what they were doing , even taking care of them after their robberies , kidnappings and murders were committed .
“ It would not have occurred to her to get involved in our business , and we always made it a point of only discussing our scores when Ma was n't around , ” gang leader Alvin Karpis said .
“ We 'd leave her at home when we were arranging a job , or we 'd send her to a movie .
Ma saw a lot of movies . "
Bank robber Harvey Bailey backed Karpis up on his description of Ma , saying that Ma “ Could n’t plan breakfast , ” let alone plan a bank robbery .
Nevertheless , the FBI painted a picture of Ma Barker that made it look like she was the ringleader of the notorious Barker - Karpis gang that was n’t afraid to kill innocent bystanders and had kidnapped the likes of brewery magnate William Hamm and banker Edward Bremer , Jr. The FBI had been quietly tracking Ma ’s letters for months – she and son Fred were holed up in Lake Weir , Florida , and she was keeping in touch with the other three .
They traced her to the Lake Weir cottage , where she and Fred died in a flurry of bullets .
The FBI says Ma died with a Tommy gun in her hand , but anyone who knew her says that ’s preposterous .
Some theories say that she killed herself after Freddie died because she was too scared to come out of the house , and the embarrassed FBI spread the rumor that she was just as vicious as the rest of them just to cover their butts .

Al Capone
.
The original Scarface probably would have preferred to die in a blaze of “ glory ” instead of how he really died – but we ’ll get to that in a second ( you probably already know the punchline anyway ) .
You already know what a bad dude Al Capone was - he was responsible for the Valentine 's Day Massacre , he illegally smuggled liquor and he was involved in a gang war with Bugs Moran .
As his speakeasies got busted by Eliot Ness , Capone decided to ( or was convinced to , by some accounts ) go to the Eastern State Penitentiary for a while to lay low and avoid drawing attention to himself .
It worked - maybe too well .
When he got out and went back to his home base in Chicago , he found that his finances and legal issues were a total mess .
The U.S. Treasury Department had been building a tax evasion case against Capone , his brother , and two other gangsters while he was away .
He stood trial and on June 16 , 1931 , pled guilty to tax evasion , telling the judge that he had arranged a deal for a two - and - a - half year sentence only .
The presiding judge smirked and informed Capone that he was under no obligation to consider any sort of a prior deal Capone may have made and promptly sentenced him to 11 years in Federal prison .
He served seven years , six months and 15 days of that sentence before he was released , his health in severe decline from syphilis he had contracted when he was a much younger man .
Although he took treatment for it immediately after leaving prison , he was never the same again .
By 1946 , he was reduced to the mentality of a 12 - year - old child , according to his doctor , and would rant about Bugs Moran , Communists and immigrants .
He had a stroke on January 21 , 1947 , and died from cardiac arrest four days later .

A roundup of a few others :
Bugs Moran died of lung cancer while doing time in Leavenworth Prison .
George " Machine Gun " Kelly had a heart attack at Leavenworth Prison .
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were , obviously , gunned down on May 23 , 1934 , in an ambush by Texas and Louisiana law enforcement .
Lucky Luciano had a heart attack and died at the Naples International Airport in Italy .
Bugsy Siegel was sitting in his girlfriend 's Beverly Hills house reading the newspaper when he was fired at through the window and was hit twice in the head .
The murder is still unsolved .
In July , about twenty design students and recent fashion - school graduates from all over the world received e-mails inviting them to show at “ Iceland Fashion Week . ”
They thought it was a thrilling opportunity ( plus , there was the allure of Iceland ’s natural wonders ) .
Many that we spoke to worked around the clock preparing for the September 6 show , and others maxed out their credit cards to purchase flights from as far away as South Korea , Poland , Brazil , and Spain .
But shortly after they arrived on September 2 , they realized that Iceland Fashion Week was far from glamorous .
The first red flag went up when they found their accommodations — not a hotel , but a former NATO military base , abandoned in 2006 , an hour away from Reykjavik and isolated among rocky fields .
The first model casting was held in an aerobics studio of an open gym ; the second was in a shopping mall .
The first runway show was in a Lexus dealership that featured models with glitter Lexus symbols on their chests , the men in furry boots and briefs .
On the morning of the main event , the September 6 group show , two designers , Juan Hernandez Daels and Narelle Dore , drove to get a look at the stage and discovered what looked like a county fair for the small town of Keflavik , complete with stalls selling hot dogs and amusement rides .
The runway was constructed from boxes of Icelandic Glacial water , stacked on the wooden pallets and still wrapped in plastic .
A huge poster of a water bottle was behind the stage .
Iceland ’s recent financial woes — a debt of 50 billion euros for a population of only 300,000 — were not to blame for this shill - friendly joke of a fashion week .
The event is the brainchild of former Icelandic Models doyenne Kolbrún Aðalsteinsdóttir , and in no way officially sanctioned .
Aðalsteinsdóttir , who goes by Kolla and has the demeanor of a drill sergeant , copyrighted the name Iceland Fashion Week in 2003 .
Her entire organization is comprised of four people , including a bus driver .
Iceland ’s fashion community boycotts her huckster presentations .
“ She is unstable , disorganized , and has no one behind her , ” says Gunnar Hilmarsson , the chairman of both the Icelandic Fashion Counsel and Iceland Design Centre .
“ You have to bring the unions , city , trade council into it .
She does n’t have that .
This is a disaster , which is why we are looking into how to stop it . ”
But the show , such as it was , went on .
The bus pulled into the fairgrounds with the designers on the afternoon of the sixth .
The seats in front of the stage were half - filled with townspeople , mostly women with strollers and their children .
Fairground music could be heard piping in the distance .
The water - bottle runway drew special ire .
“ I do n’t want my clothes to be shown on plastic ! ” seethed Kaytee Papusza .
“ I mean , barf on my face five times .
It ’s disgusting ! ”
The Icelandic models were also freaking out .
“ I am trying to process this , ” muttered one .
Kolla ’s “ gonna get smacked in the face in a little bit , ” another added .
Meanwhile , Iceland Fashion Week director Andrew Lockhart dodged questions .
“ I have n’t had anything to do with this , ” he said .
“ I do n’t deal with the show . ”
( Lockhart , affiliated with Kolla since 2003 and a partner in the organization , has since severed ties with her . )
When Kolla finally arrived to finesse the situation , she inflamed it instead .
“ Have you never been in Milan Fashion Week ? ” she asked the livid group of designers .
“ It is just like this .
Have you been to Paris Fashion Week ? ”
She went on : “ The situation is really good here !
Everyone is really happy .
The light is unbelievable !
The runway is on the website , so everyone knew the runway before they came . ”
( The runway was not , in fact , on the site . )
Kolla then tried to have Karelle Levy , the Miami designer behind KRELwear , who was loudly protesting , arrested for disorderly contact .
Catalin Botezatu , who earlier showed the questionable Lexus swimwear , was unswayed by the hoopla and commenced his runway show of sequined Carol Burnett Show–style dresses .
Then it began to rain .
Shortly after , the bus abruptly departed , leaving the designers and their collections in the downpour .
( They lugged their things uphill to find taxis and return to the barracks . )
That night , some of the designers staged a show at a Reykjavic discothèque , christened “ Rebel , ” so that their trip would n’t be a complete waste of time .
The club , via Andrew Lockhart , charged the group $ 1,800 for the privilege .
In the rarefied world of supercars , some names stand alone .
Ferrari . Bugatti . Lamborghini .
But there are all kinds of boutique automakers producing small numbers of outrageously expensive and stunningly quick cars , and Spyker has to be one of the coolest .
The Dutch company has been building sports cars at a rate of about 60 per year since 2000 , but its history dates to 1875 when it started making coaches – horse - drawn coaches .
It switched to automobiles in 1898 and turned out airplanes during World War I .
Spyker folded in 1925 and was little more than an automotive footnote until the late 1990s , when Dutch lawyer Victor Muller resurrected the name .
Spyker was in Monterey , California last month to unveil its newest car , the C8 Aileron Spyder , at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance .
But the car that really caught our eye was this C8 Spyder SWB ( those names get so confusing to the uninitiated ) that we spotted at the Sports & Classics of Monterey auction .
Our own Jim Merithew snapped some pics .
The design of the Spyder SWB ( which stands for short wheelbase and is such a mouthful that the car will henceforth be called the Spyder ) draws from the company 's aviation heritage .
People will either love the styling or hate it .
Yet the Spyder is more subdued than the C8 Aileron hardtop , which has more scoops than Baskin - Robbins .
Spykers have excellent proportions and a beautiful silhouette , though some might think the Spyder looks a bit like a catfish from the front .
Power comes from a 400 horsepower 4.2 - liter V8 engine .
It is mounted in the middle of the car , where it belongs , and mated to a six - speed manual with a beautiful exposed shift linkage ( shown above ) .
A very burly security guard with no sense of humor prevented us from seeing how the shifter action feels .
The turned aluminum panels , machined switches and polished metal give the interior an industrial chic that borders on steampunk .
Anyone wealthy enough to buy a Spyker – the Spyder starts well north of $ 200,000 – can pretty much choose their own paint and interior colors .
Some models come with an optional set of Louis Vuitton luggage because you would n't want your bags clashing with your car .
That 's Latin .
It means " For the tenacious , no road is impassable . "
It has been Spyker 's motto since 1914 .
The Spyder accelerates from zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds and has a top speed of 187 mph .
We 'll have to take Spyker 's word on that , because no one was willing to give us the keys so we could see how it handles the winding roads around Monterey .
In keeping with Spyker 's aviation heritage – the company built about 100 fighter planes and 200 aircraft engines during World War I – its logo incorporates a propeller and a wheel .
It appears on the hood , the rear deck and on what has to be the coolest gas cap ever .
We could n't clear the room to get an unobstructed shot of the car , so here 's a nice handout pic from Spyker so no one whines about us not providing a money shot .
And this , dear readers , is the C8 Aileron Spyder that Spyker unveiled at Pebble Beach .
It 's got a 400 - horsepower 4.2 - liter V8 pulled from the Audi parts bin , and for the first time you can get a Spyker with either an automatic or a six - speed manual gearbox .
It does zero to 60 in 4.5 seconds and has a top speed of 187 mph .
That wing - shaped red thing is an aluminum suitcase sitting on a luggage rack milled from billet aluminum .
You can't read it in this pic , but the company 's Latin motto , Nulla Tenaci Invia Est Via , is inscribed around the tonneau cover .
Why ?
Who knows .
But it looks cool .
UPDATE : Well , this is embarrassing .
As several readers have noted , I completely dropped the ball and misidentified the car in the pics .
It is the C8 Spyder SWB , not the Aileron Spyder .
I 've corrected / updated the post .
And to the readers who caught the error , we 're looking for a couple of bloggers ...

Civilian contractors working for the Pentagon in Afghanistan not only outnumber the uniformed troops , according to a report by a Congressional research group , but also form the highest ratio of contractors to military personnel recorded in any war in the history of the United States .
On a superficial level , the shift means that most of those representing the United States in the war will be wearing the scruffy cargo pants , polo shirts , baseball caps and other casual accouterments favored by overseas contractors rather than the fatigues and flight suits of the military .
More fundamentally , the contractors who are a majority of the force in what has become the most important American enterprise abroad are subject to lines of authority that are less clear - cut than they are for their military colleagues .
What is clear , the report says , is that when contractors for the Pentagon or other agencies are not properly managed  as when civilian interrogators committed abuses at Abu Ghraib in Iraq or members of the security firm Blackwater shot and killed 17 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad  the American effort can be severely undermined .
I 'll let Rasputin do the talking for me today , on the ongoing drama surrounding the U.S. Dollar , otherwise referred to as the " U.S. Nightcrawler " .
Apparently , the Fed is willing and able to monetize rotten Cabela 's bait and hook receivables , breast implant and liposuction receivables , 0 % Best Buy LCD TV receivables , etc. from the bleeding private label bagholders via its Alphabet Soup programs .
No wonder the U.S. Dollar is taking a drubbing .
Yet interest rates remain at or near 40 - year lows , the U.S. continues to finance its huge deficits without a hitch , each issue going out 300 % oversubscribed , and the Asian and OPEC debt enablers keep swallowing more and more nightcrawlers .
Imagine Ben and Timmy with their hands in the bait can , flinging more and more of this stuff :
Rasputin describes the situation the best :
" World trade -- which has fallen off roughly THIRTY - PERCENT in the last year -- is even beyond the drop seen in the previous Great Depression .
The question now becomes :
" What happens next ? "
... and from everything I 'm seeing ( Australia 's central bank notwithstanding ) is the most massive , coordinated , pervasive , abusive MONETIZATION , REFLATION , NATIONALIZATION AND FIAT -FLINGING the world has ever witnessed by all major governments and central banks .
And , as Mish points out here :
http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2009/10/competitive-currency-debasement-look-at.html
... even China is partaking in a true " Beggar thy Neighbor / Race to the Bottom " currency debasement , so it is n't just the Western World trashing their currency .
So , either these central banks and governments are willing to continue to burn their currencies to the ground , AND the U.S. is allowed to go back to the " good ol ' days " of running up FOUR TRILLION FIATSCOS per year of brand new debt ( over and above the near sixty - trillion we already collectively owe ) in order to again become " The mouth of the world " , or it 's back to " Great Disintegration I " .
Frankly , I 'd rather see the latter than the former take place , but I suspect that the world 's central banks and governments are going to try to incite " Global Weimar " in order to keep the whole " Ponzi Pyramid of Debt and Derivatives Death " from continuing to implode .
Uncle Sugar runs up a $ 1.5 trillion fiatsco deficit , yet manages to sell 10 - year Treasuries at a 3.21 % interest rate .
Now , here 's the funny part :
Nearly thirty years ago , the world was going BERSERK when Uncle Sugar 's TOTAL debt -- accumulated during the first two - hundred years of this country 's existence -- reached one trillion fiatscos .
Total .
One Trillion .
And , as previously mentioned , it took over two - hundred years to get there .
The result of this fiscal extravagance was that the " Bond Vigilantes " smacked Uncle Sugar with upwards of SIXTEEN PERCENT interest rates to compensate them for their perceived risk of funding his financial infidelity .
And today ?
Uncle Sugar is running up more than the ENTIRE budget - deficit - to - date back in 1980 in ONE SINGLE YEAR , yet he only has to pay ONE - FIFTH the interest rate on new debt ?
Oh , and by the way , do n't for a minute believe that one - point - five trillion number is anywhere near accurate .
It 's not .
Between the stealing ...er... " borrowing " of funds from Social Security and the " off - budget " items , the real number is probably closer to two trillion .
And let us also not forget that it is n't exactly like our dear Uncle has been a model of fiscal sobriety in these last thirty years , as he has run up twelve trillion fiatscos of debt prior to going on this latest bender .
Meanwhile , regarding the U.S. nightcrawler ...
Forty - six friggin ' percent fall over twenty - four years .
Would you call that a trend ?
If an investment or asset fell forty - six percent , nearly one - half , over a period of twenty - four years , would you consider it a loser ?
Would you stick with it , or get rid of it in disgust , finally throwing in the towel ?
Well , that very question is one with which our foreign debt enablers are wrestling , as they have watched the U.S. fiatsco fall from its 1985 high of :
164
... to today 's roughly :
76
... crushing the value of their holdings of our debt .
And they 're not happy about it .
In fact , as this lengthy - but - informative Bloomberg article so vividly reveals :
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aPoUCijvAfCk
... our creditors are seriously considering -- and moving into -- alternatives to the U.S. nightcrawler - backed buck .
Furthermore , the empty rhetoric of Turbo Tax Timmy's :
" A strong U.S. fiatsco , blah , blah ... "
... is falling on deaf ears , as the world is finally figuring out that the U.S. wants a WEAK nightcrawler , not a strong one , in order to allow us to cheat our debt holders and even allow Amerika 's few remaining exporters to show a profit .
( Ras Conclusion ) :
The trend is undeniable :
- Twenty - four years .
- Forty - six percent fall in the U.S. fiatsco .
- U.S. fiatsco share of world reserves dropping .
- Debt enablers moving to alternate currencies and buggy whips .
- Those same debt enablers balking at buying more of Uncle 's debt .
- Uncle states he wants to borrow another three - trillion fiatscos in two years .
( And ten trillion in ten years )
- Uncle and the Fed both actively trying to destroy the value of the nightcrawler .
Yet , people STILL believe that the U.S. fiatsco is gonna magically RISE , even as Uncle Sugar continues to pile debt to the sky and our debt enablers are moving away from our currency in droves and the Fed will be the ONLY buyer of Uncle 's debt ?
Imagine being an Asian central bank -- already stuffed to the gills with U.S. nightcrawlers -- then being forced to SUCK DOWN MORE of the creepy , crawly things just to keep your own export industries continuing their utter collapse .
.....................
Same old junk running today .
Despite world record unemployment , accelerating foreclosures , negative GDP as far as the eye can see , the Gamblers continue to pile into retail stocks :
I 'm building an electric car .
I 'm a regular guy .
I have no experience as a mechanic , I do n't have a lot of time and I do n't have a lot of money .
So , why am I doing this ?
It 's on my list .
Everyone has a list .
You know the one .
It 's everything you want to do if only you had the time .
Climb a mountain , see the pyramids , start your own company , form a rock band .
I 've had an EV conversion on my list for some time now , but like other items on The List it always has been just out of reach .
Budget , time and relatively little mechanical skill are all decent excuses for putting it off .
Budget is a really big one , but I digress .
So why am I converting a ' 67 Volkswagen Beetle to run on batteries ?
Saving money and energy are great reasons .
But my biggest is curiosity .
On paper , I could enjoy substantial savings avoiding the gas pump using technology that has been around as long as there have been cars .
But are those " paper " savings reality ?
And can an average Joe like me pull this off on a shoestring budget ?
If I can do it , anyone can .
I have no significant experience working on cars .
But in the past two weeks , I 've met people who do .
Brian Berrett owns Wilderness EV , a conversion kit supplier in Payson , Utah , not far from where I live .
He told me the candid truth about a project like this .
" There is a massive canyon between ' can ' and ' did , ' and most people stay in ' can , ' " he said .
So I 'm going to do it , knowing that if I do n't try today , life will simply continue to pass me by while yet another item on my list remains unchecked .
The first step in was a visit to Berrett and Ralph Finlinson .
Finlinson is an EV converter and dealer of sorts .
They are n't partners , but Finlinson uses Berrett 's kits for his own Bug conversions and Berrett sends customers his way .
They 've collaborated on a few projects , including their current project , " SK - 1 . "
It 's an electric vehicle they claim will offer 70 percent of the performance of the Tesla Roadster at 25 percent the cost .
Finlinson is one of those salt - of - the - earth types with a personality at least as big as he is .
He 'll tell you exactly how it is and dare you to challenge him so he can prove you wrong .
He is a pleasure to be around .
He was so eager to get me in an EV – the yellow Bug in the pics – when I arrived that I did n't have time for a proper introduction .
The second I stepped out of the car , he was putting me on an electric trike with a front wheel hub motor .
Finlinson 's been working on cars for 40 years , mostly restoring Beetles .
Berrett is an engineer who worked at JPL and Micron before starting his conversion kit business a few years back .
True believers in the KISS principal – Keep it simple , stupid .
– they 're the type of guys who would be willing to use a little duct tape ( expertly wielded , of course ) to get a conversion heading down the road while everyone else argued about whether to fabricate the part from aluminum or carbon fiber .
I was excited about driving an EV .
It was my first time in one .
The Bug that Finlinson put me in ( pictured ) was a bare - bones conversion with a 72 - volt battery pack made up of six 12 volt batteries and a 40 horsepower motor .
I was impressed by the car 's responsiveness at neighborhood speeds and how extremely quiet it was .
Shifting the manual transmission without a clutch took a little getting used to , but was really quite easy .
Unlike internal combustion engines , electric motors are more efficient at higher RPMs and have a relatively flat torque curve .
Cruising around the neighborhood , I never had to shift out of second gear , so the car could be driven like an automatic .
Set it and forget it .
It topped out at around 45 mph and it took a while to get there , but then the Bug never was very fast to begin with .
It would be fine for my needs , and a conversion like this can be done for less than $ 5,000 .
Old - school Bugs weigh about a ton , which is n't much for a car .
The light weight , lack of power steering and brakes and ready availability of parts make them a great choice for conversions .
And since I barely know a spark plug from a glow plug , the sheer simplicity of the Bug works in my favor .
Finlinson has more than 20 Bugs lying around in various states of repair .
I 've got my eye on a sky blue ' 67 the previous owner partially restored before having an engine fire .
The body is in great shape , it is mechanically sound and the tires are good .
It 's ideal for a conversion , and Finlinson says he 'll give me a good deal on it .
I 've got a line on a motor and some batteries .
At this point my biggest concern is how much I 'll have to spend for a car that meets my needs .
I do n't need much , just a car for daily commuting .
I will need at least 20 miles of range and I 'll need to be able to cruise at 55 mph .
You can go faster , but you need more batteries and a bigger motor .
In other words , you need more money .
Did I forget to mention my budget ?
I hate breaking shoestrings .
Got any advice , suggestions or ideas for Matthew ?

That 40 horsepower electric motor is every bit as quiet as the Bug 's engine was loud .
It 's simpler , too .
Six lead - acid batteries provide the juice .
I 'm gonna need a pile of these for my project .
Any suggestions ?
All the car needs is one of those silly " Power By Honda " decals you see on lowered Civics with bad body kits .

September 29th , 2009 Tags : d language , programming Security : Subject : Tree visits in D Time : 09:28 pm
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tree_traversal
Problem : Implement a binary tree where each node carries an integer , and implement preoder , inorder , postorder and level - order traversal .
Use those traversals to output the following tree :
1 / \ / \ / \ 2 3 / \ / 4 5 6 / / \ 7 8 9
The correct output should look like this : preorder : 1 2 4 7 5 3 6 8 9 inorder : 7 4 2 5 1 8 6 9 3 postorder : 7 4 5 2 8 9 6 3 1 level - order : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The following is my D implementation .
I have used the D Version 2 language ( to compile the code I am using DMD v2.032 , with the Phobos std lib , but it uses only the printing of Phobos , so adapting the code to Tango is easy ) , but a very similar version can be adapted for D V1 .
Disclaimer :
The following is n't an example of common ( or good ) D code .
It 's very generic and it's a bit tricky .
In practice you usually write simpler code , because you do n't need such genericity , and to keep the code simpler to write and understand .
Simpler code is also simpler to debug .
You may need to write code so much generic only in library - like routines , that are usually limited in number and size .
So there are surely ways to write simpler / shorter D code , but here I show this version because it can be useful to explain some features of the D language , and because it 's more fun .
import std. stdio : write , writeln ;
class Node ( T ) {
T data ;
Node left , right ;
this ( T data , Node left = null , Node right = null ) {
this .
data = data ;
this .
left = left ;
this .
right = right ;
}
}
// static templated opCall can't be used in Node
auto node ( T ) ( T data , Node !
T left = null , Node !
T right = null ) {
return new Node !
T ( data , left , right ) ;
}
void show ( T ) ( T x ) {
write ( x , " " ) ;
}
enum Visit { pre , inv , post }
// visitor can be any kind of callable or it uses a default visitor .
// TNode can be any kind of Node , with data , left and right fields ,
// so this is more generic than a member function of Node .
void backtrackingOrder ( Visit v , TNode , TyF = void * ) ( TNode node , TyF visitor = null ) {
static if ( is ( TyF == void * ) ) auto truevisitor = & show ! ( typeof ( node . data ) ) ;
else auto truevisitor = visitor ;
if ( node ! is null ) {
static if ( v == Visit. pre ) truevisitor ( node . data ) ;
backtrackingOrder !
v ( node .
left , visitor ) ;
static if ( v == Visit. inv ) truevisitor ( node . data ) ;
backtrackingOrder !
v ( node .
right , visitor ) ;
static if ( v == Visit .
post ) truevisitor ( node . data ) ;
}
}
void levelOrder ( TNode , TyF = void * ) ( TNode node , TyF visitor = null , TNode [ ] more = [ ] ) {
static if ( is ( TyF == void * ) ) auto truevisitor = & show ! ( typeof ( node . data ) ) ;
else auto truevisitor = visitor ;
if ( node ! is null ) {
more ~= [ node .
left , node .
right ] ;
truevisitor ( node . data ) ;
}
if ( more .
length )
levelOrder ( more [ 0 ] , truevisitor , more [ 1 .. $ ] ) ;
}
void main ( ) {
auto tree = node ( 1 ,
node ( 2 ,
node ( 4 ,
node ( 7 ) ) ,
node ( 5 ) ) ,
node ( 3 ,
node ( 6 ,
node ( 8 ) ,
node ( 9 ) ) ) ) ;
write ( " preOrder : " ) ;
backtrackingOrder !
( Visit. pre ) ( tree ) ;
write ( "
inOrder : " ) ;
backtrackingOrder !
( Visit. inv ) ( tree ) ;
write ( "
postOrder : " ) ;
backtrackingOrder !
( Visit. post ) ( tree ) ;
write ( "
levelorder : " ) ;
levelOrder ( tree ) ;
writeln ( ) ;
} Output : preOrder : 1 2 4 7 5 3 6 8 9 inOrder : 7 4 2 5 1 8 6 9 3 postOrder : 7 4 5 2 8 9 6 3 1 levelorder : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A possible design for Java is to create a Node class ( using generics to allow for different types of data ) that has preOrder , InOrder , etc , methods .
This simple design can be used in D too .
But it conflates data structure and algorithms , so you can't use the same algorithms ( the tree visits ) for other kinds of nodes .
So if your language is flexible enough ( like C++ , D , Haskell , or Python ) it 's better to follow the strategy used in the C++ STL , and implement generic algorithms , that work with more kinds of binary tree nodes and allow for a more flexible management of the node being visited .
Another design that can be natural in modern versions of Python is to create iterators , that yield the current node .
This is very handy , and such strategy can be used in D too ( with opApply or with the second iteration protocol of D2 ) but I have not used it in my D code .
In Python ( and in some other languages , in D too if you use opApply ) this strategy leads to O( n ^ 2 ) tree visits .
( There is a Python PEP that if well implemented may solve this problem ) .
Th flexibility of D language has allowed me to merge the three backtracking visits ( pre , in and post - order ) in a single templated function with zero overehead .
In the code I have used a class to represent the node to keep code a little simpler , but a struct too can be used with very small changes .
Such structs are smaller 8 bytes less on a 32 bit system ) and it's simpler to allocate them with a memory pool that can halve the time needed to create and allocate the tree .
I have added a helper node ( ) templated function , it just allocates a new node and returns it .
In D something similar can also be done with a static opCall inside Node , but here it's also templated , and templatd methods can't replace opCall of object ( I may be wrong on this , but I do n't think so ) .
If you have a different Node class / struct you need a different helper function , or you have to use opCall ( if the Node is n't generic ) or you have to build the tree in a simpler way .
Node !T is the new compact syntax introduced in D2 to instantiate a template when you have a single argument .
The standard older syntax is Node ! ( T ) , that equals to C++ Node .
show ( ) is a little function that 's used as default visitor of the node .
It 's templated , so you have to instantiate it before taking its address to use it as function pointer .
backtrackingOrder ( ) merges the three tree visits , its code is a little tricky .
The enum Visit is used to represent one of the three possible visits .
To specify it you can first partial specify backtracking Order ( ) according to visit type known a compile - time , and then you can fully specify it automatically with the given root node and an optional callable .
The node can be any type that has a left , right and node attributes .
visitor can be any callable , a delegate , function pointer , or callable object .
If visitor is unspecified you can omit it , and it uses show ( ) instantiated on the type of the data .
The static ifs are done at compile time , and they do n't create a scope , so truevisitor ( its type is found automatically ) is then visible under the static if .
The is ( ) syntax is used to test if types are the same ( a better simpler design for the D language is just to allow == between them ) .
In library code you may add few more static asserts inside backtracking Order ( ) to test that visitor is a callable , with a line of code like :
static assert ( IsCallable !( typeof ( truevisitor ) ) , " ... " ) ;
On the RosettaCode site there 's this Programming Task : Problem : Implement a binary tree where each node carries an integer , and implement preoder , inorder , postorder and level - order traversal .
Use those traversals to output the following tree :
The following is my D implementation .
I have used the D Version 2 language ( to compile the code I am using DMD v2.032 , with the Phobos std lib , but it uses only the printing of Phobos , so adapting the code to Tango is easy ) , but a very similar version can be adapted for D V1 .
Disclaimer :
The following is n't an example of common ( or good ) D code .
It 's very generic and it's a bit tricky .
In practice you usually write simpler code , because you do n't need such genericity , and to keep the code simpler to write and understand .
Simpler code is also simpler to debug .
You may need to write code so much generic only in library - like routines , that are usually limited in number and size .
So there are surely ways to write simpler / shorter D code , but here I show this version because it can be useful to explain some features of the D language , and because it 's more fun .
A possible design for Java is to create a Node class ( using generics to allow for different types of data ) that has preOrder , InOrder , etc , methods .
This simple design can be used in D too .
But it conflates data structure and algorithms , so you can't use the same algorithms ( the tree visits ) for other kinds of nodes .
So if your language is flexible enough ( like C++ , D , Haskell , or Python ) it 's better to follow the strategy used in the C++ STL , and implement generic algorithms , that work with more kinds of binary tree nodes and allow for a more flexible management of the node being visited .
Another design that can be natural in modern versions of Python is to create iterators , that yield the current node .
This is very handy , and such strategy can be used in D too ( with opApply or with the second iteration protocol of D2 ) but I have not used it in my D code .
In Python ( and in some other languages , in D too if you use opApply ) this strategy leads to O( n ^ 2 ) tree visits .
( There is a Python PEP that if well implemented may solve this problem ) .
Th flexibility of D language has allowed me to merge the three backtracking visits ( pre , in and post - order ) in a single templated function with zero overehead .
In the code I have used a class to represent the node to keep code a little simpler , but a struct too can be used with very small changes .
Such structs are smaller 8 bytes less on a 32 bit system ) and it's simpler to allocate them with a memory pool that can halve the time needed to create and allocate the tree .
I have added a helper node ( ) templated function , it just allocates a new node and returns it .
In D something similar can also be done with a static opCall inside Node , but here it's also templated , and templatd methods can't replace opCall of object ( I may be wrong on this , but I do n't think so ) .
If you have a different Node class / struct you need a different helper function , or you have to use opCall ( if the Node is n't generic ) or you have to build the tree in a simpler way .
Node !
T is the new compact syntax introduced in D2 to instantiate a template when you have a single argument .
The standard older syntax is Node ! ( T ) , that equals to C++

An Italian thief thanked police officers for arresting him and putting an end to a beating from Korean tourists whom he had robbed in Rome , police say .
" I must thank you ; they were massacring me , " the 48 - year - old criminal told police on Monday after he was arrested near the Theatre of Marcellus , one of the monuments in Rome 's historic centre .
The thief , from the northern region of Liguria , stole a handbag from a Korean family when they were not paying attention .
He threatened the family with a knife when he was spotted and then tried to flee .
Two men from the family , in their 20s , chased him for several hundred metres before they got him down with taekwondo moves .
They disarmed the thief and continued to beat him .
A patrolling police officer intervened , separated the three and arrested the thief immediately .

So , I have a good twitter friend , Gwen Hayes .
She ’s a total sweetheart , and the kind of writer I strive to be .
Earlier today she got into a little twitter battle with Scott Baio .
Oh , you do n’t remember him ?
Here , let me refresh your memory :
Now , I ’m not going to lie to you people .
When I was in middle school , and he was yukkin it up with his crazy best friend on the late eighties sitcom , Charles in Charge –I had a little crush .
What ?
He was a cutie …
But now , he ’s on twitter .
And –he ’s a little opinionated .
He started ragging on the president .
So , she responded :
And , so he responded :
Then he blocked her .
How sad is that ?
Everyone ’s sixth grade crush blocked a fan .
Ouch .
I guess he just is n’t that in to the whole ‘ being cool to his tweeps ’ thing .
But , I ’m super bored a good friend … so I stuck up for her :
And then … that boy who lived under those stairs and of COURSE that boy who loved Joanie …
He Dm ’d me !
He actually sent me a direct message .
When I opened my email program , I saw this :
Wait , what ?
Scott Baio sent me a direct message on twitter ?
Oh for cripes sake !
I had to read it !
So , I opened up my twitter page and in one fell swoop , my childhood was crushed .
Turns out Scott Baio is a crochety old douchebag .
He lives for family and GOLF ?
He equates an activity where you stand around all day and swing a titanium stick at a tiny ball a few times to his FAMILY ?
Wow … I guess it ’s true what they say about those childhood actors–they really do go nuts .
Way to ruin it , Scott .
Maybe you could call Kirk Cameron and have him pee all over my eighth grade feelings for him , too .
Want to read the rest of this story ?
That ’s right , it does n’t end here –Scott Baio continues his douchebaggery in Part Two , and Part Three .

The US space agency 's Ares 1 - X test rocket has reached its launch pad at Florida 's Kennedy Space Center .
The launcher 's journey from its assembly building to the pad took nearly eight hours .
The super - slim , 100 m - tall launcher is a demonstrator for the vehicle Nasa plans to use in the next decade to take its new astronaut crewship into orbit .
The Ares I - X is expected to make an unmanned , two - minute flight at the end of the month .
The purpose is to check out basic design concepts and gather engineering data .
However , the project 's long - term future is uncertain and could conceivably be cancelled in the coming months .
US President Barack Obama convened an expert panel back in May to review American human spaceflight plans and priorities .
Led by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm Augustine , the advisory group has suggested a range of options for getting astronauts into space - most of which do not require the new stick - like Ares launcher .
The rocket was brought out on a large crawler - transporter
The committee is expected to deliver its final report to the White House this week .
The Ares 1 - X started its move from the giant Vehicle Assembly Building ( VAB ) at the Kennedy Space Center at around 0639 BST ( 0139 EDT ) on Tuesday .
It was carried atop a huge crawler - transporter vehicle during the 6.7 km ( 4.2 miles ) journey to launch pad 39B .
The rocket is now positioned on the pad and engineers are establishing mechanical and electrical connections .
Later today , a vehicle stabilisation system - to steady the rocket against high winds - and a rotating service structure will be deployed .
The $ 350 m ( £ 213 m ; 234 m euro ) test launch is scheduled to take place from the Florida spaceport no earlier than the 27th of the month .
The 1 - X will climb about 40 km ( 25 miles ) into the sky during the powered phase of its flight , continuously measuring vehicle aerodynamics , controls and performance of the rocket 's first stage .
The demonstrator will help verify design assumptions so that when the Ares 1 proper is built , the engineers can be confident it will fly as expected .
" It 's a tall rocket ; it 's been over three decades since anyone has built a rocket this tall .
That was the Saturn V , " explained Trent Smith , the vehicle processing engineer for the Ares 1 - X .
" We have over 700 sensors on this rocket ; and the whole point of Ares 1 - X is to understand how does a rocket this shape , this weight , this tall actually fly , " he told BBC News .
The top half of the 1 - X is a dummy .
What would be an upper - stage , with a crew capsule and its emergency escape mechanism are simulators made to the correct shape and weight .
Once the first stage has been extinguished and has separated from the top of the 1 - X , all the elements will come back to Earth .
The first - stage booster will parachute into the Atlantic Ocean where it will be recovered for inspection by engineers .
The simulation elements of the vehicle will be destroyed on impact with the water .
The US space agency is scheduled to retire its space shuttles next year , and has begun the development of a new human space launch " architecture " called Constellation .
The architecture calls for two new rockets : the Ares 1 to launch crew , and a new heavy - lift rocket known as Ares 5 that could put into orbit the equipment needed by a manned capsule to travel to the Moon and beyond .
However , all the systems are under review , and many commentators expect the Ares development plans to be heavily modified or even cancelled .
If it is allowed to proceed , a manned Ares 1 is not expected to fly before 2016 .

After waiting for a warm , summery day , biologist Doug Taron and a handful of colleagues fanned out through a thousand acres of restored prairie this month , stroking plants with delicate paintbrushes in hopes of adding a little color next summer .
Their medium was not oil paint or watercolors , but dark little caterpillars that will turn into Baltimore checkerspot butterflies .
They dipped their brushes into cups , picking up one or two of the tiny , quarter - inch creatures on the tip , and transferred them just beneath the leaves atop slender stalks of turtlehead , a native wetland prairie plant on the grounds of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , near Batavia , Ill .
It is an experiment , said Taron , curator of biology at Chicago 's Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum .
If it goes according to plan , 20 or so of the caterpillars will gather in leaf litter at the base of the stalk as the plant dies and hibernate in a loosely spun web as a colony for the winter .
In the spring , they will wake up , pupate into the chrysalis stage and emerge as adult butterflies .
" This is one of the flashier butterflies in this state , " Taron said of the Baltimore checkerspot , a big , dark - winged butterfly with wings 2 to 3 inches across , spattered in patterned orange and white spots .
Taron and Vincent Olivares , the Nature Museum 's director of arthropod conservation , are Midwest pioneers in trying to captively breed rare and endangered butterfly species in large numbers and restore them to nature , hoping they repopulate natural areas where they have not lived in many decades .
The Baltimore checkerspot is not an endangered species , but because Illinois has less than 1 percent of the checkerspot habitat that it had 200 years ago , they are a rare sight , Taron said .
" What we 're doing is a pre-emptive strike , taking action before it becomes a seriously endangered species , " he said .
" We 'd like to keep it away from becoming endangered . "
Taron and Olivares work closely with area butterfly enthusiasts and prairie and wetland restoration projects .
As native plants are re-introduced to pockets of agricultural land , the pair also tries to assess what animals used to live there -- including butterflies -- and when possible restore those , too , as a part of the old , natural ecosystem .
In 1975 , Fermilab decided to restore some of its thousands of acres to native prairie , a project that continues successfully to this day .
The hallmark of an ecosystem favored by the Baltimore checkerspot is the turtlehead plant , named for the shape of its leaves .
Females lay eggs on the turtlehead plants in the summer because it is only that plant the caterpillars feed upon when they hatch from the eggs .
Turtlehead was not planted at first in the Fermilab prairie restoration .
But a few years ago Tom Peterson , a Fermilab engineer and butterfly enthusiast , suspected they had been native to the area .
He arranged plantings of the wetland species in appropriate areas and they flourished .
Peterson called in Taron and Olivares , and last June they collected seven wild female Baltimore checkerspots in McHenry County , taking them to their museum lab .
" They produced the 1,758 larvae ( caterpillars ) that we are working with , " said Olivares .
When they hatched as caterpillars less than an eighth - inch long , they had lots of fresh turtlehead leaves at the lab to feed on , brought in from a staffer 's garden .
Following their natural cycle , they ate through the summer , finally stopping as their metabolism slowed in preparation for winter hibernation .
" We are only putting about 250 out in the prairie for the winter , " said Olivares , who was using a tweezers instead of a brush like his colleagues because , he said , he is " more proficient with tweezers . "
" If we find a lot of them survive and mate next spring , we 'll put even more out next year , " he said .
The other 1,500 Baltimore caterpillars will hibernate under large , upended ceramic flowerpots on the roof of the museum .
If they survive and thrive , as expected , Taron will release them all in June , hoping that they all become the foundation of a healthy , permanent population .
Since they began experimenting with butterfly restorations in 2003 , Taron and Olivares have raised thousands of Silver - bordered Fritillary , swamp metalmark and Gorgone checkerspot butterflies in captivity .
There are no textbooks on the topic , so they learn by hit and miss efforts .
At one time , trying techniques that work elsewhere in the country , Taron tried keeping local butterfly larvae in refrigerators through winter months , but ended up killing some of them .
Then he hit on the idea of leaving them in the real Chicago winter on the museum roof .
" They need to experience the cold , " he said , " but to do it in a way that they can survive the process . "
Taron said he is pleased that Fermilab 's turtlehead plants were near public hiking , biking and horse trails running through the grounds , so the Baltimore checkerspots will be easy for visitors to see .
" They are beautiful , " he said , " and will give people a lot of pleasure watching them . "

Spanish bishops broke decades of silence at the weekend to apologise for the killing of 14 priests by Francisco Franco ’s troops during the civil war , asking forgiveness for the church ’s collusion with the dictator ’s cause
The bishop of Vitoria celebrated a memorial service in the cathedral of the Basque regional capital yesterday to mark the execution 73 years ago by Francoist troops of 14 priests who had never received a funeral , and whose deaths were never officially recorded .
" The silence with which officials of our Church surrounded the deaths of these priests is not justifiable nor acceptable for much longer , " Bishop Miguel Asurmendi said during the service that was attended by two other bishops and 200 priests .
" Such a long silence was not only a wrongful omission , but a lack of truth and an act against justice and charity , for which we ask pardon , " the bishop added .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The apology is unprecedented .
Spain ’s ecclesiastical hierarchy supported Francisco Franco from the moment the civil war broke out in 1936 .
It never wavered in its support for his 40 - year dictatorship , and uttered no word of remorse during more than three decades of democracy that followed the generalissimo ’s death in 1975 .
The priests , killed in 1936 and 1937 , had been officially forgotten .
The " painful circumstances " surrounding their deaths were unknown , Bishop Asurmendi said , but " testimony from many of their parishioners and companions indicates they were seized while they carried out their duties .
For years their names were relegated to silence . ”
Two of the priests were known to have been shot .
The service was attended by the bishops of Bilbao and San Sebastian , 200 priests , family members of the priests who died , and representatives of the regional Basque government .
Andoni Lekuona , nephew of one of the 14 , said from the pulpit that he “ did n’t even know where his uncle ’s remains were . ”
Historians believe several thousand priests , monks and nuns were killed by defenders of the Spanish republic against Franco ’s troops , in a bloody three - year conflict that caused up to half a million deaths .
Many Spaniards were passionately anti-clerical , regarding priests as upholders of the rich and powerful in a brutally unequal society .
Franco ruled with what the historian Paul Preston called “ vengeful cruelty ” for 40 years after his victory in 1939 , during which his regime , his bishops , cardinals and local parish priests , honoured their own dead in extravagant ceremonies .
But they expunged the memory of tens of thousands of opponents who still lie in the unmarked graves where they were tossed after pre-dawn executions .
Spain ’s recent history abounds with priests who took the side of their parishioners , protecting many from Franco ’s reprisals .
But Saturday ’s historic memorial service is the first gesture of recognition for Franco ’s victims from the catholic high command .
It is also a gesture of defiance against to an act of defiance against Spain ’s catholic strong man , the ultra - conservative Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela , Archbishop of Madrid .
Collaborators :
The caudillo and the clerics
Franco ’s rule was closely entwined with Spain ’s Catholic Church .
On his victory in 1939 , in token of his loyalty , he handed his “ sword of victory ” to Archbishop Goma of Toledo , Primate of all Spain , who blessed him , then laid the sword on the altar of Madrid ’s Santa Barbara basilica .
The church hailed the dumpy general as their hero , and Franco called his endless campaign against opponents a “ crusade ” , and his official ideology “ national catholicism ” .
He saw the church as legitimising his divine purpose , and cultivated the impression that he and the hierarchy were totally at one with each other .
Franco presided over elaborate religious ceremonies laden with medieval overtones , declaring “ the history of our nation is inseparably linked to the history of the Catholic Church , its glories are our glories , its enemies our enemies . ”
Hundreds of thousands of the faithful gave hysterical support , providing a useful cover for savage repression .
Pope Pius XII hailed Franco as “ our beloved son ” , and gave him the Vatican ’s highest award , the Supreme Order of Christ .
This extravaganza of mutual admiration has left an onerous legacy .
Whether they know it or not , the National Football League faithful who root for their teams every weekend have also become big fans of " augmented reality " .
If you 're not sure what this is , take a look at your television on Sunday afternoon and notice the yellow " first down " stripe running the width of the field ( as well as a blue one that delineates the line of scrimmage ) .
That 's augmented reality — technology that merges computer - generated images with real - world sights and sounds .
For decades , researchers also have been developing a more sophisticated , wearable technology that brings augmented reality to people in their daily lives .
Think of a see - through visor in automobiles that would provide directions ( not just text , but arrows ) to drivers as they cruise down the highway .
These kinds of mobile applications are not easy to engineer because the wearer 's location is constantly changing , making it difficult for the cameras , angular velocity sensors and accelerometers that are part of a wearable augmented - reality system to determine which graphics to display , says Jurjen Caarls , a researcher at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands .
Caarls should know , because last week he received a PhD from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , where he and colleagues created a prototype augmented - reality system that superimposed computer - generated graphics over real - world scenes .
The system included a helmet with a visor that projected images into the wearer 's eyes to create the illusion that these images were part of reality .
This effect was achieved using two small screens and two semitransparent mirrors built into the helmet .
Caarls 's system used a camera and inertia sensors for measuring the wearer 's position .
Cameras are capable of obtaining accurate absolute positions , but they do so rather slowly , according to an interview with Caarls in the university 's Delta newspaper .
Inertia sensors are faster , but less accurate , providing only acceleration and rotation speed .
By combining the two data inputs , Caarls developed image - processing techniques and filters that allowed for the absolute position to be determined with the camera and a single small visual marker , while information from the inertia sensors was used to interpolate in - between camera measurements .
One problem that Caarls could not solve completely , however , was the slight time lag ( about 80 milliseconds ) between what the user sees in the real world and the virtual projection .
" I can imagine a future in which people experience augmented reality by wearing glasses with integrated displays that project images on their retinas , " Caarls said in a press release describing his research .
" Think of it as a visual Walkman . "
Any augmented - reality system includes three key features , according to Mark Billinghurst , director of the Human Interface Technology Laboratory at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand , in the article , " Annotating the Real World , " published in the October 2008 , issue of Scientific American .
These include : " virtual information that is tightly registered , or aligned , with the real world ; the ability to deliver information and interactivity in real - time ; and seamless mixing of real - world and virtual information . "
The keys to advancing augmented reality , he wrote , are advances in display technologies ( " virtual " eyeglasses , for example ) , processors and graphics chips for mobile devices , along with tracking systems and cameras .
Researchers have been building prototype systems for more than three decades , according to an April 2002 , Scientific American article entitled , " Augmented Reality : A New Way of Seeing " .
The first was developed in the 1960s by computer graphics pioneer Ivan Sutherland and his students at Harvard University and the University of Utah .
In the 1970s and ' 80s a small number of researchers studied augmented reality at institutions such as the U.S. Air Force 's Armstrong Laboratory , NASA Ames Research Center and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
In the 1990s Boeing envisioned mechanics wearing head - mounted displays ( HMDs ) and carrying small computers that would contain a database of information for fixing Boeing products , says Eric Foxlin , founder and chief technology officer of InterSense , Inc. , a Billerica , Mass . , motion - tracking technology –maker that helped Boeing with the project .
Augmented reality would inform mechanics how to replace parts without the need for consulting a manual .
More recently , Boeing has proposed its HMD technology ( or some variation of it ) as a way to help with repairs on space missions .
The publisher of The Official Michael Jackson Opus , a biography of the late performer due in December , plans to incorporated augmented reality into the project .
Opus Media Group designed the 400 - page , 12 - kilogram book so that , when certain pages are held up to a Web camera , " the pages will come alive , with both video and music appearing on your screen while you hold the book up to [ Webcam ] , " according to RollingStone.com .
Consumers hate DRM — all that " phoning home , " the outside control over one 's behavior , the fact that you can't resell encrypted digital media , the worries about activation servers dying .
But what if digital rights management could be turned into " consumer rights management " and people could actually own and fully control the digital content they purchase ?
That 's the dream of Paul Sweazey , who 's heading up a new study group on " digital personal property " at the IEEE .
Selling unencrypted downloads would certainly make this possible , as it has in the music industry , but movie makers and other rightsholders have shown no inclination to offer such open copies of their work to the public .
In Sweazey 's view , most people understand why rightsholders want some limits on copying , but they can't abide the electronic tethers that DRM currently requires .
They do n't want to be told what to do and who to share their content with ; what they want , he tells Ars , is for digital property to " complete the emulation of the physical world . "
Digital personal property ( DPP ) is an attempt to make consumers treat digital media like physical objects .
For instance , you might loan your car to a friend , a family member , or a neighbor .
You might do so on many different occasions and for different lengths of time .
But you are unlikely to leave the car out front of your house with the keys in it and a sign on it saying , " Take me ! "
If you did , you might never see the vehicle again .
It 's that the ability to lose control over property that is central to the DPP system .
DPP files are encrypted .
They can be freely copied and distributed to anyone , but here 's the trick : anyone who can view your content can also " steal " it irrevocably .
The simple addition of a way to lose content instantly leads consumers to set up a " circle of trust " that can be as wide as they like but will not extend to total strangers on the Internet .
How it works
Digital content lends itself easily to the creation of identical copies , so crafting a system in which digital content can be " stolen " is trickier than it might sound .
The idea is to make it a " rivalrous good , " one that , after being taken , deprives someone else of something .
DPP hopes to do this by relying on two major pieces : a title folder and a playkey .
The title folder contains the content in question , it 's encrypted , and it can be copied and passed around freely .
To access the content inside , however , you 'll need the playkey , which is delivered to the buyer of a digital media file and lives within " tamper - protected circuit " inside some device ( computer , cell phone , router ) or online at a playkey bank account .
Controlling the playkey means that you control the media , and you truly own it , since no part of the system needs to phone home , and it imposes no restrictions on copying ( except for those that arise naturally from fear of loss ) .
The playkey , unlike the title folder , can't be copied — but it can be moved .
To give your friends and family access to the file in question , you can send them a copy but must also provide a link to the playkey .
Under the DPP system , though , anyone who can access the playkey can also decide to move it to their own digital vault — in essence , anyone can take the content from you , and you would no longer have access to the media files in question if they did so .
To Sweazey , this system solves most consumer problems with DRM : no Internet tether on files , no online authentication servers that could go dark , and the unlimited ability to backup files and share them with others .
Want to send a song to fifty friends ?
You can .
Want to back it up online , on DVD , on your NAS , and on 3.5 " floppy disks ?
Knock yourself out .
Want to resell DPP files by transferring the playkey to a new owner ?
You can .
You just can't share with the entire world — or someone will steal your purchase .
Kinder , gentler DRM
" Deep down inside , I 'm just a regular guy consumer , " says Sweazey , who argues that DPP has to be a single unified standard .
What it can't turn into is " another DRM , another single company making a solution . "
That 's why he 's chairing the IEEE study group , hoping to drum up enough interest to start work on a standard .
Under IEEE rules , the group has six months to decide if it's worth pursuing the project and if the entire idea is technologically feasible .
They also must decide if it is politically feasible , since the DPP scheme relies on support from hardware and software vendors for the tamper - proof digital vaults and the playback decryption apps .
Given that digital content just is n't like physical content , I ask Sweazey why we might want to force it back into that model ; why not provide truly open files for download , perhaps reserving traditional tethered DRM for rentals and streaming ?
His answer is that such freely - copiable goods breaks the basic business model of human commerce by making goods nonrivalrous ; it no longer has aspects of a private good , and this makes it difficult to sell .
The study group 's mission statement makes the same point , saying that it wants to give consumers true ownership of content while still " preserving business models based on the sale of private goods where the number of items in circulation equals the number sold and the number of users of each item is naturally , reasonably , and unavoidably limited . "
But not even a full DPP implementation would suddenly make content rivalrous .
The scheme will be cracked , and once it is — even if only a few technically - savvy people can do the necessary work — content will flood P2P networks .
Barring that , there 's always streamrippers and screen recorders .
Barring those , people can always record movies using a video camera pointed at a screen ( as the MPAA helpfully suggests ) .
There 's simply no way to truly control the distribution of media material anymore .
If you can watch it or listen to it , a copy can be made ; if you can't watch or listen to it , there 's no point in paying for it in the first place .
And once it's out on the P2P networks , we 'll find ourselves in the same situation we have now , where DRM inconveniences the lawful users and does n't stop the pirates .
Making DPP much kinder and gentler does n't appear to change this basic dynamic , though the scheme does sound less noxious than some of the DRM systems out there at the moment .
MALIBU , Calif . ( AP )  Wells Fargo has fired an executive who reportedly partied and stayed at a bank - owned $ 12 million beach house in the exclusive Malibu Colony .
Bank spokeswoman Jennifer Langan on Monday confirmed the employee was Cheronda Guyton , a senior vice president .
The bank says the executive violated company policy .
LA TIMES : Guyton had parking pass
The previous homeowners turned over the 3,800 - square - foot house to the bank in May .
Their real estate agent says they were financially devastated by Bernard Madoff 's fraud scheme .
Langan says the home was not foreclosed and the bank agreed not to immediately sell it .

I would like to make one small point : the cheapest maintenance for a car in U.S. is $ 0.39 per mile .
Es löst jedes Mal Verwunderung aus , wenn ich folgendes zum richtigen Verhalten gegenüber der Polizei sage : Kein Zeuge ist verpflichtet , bei einem Polizeibeamten eine Aussage zu machen .
Er muss nicht an an Ort und Stelle Angaben zur Sache machen .
Auch nicht , wenn er nachts aus dem Bett geklingelt wird .
Er kann Vorladungen ignorieren .
Und er kann , wenn er denn möchte , bei ihm klingelnden Polizisten die Tür vor der Nase zuschlagen .
Nur eines darf ein Zeuge der Polizei nicht verweigern , aber das ist nun wirklich nicht viel : seine Personalien .
Tut er es nicht , ist das aber nur eine Ordnungswidrigkeit .
Dass Polizeibeamte gegenüber Zeugen praktisch keinerlei Rechte haben , ist weitgehend unbekannt .
Insbesondere auch unter Polizeibeamten .
Ich führe in schöner Regelmäßigkeit diese Diskussionen , gerade mit Kripo - Kommissaren .
Während ihre Kollegen beim Verkehrsdienst sich natürlich nicht wundern , wenn sie von schriftlich vorgeladenen Zeugen von Verkehrsunfällen nichts hören , muss es aus Sicht der Kriminaler immer schnell schnell gehen .
Da wird zum Beispiel bei der Hausdurchsuchung in einer Firma das Personal informiert , jeder Mitarbeiter der Abteilung werde gleich im Zimmer des Chefs vernommen .
Natürlich ohne den Chef. Dabei wird alles getan , um den Eindruck zu erwecken , dass man sich als Zeuge dem nicht entziehen kann .
Die Strategie ist klar : Wenn ein Zeuge vor
Ort nicht aussagt , hat er Zeit zum Überlegen , Wikipedia und / oder einen Anwalt zu konsultieren .
Dann wird das nichts mehr mit der erhofften Direktbelastung der Chefetage .
So gibt es tatsächlich auch genug Kripobeamte , die selbst gegenüber einem
Anwalt empört darauf hinweisen , sie seien von der Kripo , der Zeuge sei ein Zeuge und deshalb müsse er jetzt aussagen .
Die den Anwalt also für dumm verkaufen wollen .
Oder , sicher die seltenere Variante , eben selbst dumm sind .
Ich frage immer zurück , wo das denn alles in der Strafprozessordnung stehe .
Das stehe schon drin , heißt es dann .
Und auf den Einwand , es stehe eben gerade nicht drin , kommt mit Sicherheit die Bemerkung , das könne schon sein , immerhin hätte ich ja Jura studiert .
Aber auf jeden Fall sei das , was wir Anwälte da abziehen , „ Behinderung der Justiz “ , „ Strafvereitelung “ oder „ Begünstigung “ .
Eine Kommissarin sprach sogar mal von „ unterlassener Hilfeleistung gegenüber dem Staat “ .
Wie auch immer , keine Erklärung ist – bei unseriös arbeitenden Polizisten – zu schrottig , um Zeugen über ihre Rechte in die Irre zu führen und ihnen den Mund zu öffnen .
Niemand muss mit der Polizei sprechen – dieses bislang weitgehend unbekannte , dennoch aber eherne und nur vom BKA - Gesetz etwas angetitschte Prinzip gerät nun ins Wanken .
Im Koalitionsvertrag findet sich zwischen den Änderungen im Wiederaufnahmerecht und der Reform des Transsexuellenrechts , also ziemlich weit hinten , folgender Satz :
Wir werden eine gesetzliche Verpflichtung schaffen , wonach Zeugen im Ermittlungsverfahren nicht nur vor dem Richter und dem Staatsanwalt , sondern auch vor der Polizei erscheinen und – unbeschadet gesetzlicher Zeugenrechte – zur Sache aussagen müssen .
Bevor wir nach Sinn und Unsinn dieses Vorhabens fragen , sollten wir klären , warum Zeugen bei der Polizei eigentlich nichts sagen müssen .
Es ist zunächst keineswegs so , dass Zeugen grundsätzlich schweigen dürfen .
Wie schon im Koalitionsvertrag angedeutet , müssen Zeugen vor dem Staatsanwalt und Richter jederzeit erscheinen – und aussagen .
Und zwar nach Vorladung .
( Was natürlich Vorlaufzeit bedeutet und die Möglichkeit gibt , sich als Zeuge über die eigenen Rechte zu informieren .
Und , was immer zulässig ist , zum Beispiel einen Anwalt mitzubringen . )
Eine erste Erklärung ergibt sich daraus , dass Polizisten nach dem jetzigen Konzept der Ermittlungen lediglich „ Hilfsbeamte “ sind .
Chef der Ermittlungen ist der Staatsanwalt .
Er koordiniert , entscheidet was zu tun ist – und er befragt dann auch die „ renitenten “ Zeugen .
Ist ein Zeuge für die Ermittlungen sowieso von überragender Bedeutung , wird der Staatsanwalt ohnehin nicht zögern , ihn vom Richter vernehmen zu lassen .
Beim Richter gemachte Aussagen können nämlich später unter Umständen auch dann im Prozess verwendet , das heißt verlesen werden , wenn der Zeuge später nichts mehr sagt .
Auch die höhere Qualifikation von Staatsanwälten und Richtern spielte eine Rolle , die Strafprozessordnung so zu machen wie sie heute ist .
Zeugen , die nichts sagen wollen , haben ja meistens einen Grund .
Insbesondere bei der Bewertung , ob ein Auskunfts - oder gar ein umfassendes Zeugnisverweigerungsrecht besteht , kann es jedenfalls nützlich sein , wenn der Vernehmende Jurist ist .
Außerdem kommen auch Mittel in Betracht , den Zeugen zum Reden zu bringen .
Er kann sogar eingesperrt werden , wenn er sich vor dem Staatsanwalt oder dem Richter ohne gesetzlichen Grund weigert , etwas zu sagen .
Der Polizei wollte man gar nicht die Möglichkeit geben , einem Zeugen mit Ordnungsgeld oder gar Zwangshaft drohen zu können .
Aus naheliegenden Gründen .
Jedenfalls jene Minderheit von Polizeibeamten , die auch heute noch Beschuldigten die Kontaktaufnahme mit ihrem Anwalt verweigern ( beste Erklärung in letzter Zeit : „ Vom Dienstapparat dürfen wir keine Handys anrufen “ ) , würden sich über die neuen Daumenschrauben herzlich freuen .
Hinzu kommt ein anderer Aspekt .
In einem Ermittlungsverfahren ist regelmäßig nur ein Staatsanwalt zuständig .
Ebenso ein Ermittlungsrichter .
Es kann aber sein , dass zig Polizisten , noch dazu an den unterschiedlichsten Standorten , Ermittlungen führen .
Wie oft darf dann der Zeuge von der Polizei in die Mangel genommen werden ?
Beliebig oft , oder zumindest einmal jeweils in Düsseldorf , Stuttgart und Berlin ?
Die Formulierung im Koalitionsvertrag geht dahin , Zeugen müssten vor der Polizei erscheinen .
Das klingt zumindest so , als sei geplant , die Aussagepflicht an eine vorherige „ Einladung “ zu koppeln .
Was dem Zeugen einen zeitlichen Vorlauf gäbe , um sich unabhängig über seine Rechte zu informieren und einen Beistand zu organisieren .
Immerhin .
Natürlich steht es in den Sternen , ob das Vorhaben umgesetzt wird .
Gut möglich , dass die liberale Justizministerin zunächst andere Schwerpunkte setzt .
Wenn die Vorschrift aber kommt , hätte sie auch ein Gutes .
Alle deutsche Fernsehkrimis , in denen Polizisten nach Lust und Laune demütige Zeugen ausquetschen , wären nachträglich juristisch rehabilitiert .
There ’s an App for That !
Use a Goal Tracker to Help You Follow Through on Your NY ’s Resolutions
Are you one of the 53 % of people that hoped to save money this year ?
Or perhaps you made a New Year ’s resolution to travel more , like 24 % of people ?
Or maybe you wanted to acquire a new skill set .
New Year ’s resolutions are awesome .
They range from the complex ( find love ) to the simple ( read more books ) .
They ’re motivating , exciting , and progressive .
That is if you follow through with them !
Sometimes that can be a little more difficult than you ’d expect .
Life gets in the way , and before you know it , you ’re back to your Netflix habit , neglecting the book on your end table .
But there ’s a way to avoid that disappointment .
And it involves using something you already use every day – your smartphone .
If the above sounds like you , you ’re the perfect candidate for a goal tracker .
There are many different apps for this !
Here are some of our favorites !
1. Streaks
The Streaks app is a “ to - do list that helps you form good habits . ”
It allows you to track your progress on up to 12 different goals .
If you ’re consistent , you ’ll find yourself on a streak .
Consistency allows you to form good , healthy habits .
If you fall behind , your streak reverts back to zero .
Let that 0 be a motivation to walk your dog , drink six glasses of water , or meal - prep for the week .
2. Lifetick
The Lifetick app uses SMART goal - setting .
This works to ensure you ’ll have the highest level of success at work , school , and more .
What is SMART goal setting ?
Specific ( or practical )
Measurable ( or inspiring )
Achievable
Relevant ( or reasonable , sensible )
Time - bound ( or well - timed , time - sensitive )
In other words , the perfect formula for crushing your daily goals !
3. Goals
This feature on Google Calendar will ensure that you ’re a couch potato no more !
It ’s simple !
Create a goal and choose how much time you hope to spend on it per week .
Google Calendar will set aside time for you to achieve that goal .
If you miss your window , Calendar will automatically reschedule it for you .
4. Habitbull
This app is a premium habit tracker .
It allows you to create new , better habits while abolishing your old , unhealthy ones .
This app is navigable and catered to its audience .
The makers listen to user feedback and use their input to improve the app on a regular basis .
5. Coach.me
Ever wished you could have a coach follow you around every day to motivate and inspire you ?
With the Coach .me app , you ’re getting exactly that .
They offer three different styles of help : habit tracking , habit coaching , and leadership coaching .
With habit coaching , you ’ll have access to over 700 coaches who are ready to help you achieve your goals .
With leadership coaching , you can “ achieve career success ” through a structured , informative program .
Use a Goal Tracker to Crush Your Goals
Using a goal tracker makes you a goalkeeper ( and no , not the soccer variety – unless that was one of your resolutions ) .
We ’re talking about holding yourself accountable .
Being a better , fuller , more well - rounded individual .
One who checks off everything on their to - do lists and smiles with accomplishment .
And we can all use a little more of that in our lives .
Speaking of resolutions .
With all the free time and creativity that 2019 is bringing you , why not make your own app ?
We show you how to create your own here !
It depends on the part of India you are referring to .
In certain regions it means the woman is married , in others it is simply a body decoration .
It is in between the eyebrows because this area is a major nerve center in the human body .
It is also the sixth chakra , the third - eye chakra .
It is the seat of wisdom and is related to clear insight .
Also because i said so ( :

Brad , I 've got to confess I 'd never heard of BradBlog until I got involved in election integrity issues .
And I 'd probably never have heard of Sibel Edmonds if it were n't for BradBlog .
Absolutely astonishing what the media will almost succeed in suppressing .
I wonder what they succeed at .

Thanks ,
Mitch .
The accolades mean a great deal coming from you in particular .
I should probably mention that we were also covering election integrity issues long before anybody was paying attention to that topic either !
These things , apparently , the most important to the nation , seem to take a lot of time before the " mainstream media " bothers to notice .
And that is , of course , at the bottom of virtually everything that 's a mess in our country right now , I 'm afraid .
Anyway , * very * glad you found us .
Please keep spreading the word !

This country owes this brave woman untold apologies and gratitude for standing up for the integrity of our nation .

I 've personally been commenting on every blog for the last 6 - 7 years , begging for them too interview her and keep her story alive .
( " Blondesense " , do you hear me now ? ? , WTF is it now ? , where were you ?
Jane @ FDL , I begged you , Raw Story editors , FINALLY you come around .....)
Brad deserves mucho accolades for keeping the embers stoked , perhaps we can use them to light a damn fire under this issue , and start the clean up D.C. begs for .
Thank you again , Sibel .

# 3 : I 'm guessing that there were some " costs " to Brewster Jennings getting exposed by Marc Grossman that lead to people getting murdered in the field , which I understand happens a lot when undercover operations are exposed and the public of course does n't hear about the real detailed costs that happen then .
I 'm guessing that in John Cole 's book that whoever might have exposed Brewster Jennings might be considered guilty of murder and not just treason in this case .
I 'd agree with that assessment if that 's what he 's referring to , and if in fact people did die in the field due to that action .

I have been musing on the reasons WHY the states secrets privilege was invoked : 1 ) Outright protection of criminals and ongoing criminal activity 2 ) Embarrassment at doing such an incredibly shoddy job of vetting employees and instituting internal controls against abuse of privilege .
2a ) Or embarrassment morphs to criminal liability as the thread unravels and we discover some serious blowback ( such as 9/11 , or nuclear proliferation ) resulting from some of these extracurricular diplomatic activities .
3 ) Related to 2 , political considerations , as John Cole suggests .
Such as the need to get the Patriot Act passed - which would be undermined bigtime were the public to know how easily its powers would be ( or had already been ) abused .
4 ) Threat of losing ability to work with " allies " , who would take their ball and go home ( e.g. deny the U.S. the ability to base out of Turkey for the invasion of Iraq they had already planned prior to 9/11 ) .
But , apart from the case of option 1 , you 'd think Priority One would be to stop the bleeding , revoke some security clearances , and quietly get rid of ( in the sense of firing , not killing ) the offending employees .
Yet , according to my crack research over at Wikipedia , Feith , Wolfowitz , and Grossman all stayed on in their posts until 2005 .
So what was going on from the point in time that Sibel raised her concerns to the time those traitors moved on to greener pastures ?
More whistleblowers , please .

Oh , and in the " sucking up " department , I do wish to compliment you , Brad , on your ongoing coverage of this topic .
You very briefly and effectively sum up the developments to date , with excellent use of hyperlinking , for ( a hopefully growing number of ) those who are just joining the fray , before jumping into the new developments .
You do this in a way that does n't feel repetitive to those of us who have been following this all along .
In my job , I appreciate this as a valuable but all - too - rare talent .

When this story seemed like it could no longer be ignored by ' the US media ' , I decided to plot a graph of it's ascent .
So I googled ' sibel edmonds ' hits during preceding 24 hours .
I am saddened by what I have found : 25 September 2009 15:26 --- 29,300 hits
30 September 2009 17:29 --- 12,800 hits
6 October 2009 15:08 34 --- 35 hits
That 's right it 's down to 35 hits for the past 24 hours .
Not only is the MSM ignoring ( repressing ) the story , the ' blogosphere ' seems intent on doing so as well .
It really does seem like embers now , that we have to keep alive so carefully .
The truth will eventually out .

Nooneyouknow : it could be a reference to FBI agent John O'Neil who the bombing of the USS Cole back to the USA .
He died on 9 - 11 .
OR it most likely has to do with the Valerire Palme spy case who had her cell ratted out by Grossman / Armitage resulting in their tortured deaths .
Palmes cell uncovered Nuke smuggling based in the US .
Novak relayed two year old information to the press .
The release was a diversion to take attention off the murders .
The press made it about revenge for the nigerian yellowcake scam .

Why does anyone still have to ask this question ?
The prime directive for the corporately owned and controlled mainstream media is to protect the established order .
By all means , reporters can make waves and " rock the boat " from time to time ( good for appearances as it helps foster the illusion there really is such a thing as a free press ) , but by golly they know damn well they are never supposed to make waves big enough to swamp the boat or to actually put the boat in danger of tipping over .
Broadcasting Sibel Edmonds ' story would be like having a Tsunami breaking on top of a rowboat .

Thank you for all of this .

Still nothing in the MSM .
He calls for a special prosecutor .
Calls upon what agency ?
Just so we know where to watch .
As Sibel has stated that " we were working with Bin Laden " right up until 9/11 , I would hazard a guess and say that over 3000 people were murdered in NYC on a crisp September morning .
That would be just one example .

We are not playing cricket with our enemies .
The enemy ( or potential enemy ) needs to think the info they are getting is the real thing ( and enough would be to convince them ) and if that means a few corrupt politicians get hand outs then thats a small price to pay .
Sibel probably blew the operation and may in the long run cost many lives .... good job

( This comment reminds me of the chapter in The Phantom Tollbooth about leaping to conclusions , a small island very difficult to leave once you 've made the leap . )
The problem here is -- 1. your premise is complete conjecture and 2.-- how is it that what 's so obvious to you has seemingly not occurred in the slightest to John Cole , 18 - year FBI Counterintelligence and Counterterrorism Manager ?
What do you know that John Cole would n't ?

At least if actual evidence to the contrary means anything to you .
The Senate Judiciary Committee , when they met with Edmonds in 2002 first checked to make sure that was not what was going on .
Otherwise , they would not have recommended the DoJ IG investigate the allegations , and the DoJ IG would not have confirmed them as accurate .
Sorry The Smith .
Facts first , your evidence - free scenarios last .
David Lasagna - The Phantom Toolbooth is one of my favorite books .
Thanks for mentioning it !

Look : this story is not only important for the ACTUAL story , but another HUGE thing : it 's proving REAL TIME that the corporate mainstream media is controlled .
It 's TWO huge stories in ONE !
One is a " by - product " story maybe as big as the actual stoey itself !
It would be a fatal mistake not pushing that indirect story of this being real time proof of the controlled media .

I do n't think it ( necessarily ) proves any such thing .
It suggests they * could * be controlled .
It also suggests that they could be lazy , frightened , intimidated , assigned to other things , etc .
If your implication is that someone , on high , is directing them to NOT cover this story , that could be .
But I do n't think anything we 're seeing here necessarily " proves " it , at this point .

Old Zen koan :
What do you call the world ?
I 'd say that in light of the seriousness of the allegations and the credibility of the persons pressing , " lazy , frightened , intimidated , assigned to other things " all are synonyms for " controlled " .
There really can't be any more quibbling about that .
Whether there are direct orders , and I 'm sure there are in many cases , the fact that journalists would have any of those other excuses on something this big means they are controlled .

I mean , they do n't want to get Donohued or Rathered or X number of others who got taken down for getting real .
They also do n't want to be the target of the oceanic accusations of " conspiracy theorizing " .
Everyone , not just journalists , is afraid to step out of the mainstream because of the fierceness of the social and economic consequences that have been carefully cultivated to maximize compliance with the will of the power élite .
All this is coercive , and has been meant to be coercive ....
Same deal with corrupt politicians .
Coöperate and you thrive , but buck too hard and you get vilified or marginalized .
Buck even harder and you get Wellstoned .
It 's all " control " .
The extent to which our country has been ruined coincides with the extent to which this " control " has been effective .
Our country is broken .
All three branches of government and the fourth estate .

So , they are either : 1 . Frightened & Intimidated .
...or... 2 . Controlled .
Is n't that the same thing ?
WHO is " frightening and intimidated " them , if it 's # 1 ???
And WHY are they " frightened and intimidated " ???
Maybe they are : FRIGHTENED and INTIMIDATED and CONTROLLED : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYlyb1Bx9Ic
People are trying to expose the so - called liberal media , the corporate media .
They say TWO things about it , in explaining the so - called liberal media 's lack of " doing their job " .
They 're not " doing their job " because : 1 . They 're frightened and intimidated .
2 . They 're controlled and they actually ARE doing their job .
Their job it to speak for the wealthiest few people really controlling everything , corporations , and the military industrial complex .
Noam Chomsky in the video above , entitles it : " The MYTH of the liberal media " .
MYTH implies they 're doing their job ( to me ) which is to misinform .
I think the former excuse , that they 're intimidated / frightened , is a cop -out excuse and actually hurts exposing what they really are , because it 's implying they WANT to do their job ... but they 're " frightened " and " intimidated " .
I simply do n't buy this .
No disrespect intended to your point of view , which seems to be the former ... or at least you say either way is not " proven " .
Time after time after time ... year after year after year ... decade after decade after decade ... this keeps going on and we keep making excuses FOR them ... to the point where I do n't buy it anymore - I believe they 're doing it on purpose .
And it explains a lot , to me , if they 're doing it on purpose .
For one thing , it explains why they KEEP doing it !

Tempted to comment on the total despair doomsday tone above , but why waste my breath .
Anyway , I 'd like to suggest that everybody who has been following this extrodinary case call their federal legislators and ask them to read the American Conservative article .
That way , they can't squirm out and say the had no idea .
Last week when I called my senators to urge them to adopt Feingold 's ammendments on the patriot act , I used Siebel 's story as an example of why gag orders need reformed along with other reform measures like nsl letters referencing the 2007 wapo article .
The assistants were n't sure if the senators were aware of Seibel 's story , so I say we make sure they know !

To the extent that it 's ever possible for ordinary citizens to be sure , I 'm sure Sibil Edmonds is reliable .
I 'm sure she 's not making a single thing up and not only that , that she 's been meticulous from the beginning , and remains so .
Bravo to her .
Thank God for her .
But here 's what troubles me , probably at least as much as the horrible things she has exposed : why is she the only translator who has ever had the conscience to blow this whistle ?
How in the name of God do you translate these atrocities , day after day , and NOT do what she did ?

Look at how they make " media stars " and they 're always " media stars " who happen to be for the corporations : Joe the Plumber , now Betsy McCaughey .
They are always ALL for corporations , etc ... these fabeicated " media stars " .
Betsy McCaughey 's usefulness is gone after this : http://www.msnbc.msn.com...001/vp/33192386#33192386

I will point it out when it happens .
This new " media star " will , of course , be pro-corporation and / or pro-military industrial complex etc .... because darling
Betsy lost her cool and is now useless to them .
They will make their rounds across all networks and we wo n't know how .
I have to say this : MSNBC has : Maddow , Schultz , Olbermann , Ratiger ... we have n't seen liberals like this in I do n't know how long , on anything that could be remotely called " mainstream corporate TV " .
All it will take , is another 9/11 to stop it , like they yanked # 1 rated Phil Donahue during the leadup to the Iraq War because he was anti-war .

Reina #39 - Sibel was checking conversations that had already been translated by a woman involved with her husband in the espionage .
When Edmonds realized the translations had been faked the FBI was forced to gag her .
The corruption is complete and systemic .
No Judge will let any Grand Jury say out loud what can all be proved in court .
As these guys keep meticulous records .

Well , " control " , or not , I 've yet to see an explanation that adequately explains Josh Marshall 's and Steve Clemons ' cowardice on this issue .
As you know , Brad , Steve offers some sort of " spat " with Sibel as an excuse , in addition to ethereal musings , vaguely presented , about having " misgivings " about Sibel 's assertions .
And Marshall , when directly queried by me , offered some inane sarcasm in response via email .
I do believe , not without cause , that Marshall and Clemons travel and party in the same circles , and I have a very strong suspicion that Grossman is swilling out of some of the same punchbowls .
Steve is now accusing those of us that wish to see this story in the national limelight of being cultists .
I quote ...
" I want nothing to do with the story any more because the movement is seeming less and less like a whistle blower issue and more like a cult of personality .
I hope she gets somewhere with what she is trying to do .
It 's clear that she was close to some pretty interesting intel work ... but there are other explanations , potentially , for some of what she saw than the explanations she has offered .
And someone like Giraldi should know this " " I wo n't go into this because of an experience I had with Sibel early on , after I tried to dig into it when you , POA , encouraged me to .
I will not do it again "
As I have repeatedly tried to point out , when the mainstream blogosphere is rebutting Sibel 's assertions with such implied accusations of " conspiracy theorism " , it is extremely important that knowledgable and known personages respond directly .
That would be YOU , Brad , and Giraldi , Cole , and even Sibel .
I suppose you have your reasons for not directly confronting Sibel 's detractors , on their turf , but common sense tells me that Sibel 's story will NEVER get any traction if you expect her detractors to come to you .
They are having a field day out there on the mainstream blogosphere rebutting Sibel 's assertions with vague bullshit , with virtually no opposing viewpoints from those best informed to present Sibel 's case .
Her cause , and her story , is dead on the vine if you , Giraldi , and Sibel do not rebut comments such as Steve 's , promptly , and directly .
And I am not offering this argument judgementally or adversarily .
I am just making a common sense observation .
These people ARE not going to come to you , nor is their international and high powered readership .
You will have to take it to them .
If the media wo n't give you exposure , then its time to start doing changing tactics .

POA - I have , in fact , sent private notes to both Clemons and Riz Kahn , but have n't received a reply from either .
I did have a short back and forth conversation via email with Josh .
Not by way of defending any of them , I will just note that not everybody can cover everything .
I too am criticized by various folks for not covering this or that when , in truth , I 've only not covered it for lack of resources to be able to cover everything .
Or , even lack of interest or confidence in a particular story .
That last is likely closer to the explanation shared by Josh with me , and that 's fine .
I disagree with the assessment , but there it is .
As to not confronting or responding to Clemons over at his site , that has * truly * been for a lack of time .
Feel free to , again , point me to where the discussion is ongoing , and I 'll try to respond .
Partuclarly to this bit you quoted from Steve : " there are other explanations , potentially , for some of what she saw than the explanations she has offered . "
Really ?
What are they ?
Because the ones that I 'm aware of have largely debunked by other evidence , corroboration , etc .
But I 'd be happy to discuss it w / Steve either privately or publicly as he prefers .
But I can't be out everywhere debunking every bit of misconception AND actually covering and investigating the story here , at other sites , and in the media ( radio , etc . )
I 'm doing my best , but there just ain't enough of me to go around .
So I DO appreciate your help .
Hint : Avoid harrangueing * anybody * , however , as that makes folks * less * likely , rather than more likely , to cover anything .
I can tell u this from first hand experience .

I would be interested in PC's take on whether the corporate media is controlled or they 're " scared / intimidated " .
I think it 's the former , because suppressed or slanted stories have gone on over the years , many years .
People have changed over those many years , yet that common thread remains ... of the suppressed / slanted stories .
The pattern of the suppressed / slanted stories over many many years and through many changes of people always is slanted towards the wealthy , corporations , the military industrial complex , and government officials who back them .
In general , it never favors the populace .
That 's a PLAN , not an ACCIDENT .
That 's just my opinion .
Project Censored goes back to the 70's .
So , if we believe the " intimidated / frightened " theory , we have to believe an array of different people over many decades have all amazingly been intimidated / frightened independently .
That to me is not believable .
What is believable to explain it , is a few people control it .
That is very believable .
When you OWN something , it 's easy to control the output of what you OWN .
Hence : independent media does n't look like corporate - OWNED media .
If the so - called liberal media ( the corporate - OWNED ABC , NBC , CBS , FOX , CNN , NYTimes , WaPo ... ) was liberal , it would look like the liberal media ( Democracy NOW ! , Raw Story , Brad Blog , etc ... ) .
SO ... the liberal media does n't look like the liberal media !
Which is the liberal media ?
Why do n't they look the same ?
You would n't NEED independent media , if the so - called liberal media ( the corporate - OWNED media ) was liberal , like they tell us it is .
So , I have come up with another question :
How come the liberal media ( ABC , NBC , CBS , CNN , NYTimes ) does n't look like the liberal media ( independent media : DN ! , RS , BB , etc ... ) ???
One of the " liberal medias " is n't liberal !!!

Here is further response from " WigWag " at the TWN blog .... I quote ...
" As I said , POA , he has an entertaining blog .
When some real journalists pick up the story then alot of people will pay attention including me .
If none of the hundreds ( if not thousands ) of legitimate news outlets in the country are willing to cover the story , it makes me skeptical that there 's any " there " there "
" That is unless you believe in crackpot conspiracy theories like the idea that media outlets across the land are conspiring to keep the story quiet " " A blog is a blog .
Brad owns his blog ; he can say whatever he wants .
I have no basis for either accepting or questioning the veracity of what he says " " But only the delusional or the paranoid could believe that the story is being suppressed by some sort of media conspiracy .
It 's much more reasonable to conclude the story has largely been ignored by the conventional media because there are important holes in what Edmonds has to say " " Could Brad Friedman be right ?
Sure .
Could the facts he 's presenting be skewed or half - truths ?
Sure .
There 's nothing about the reputation of Brad Friedman or the Brad Blog that makes anything he says particularly compelling "
" I 'm willing to consider the possibility that there may be enough information in the public domain to suggest some type of objective inquiry is called for .
But the mere fact that a blogger is calling for an independent investigation is , of itself , not particularly compelling "
" No mainstream media outlet is above reproach ; they all make mistakes .
Sometimes these mistakes are bad .
But that 's hardly a reason to believe everything you read on a blog or any other internet site " " Glenn Beck has a blog too .
So does Sean Hannity .
Should we run out and call for investigations every time they make some allegation on their blogs ? "
" If Brad Friedman is on to something , he will manage to get some legitimate and trustworthy journalistic enterprise to examine it " " Until then , it 's just noise " " And by the way , in case you did n't read the first sentence of Brad Friedman 's comment , he said that taunting does nothing to establish the credibility of the story .
I think it 's fair to say that carrying on like a maniac does n't help too much either " http://www.thewashington...t_by_r_4/#comment-140885

How long can " officials " with authority to make policy and things happen are going to have their own authority respected , when it 's been like 10 years and the authority ignores such problems using whatever list of excuses .
You want to tell us ( the public ) to obey all these laws of the land , yet at the same time you ( government / state / officials ) break them ?
Frankly we ( the public ) are at odds with such government officials in wherever agency they hail from .
You " officially " demanding this and that , but when it comes to carrying the can yourself , you do n't .
I think government has fucked up .
They do n't seem to grok the public has this dollar / bank / bond problem which if left as it is , working for anything will end up being worthless .
Retirement ( if based on the dollar ) worthless .
Since the money ( the dollar ) will be worthless .
Which is the SENATE'S OATH BREAKING .
This is why there 's no trust .
Not in Government , Not in Cops , Not in Flu Shots , Not in the Financial Market .
And wo n't be ever .
And the path forward on this road will be littered with nasty surprises which destroy real lives .
Like ALCO 's profits .
They did n't actually produce more in yesterday 's news .
The price of the aluminum changed instead .
Fascist media sources call that green shoots , I call it cooking the god damned books , and eventually will get dealt with .
In fact all these laws and crap that have been pretty much skirting the Constitution are going to come back to bite this country in the ass .
Not only is the Constitution reduced to symbology without substance , the actual power the people have has been reduced to nothing ( officially ) .
And I do n't want to scare you ( unofficially ) , but if it stays that way , the people 's power will not be what the officials consider legal under whatever crap legal shit they 've currently passed to cover their dreamed up nonsense turd pile with .
At a certain point , our own government itself becomes a terrorist threat .
If not worse than a terrorist threat .
What if that threat threatens your family members ?
Do you pick up a weapon and stop them ?
Where the fuck in the original constitution did it say ... can't protest ?
can't have a non-corporate tv station for the public ?
can't be a " journalist " without profiting from it ?
( Anyone want to have themselves take a gift of a penny from me and then pay me a penny for all my corporate journalism work ? )
I am not a journalist , I said that many times before on bradblog .
If I was though , I would n't like this at all , and even I not being a journalist still I do n't like this at all .
Ultimately I do n't want to see the end result of all this , where we have law enforcement , police ( corporate or private ) and US military in the streets breaking every damned thing they swore an oath too !
When I say I do n't want to see the end result , that does n't mean I want to die .
It means I hate seeing all this go down because our " electronic vote tabulation device " based machines allowed these corrupt bastards and bitches assume and exploit their authority .
The way I see it all these problems and more are because of these devices .
And the exploited powers ?
Unacceptable behavior where ever it lurks .
How is it when I swore an oath , it 's somehow different then when current officials do ?
Their oath conflicts with my oath .
I am not alone .
It 's deep and nasty what they have done to us .
Up is Down , Yes is No , Clean is Dirty , Pure white light is Darkness nothing ether .
So it 's no
surprise there would be confusion and lack of trust .
How about a law that stops these kind of " final steps " from happening before it 's too late ?
Cause if the public get tangled with law enforcement , us military , there 's no going back from that .

BRAD .... I just recieved an interesting email from Steve .
Last night , I emailed him a link to the comment you posted on his blog .
I know that he does not always read the entire threads , or , at least , he claims not to .
So I thought I would call his attention to your comment .
Anyway , this morning I recieved a short email , following ...
" Do you happen to have a phone number for the gentleman working with Sibel .
I ’ll give him a call .
Best , steve " Wierd , huh ??
Its as if he does n't know it was you that posted the comment .... " the gentleman working with Sibel " Anyway , give him a shout , if you 're so inclined .
I believe his phone number is listed at his blog , if not , let me know , and I 'll see what I can do to get it for you .
If not his blog , I 'm sure you can find a number for the New America Foundation .
Or , if you want , just email me your number , and I will forward it to him , with a promise that that is ALL I will do with the number .

Oh my ... ( From POA 's ^^^ link )
" You certainly have been tenacious about pursuing Edmund ’s accusations ; that ’s commendable , but it ’s not enough .
Ultimately for the story to have legs you have to convince other mainstream reporters that there 's " there " there . "
Frankly all the " I am a journalist " vs. " No your not " talk is nauseating .
Enough is enough .
Screw ALL MEDIA ...
They are all failures !
I do n't even give a crap how any opinions on " how to get a story into the corporate media and public broadcast spectrum . "
I want my government back !
I want officials who have taken the oath , to get off their asses , and on this damn thing , and find out if these people are treasonous or not !
Now .
You want to make a story on it ?
Or profit , I do n't give a crap .
But I want officials LEGALLY doing what they swore to do , and I want it happening ASAP .
Already this decade long surveillance crap is a miserable failure .
If we got treasonous people inside government we need their god damn security yanked , their net / vault / official business / voting / whatever yanked and and to find out and either clear the target or jail the bastard for 999 years .
Expedite these reports , and surveillance datas ' and uphold your sworn oath .
Not letting Grossman access whatever government networks , documents , or making decisions .
Until we can find out , it 's unbelievable to me the guys Security clearance and position remains in place .
Already I do n't like that bastard anyway with all this Electronic Vote Tabulation Device crap is seems to love to shove on us .
Then we hear he 's been under surveillance for a decade ?
And then we have Sibel 's report .
Is there nobody in our god damned government responsible enough to " Just Do it " and get cracking .
The whole corporate media thing is a different pandora 's box in the big picture .
But I can tell you right now if I was still in the USAF , and another soldier did some illegal shit against my country , I guarantee that bastard would be stopped , using all my resources within minutes !
If I physically had to hit the bastard over the head with my toolbox I would .
( Yeah my weapon was a toolbox ) NOW WHERE'S THE COPS ALREADY !?
They got all this freaking time and resources to spy on American citizens under the " drug war " + " patriot act " nonsense , but when someone tells them someone high up could be into sabotage , treason , leaking classified data , all they fucking do for 12 years is nothing ?!
This is n't really a corporate media problem as much as it is an oath of office , and sworn oath breaking Constitutional crisis .
The corporate media agenda is just a giant turd factory , and to deal with that will require knocking on the FCC 's door , but I want ACTION on my fellow American citizen 's ( and EX FBI translator 's ) report .
Good God already !
WTF !?
no wonder banksters can steal all this money , the people in charge of stopping are " patients in an insane asylum . "
And if we could get these electronic vote tabulation devices outlawed nationally , then maybe the people can finally get these rotten officials out of office before they destroy more than just the US Constitution ( e.g. our government itself )
While , I agree the corporate media no longer serves the public interest , and perhaps it 's time to legally and forcefully get them the hell off public broadcast spectrum until they do serve the public interest .
( WHY ARE THEIR PUBLIC FILES NOT AVAILABLE ONLINE ?
YOU GOING TO TELL ME IT COST TOO MUCH OR TECHNOLOGY ISN'T THERE ?
LIAR !!!)
I 'm sorry but if you read a story like the Sibel Edmonds case and all you can drum up is whaaa whaa the corporate media wo n't play my miniDV then we truly are fucked in America .

This whole country is based on accountability .
The electronic vote tabulation device is an invention which removes the public or republic 's power of accountability to hold officials accountable ; by breaking the chain of custody of a registered voter 's " vote representation in any kind of electronic signal format " from being seen by anyone attempting to provide public oversight , simply because they can not SEE electronic signals physically with their eyes .
Add into the mix untrained ( in electronics and physics and programming ) local law enforcement is used to ensure anyone smart enough to point out the flaws ( like poll - watchers ) is delayed by any means ( beat the rap , not the ride ) until everything becomes moot as officials ritually swear ( fastrack by jet , overnighter ) in and assume their power again and wash , rinse , repeat .
And now people ( citizens ) are realizing their ( these fastrack piece of crap officials ) laws suck , they suck , and some ( officials ) are corrupted completely .
So why would n't we want to pick up the phone , and at least have Grossman checked out once and for all ?
It does n't mean he 's guilty , it just means halt .
Hold up for a moment , your still getting paid , you can answer some questions while we make sure we can trust you with nuke secrets .
Come on .
Wash , Rinse , Repeat .

From Bloomberg : Fed Failed to Curb Flawed Bank Lending , Inspector General Says ( ht Stephen , others )
Federal Reserve examiners failed to rein in practices that led to losses from excessive real estate lending at two banks in California and Florida that later closed , the central bank ’s inspector general said .
Riverside Bank of the Gulf Coast in Cape Coral , Florida , “ warranted more immediate supervisory attention ” by the Atlanta district bank , Fed Inspector General Elizabeth Coleman said in a report to the central bank ’s board .
In overseeing County Bank in Merced , California , the San Francisco Fed should have taken a “ more aggressive supervisory ” approach , Coleman said in another report , also dated Sept. 9 .
Based on our analysis of Riverside - Gulf Coast ’s supervision , we believe that emerging problems observed during a 2007 visitation provided FRB Atlanta with an opportunity for a more aggressive supervisory response .
Specifically , FRB Atlanta noted a significant decline in the local residential housing market and observed that new appraisals indicated that the value of certain collateral , particularly developed lots ready for construction , declined by as much as 70 percent .
In addition , examiners observed that Riverside - Gulf Coast could no longer sell mortgages in the secondary market and , therefore , would be required to hold and service these loans .
Historically , Riverside - Gulf
Coast focused on growth through real estate lending in its local service area , a business strategy that created concentrations in both the type of loans and the geographic location .
In general , local real estate concentrations increase a financial institution ’s vulnerability to cyclical changes in the local market place and may elevate a bank ’s safety and soundness risk .
Examiners noted that Riverside - Gulf Coast experienced rapid growth during its first six years when the bank ’s total assets grew approximately 40 percent annually , to $ 275 million as of December 31 , 2003 .
...
Riverside - Gulf Coast ’s concentration in real estate loans ranged between 92 and 98 percent of total loans during 2003 to 2008 .
The bank ’s real estate portfolio included traditional one - to - four family mortgages and home equity lines of credit .
In addition , a substantial number of Riverside - Gulf Coast ’s real estate loans , such as those for residential construction , were categorized as CRE because repayment was dependent on the rental income , sale , or refinancing of the underlying collateral .
emphasis added
Riverside Bank was closed in February 2009 by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation .
The FDIC DIF is estimated to have lost $ 201.5 million from the failure of Riverside , or about 38.5 % of assets ( not an unusually high loss percentage in this cycle , see this sortable table ) .
Here is the report from the Inspector General : Material Loss Review of Riverside Bank of the Gulf Coast Inspector General Coleman suggested that there should have been " more immediate supervisory attention " in 2007 .
" Emerging problems " in 2007 ?- because of 1 ) concerns about the housing market , and 2 ) the concentration of loans in residential real estate .
From the report :
The signs of excessive risk were apparent in 2003 to 2005 .
The Fed is aware of the risks , especially of a high growth strategy with a high loan type concentration .
If the regulator was unable to step in sooner and evaluate the risk , then the regulatory process is flawed - and the regulator has already failed .
It was too late by 2007 .
The inability of the Federal Reserve and the Inspector General to recognize the need for tighter supervision in 2005 or earlier is a serious oversight failure .
A British Iraq war veteran has died after he was given a pair of cancerous lungs donated by a smoker as part of a lung transplant .
Matthew Millington , 31 , a corporal in the Queen 's Royal Lancers , needed the transplant because he had an incurable lung condition .
But he ended up with cancer after the organs donated to him came from someone who smoked 30 to 50 cigarettes a day , the Daily Mail said .
He died in February last year .
At an inquest , Coroner Ian Smith said he had died from " complications of transplant surgery " .
His widow Siobhan said : " All he wanted was another set of lungs .
He said ' they 've given me a dud pair ' , "
Papworth Hospital in Cambridge , which performed the transplant , said early X - rays did not find any sign of cancer in Mr Millington 's lungs , the Mail said .
But the tumour had been missed .
Drugs given to Mr Millington to help his body accept the new organs sped up the spread of the tumour , it said .
The hospital defended its use of smokers ' lungs in transplants and said all organs were screened rigorously , the Mail said .
Mr Millington had served in the army since he was 16 , but started to struggle with his breathing while in Iraq in 2005 .
A year later he was told he would die in two years unless he had a transplant .
Anyone who has ever taught knows that students sometimes cheat .
With the increasing prevalence of online classes , there has been some fear that cheating would shoot through the roof — it's a lot harder to spot answer - sharing on tests when it 's all online , after all .
A new study , however , suggests that cheating is actually less common among students in virtual classrooms , though limitations in this study mean that further research is needed before declaring a winner between online and traditional classes .
The study , titled " Point , Click , and Cheat : Frequency and Type of Academic Dishonesty in the Virtual Classroom , " acknowledges previous reports stating that students who have a close relationship with their professors tend to be more honest — a belief that feeds into the idea that virtual classrooms invite more cheating .
" Both students and faculty perceive that cheating occurs more frequently in virtual classrooms because online students are often believed to be more savvy at utilizing online resources than their on ground counterparts , or are less likely to be caught by faculty who are unfamiliar with online detection techniques , " wrote the researchers .
However , when they surveyed 225 students at Friends University in Wichita , KS , they found that students appeared to be much more willing to engage in some form of cheating when " on the ground " versus a virtual classroom .
Almost three times as many students admitted to engaging in any form of cheating while on campus compared to an online environment — this included cheating on tests , plagiarizing , fabrication of facts , somehow achieving an unfair advantage , aiding / abetting , falsification of records , and gaining unauthorized access to materials .
In all instances , these activities occurred less frequently online than in real life , and in some cases ( such as falsification of records and unauthorized access ) , it did n't occur at all online .
Among those who did engage in academic dishonesty in the online classroom , the largest percentage admitted to aiding and abetting — that is , helping someone else cheat by letting them copy answers or a paper .
The researchers also noted that students who admitted to cheating in high school were also more likely to admit to cheating in college , and " only a small percentage of students in both samples reported getting caught . "
Though they acknowledge that going into the reasons why students cheat is beyond this study , the researchers theorize that students on the ground may be more compelled to engage in " panic cheating . "
Of course , there are numerous caveats to taking a study like this at face value .
Since the results were taken via self - reported survey , we can only count on the results from students who were willing to admit to cheating both on and off campus — a group that may not include everyone who has cheated in either situation .
The sample size is also relatively small and only includes students from a single university , and the report notes that instructors may have anticipated more cheating in an online environment , therefore crafting class materials to be more challenging and involved than they would have otherwise .
Despite these limitations , the researchers believe that their findings are a good starting point for further studies on cheating in a virtual environment .
One suggestion that sparks our interest is a study looking at the personality traits of students who choose to take online classes and whether those students are more motivated than the traditional campus student .
Even if that were the case , however , the researchers acknowledge that a lingering concern over distance and disengagement remains : " Thus , the need for colleges and universities to search for ways to increase online students ’ connectedness to the online community cannot be over stated .
As online learning becomes more accepted as a means to an educational end and available to more people , it is likely that the prevalence of academic dishonesty will increase . "
The best of Matt Wuerker 's cartoons on Obamacare .
There are 2,000 in that container .
And there are 112 such containers in Microsoft's $ 500 million Chicago data center .
It may seem somewhat ridiculous , but this container - based data center design is absolutely brilliant ( and environmentally sustainable to boot ) .
Advertisement
While we have n't seen Microsoft 's newest data center , we hear that it has 700,000 square feet of space , really , really high ceilings , and 40 - foot stacks of server - filled containers .
Thinking about the stacks may leave me with vertigo , but thinking about the ingenuity of the design leaves me impressed : Microsoft has built something which 'll " deliver huge benefits in cost , energy efficiency and environmental sustainability . "
All those containers are plug - and - play in a way , complete with corresponding bays , and can be set up by " as few as four employees " in hours .
Yes , they 've designed it so that moving 60 ton stacks of servers requires only four people .
If that 's not incredible then let 's consider that the place has a huge focus on being energy efficient :
Despite the facility having a 30 - megawatt power capacity , steps have been taken to make it as economical and sustainable as possible :
[ T ]he Chicago site employs water - side economization [ which takes ] advantage of cool outside air to reduce the data center 's reliance upon power - hungry chillers to produce chilled water .
Air economizers introduce fresh air into the data center , while water - side economizers use cooling towers to remove waste heat .

Basically Microsoft is cutting down energy waste , saving on labor , and being all - around economical .
While the modular , server - in - a - box approach might not get the stamp of revolutionary , the way Microsoft is approaching it is something worth paying attention to because it might just be what 'll help " meet the demand for cloud computing at scale . "
[ Data Center Knowledge ]
Despite strong words from Barack Obama and Gordon Brown , there is no sign of a consensus on what additional sanctions should or could be imposed by the international community if Iran continues to ignore concerns about its suspect nuclear programmes .
Tehran is meanwhile busy taking pre-emptive measures to mitigate any UN or unilateral punishment , despatching diplomatic missions to China , central Asia and Venezuela and stockpiling petrol and gas in case of winter shortages .
The option preferred by many in the US Congress – a ban on exports to Iran of refined fuel products including petrol – looks like a non-starter .
Iran is seen as vulnerable on this front since it imports 40 % of its gasoline .
But it has the world 's second largest proven crude oil reserves and China is the world 's second largest crude oil importer .
For American hawks this is a marriage made in hell .
But no divorce is in prospect .
Iran provided 10 % of China 's crude oil needs last year ; its market share is expected to grow .
Chinese companies and middlemen are supplying one third of Iran 's refined petroleum requirements as western companies back off .
Earlier this year the China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $ 1.7bn investment deal with the National Iranian Oil Company .
The overall Chinese energy stake in Iran is said to be worth $ 100bn .
Speaking before crucial nuclear talks in Geneva , Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu urged the US , Britain and other UN security council members to eschew confrontation .
" We believe that all sides should take more steps to ease tensions and resolve problems , not the opposite , " she said .
Beijing 's meaning was plain .
Even if it supported sanctions in principle ( which it does not ) , it was not disposed to support measures that would harm its national economic self - interest .
Russia 's previous opposition to tougher sanctions appeared to soften last week when its president , Dmitry Medvedev , met Obama in Pittsburgh for a mutual admiration session .
But it is unclear what has changed in practice .
Moscow views Tehran as an important ally and trading partner in the Caucasus , Caspian and central Asian regions .
It is also uncertain whether the youthful Medvedev , rather than his more powerful , less co-operative mentor , Vladimir Putin , is really calling the shots .
Iran 's neighbours are reluctant to climb aboard the sanctions bandwagon .
Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , said he would discuss the nuclear issue when he met Iran 's president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in Tehran next month .
But he warned : " Those sanctions wo n't bring about anything good for the people of Iran .
So I think we have to be careful . "
Even less help can be expected from Iraq , which experienced devastating UN sanctions in the 1990s and whose Shia leadership is closely allied with Tehran ; or from Afghanistan , whose government barely controls Kabul 's bazaar let alone the smuggling havens along its border with Iran .
As for Pakistan , its president , Asif Ali Zardari , warmly embraced Ahmadinejad in New York last week and said he looked forward to working closely with Iran " to promote peace and security " and improve commercial ties , the Tehran Times reported .
" The two presidents also discussed the Iran - Pakistan gas pipeline and the need to step up work on this lucrative project , " it said .
And how to close off prohibited commercial traffic between Iran and Dubai , a major re-export hub in the Gulf , is another unanswered challenge .
Contemplating these obstacles , US officials are increasingly focusing on curbs on international companies undertaking financial , banking , insurance and investment business on behalf of or in Iran , in addition to US and EU government - level action .
Such measures , recalling those used against North Korea , have already persuaded some western energy companies to pull back from Iran .
They also have the advantage of not requiring security council approval – a boon if China and Russia block a fourth round of sanctions .
Robert Gates , the US defence secretary , expressed optimism in weekend television interviews that , if need be , Iran could be brought to heel by additional penalties .
" There are a variety of options still available , " he said ; it was " a pretty rich list to pick from " .
Measures could be enforced that " have the potential to bring them to change their policies " , Gates said .
But many profoundly disagree .
Writing in the Wall Street Journal , Eliot Cohen , a former Bush administration official , said Gates was kidding himself .
" A large sanctions effort has been under way against Iran for some time .
It has not worked to curb Tehran 's nuclear appetite , and it will not , " he said .
Sanctions were a mere fig - leaf for weak politicians .
And since doing nothing was not an option , Washington 's only logical alternative was to " actively seek the overthrow of the Islamic Republic " by whatever means necessary , barring all - out invasion .
With such dangerously ill - considered threats emanating from the world 's only nuclear superpower , little wonder Tehran 's own hardliners are circling the wagons .
And little wonder Beijing , the new voice of reason , is pleading for calm .
Is he really this stupid ?
Really ?
Just in case you need more proof .
Americans narrowly oppose sending new troops to Afghanistan , with some of the strongest opposition coming from President Barack Obama 's political party , according to a new ABC News / Washington Post poll .
Poll : Majority opposes Afghan surge
Americans narrowly oppose sending new troops to Afghanistan , with some of the strongest opposition coming from President Barack Obama ’s political party , according to a new ABC News / Washington Post poll .
According to the Post , 47 percent of those surveyed favor a substantial buildup of U.S. forces , along the lines recommended by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , while 49 percent oppose it .

Confidence in Obama ’s handling of the Afghanistan issue has eroded since the spring , the newspaper said : “ In the latest poll , 45 percent approve , down 10 percentage points in the past month alone , and 47 percent disapprove , an increase of 10 points .
Nearly a third of those surveyed say they strongly disapprove . ”
Although “ the sharpest drop in support for Obama ’s work on Afghanistan has come among Republicans , ” the Post said , “ Obama faces a possible loss of support among his Democratic base if he decides to order the kind of substantial troop increase McChrystal recommended .
Just a third of Democrats favor sending about 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan , with 61 percent opposed — 51 percent strongly so . ”
Italian Sausage Meatballs with Fresh Herbs
Perhaps there is a more eloquent way to say it , but Shalon perfectly describes the flavor of the meatballs she entered in the Primal Blueprint Cookbook Contest with this quote : “ They satisfy my mmm , goodness requirement . ”
It ’s true .
“ Mmm ” is likely to be the first thing out of your mouth when you take a bite , thanks to a flavorful combination of ground beef ( or bison ) and sweet Italian sausage .
Italian sausage is traditionally made from pork but chicken and turkey varieties are also out there .
Fennel seed , which has a slightly sweet and very faint licorice - like flavor is the distinguishing characteristics of sweet Italian sausage .
The Italian sausage perfectly matches other ingredients in the meatballs like fresh herbs , garlic and red pepper flakes .
You can dip the meatballs in ketchup or mustard if you want , but with so much satisfying flavor packed into them you ’ll be completely satisfied eating the meatballs unadorned .
Meatballs are easy to pack for lunch .
You can also do what Shalon does and keep your freezer well - stocked ; whenever hunger hits , defrost a few for a convenient protein - packed snack .
Makes 20 large or 30 medium meatballs
Ingredients :
1 lb ground beef ( or bison )
1 lb sweet Italian sausage
2 cloves garlic , minced
1 sprig fresh rosemary , minced
3 sprigs fresh thyme , minced
1 long sprig fresh oregano , minced
1/4 cup roughly chopped flat leaf parsley
1/2 small yellow onion , roughly chopped
1/2 cup almond meal
2 eggs , whisked
1 tsp red pepper flakes
A few grinds black pepper
1/4 cup cream ( optional )
1/2 cup finely shredded parmesan ( optional )
1/4 cup bacon fat
Directions :
Remove the Italian sausage from its casing .
Mix all of the ingredients , except bacon fat , together until well combined .
With lightly oiled hands , roll the meatballs into the desired size .
To cook , heat bacon fat in a saute pan over medium to medium - high heat .
Once hot , add the meatballs .
Fry 5 - 7 minutes , until bottom is browned .
Turn meatballs to opposite side and fry until that side is nicely browned , another 5 - 7 minutes .
Cut one open to determine if it is fully cooked on the inside .
If not quite done , turn heat to low and cover pan for a few more minutes or put meatballs in a warm oven while you fry another batch .

[ Distutils ] Setuptools 0.6c10 release imminent ; please test
I 've just updated the setuptools trunk and branch with a large number of bug fixes , preparing to release 0.6c10 .
These fixes include fixes for all the setuptools bugs currently marked " in-progress " or " testing " on the setuptools bug tracker as of this moment , and I 'd like your help in ensuring that the new version is ready for release .
Major updates and fixes include : * Fix for Vista UAC errors running easy_install.exe or other " installer - looking " executables *
Fix for errors launching 64 - bit Windows Python * Fix for the Python 2.6.3 build_ext API change * Support for the most recent Sourceforge download link insanity * Support for SVN 1.6 * Stop crashing on certain types of HTTP error * Stop re-trying URLs that already failed retrieval once *
Fixes for various dependency management problems such as looping builds , re-downloading packages already present on sys.path ( but not in a registered " site " directory ) , and randomly preferring local -f packages over local installed packages * Prevent lots of spurious " already imported from another path " warnings ( e.g. when pkg_resources is imported late ) * Ensure C libraries ( as opposed to extensions ) are also built when doing bdist_egg * Fixed running the " test " command under Python 2.6 + ( 0.7 a1 trunk only )
Other changes : * Misc. documentation fixes * Improved Jython support * Fewer warnings under Python 2.6 + * Warn when ' packages ' uses paths instead of package names ( because it causes other problems , like spurious " already imported " warnings ) *
Stop using /usr / bin / sw_vers on Mac OS ( replaced w/' platform ' module calls )
You can install the updated version using easy_install ( or pip ! ) , asking for setuptools==dev ( for the 0.7a1 trunk ) or setuptools==dev06 ( for the 0.6c10 development branch ) .
But before you do that , be sure to uninstall Distribute completely .
In particular , please note that these changes are NOT a merge from Distribute ; upon review , many of the tracker - submitted patches used as a basis for forking were incorrect , incomplete , introduced new bugs , or were not addressing the root causes .
( E.g. , one of the changes I made fixes three superficially unrelated issues in the setuptools bug tracker . )
Even if some of the change descriptions are the same in Distribute , many of the fixes are implemented quite differently .

Murray also became the first man in more than four years other than Roger Federer or Rafa Nadal to hold that ranking , and he did it with a 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 victory in which the world No7 from France twice had set point to take an increasingly tense match to a third set .
At that stage Murray had to thank one or two moments of madness from Tsonga , counter - balancing much brilliance from him , too .
Overall , though , the Scot just about deserved his win for his intelligence , patience , fitness and tactical variety .
" It 's obviously special to get past Rafa ... though unfortunately Rafa has had an injury and not been able to play in the last few months , " Murray said .
" But I played well .
I will try and justify the No2 ranking which is incredibly difficult . "
The advantage of the ranking is not just one of greater status .
Provided Murray does not lose the ranking between now and the end of the Cincinnati tournament next week he will be seeded second at the US Open , reducing the chances of having to beat both Nadal and Federer to win the title .
It would have been easy to have become distracted by the significance of this .
The day before he had said : " I 've been asked about it a lot , so it 's impossible not to think about it a little bit , but when I 'm playing my match it 's the furthest thing from my mind .
The only thing I am thinking about is winning and nothing to do with rankings or anything . "
Mostly that appeared to be so , despite a frantic finish , in which the crowd screamed and Murray betrayed his edginess with one or two fraught gestures .
The first set was a curious mixture of stunning rallies , strange mistakes , a good lead lost and an advantage snatched back at the last moment .
That was because of the staccato - inducing mixture of the hit‑or - bust style favoured by Tsonga and the sprat - to - catch - a - mackerel tactics used by Murray .
These involved rolling the ball in slowly to frustrate Tsonga in his most testosterone - charged moments , playing the ball to a three - quarters length to tempt him unwisely in , switching the direction of his attacks suddenly to disrupt his opponent 's rhythm , and using slice frequently to drag groundstroking errors from Tsonga .
It did not always work .
Sometimes Murray allowed too much time and room for a talented hitter to wind up and launch something big .
But it did get him an early lead and it went some way towards undermining Tsonga mentally .
Murray floated and sliced , Tsonga volleyed one and then drove one into the net , and Murray was away with an early break – 3 - 1 , then 4 - 1 and 5 - 2 as he consolidated the break twice .
Tsonga then got 12,000 throats roaring with some moments of sublime brilliance , and prevented Murray from closing out the set , only to lose his service game for the second time as Murray coaxed and chivvied him into mistakes .
That determined Tsonga to be more disciplined in the second set .
He serve - volleyed well , but also rolled the ball and rallied a bit more when he had to .
He did though missed a chance to break for 5 - 3 – but by then the match had became physically draining .
And so the score zig - zagged on , with serve , till six - all .
Tsonga got the first mini - break , advanced to 4 - 2 with the decibels of support rising , and might have got to 5 - 2 had he not tried to make his net approach with a drop shot .
That gave Murray a break back , though he still had to save set points on his serve , at 5 - 6 and 7 - 8 .
Tsonga saved one match point with an outrageous serve / drop - volley / lob - volley combo , but when he tried to save a second with another serve- volley Murray jump - drove the ball down at his feet and forced the volleying error .
But there was no extravagant celebration .
He has a title to win tomorrow and next month 's grand slam on which to focus his attentions .
42 Ways To Radically Simplify Your Financial Life
Tweet
Note :
This is a post from Adam Baker , founder of Man Vs. Debt .
The more you simplify your financial life , the easier it is to dominate it .
I ’ve made this concept one of the pillars of my financial life in the last couple of years .
I must warn you , though , this stuff is addicting .
The more I explore this subtle art , the deeper the rabbit hole seems to go .
For me , simplicity is n’t always taking the most convenient option .
Simplicity does n’t mean pursuing automation at all costs or always choosing the option that saves the most time .
Rather , simplicity is ruthlessly cutting out anything in your life that stands between you and your passions .
It ’s a journey to increase intimacy .
The heart of simplicity is in exploring , finding what works for you , and purging the rest .
With that in mind , here are 42 ideas to help push you down the rabbit hole :
Focus on one financial goal at a time .
The average person seems to always be juggling paying down debt , building an emergency fund , saving for retirement , coming up with a down - payment , college , weddings , kids … ugh .
Instead , try passionate focusing your intensity on one goal at a time .
If you ’re attacking debt , attack debt .
If you ’re saving for a down - payment , start stockpiling .
Simplify , focus , and prioritize .
Build on your momentum .
Once you knock out one , plow through the next .
Consolidate accounts .
I seriously doubt you need 2 savings , 4 checking , and 3 separate retirement accounts .
It ’s no wonder people get lost tracking their finances .
Shoot for 1 of each .
Unfortunately , we ’re forced to have two checking accounts , one for NZ and one for U.S. Close enough , I guess .
Combine finances if married .
This battle has already been publicly fought here and on other blogs .
My preference is clear .
Invest the time upfront to create 1 account of each type , 1 set of goals , and 1 financial life .
Cancel your credit cards .
Yeah , I said cancel .
While you ’re at it burn the evidence ( in the most environmentally friendly way , of course ) .
Lower risk of identity theft , less financial accounts , less miscellaneous and erroneous fees , and cleaner reviews of credit reports makes Baker a happy boy .
By the way , it ’s been a year and my credit score is perfectly fine .
Freeze your credit reports .
For those committed to a life without credit ( or those who wo n’t need it for awhile ) , freezing your credit report can save a lot of headaches .
A freeze limits access to your report , making it much more difficult for anyone to compromise your identity .
Most states charge a fee , although a couple offer it for free .
You can even do it all online .
It does n’t get any simpler than that .
Budget using pen & paper .
I ’ve recently adopted this practice and I absolutely love it .
My new theory is if you ca n’t generate a simple budget with pen & paper … your budget is too complex .
This forces you to use broad categories and encourages you to lower your spending / monthly commitments .
Also , physically writing out your budget is a much better demonstration of comprehension than staring at fancy computer software .
Budget using last month ’s income .
This popular budgeting hack is effective for three reasons .
First , it implies that you ’re a month ahead of you bills , meaning you have a least a small cushion .
Secondly , it solves the problem of budgeting for irregular income .
Third , because it can’t change , it lends itself easily to zero - sum budgeting or the process of allocating each dollar to a specific category at the beginning of the month .
Use cash .
Try adopting cash for your discretionary spending .
The key to cash is to make the process as intimate as possible .
Using physical envelopes that represent your spending categories is a fantastic way to make your budget tangible .
It does n’t get more simple than looking down to find $ 4 left in the “ Entertainment ” envelope .
Do n’t mistake convenience for simplicity .
They are n’t always the same thing .
Batch bill paying .
The goal of this idea is to pay all the scheduled bills for the month on the same day .
I do this with our student loans .
It can be hard to do with some bills as due dates can be spread out .
However , the far majority of vendors are more than happy to take your payment a couple weeks early .
This is especially easy if you are budgeting based on last month ’s income .
Leverage calenders .
If batching your bills does n’t work well for you , set up a bill calender for a simple visualization of the month .
Most calenders can send auto - reminders to ensure you do n’t miss a regular payment .
Track your spending at the point - of - sale .
Carry a notebook .
Tap it into your iPhone .
Use whatever strategy you want , but do it at the point - of - sale .
There ’s a big difference between auto - syncing your spending into budgeting software and physically logging your spending .
Tracking in this way enforces your positive spending patterns and causes you to think twice about your impulses .
With limited practice this habit becomes second nature .
Experiment with spending hacks .
Implement “ No Spend ” days .
Try fasting from different common purchases ( no television for a month , no daily Starbucks for a week , etc… ) .
Give yourself time to adjust and test whether those reoccurring expenses are really worth it .
Add any of your “ must - have - it - now ” purchases to a 30 - day list .
Only purchase those that are still “ must - have ” after a month .
Stop thinking monthly .
When purchasing big ticket items , stop thinking about the monthly payment .
Think , negotiate , and buy based on total or lifetime cost .
This goes for contracts as well .
What ’s the total price ?
Once again this will lead to less impulse spending , less useless clutter , and , of course , less monthly payments .
Automate the flow .
Take advantage of online bill paying services .
Direct deposit your paycheck .
Ensure your accounts are properly linked .
That being said , I ’m not a huge fan of automatically paying your bills .
Streamline it so you can pay with the click of a button , but I choose to maintain control of authorizing the payments each month .
This allows me to scrutinize bills and notice erroneous fees or changes in service .
There is such a thing as too much automation .
Go paperless .
Authorize vendors to issue online billing as much as possible .
Scan and keep digital copies of any important paperwork .
Reduce your junk mail .
Good for the environment , even better for your sanity .
Insure adequately .
Invest the time upfront to understand your insurance coverage .
Know at least the very basics of your policy and how it works .
Stop making excuses and buy health insurance .
Life , home , auto , long - term disability , make sure you cover your bases .
When the time comes to use it , you ’ll life with my 1000 times more simple .
By the way , this include having a basic will .
Package services .
Speaking of insurance , package all your insurance needs with one company .
This means less contacts , less confusion , and usually will save you money anyway .
Look for ways to do this with other services like communication .
At the same time , do n’t ever get an add - on you do n’t explicitly need .
Package your needs before you start shopping .
Pay for regular services in advance .
For any service you pay monthly , check to see if you are able to pay in advance .
Often times you can pay for 3 , 6 , or 12 months .
This not only is simpler in terms of paying less often , but almost always results in a discount .
Cancel all subscriptions .
Subscriptions , especially the small ones , can really sneak up on you .
Rather than pick and choose , cancel any of them you can and start from scratch .
Be ruthless .
Do n’t re-subscribe easily , even if it ’s free ( unless it ’s to Man Vs. Debt ) .
Quit signing contracts .
Cell phone contracts , gym memberships , and even long term leases are common examples .
Stop signing this crap .
Negotiate , pay in advance , or explore alternatives .
I ’ve adapted this principle with great success in the last year .
Only sign contracts on the most essential needs in your life .
Almost everything else has several other option .
Fund an emergency fund .
This is most important for peace of mind .
If you do n’t have one of these , you have no idea what sort of stress release it is to have this in your back pocket .
It ’s changed our complete mental approach to our finances .
We treat our fund as another form of insurance .
We do n’t fret about interest rate or optimization .
It ’s just there to help spread the risk of something unexpected .
Become 100 % debt - free .
Including the mortgage .
I can only imagine what it feels like to not owe a single cent to anyone .
Must be so liberating .
I know how much more simple my financial life is now without my consumer debt and I can’t wait to knock out the rest of the student loans .
Can’t .
Wait .
Consolidate high - interest debt .
Be careful .
Normally , I vehemently oppose consolidation .
9 times out of 10 , people use this as an excuse to transfer responsibility .
They consolidate and then fall right back into the same trap .
However , my friend Matt Jabs recently consolidated his high interest debt using Lending Club .
He ’s proven there are exceptions to the rule as he ’s now more passionate than ever .
In his case , he ’s simplified it into one source and is saving a lot of interest in the process .
Create artificial scarcity .
This is more commonly referred to as “ pay yourself first . ”
The theory is to automatically transfer a portion of your income to savings and budget on the rest .
Basically , it is prioritizing your goals .
The theory is great , as long as you actually spend less than your earn .
There ’s no reason to pay yourself first , if you ’re going to overspend and continue to plunge into debt .
When done correctly , though , this ensures you ’re accomplishing even your “ boring ” financial goals .
Simplify your investments .
My theory when it comes to investing is that if you ca n’t provide a quick summary of what your investing in and how it works … you should n’t be investing in it .
You do n’t have to become a financial planner to know the basics of what your money is doing .
And , yes , you can simplify , while still maintaining diversification .
The two are n’t mutually exclusive .
Buy and hold .
Stop trying to time the markets .
There are very few exceptions and you are n’t one of them .
Neither is your cousin ’s new inside “ opportunity . ”
This game is an emotional roller coaster and the stress it causes is the exact opposite of everything that is simple .
Do it yourself .
Simplicity is n’t just doing whatever takes less time .
There is simple virtue found in embracing sustainability , creating your own products from scratch , cooking at home , and learning the skills to repair instead of replace .
At the same time , do n’t be afraid to …
Outsource tasks .
The truth is learning the skills it takes to be self - sufficient takes time and practice .
Some people are better off focusing their attention on tasks that offer more value .
More importantly , there are some things best left to trained professionals .
Outsourcing makes sense when it will increase the quality , while saving time , stress , and money .
Create a list of everything you own .
I ’ll be honest .
Creating the list , itself , is n’t simple .
Actually , it ’s pretty hard .
But the process of creating this list is sure to stimulate a quest for simplicity .
It ’ll be a wake - up call to consume less , spend less , and own less .
Sell half of the list within the next two weeks .
Here ’s where things get interesting .
Making a commitment like this will spark a wave a simplicity in multiple areas of your life .
Not only will you generate some cash , but you ’ll be saving maintenance , upkeep , and potentially storage costs for all your unused junk .
This also increases productivity as it spills into other areas of your life .
Get rid of 2 items for every 1 you buy .
Once you ’ve simplified your consumption habits , it ’s important to take measures to maintain them .
Adopting this policy will help control your spending , encourage you to borrow before you buy , and shift your focus from possessions onto experiences .
Embrace alternative transportation .
Ditch the cars .
Research public transportation .
Try the buses , trains , or subways .
Move closer to work , so you can bike .
Walk if at all possible .
In addition to the potential health benefits , you get to bypass car payments , repairs , registration , plates , gas , insurance , etc … Become a one - car family .
Alright so you have to be able to drive .
Whatever .
More and more families these days are making the jump to a one car .
Whatever you do , you ’re going to be hard pressed to explain how having 3 , 4 , or more vehicles is necessary ( not all that uncommon ) .
Go ahead and try , I ’m all ears .
Buy a smaller car .
Less upkeep and usually more efficient anyway .
Do n’t read this incorrectly , though .
This does n’t say “ buy a new car . ”
You can find dependable , late model , compact cars .
In fact , they are all over the freakin’ place .
You might have to look at more than just one website , though .
Rent .
Avoid the number one killer of financial simplicity … a house .
Two years ago , I would have been shot on sight for this suggestion .
These days , examples of buying too soon , too much , or too many are all around us .
I ’m a fan of home ownership , but you ’ve got to be 100 % ready for it .
It ’s adds an enormous amount of complexity to your financial life .
Consider a condo .
A condo could be an option if you ’re just dying from house fever , but are looking to stay as simple as possible .
Obviously , buying a condo is just as dangerous ( if not more so ) than buying a house .
It still requires 100 % commitment and offers a different set of challenges .
However , it ’s often easier to budget for “ association fees ” than it is to account for all the ups and down of maintaining a single - family home .
Buy less house .
Finally , if a house is a must , consider buying less .
One of the biggest problems with leveraging credit to purchase a home is the temptation to buy so much more than we need .
Remember , bigger home means higher maintenance , insurance , and mortgage .
Do n’t forget you ’ll need more crap to fill it up .
Simplify your income sources .
Multiple streams of income sound great , but pursuing too many options at one time can stifle them all .
I suggest having one primary and one secondary source at any one time .
If you ’re working a full - time job , trying to buy and sell on e-bay , launching your blog , and delivering pizzas on the weekend … stop .
Choose one of these side pursuits and focus your energy .
You ’ll simplify your life and most likely have more success anyway .
Discover what you do well … and do it more .
If you ’re an employee , search for whatever delivers the most value for your employer .
Once you find out , replicate it as much as possible .
Playing to your strengths will fast track your progress , as well as your satisfaction .
As an entrepreneur , you ’re goal is to find out what unique value you provide that your competitors do n’t .
Whatever extra value you offer , focus on that .
Stop trying to be everything to everyone and just be something to someone .
Learn to negotiate .
Many of the tips above will be much easier to implement when you become comfortable with a certain level of negotiating .
We all negotiate in one form or another .
It pays to learn some basic strategies to help you understand and deal with other people ’s wants .
Filter your financial advice .
Experiment with different forms of inspiration .
Find what sources click with you and which do n’t .
Hone in on those that offer value ( * cough * - Man Vs. Debt ) and throw away the sources that do n’t speak to a part of you .
Take the best parts of all the guru - system out there and craft your own .
Once you find a system that works , cut down the noise and focus on it .
Simplify other areas of your life .
Eat Less .
Passionately pursue only one hobby at a time .
Remove clutter work environment or office .
Simplicity is viral .
Come drink the kool - aid .

The tourist , who paid £ 50 for the jump , said he had no idea how the harness came loose , but that he would not sue the operator because there would be little chance of him succeeding .
President Barack Obama plans to speak to the nation 's schoolchildren on Sept.
8 . According to the U.S. Department of Education , the speech will be about " the importance of persisting and succeeding in school , " and the department is offering classroom materials to " engage students and stimulate discussion on the importance of education in their lives . "
You might think that would be a harmless topic , and that people across the political spectrum could agree on the importance of education .
Not so for the Republican Party of Florida , which released a statement " condemning President Obama 's use of taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America ’s children to his socialist agenda . "
" As the father of four children , I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama 's socialist ideology , " said Jim Greer , party chairman , in a news release .
" The idea that schoolchildren across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government - run health care , banks , and automobile companies , increasing taxes on those who create jobs , and racking up more debt than any other president , is not only infuriating , but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans , while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power , " he added .
" The Democrats have clearly lost the battle to maintain control of the message this summer , so now that school is back in session , President Obama has turned to American ’s children to spread his liberal lies , indoctrinating American ’s youngest children before they have a chance to decide for themselves , " he concluded .
The release , which we received via e-mail , told us to click a link to learn more about Obama 's speech .
That took us to the U.S. Department of Education Web site , where Secretary Arne Duncan wrote that the speech was about " the importance of education . "
" The president will challenge students to work hard , set educational goals , and take responsibility for their learning , " Duncan wrote .
" He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students , parents and educators to ensure that every child in every school receives the best education possible so they can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as American citizens . "
We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence that Obama intended to discuss health care , banks , automobile companies or taxes with the nation 's schoolchildren .
They could n't point us to anything .
A spokesman said the party was particularly concerned about the study questions the department had provided .
" The goal of these materials is to tell students why they should support President Obama in his overall agenda , " said Katie Gordon .
" If the former administration had done something like this , the media would be handling this a lot differently , " she added .
We reviewed the study materials but did n't see any mention of controversial issues , let alone any attempt to indoctrinate students in socialism .
The pre-K through 6th grade materials said the main ideas of the speech would be " citizenship , personal responsibility , civic duty . "
The materials for high schoolers mention " personal responsibility , goals , persistence . "
We searched previous media reports to see if former President George W. Bush ever gave a nationwide address to schoolchildren , but based on our search , it appears he did not .
He did , however , regularly visit individual schools and discuss the importance of education with students .
We did learn , however , that President George H.W. Bush addressed the nation 's students in a televised speech during school hours in 1991 .
'' I ca n't understand for the life of me what 's so great about being stupid , '' Bush said , according to news reports from the time .
He told students to '' block out the kids who think it 's not cool to be smart ' ' and '' work harder , learn more . ''
Democrats at the time criticized the speech .
" The Department of Education should not be producing paid political advertising for the president , it should be helping us to produce smarter students , " said Richard Gephardt , then the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives .
Republican Newt Gingrich defended Bush 's speech , though .
" Why is it political for the president of the United States to discuss education ? " Gingrich said at the time .
" It was done at a nonpolitical site and was beamed to a nonpolitical audience .
. . .
They wanted to reach the maximum audience with the maximum effect to improve education . "
But we digress .
In ruling on Greer 's statement , we wondered whether we should give him latitude for legitimate commentary on Obama 's speech .
But he crossed a line when he said that Obama intended to discuss " plans for government - run health care , banks , and automobile companies " and other policy matters not germane to education .
That is factually incorrect , and the party could not offer any support for the statement .
For raising the specter of socialist ideology and indoctrination , the party takes its claim to an additional , absurd level .
We rate the Republican Party of Florida 's statement Pants on Fire !
Update , Sept. 3 : Since we published this item , the Department of Education has modified a line in its classroom materials about the president 's speech .
A bullet point for activities after the speech used to say , " Write letters to themselves about what they can do to help the president .
These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals . "
Now it states , " Write letters to themselves about how they can achieve their short–term and long–term education goals .
These would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals . "
That change , however , does not alter our ruling .
Based on the press release that the Republican Party of Florida used as a basis for this claim , there remains no evidence that Obama intends to discuss the controversial policy issues of health care , banking , the automotive industry , taxes or the national debt during his address to students .
And so we still find the party 's claim to be Pants on Fire .
A new online " game " called Internet Eyes is about to launch , offering players a chance to earn money by spying on people through closed - circuit television cameras and reporting them to the police - for real .
Players of Internet Eyes will monitor " thousands " of CCTV cameras , watching for crimes and reporting them to the authorities in hopes of winning monthly cash prizes of up to £ 1,000 ( roughly $ 1600 ) .
The game 's website will also feature a gallery of the people busted by Internet Eyes users along with a breakdown of their crimes and which user caught them .
Tony Morgan , one of the men behind the scheme , said he and his partners were inspired to launch Internet Eyes by the fact that while the U.K. has roughly 4.2 million CCTV cameras installed throughout the country - a per-capita rate that easily outpaces even that of China - only " one in a thousand " actually gets watched .
" This could turn out to be the best crime prevention weapon there 's ever been , " Morgan said .
" I wanted to combine the serious business of stopping crime with the incentive of winning money . "
The game will be free to play , while anyone who wants a camera monitored by Internet Eyes will pay £ 20 per week for the service .
Morgan said he hopes that businesses , " local authorities " and even police forces will eventually take advantage of the service .
The game will use cameras in the town of Stratford - upon - Avon when it launches in November , with a country - wide rollout expected soon after .
" Crimes are bound to get missed but this way the cameras will be watched by lots of people 24 - hours - a - day .
It gives people something better to do than watching Big Brother when everyone is asleep , " he said , apparently without a trace of irony .
" We 've had a lot of interest from local businesses and hope to roll it out nationwide and then worldwide . "
Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the plan as Morgan , however .
Charles Farrier of the group No - CCTV called it " an appalling idea " and said , " It is something which should be nipped in the bud immediately .
It will not only encourage a dangerous spying mentality by turning crime into a game but also could lead to dangerous civil rights abuses . "
I think " appalling " is a pretty good word for it .
In the latter half of the 20th century , East Germany suffered under the incredibly repressive thumb of the Ministry for State Security , better known as the Stasi , a secret police agency famous for the extent to which it monitored the lives of everyday German citizens .
Citizen - spies employed by the Stasi reported on each other to such an extent that two decades after reunification , the nation is still struggling to come to terms with the extent of the collusion .
And now somebody wants to turn that sort of self - inflicted surveillance into a game ?
On the other hand , maybe " appalling " is n't strong enough .

A chat with Rich Sommer , Rich Sommer interview , Mad Men , Harry Crane
Interviews Home / TV Home / Bullz - Eye Home
As ad man Harry Crane , actor Rich Sommer had a good run during the second season of “ Mad Men , ” finding the cojones to get himself put in charge of Sterling Cooper ’s television branch .
Given the way that TV advertising kicked into overdrive during the ‘ 60s , outpacing print ads in rapid fashion , one can only presume that Harry will really be working his ass off in Season 3 of “ Mad Men . ”
In fact , everyone can only presume , since neither Sommer nor anyone else on the cast of the show is willing to discuss the events of the new season , lest Matthew Weiner scream , “ Off with their heads ! ” Bullz - Eye did , however , convince Sommer to discuss Season 2 of the series – now available on DVD from Lionsgate – and the developments of his character , as well as how he came to be a part of the show in the first place .
All of this , however , only took place after yours truly actually heard his phone ring .
( I ’d left it in the other room and missed Sommer ’s first two calls ! )
Bullz - Eye : I am so sorry .
Rich Sommer : ( Laughs )
It ’s okay .
How are you Will ?
BE : I am good , man .
It ’s a pleasure to talk to you .
RS : Absolutely .
You , too .
BE : The phone was in the other room and I just did not hear it .
Then I walked in here and was , like , “ Oh , crap . ”
RS : No worries , no worries .
BE : Well , like I said , it ’s a pleasure to talk to you .
I actually was out at the TCA tour last year and did the “ Mad Men ” set visit .
RS : So we may have met that very day .
BE : I ’m pretty sure we did , yeah .
Very briefly , but there was a lot going on that day .
RS : Yeah , absolutely .
It was kind of crazy .
BE : So…Season Two .
You had a good year on the show .
RS : It was fun .
It went well .
BE : Now , when did …well , I guess Matthew would have been the one who let you in on the whole “ head of television ” development for your character .
RS : Yeah .
BE : How did he approach you about that and let you know what was going to be going on ?
" Matt ( Weiner ) is a little bit impish and likes to sort of tease you with things .
Like , in the first season , when Harry was going to sleep with Hildy , he sort of would tease me and say , ' Oh , you ’ve got a little story coming up in a couple of episodes . '
I would say , ' Oh , that ’s awesome .
What is it ? '
He would say , ' You have to guess . ' "
RS : You know , we are not given much advance notice on what ’s going to happen story - wise .
( Laughs ) I believe that he may have kind of …Matt is also a little bit impish and likes to sort of tease you with things .
Like , in the first season , when Harry was going to sleep with Hildy , he sort of would tease me and say , “ Oh , you ’ve got a little story coming up in a couple of episodes . ”
I would say , “ Oh , that ’s awesome .
What is it ? ”
He would say , “ You have to guess . ”
And I ’d throw out things like , “ Is he going to ask for a promotion ? ”
He was , like , “ No , God , do you think he… ?
No , no , no .
He ’s too much of a pussy for that . ”
I was , like , “ Oh , okay , I do n’t know .
Well , then , uh … ” .
So he likes to tease a little bit .
And , so finally , when that was happening , he had sort of thrown me a little bit of a bone , saying that Harry was sort of going to grow a pair and do something .
So I did n’t know until I got the script , and I only got the script a couple of days before the read - through , which is only a day before we start shooting .
So I had really very little advance notice that he was about to be promoted .
BE : It was a nice progression throughout the course of the season .
I mean , first he ’s getting grumpy about his paycheck , and then figures out the angle to be able to throw some muscle toward what he wants .
RS : Yeah , it was really well done .
I mean , the writing on the show is ridiculous .
BE : Oh totally .
Of course , I ’m one of the members of the TCA , so we ’ve shown our appreciation more than once .
RS : That ’s true , that ’s true .
We do appreciate that .
BE : So how did you originally come on to the series ?
Was it just a standard audition , or did somebody know your work and ask you in ?
RS : It was sort of a mixture of the two .
It was a person who had been an assistant to the casting director of “ The Devil Wears Prada , ” which was a movie I had done a couple of years before that , or maybe a year before that .
BE : Right .
RS : She had switched to another casting office , and when they were looking for all these men about my age , she recommended me as someone who might be able to pull it off .
So that casting office , I did n’t know them at all .
It was my first audition there .
It was really just a weird , weird fluke .
It just worked out .
It was the only audition during that pilot season that I got a callback for , and it was my final audition of the pilot season .
It had been three miserable , horrible months where I had zero callbacks , zero positive reception .
It was one of those pilot seasons that makes you pretty sure you are never going to be an actor and never want to be an actor .
And then that happened , and it ’s the best thing that has happened to my career , obviously , ever .
So it ’s pretty awesome .
BE : Well , to look at your IMDb page , it ’s like you almost came out of nowhere , as far as working TV and film .
I mean , “ The Devil Wears Prada , ” and then bam .
RS : Yeah , it kind of was that way .
I mean , I went to grad school , so I was relatively late to the professional game .
A lot of people get into this when they are 18 or 19 or 20 .
I did n’t get to New York until I was 27 or 28 , maybe 26 .
I really have no idea .
We did a grad school showcase , and I luckily found the best management I could have hoped for .
They are still my managers to this day , and they are just fantastic .
They are Davis Spylios Management in New York , and they became sort of surrogate parents when my wife and I were in New York .
They held my hand through the whole thing and they just introduced me to the right people .
Marcia DeBonis , who ’s a casting director in New York , introduced me to Ellen Lewis , which led to “ The Devil Wears Prada . ”
It all was really just a series of happy relationships , people that I happened to sort of hit it off well with .
BE : When you first heard about “ Mad Men , ” did you have any trepidation about the fact that it was a period piece ?
Or did you just trust Matthew ’s reputation ?
RS : I had no trepidation about the fact that it was a period piece , but I also had no inkling of Matthew ’s reputation .
I had never seen “ The Sopranos ” at the time .
I had no idea who this guy was .
I read that script and …again , I had read about 30 pilot scripts that year , and the script … I mean , it sounds almost cliché at this point , but it completely blew everyone who read it away .
It was very clearly , even to someone like me , who had only been in the game for a couple of years , something special and very different from everything else that I had read .
That alone was enough reason for me to really , really want to be a part of the show , more so than any of the other things I had auditioned for .
BE : Well , I think one thing that is particularly impressive about the series for me is that , even though there are obviously key roles , like Don and Peggy , it ’s really a fantastic ensemble , and one where everybody has a major ongoing storyline .
On being cast in " Mad Men " : " It was my final audition of the pilot season .
It had been three miserable , horrible months where I had zero callbacks , zero positive reception , one of those pilot seasons that makes you pretty sure you are never going to be an actor and never want to be an actor .
And then that happened . "
RS : Yeah , it ’s the right group of people to be in .
I mean , we are really fortunate to be in not only an ensemble that is written so well , but an ensemble of really strong performers .
It ’s very exciting to go to work everyday .
Even in those episodes where I only have four lines , I know I get to contribute in some small way to one of the major story lines .
Then there are those few times each season that we kind of have our own thing to get to do .
You know , Harry and Hildy in the first season , asking to be the head of the television department in the second season .
It ’s always very exciting to get to have even a little more of an impact on this show that we are all huge fans of .
BE : As you said , Matt likes to tease the actors , but he teases the critics as well .
RS : ( Laughs )
Of course .
BE : Is it hard to do interviews when you know the critics are going to say , “ Hey , what ’s coming up ? ”
RS : You know , it ’s hard only because , of course , I want to be able to talk about it .
I want to be able to say , “ Oh , man , how about what happens in episode three of this season ? ”
Like , I ’d love to be able to talk to you about it .
But I can ’t .
I ca n’t do it .
So in that way , it ’s a little frustrating .
But also , I know not only how important it is to Matt to keep these things secret , but how much we want it to be a secret .
Because Matt has definitely instilled in us the importance of surprise .
I think in the first season , we did n’t really understand why it mattered until it started airing , and we got to see at the same time everybody else did , what this show had become , beyond what we were doing .
It became very clear , very quickly that there really is a lot of power in the sort of mystique of the show .
So while it is frustrating those handful of times that I can’t talk about it , it ’s really exciting when it does happen and you call me after episode three , or whatever it is .
Then I can really talk about it and we can really dig down deep .
That ’s always fun .
I love talking about stuff after it airs , because we ’ve all been holding onto it for six months , so it ’s killing us .
And I ’m dying to talk about it .
BE : Well , given your character and the history of advertising , I ’m obviously figuring that he ’s going to play a major role in season three , just by virtue of the fact that TV is such a major thing with advertising by then .
RS : Sure , I mean , it was definitely one of the biggest revolutions in media ever .
If not the biggest .
It changes the whole media landscape .
BE : So have you looked into anything about the history of advertising to play your part ?
RS : A little bit .
We did the first season a little bit , and then I sort of came to understand that it ’s important in a sort of contextual way , just to sort of know what ’s going on , but it ’s less important for us in regards to the story .
All the necessary history is given to us in the scripts .
And , really , our main job is to play the interactions of these people .
It ’s less about playing anything outside of that .
So I did a little bit of research before the first season , but I ’ve kind of let that go at this point because I know I ’m going to know what I need to know .
Otherwise , the rest is just Harry and Ken and Pete having a conversation , and that ’s what matters .
BE : Did you enjoy having all those scenes with Christina during the course of Season Two ?
RS : Oh , absolutely .
BE : She was very key to your storyline towards the end of the season .
On getting info about Season 3 : " You might be able to get that out of someone else , but I ca n’t be the guy , because I have a good relationship with Matt Weiner ... and I ’ve got to keep it that way ! "
RS : Yes , definitely .
And , you know , she ’s remarkable , and we had never really gotten to do any actual extended work with each other .
Harry … I ’ve been very excited about the stuff that Harry has gotten to do , from both a character standpoint and from just a nerdy actor standpoint .
You know , I am a huge fan of this show , and I ’ve gotten to do , in the first and second season , one - on - one scenes with Jon Hamm , which is , like …come on , I mean , the guy has blown up a little bit .
( Laughs )
One - on - one scenes with John Slattery , one - on - one scenes with Robert Morse … I mean , those are the things that , when I think back , are the really exciting moments .
Any of those one - on - one scenes .
Christina and I had one , Bryan Batt and I had one in the first season .
I love those little moments because those are the times when …the big boy group scenes are really fun as well , but when you get to sit down with one other actor whom you have an immense amount of respect for , and you just kind of get to take these beautiful words that the writers have given you , and you get to play with them , just even a little bit… ?
That ’s my favorite part of all of this entire process .
BE : What do you think about the painting in Mr. Cooper ’s office ?
RS : I think it is orange .
( Laughs ) I have no idea what it means .
I am not …I must admit , I have never been much of an art aficionado .
I did not know the name Rothko before we shot the episode .
Which probably gives away a lot about my intelligence level , but that ’s okay .
I ’m willing to admit that .
That ’s part of why it was pretty easy for me to play the completely bewildered Harry Crane , who had no idea why this picture was supposed to mean anything .
( Laughs )
That was a really fun scene that they let me do .
BE : I want to keep you on track here , because I was the one who made you late getting in touch with me , but it ’s been good talking you .
Do you know if you guys are going to be at the AMC function at the TCA tour this time ?
I hear they ’re having a cocktail party .
RS : Yes , that ’s right .
It ’s in a couple of weeks , in Pasadena .
We will be there .
BE : Awesome .
I thought you might .
It does n’t actually specify who ’ll be in attendance , but when it says that AMC is having a cocktail party … well , that kind of almost spells people from “ Mad Men ” being there .
RS : ( Laughs ) Yeah , we ’re definitely going to be there .
Please seek me out .
I would love to re-meet you .
BE : Definitely .
I ’ll remind you that I ’m the one that did n’t answer the phone the first two times you called .
Alright , Rich , good talking to you man .
RS : Thanks ,
Will , you too .
( Fade out on Virginia , fast - forward two weeks , and fade in on California … Pasadena , to be specific , at AMC ’s cocktail party at the Langham Huntington Hotel & Spa .
I walk up to Rich Sommer , and he spies my nametag . )
RS : Hey , hey !
We talked a couple of weeks ago … and we had a little bit of a phone kerfuffle , if I ’m remembering correctly .
( Laughs )
BE : ( Laughs )
Yes , I ’m the one who did n’t answer the phone the first two times you called .
I screen my interviews .
RS : How are you , man ?
Good to see you meet you …or re-meet you , I guess , right ?
BE : Exactly .
So , you know , I still have n’t seen the first episode of Season 3 yet , but I know that some critics have , so I did n’t know how much you were able to talk about it now , at least about the increase in the use of television in advertising .
Rich Sommer :
Well , I still feel very …we are under such lock and key that I still feel awkward saying anything .
I mean , of course , you ’re going to see how it has affected him , and , of course , you ’re going to see every character and how they have been affected by the things you have seen so far .
This show is like an elephant , it never forgets .
Everything was done for a reason ; every little move that has been made was intentional .
So certainly you ’ll see how the stuff with his wife affects him , the stuff with the baby that they were having at the end of the last season , stuff with the job , of course .
It will all be there somewhere .
BE : What is the timeframe they are going to put it in ?
RS : Timeframe in what way ?
BE : What year is this going to be in ?
RS : It is … ( Hesitates , then starts to laugh ) I ’m so sorry .
BE : That ’s cool .
It ’s totally cool .
RS : You might be able to get that out of someone else , but I ca n’t be the guy because I have a good relationship with Matt Weiner and I ’ve got to keep it that way .
( Laughs )
BE : I do n’t want to be guilty of wrecking that .
RS : You know how it is .
You ’ll know soon enough .
BE : Fair enough .
Well , I ’ll let you get to talking to people who did n’t just interview you , but there was one more thing I meant to ask you the other day : what ’s your favorite project that you ’ve worked on that did n’t get the love you thought it deserved ?
Even if it was just a one - off .
RS : Um…boy , that ’s a really tough question .
I ’ve got to be honest : I ’ve had a pretty lucky run of it here .
I mean , “ The Devil Wears Prada ” was the top - grossing comedy of that year , “ The Office ” is doing just fine with or without me , and “ Mad Men ” is “ Mad Men . ”
I mean , they did n’t give me positive reviews for my turn as a bad guy in “ Without A Trace , ” but frankly , I did n’t feel I deserved them , so I ca n’t say I was shorted there , anyway .
( Laughs )
BE : Anything in the theater you ’ve done ?
RS : No , you know , I have n’t done a play since grad school , so it has been five years since I have done a play … which is really weird to say , because that ’s the longest drought I ’ve ever had .
So it ’s very strange .
BE : Is that something you want to pursue ?
RS : Yeah , I ’m always talking to my representatives about getting a play going .
I would love to go back to New York .
Obviously , there is not the money in it that this has , but I feel like part of the bonus of doing this television show is that it affords me the opportunity to do stuff like that .
So I ’m hoping to do something in the near future .
We actually had a party the other night for an NBC miniseries , “ The Storm . ”
We had a bunch of people over …
BE : You know , they sent me a copy of that .
I watched it the other day .
RS : You did ?
BE : Yep .
RS : Huh .
( At this point , Sommer goes quiet , but in his silence , he offers an expression that says a thousand words … and possibly more . )
BE : I did n’t say anything .
RS : ( Bursts out laughing )
No , and neither did I !
But , anyway , we had Bryan Batt , Michael Gladis , Aaron Staton … everybody was over at my house .
We started talking about how much fun it would be to do a play , the four of us .
So that night , we went on to Dramatists Play Service online and found four - man plays and ordered a pile of them .
So they will be coming to my house , and we ’ll start reading them and just see if we can be a little proactive about this thing .
BE : You know , I would love to see you guys do “ Glengarry Glen Ross ” .
RS : ( Grins )
That would be really fun .
And that was one that was brought up .
But , you know , they just did it on Broadway , so it ’s probably unlikely .
But there are a few names that we have been talking about .
We all know enough people that maybe we could pull something together .
It would be fun .
BE : Okay , man , thanks .
And it ’s good to see you in person again .
: You , too , Will !
The last few Case - Shiller readings showed improved sequential home prices in many regions , but analysts widely expect the index to droop again , as the summer homebuying season ends .
We 'll see .
The next one will be crucial .
In the meantime , other research indicates that the slide is back .
Here , for example , is the FHFA , whiich today said that home prices declined 0.3 % from July to August , after past months showed increases .
This is an interesting chart showing home prices off the peak .
( the full announcement is embedded below ) .
Separately , Altos Research is out with data for September , showing a 0.5 % decline in housing
Again , we eagerly await the new Case - Shiller data for confirmation .

In 1988 , Disney Imagineering was searching for a Lockheed Electra 12A airplane like the one seen in the 1942 film Casablanca .
They planned to use it as part of a Casablanca tableau in The Great Movie Ride , an attraction planned for the new Disney - MGM Studios theme park scheduled to open in Orlando the following year .
They eventually found the type of plane they were looking for in the hands of one Ed Walker of Hondo , Texas .
Walker not only had an Electra 12A on hand , but one that had purportedly been used in several films during the 1940s ( including Tarzan ’s New York Adventure ) before disappearing into an obscure career that reportedly saw it used to seed clouds over Texas , owned by several different flying clubs , sold to a junior college , obtained by persons who used it for “ criminal purposes , ” and finally sold to MGM for use in a 1976 TV movie about Amelia Earhart , whose producers supposedly planned to blow up the plane on camera until the “ threat of a lawsuit ” ( filed by whom ? ) dissuaded them from doing so .
The Lockheed was finally purchased by John Tarsikes of Devine , Texas , who in turn sold it to Walker , from whom Disney bought it .
Soon after Disney acquired the plane from Walker , they began trumpeting the discovery that their Lockheed Electra 12A was n’t merely like the one used in Casablanca ; according to its serial number ( 1204 ) , it actually was the airplane used in Casablanca !
There was one small problem with Disney ’s serendipitious claim , however — no such airplane appeared in the film .
Casablanca began filming just a few months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , when military security in southern California was at its height in anticipation of another Japanese attack on the aircraft manufacturing facilities and military installations found along the coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego .
Location shooting by movie studios in this area was severely restricted , and filming at facilities such as airports was prohibited altogether .
Therefore , Casablanca was shot entirely on soundstages at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank ; and Soundstage # 1 , which was used for the film ’s climactic airport scene , was n’t large enough to accommodate a real airplane .
That final scene , in which Rick Blaine ( Humphrey Bogart ) and Ilsa Lund ( Ingrid Bergman ) say their final goodbyes as the plane to Lisbon ( the one which will carry Ilsa out of Rick ’s life forever ) warms up in the background is one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history , and this is the scene Disney recreated in their Great Movie Ride , for which they needed a real Lockheed Electra 12A .
However , when Warner Bros. filmed the scene , they found their soundstage was too small to accommodate a real airplane , so the studio ’s prop men constructed half - and quarter - size models of a Lockheed Electra 12A out of plywood and balsa .
Midgets garbed in jumpsuits were hired to move in and around the replica planes to camouflage their smaller - than - life scale , and the whole scene was swathed in machine - generated fog to further conceal the artificiality of the setting .
( Fog certainly was n’t added for any touch of realism , as foggy nights are a rarity in in Casablanca . )
The one Casablanca scene shot outside a sound stage did involve an airplane , but it was n’t a Lockheed Electra 12A .
Major Strasser ’s arrival in Casablanca was filmed at Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys ( now known as Van Nuys airport ) on 10 July 1942 , after some of the wartime restrictions on location shooting had been loosened .
However , according to Richard E. Osborne ’s Casablanca Companion , the plane that carried Major Strasser to Casablanca in that scene was a Travel - Air light transport plane manufactured in the late 1920s , not a Lockheed .
So , since Disney purchased a real Lockheed Electra 12A , not a Travel - Air , and not a wooden scale model , how could they possibly have “ the ” plane actually used in the film ?
The answer is , they do n’t .
But it created some great publicity for their new theme park to claim that they did .
Only the front part of the Lockheed Electra was eventually used for The Great Movie Ride ; the back half appeared in both the Studios Backlot Tour and the Magic Kingdom ’s Jungle Cruise attraction .
Even though both Disney and one of the plane ’s former owners were careful to say that the Lockheed Electra “ may have been ” ( or “ probably was ” ) the one actually used in the film , Disney cast members at the Disney - MGM Studios theme park still identify it as the “ actual plane ” used in Casablanca .
Tire manufacturer Yokohama is now selling a model made with 80 percent non-petroleum material , substituting orange oil as the primary ingredient to make vulcanized rubber .
The new tire is called the Super E-spec™ and has already received the Popular Mechanics Editor ’s Choice Award in 2008 .
Yokohama will initially market the tire for hybrid car models such as the Toyota Prius .
“ The eco-focused dB Super E - spec mixes sustainable orange oil and natural rubber to drastically cut the use of petroleum , without compromising performance , ” Yokohama vice president of sales Dan King said .
“ It also helps consumers save money at the gas pump by improving fuel efficiency via a 20 - percent reduction in rolling resistance . ”
Orange oil is considered sustainable because it is produced from a renewable resource .
The same philosophy of reducing petroleum use is utilized in producing plastics from corn starch or vegetable oil .
Yokohama has yet to release the environmental impact of disposing these tires , which typically provides an environmental concern .
The petroleum in traditional tires can burn for months in a landfill and is difficult to extinguish .
These fires also release black smoke and toxins into the air .
Yokohama has not specified whether the orange oil will biodegrade over time .
The process for recycling tires involves devulcanizing the rubber , which would essentially remove the oil and extract natural rubber .
Because this is an expensive process , used tires are often shredded and turned into playground surfacing or additives for the soil in sports turf .
It can also be reused as artwork .

The San Diego Supercomputer Center has built a high - performance computer with solid - state drives , which the center says could help solve science problems faster than systems with traditional hard drives .
The flash drive will provide faster data throughput , which should help the supercomputer analyze data an " order - of - magnitude faster " than hard drive - based supercomputers , said Allan Snavely , associate director at SDSC , in a statement .
SDSC is a part of the University of California , San Diego .
" This means it can solve data - mining problems that are looking for the proverbial ' needle in the haystack ' more than 10 times faster than could be done on even much larger supercomputers that still rely on older ' spinning disk ' technology , " Snavely said .
SDSC intends to use the HPC system -- called Dash -- to develop new cures for diseases and to understand the development of Earth .
Solid - state drives , or SSDs , store data on flash memory chips .
Unlike hard drives , which store data on magnetic platters , SSDs have no moving parts , making them rugged and less vulnerable to failure .
SSDs are also considered to be less power - hungry .
Flash memory provides faster data transfer times and better latency than hard drives , said Michael Norman , interim director of SDSC in the statement .
New hardware like sensor networks and simulators are feeding lots of data to the supercomputer , and flash memory more quickly stores and analyzes that data .
Calling it the first HPC system to use flash memory technology , the system has already begun trial runs , SDSC said .
It has 68 Appro International GreenBlade servers with dual - socket quad - core Intel Xeon 5500 series processor nodes offering up to 5.2 teraflops of performance at peak speeds .
It has 48 GB of memory per nodem , which gives users access to up to 768 GB of memory over 16 nodes .
The system uses Intel 's SATA solid - state drives , with four special I / O nodes serving up 1TB of flash memory to any other node .
The university did not immediately respond to a query about the total available storage in the supercomputer .
SSDs could be better storage technology than hard drives as scientific research is time - sensitive , said Jim Handy , director at Objective Analysis , a semiconductor research firm .
The quicker read and write times of SSDs compared to hard drives contribute to providing faster results , he said .
SSDs are also slowly making their way into larger server installations that do online transaction processing , like stock market trades and credit - card transactions , he said .
Many data centers also a employ a mix of SSDs and hard drives to store data , Handy said .
Data that is frequently accessed is stored on SSDs for faster processing , while hard drives are used to store data that is less frequently needed .
" Hard drives are still the most cost - effective way of hanging on to data , " Handy said .
But for scientific research and financial services , the results are driven by speed , which makes SSDs makes worth the investment .
Remember the guy we told you about who desperately wanted someone to buy him a JetBlue unlimited travel pass ?
The guy who actually thinks flying every single day for a month will be fun ?
Well , he got his ticket .
We 're the suckers who bought it for him .
Meet Brendan Ross , Wired.com 's Terminal Man .
The 28 - year - old Texan is waiting for the feds to grant a security clearance so he can begin working as an air traffic controller .
Until the FAA makes sure he 's never applied for a position with the North Korean government , Brendan has no money , no responsibilities and a severe case of wanderlust .
He figured jetting around for a month would pass the time , but he could n't swing the ticket .
We got wind of him after reading his funny Craigslist ad and offered him a job blogging about his adventures exploring JetBlue 's route map .
Sounds like a cushy gig , no ?
Well , wait until you hear the rules .
We are n't gonna make this easy on him .
And we 're going to let you , our dear readers , help us decide where he should go and what he should do .
Now then .
About the rules .
First and foremost , if he 's not on a plane , he 's in an airport .
No hotels .
Before you jump all over us for this , it was Brendan 's idea .
He told us he feels leaving the airport is cheating .
Second , he can't check any bags .
Again , this was his idea .
He carries everything with him .
Third , he has to fly every day if possible , with a planned itinerary of as many as 68 flights .
Like Biff Henderson , he has to comply with any zany antics we foist on him , from getting the nicknames of every captain he flies with to finding the JetBlue E190 Sarah Palin chartered .
He is totally cool with this , and in fact told us he would wear a chicken suit .
( He owns one .
Seriously . )
We told him that would n't be necessary .
Still , he 's fully aware of just how grueling this will be .
" There 's definitely a concern over the toll that so many flights will take , " Brendan told us .
" Add into that the physiological toll of sleeping in airports every night , being surrounded by people that usually do n't want to talk to you … .
It wo n't be a walk in the park . "
No , it wo n't .
The only thing that might save him from insanity is you .
We 're inviting readers to participate in Brendan 's journey , but without sleeping in chairs and eating soggy overpriced Wolfgang Puck Express sandwiches .
Let us know where you want him to go and what you want him to do .
Follow his journey on Twitter and bring him some real food and a bar of soap if your paths cross .
If he 's feeling generous , you might even get some cool Wired swag .
Surprisingly , Ross does n't seem too worried about any of this .
" A lot of people can relate to getting caught for a few hours , overnight , maybe even a day or two , " he told us .
" This is taking it to an extreme , setting me out there with just what you 'd find in a typical carry - on . "
While that guy who lived on an AirTran plane for a month at least got to put his seat in the reclined position once the plane took off , Brenan is stuck with long nights in terminals .
He 's a self - styled Mehran Karimi Nasseri or Hiroshi Nahara .
" That 's usually going to mean hitting up those long , black and chrome seats you find everywhere , " he said .
" Once in a while I might have to manage outside if the airport kicks me out for the night .
That 's all right .
I 've been on some extended backpacking trips , and have slept in places worse than what you 'll find in public airports .
I have the feeling that the uglier the conditions are , the more interesting of a story it 'll make . "
Luckily for his fellow passengers and those brave Wired.com readers who venture into arrival lounges to meet him , Brendan says he 'll maintain decent personal hygiene even without the benefit of a shower .
How ?
We 're not sure .
" I do n't want to tip my hand just yet , but I will say that people are n't going to be uncomfortable sitting next to me once I get three weeks into the trip , " he said .
" I 've had to share rows before with those guys with visible stink lines .
It sucks , I know .
I do n't plan on imparting that experience onto anyone else . "
Aside from overzealous TSA agents in tiny airports that are n't used to overnight guests , Brendan says the biggest hassle will be all the time away from his wife .
" It was a downer at first , but we were able to come up with a free frequent flier ticket and cheap airfare to one of my stops , so I 'll actually get to see her two or three times , albeit briefly , " he said .
The great adventure begins when Ross leaves Austin , Texas on Sept.
8 . He 'll meet the Wired.com crew in San Francisco , then take to the air .
We want you to help us decide where he goes and what he does .

Flying an airplane , like driving a car , requires using your hands and your feet .
While cars can be modified so the disabled can drive , there have been few options for people who can't use their legs but still wish to fly .
Scott Johnson wants to change that .
Most people are familiar with the stick or yoke used to make the airplane pitch up and down or bank left and right .
But airplanes also have two pedals that direct the rudder , which is critical in controlling the aircraft in turns or a tricky crosswind .
The Minneapolis flight instructor said he'd received phone calls from people who dreamed of becoming pilots but were told they could n't because of their disability , so he decided to find a way to open the sky to them .
“ It ’s fun to teach somebody to fly ” Johnson told Wired.com .
“ But when you take somebody who ’s been told no over and over again and then find a way to do it , that ’s the most amazing feeling . ”
There have been a few pilots with disabilities who have been issued a pilot 's license from the FAA .
Just this year Jessica
Cox made headlines when she earned her license despite being born without arms .
Cox and some others fly an Ercoupe , a design from the 1940s that eliminates rudder pedals by connecting the rudder to the yoke .
But the Ercoupe has limitations , especially in a crosswind takeoff or landing .
Johnson wanted to develop a system using a modern aircraft that would retain all the capabilities of the conventional controller design .
Johnson ’s flight school , LSA North , uses small , two - seat composite planes made by Flight Design in Germany .
He already had one student who had lost a leg to cancer and had been taking flying lessons but could n’t fly solo .
When an Iraq war veteran who lost the use of his legs in a bomb blast contacted him , Johnson knew it was time to find a solution .
“ I never take no for an answer ” Johnson said .
Over the winter he asked the engineers at Flight Design about the possibility of modifying the airplane used by his flight school to only need hand controls , much like a car with the brake and throttle controls on the steering wheel .
Johnson was n’t sure how long it would take to build , or what the controls might look like .
The guys at Flight Design did n't disappoint – they brought a prototype control set to the AirVenture air show in Oshkosh last month and installed it in one of Johnson 's planes .
He was thrilled with the result .
“ People were surprised how simple it was , ” Johnson says , “ It seems so intuitive to use the hand controls . ”
Flight Design modified a conventional control stick by giving it two handles .
The right handle is fixed and moves the entire stick to control pitch and bank as it would in a typical airplane .
The left handle can be pushed forward and back to control the rudder .
There 's also a button to control the throttle since using the modified control stick requires keeping both hands on the stick during take off and landing .
The factory still has a few final modifications to make to the prototypes , and Johnson says he hopes to see a final production version soon .
His student pilots were n’t able to see the prototypes in person , but were impressed with the pictures and are excitedly looking forward to taking to the skies on their own .

• Samples sold from £ 4 each to help gain disability grants •
Scam growing as sufferers compete to sell stolen clinic bottles
South Africans in an impoverished township are profiting from an illegal trade in a precious new currency ‑ saliva .
Tuberculosis sufferers in Khayelitsha , Cape Town , were found to be selling samples of their sputum to healthy people to pass off as their own in a scam to gain medical grants .
An investigation by the West Cape News identified people with TB charging R50 - 100 ( £ 4.10 - £ 8.20 ) for saliva samples contained in bottles stolen from health clinics .
The paper said that buyers of the samples were then able to get a card from a clinic indicating they have TB and use this to fraudulently obtain a temporary disability grant of R1,010 per month from the department of social development .
A 54 - year - old man told a reporter that he makes an average of R500 per month from selling his saliva to people seeking to trick their way on to the benefits system .
But he said business was " not good " because so many people were infected with TB in the township that he had a lot of competition .
John Heinrich , chief executive of the SA National Tuberculosis Association , said : " It is definitely happening .
People are trying to get a grant by pretending to be TB positive .
Instead of handing their own sputum in , they buy it from people who have TB - positive sputum . "
He added : " They go to the clinics and get treated as TB patients .
People are supposed to produce their sputum under supervision , but I 'm sure when the clinics get busy , that does n't happen . "
South Africa has one of the highest TB rates in the world with around half a million new cases each year , resulting in 78,000 related deaths .
Poverty , malnutrition , HIV and cramped conditions in townships such as Khayelitsha , one of the biggest in the country , help the infectious disease to thrive .
Heinrich added : " There is so much unemployment , especially in that area of the Western Cape , that if there 's a chance to make money , people will jump at it .
The authorities should insist that samples are handed in to clinics under supervision . "
The West Cape News journalist went to a clinic in the township and was given two bottles by a health worker , but was not asked to cough up the sputum in the worker 's presence , making it easy to swap the bottles .
Fidel Hadebe , a spokesman for the national health department , condemned the trade as illegal and " based on greed " .
He said : " This is wrong and can not be allowed .
People have to be tested by professional workers . "
Crisis averted .
Jobs safe .
Vice - like grip on the Wallabies continued .
All in a night 's work for the suddenly awesome All Blacks .
But the big question we 'll be asking ourselves as we digest this comprehensive 33 - 6 Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup victory over the Wallabies over our Sunday morning breakfast will be just what value do we place on it ?
Really , was it any great surprise ?
The All Blacks have now won six of their last seven tests against the Wallabies over the last two seasons , since a certain Robbie Deans slunk across the Tasman to take charge of the Men in Gold .
And this latest instalment simply continued that trend .
Graham
Henry might not be able to buy a win over the Springboks right now ; but he owns Deans .
And really as much as the All Blacks are tying themselves in knots over their inability to counter the South African game ; they must feel pretty satisfied about the superiority they hold over their trans - Tasman rivals .
They 've now swept them 3 - 0 in the Tri-Nations and will surely make it a round four in Japan next month .
Really , if ever the Wallabies were going to redress the imbalance , you would have thought this match would have been it .
But they simply were n't good enough as the All Blacks convincingly won the arm - wrestle through the first three quarters and then came home with a wet sail and two late tries to inflate the margin out close to embarrassing territory for the Wobberlies .
This was among the more convincing wins over the Australians over the last couple of years , too , with the All Blacks dominating most aspects of play , including that much talked - about lineout , and successfully suffocating everything and anything the visitors could throw at them on attack .
Yes , it was a performance to be proud of from the All Blacks who avoided the spectre of their first ever three home loss season , and answered their critics in fine style .
This was how we expect them to play .
This was how they should play .
Their set - piece work was excellent , their breakdown game top drawer and , possibly for the first time this season , the All Blacks got their attacking game going .
It was a sweet response , and would have been manna from heaven for the under - siege New Zealand coaches .
Credit to them , too , to rally the troops after the defeat in Hamilton and come up with improvements in areas where they had to be made .
" I 'm pretty proud of the guys , it 's never easy coming off a loss and the belief among the whole group was outstanding and to put a performance out here tonight ... very , very happy , " said skipper Richie McCaw afterwards .
He was rapt with the lineout response that saw the All Blacks hold firm on their own ball and even steal two straight Wallaby throws ( both by supersub Jason Eaton ) late in the piece .
" We kept the belief in ourselves , " said McCaw .
" We realised last week it was only minor things that went wrong , the boys worked hard all week and put that together which is vital to get your game going .
" It 's great .
When you 're down it 's a real test of what character you 've got within the team . "
Wow .
What a difference a week - and a few harsh words from their critics - made .
The All Blacks looked a different side in the first 40 minutes of this contest , playing with a purpose , precision and penetration that had not been there in Hamilton , nor for that matter in any of their opening salvos throughout this competition .
A strong , and accurate , opening half was punctuated by a magical period around the half - hour mark right about when it looked most ominous .
Centre Isaia Toeava had just been despatched to the sin-bin for a high tackle on young Wallaby fullback James O'Connor , and from the same play phase Berrick Barnes had just coolly slotted a dropped goal ( under advantage ) to close the Wallabies to within three , at 6 - 9 .
Ten minutes , a man up , we all steeled for the Wallaby charge that would surely come .
Instead it was the numerically disadvantaged All Blacks who pounced .
During a nice spell where they did extremely well to limit the Australian chances to expose them , wing Cory Jane snatched a try - quite literally - out of thin air .
It had looked distinctly unpromising when fullback Mils Muliaina received backtrack ball his side of halfway and sort of ran out of options for the pass .
So instead he hoisted one of those middle - of - the - field high bombs that the Springboks specialise in , but are catching on like wildfire at the moment .
It could have - should have - been diffused with little discomfort by the Wallabies .
Could have , schmould have .
Instead Jane came flying through the air like , well , Tarzan , plucking the ball from right under the nose of startled Australian wunderkind James O'Connor and then dashing 35 metres or so for a superb try , and a 16 - 6 lead they would hold till the break .
Where has this man been all season ?
Oh , that 's right , not required .
The Wallabies came out with plenty of purpose after the break , but they could still find no way through an All Black side that remained on its mettle on defence .
Carter slotted an early penalty to extend the margin to 13 , the All Blacks battened down the hatches for a period of Wallaby dominance and then straight after Eaton had come in with his lineout thievery they finished with their flourish .
Ma'a Nonu had the second try six minutes from the end , with a trademark bullocking run that left a handful of Wallaby defenders looking like fools ; and before it was over the All Blacks worked a couple of quick phases off a scrum before putting Josevata Rokocoko into enough space on the right to unleash one of those swan dives for his 45th test try .
And , with Carter slotting a second goal off the upright , the margin went out to 33 - 6 , and the bleeding was well and truly stopped .
The All Blacks were mostly all on top of their games .
Jane was superb on the wing , and surely he 's earned more starts on the back of this .
Toeava had one of those tests that remind you why his coaches covet him so and there was also a much improved showing from Rokocoko .
Also , was n't it good to see Mils Muliaina playing with a lot more confidence ?
Up front new chum Tom Donnelly had an excellent debut in the second row , Andrew Hore got his lineout stuff right , Adam Thomson added some much - needed mobility to a loose trio that outplayed their opposites and the set - piece stuff was , by and large , on the money .
Richie McCaw was back to his best too as the All Blacks won the tackle ball area comprehensively .
The Wallabies ?
O'Connor had a match to forget , Giteau was again well contained by the All Blacks and the Australian backline in general found themselves running at a black wall all night .
The Wallaby forwards also could make little or no headway all night , and even failed to procure the supposedly failsafe method of possession via the All Black lineout .
Pocock and Smith were non-factors .
For the All Blacks the questions were answered .
For the Wallabies they start all over again across the Tasman .
Deans should buckle down for another assault .
New Zealand 33 ( Cory Jane , Ma'a Nonu , Joe Rokocoko tries ; Daniel Carter 4 pen , 3 con )
Australia 6 ( Matt Giteau pen , Berrick Barnes dropped goal ) .
Halftime : 16-6 .
" The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) is no longer an active initiative and as such this website will act as an archive for SPP documents .
There will not be any updates to this site . "
- Disclaimer from the U.S. government 's SPP website .
In October 2007 , Globe and Mail reporter John Ibbitson predicted that a then two - year - old effort to deepen and expand NAFTA called the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) would die unless North American leaders put some backbone into it .
Too much of the discussion was happening behind closed doors , wrote Ibbitson , himself a big supporter of the SPP and one of the only journalists to ever write about it in the Canadian media .
" If you 're going to negotiate freer trade , " he said , " sing it from the rooftops .
Keep the media informed .
Make it a Big Deal . "
Well governments did n't sing ( or not loudly enough ) , barely informed the media , and it fell to alter - globalization and social justice movements in Canada , Mexico and the United States , including the Council of Canadians , to highlight its many flaws .
As a result , the NAFTA - plus agenda died in Guadalajara , Mexico last week .
We killed it .
And we should be singing it from the rooftops .
So why the stage fright ?
Maybe it 's because things do n't feel all that different .
Many of the SPP 's underlying principles -- integrating energy and electricity markets , jointly policing the continent against Osama bin Laden and other common perceived threats , and cutting regulations to help businesses make more money -- remain in place as official North American priorities after Guadalajara .
The lack of media attention might also be killing our buzz .
But should we really let this oversight , from a tri-national press corps that missed the SPP 's corporate conception
in 2003 , its official birth four years ago , and almost every major initiative since , stop us from dancing in the streets ?
Maybe we 're distracted by the odd persistence of the name " Security and Prosperity Partnership " in Liberal Party press releases , and desperate statements from corporate lobbies trying to keep the SPP agenda alive .
But let 's try to see the former as grief ( the SPP was a Liberal creation ) and the latter as a sign of perhaps our most significant victory : the end of the North American Competitiveness Council ( NACC ) .
Before Guadalajara , there was a lot of speculation whether Barack Obama , Stephen Harper and Felipe Calderón would extend another invitation to the NACC , that blue - chip panel of powerful North American CEOs , which had for the past two years submitted reports to leaders directing them on where to take the SPP dialogue .
The NACC was institutionalized in June 2006 " so that the work will continue through changes in administrations , " said former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez .
And " directing " is not too strong a word to describe the panel 's relationship to the SPP process .
Access to information requests by Saskatchewan blogger Joe Kutchta in early 2008 uncovered proof that the Canada Border Services Agency was under pressure to respond to business sector priorities for the department .
Unfortunately for the CEOs , neither the SPP nor the NACC could survive a change in U.S. administration .
Perhaps still waiting for an invite to Guadalajara , and clinging desperately to a powerful but now useless moniker , the NACC meekly offered North American leaders one last five - page report about the evils of protectionism .
" We and the business communities we represent trust that our advice to date has assisted Leaders in choosing priorities and driving progress , " it said .
" Going forward , the NACC stands ready to offer our ideas and expertise , and we hope the three governments will continue to consult with the NACC . "
The NACC may continue to exist .
It might even meet every now and then to dream up new priorities for the three North American governments .
But we have successfully robbed these CEOs of their privileged spot inside North American summits .
Heck , our leaders even opened the door a crack to wide public consultation on annual summit priorities .
There was a legitimate concern prior to Guadalajara that Obama would simply continue the SPP under a different name .
One authoritative report from the Brookings Institution even recommended it .
And we know that some NAFTA / SPP working groups will continue to operate .
An example is the North American Biotechnology Initiative to develop a common regulatory environment for genetically engineered crops .
But the fact remains that the SPP as a venue for North American integration , like the Free Trade Area of the Americas as a venue for hemispheric integration before it , has perished .
This presents challenges and opportunities for human rights , environmental , civil liberties , farmers , unions and social justice organizations that had come together , often across borders , to fight the anti-democratic Security and Prosperity Partnership .
We may not have a big target to thump away at anymore , but the separation of trade and security policy under the Obama administration helps us shed more light on the injustices perpetuated by both .
The delinking of Mexico from the Harper government 's vision of North America also opens up room for targeted solidarity work with Mexican groups fighting the militarization of drug and border enforcement under the Merida Initiative .
( Harper 's contribution , announced in Guadalajara , of RCMP training for Mexican police , on top of the new visa requirements for Mexican travellers , makes this solidarity work even more important . )
Furthermore , a new space has opened up for a reinvigorated civil society push to renegotiate NAFTA .
Obama has , in a way , only gone back on his promise to enter into discussions about renegotiation within 100 days of being elected .
If you read carefully his statement
before Guadalajara , the President says he still wants to strengthen the labour and environmental side agreements by possibly bringing them into the body of NAFTA , but that now is not the time to do it .
We can't give up that space so quickly , even if we know deep down that now is the perfect time to renegotiate NAFTA , when the old " free trade " model bares so much responsibility for the current economic downturn .
Finally , as Canadians , the death of the SPP ( and the change in administration that preceded it ) forces us to focus more on our own government .
Former U.S. President Bush provided a convenient target to embody all the evils of NAFTA expansion through the SPP .
In the new dynamic it 's Harper and Calderon playing " free trade " bullies to Obama 's more pragmatic approach to economic development -- an approach that encourages investment in America 's local and national economies even at risk of appearing " protectionist . "
It 's time to regroup and rethink , for sure .
But please let 's do it with a bottle of champagne -- even if it's one from the cheap shelf .
The SPP is dead and we killed it .
Let 's recognize what we have achieved and then get back to work .
Stuart Trew is trade campaigner for the Council of Canadians .
Sudan 's genocidal Darfur war still attracts international attention , and though large battles pitting national government troops against Darfur rebels are less frequent there , violent anarchy still afflicts that sad region .
A much larger and more dangerous war haunts Sudan , however : a re-ignition of the " North versus South " civil war .
This reviving horror has ominous implications not only for East Africa but all nations straddling sub-Saharan Africa 's " Arab - Black " ethnic and " Muslim - Christian " divides .
The last North - South war ( the Second Sudan Civil War ) lasted for two decades , left approximately 2 million dead , created millions of refugees and -- despite ritual denials by the northern , Islamist , " national government " in Khartoum -- involved slaving operations by northern - backed " Arab " militias .
The evidence for this evil was damnably clear .
South Sudanese black tribespeople would be kidnapped and then sold as laborers in the north .
The " third civil war " would be as vicious as the last , but given current political conditions , could rapidly expand beyond Sudan and become a regional war involving several other impoverished , fragile states in East Africa -- a war of the poor creating greater poverty and anarchy .
The Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) , signed in January 2005 , created a map with interim milestones for resolving the civil war .
Today the peace map is tattered .
Interim successes have been undermined by cynical manipulation , corruption , chaotic bloodshed and -- here 's the deep worry -- the likelihood of calculated " proxy war " instigated by the north and thinly masked as tribal disputes .
The situation has deteriorated despite U.N. peacekeepers deployed in the south .
UNMIS ( UN Mission in Sudan ) was initially regarded as a success .
China contributes troop contingents .
China 's role as peacekeeper , however , is overshadowed by its role as oil field developer and oil customer .
Sudan 's oil fields inconveniently stretch across the North - South boundary , but to classify the conflict as another oil war vastly oversimplifies the complex problems .
In fact , China may have played a passive role in exposing what many southerners believe is revenue - cheating by the national government .
The CPA guaranteed a fair split of oil income between the national government and the semi-autonomous Government of South Sudan ( GOSS ) .
Recently , a human rights group sympathetic to GOSS said it had evidence that Khartoum reported less production from the oilfields than the Chinese oil company operating the fields reported .
Khartoum denies the accusation .
Oil revenue sharing is but one trouble .
The CPA called for a fair border demarcation process that would take into account " verbal information " from tribal leaders as well as " physical features of the landscape . "
A demarcation decision issued by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague this July was regarded as a major accomplishment -- until affected tribespeople spurned it , with good reason .
The civil war destroyed traditional settlement patterns , as people fled the violence .
Now returning refugees clash with new settlers .
This happened in the oil - rich Abyei area , when Ngok Dinka returnees ( southerners ) clashed with the " Arabized " Misseriya tribe .
( Abyei was the scene of an outright battle between northern and southern security forces in 2008 . )
Khartoum and the GOSS have yet to agree on census figures , which are required for conducting honest national elections -- which leads to what Khartoum really fears : a vote by southerners favoring the formation of a completely separate state .
Suspicion abounds .
Southerners suspect this year 's spate of inter-tribal violence in South Sudan is being stoked by the north .
At least 1,200 people have died in these ugly battles .
The southerners believe Khartoum 's goal is to undermine the independence referendum by destabilizing the south .
Other wars intertwine .
Uganda always insisted that the Ugandan rebel Lords Resistance Army ( LRA ) was a tool of Khartoum .
Now a revived LRA is appearing in South Sudan , and more than a few Ugandans suspect that " Arab " Khartoum has assisted the LRA .
GOSS says it will fight to protect its people .
Kenya and Uganda ( both predominantly Christian nations with a substantial number of Muslim citizens ) are lined up behind GOSS .
The stage is set for an East African conflagration .

An attorney for Alabama death row inmate Max Landon Payne says he does n't expect to file last - minute appeals to stop Thursday 's scheduled execution .
Attorney Bruce Nestor of Minneapolis said Tuesday that Payne has exhausted his available appeals .
Payne is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Thursday at Holman Prison in Atmore .
Prisons spokesman Brian Corbett said Payne was being moved into a holding cell near the execution chamber .
Payne was convicted of kidnapping , robbing and killing the owner of a Cullman County grocery store , Braxton Brown , on March 23 , 1992 .
Brown was shot in the face with a shotgun and his body dumped into Crooked Creek .
Payne was arrested a day later at a bus station in Miami , Fla .

" Replacing a government monopoly with a government - sanctioned corporate monopoly simply transfers the bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption from one entity to another . "
Throngs of tweenies rushed to buy their copies of the June 2009 issue of Rolling Stone , eager to read about the adorable Jonas Brothers .
As they flipped it open , questions rushed through their heads : " Are they on tour ? " " Do they have girlfriends ? "
" What do they look for in a girl ? "
What those girls were n't asking themselves was " How was Goldman Sachs , the world 's most profitable investment bank , involved in creating the current financial crisis ? "
But that did n't stop Matt Taibbi from answering that question in the same issue of Rolling Stone , in his article , " The Great American Bubble Machine . "
Interestingly , in a November 9 , 2007 , interview with Marty Beckerman of Reason , Taibbi actually described himself as " more of a libertarian than anything else . "
Unfortunately , in keeping with Rolling Stone 's dominant line , Taibbi's attack on Goldman Sachs was quite antimarket .
He coolly placed the blame for the US financial crisis on the shoulders of this lone company .
However , he did manage to illuminate the bank 's relationship with government regulators and the Federal Reserve .
As the saying goes , " even a broken clock is right twice a day . "
Here 's the danger though : The Rolling Stone audience is young and impressionable .
Most already harbor the belief that the current economic crisis is the result of capitalism 's failure .
Now , I 'm not going to delve into the ins and outs of Goldman Sachs or dissect Taibbi's " investigative journalism . "
But I feel it important to set the record straight in case one rogue 13 - year - old decides to learn more about the situation with Goldman and happens to stumble upon Mises.org .
" What those girls were n't asking themselves was ' How was Goldman Sachs , the world 's most profitable investment bank , involved in creating the current financial crisis ? ' "
Taibbi writes ,
What you need to know is the big picture :
If America is circling the drain , Goldman Sachs has found a way to be that drain — an extremely unfortunate loophole in the system of Western democratic capitalism , which never foresaw that in a society governed passively by free markets and free elections , organized greed always defeats disorganized democracy .
Yet a few paragraphs later he goes on to say ,
They [ Goldman ] hoover up vast sums from the middle and lower floors of society with the aid of a crippled and corrupt state that allows it to rewrite the rules in exchange for the relative pennies the bank throws at political patronage .
There you have it .
Taibbi first characterizes the corruption at Goldman Sachs as an inevitable result of " free markets and free elections , " then argues that it was made possible by " the aid of a crippled and corrupt state . "
So , which is it ?
The free markets or the state - sanctioned corruption ?
These are entirely different arguments and they must be carefully treated as such .
I will be the first to argue against the state aiding and abetting corporations .
Among the advocates of the laissez - faire system , there is a clear understanding that such aid is corporatism or corporate socialism .
Yet in all such schemes , the hand of government regulators is disguised so well that when the scheme fails , most people see the puppet but overlook the puppet master .
Perhaps Taibbi can be forgiven for the error .
After all , we have been witness to numerous such shell games at the hands of government .
Consider Philadelphia 's failed attempt to " privatize " education .
The city hired the services of a supposedly private corporation called Edison to oversee it .
All the schools were taken over by Edison and the city paid it to manage them .
With no competition in sight and a guarantee of payment by the government regardless of performance , Edison 's operation was completely inefficient , and it promptly failed .
The proponents of public education were ecstatic .
They could say to the world , " See — we 're open - minded .
We tried using the market to educate children and it failed ; capitalism failed . "
Wrong !
Capitalism did n't fail ; corporatism failed .
Capitalism works when government stays out of the way completely .
In a free market , prices go down and quality goes up .
Why ?
Because private companies are competing with one another for your dollars .
" It was the hidden hand of government that failed , not the market . "
The rationale behind " privatizing " education is that it would introduce the element of competition .
Schools would not hold a monopoly in their districts and would not be guaranteed students .
Therefore , they would have to improve education levels to attract their students .
Replacing a government monopoly with a government - sanctioned corporate monopoly simply transfers the bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption from one entity to another .
And who can forget California 's " energy deregulation " scheme ?
That fiasco began when voters passed a ballot measure mandating energy deregulation .
Well , the legislature together with a handful of private corporations ( including Enron ) devised a system guaranteed to fail : they partially deregulated energy supply while keeping consumer prices tightly capped .
As was to be expected , energy sold on the spot market increased overall costs for suppliers , due in large part to manufactured shortages by energy brokers like Enron .
Consumers gobbled up more and more wattage in the comfort of prices that government regulators kept artificially low , and the entire system began to collapse .
Moreover , the government made it impossible for anyone to construct new power plants , thus ensuring that no one would be able to meet the rising demand for energy .
In the end , the scheme worked from the perspective of the government and the corporate energy brokers .
A few companies earned record profits on the energy spot market , Californians were forced to endure rolling blackouts due to supply shortages , and consumer prices ultimately rose to meet demand .
The spin was the same : free markets in energy do not work .
But once again , it was the hidden hand of government that failed , not the market .
And do n't get me started on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These quasi- private corporations may benefit from privatized profits but their losses are socialized , creating a huge moral hazard .
Where does it all end ?
Whether we are discussing farm subsidies , bailouts , corporate favoritism , or licenses and privileges given to certain companies , we are in fact seeing the myriad ways that government has reared its head into the markets .
Government and corporations invent scheme after scheme to ensure the superficial appearance of free enterprise , line the pockets of each , and shield the government from any blame .
These market interventions create all - powerful corporations , which are seen as capitalist greed at its worst .
This typically occurs among utilities companies .
Their existence and profits are often guaranteed by government , making them completely inefficient .
The public then blames the inefficiency on corporate greed and , of course , on capitalism .
In reality , this is just more socialism .
So Matt Taibbi missed the mark entirely .
Goldman
Sachs may well deserve its share of blame for the financial crisis , but should n't we also take a quick gander at the hidden hand of government ?
Corporatism may have failed , but true free - market capitalism has never even been given a chance .
And , unfortunately for those 13 - year - old girls , Kevin Jonas is , in fact , engaged ! :(
It also came after the Obama administration announced that it would retool a European missile defense system fiercely opposed by Russia .
That move was thought to have paid dividends for the White House when Mr. Medvedev appeared to throw his support behind Mr. Obama on Iran , though American officials say the Russian president was also likely to have been reacting to the disclosure of the secret nuclear site near Qum .
After the meeting with Mr. Lavrov , Mrs. Clinton met Mr. Medvedev later on Tuesday , and two administration officials said he did not retreat from his support in his private discussions with her .
But he said nothing about Iran publicly before or after the meeting .
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin , who has been skeptical of sanctions , was in China on a trade mission .
Mr. Lavrov said that the talks in Geneva between Iran and other countries had raised hopes for a diplomatic solution , and that it made no sense to discuss sanctions as long as those negotiations were under way .
“ We are maybe not 100 percent , but still have chances to succeed , ” he said .
His position conflicts with that of the Obama administration , which argues that the threat of sanctions is crucial to the prospect for a diplomatic solution .
Unless Russia and China join the United States and Europe in signaling that the sanctions may be necessary if diplomacy fails , American officials have said , Iran has less incentive to make concessions .
A Russian refusal to back sanctions could expose the Obama administration to criticism at home , where Republicans have argued that the president yielded to Kremlin concerns on the missile shield without getting much in return .

" House Republicans have gone way too far , " said Jennifer Crider , spokewoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
" The NRCC 's despicable promotion of a video comparing Nancy Pelosi 's effort to reform health care to America to Adolf Hitler 's extermination of millions is a shocking new low that must be condemned .

" We saw the video this morning and thought , like other parodies , that it was funny , " Randall just told me .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A law has been proposed in France that would see digitally enhanced images carry a warning to viewers that the image has been retouched to change the physical appearance of a person .
The proposed statement may eventually apply to political campaigns , billboards , photos on packaging , art photos , and press photographs as well as advertisements in magazines and newspapers .
The law has been proposed by Valerie Boyer , a member of parliament in France , because of concerns that airbrushed or " photoshopped " images can distort how people , especially young people , see themselves .
Boyer is an advocate for awareness of body image problems such as obesity and anorexia , and worries that the preponderance of enhanced images in magazines encourages people to believe in a non-existent reality .
Boyer believes the disclaimers could help young people realize that touched - up images distort reality .
She said that many adolescents , especially young girls , have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is not , and they can develop body image problems and unrealistic expectations , that can sometimes lead to anorexia and other serious health problems .
Boyer , a member of French President Nicolas Sarkozy 's UMP party , is backed by fifty other politicians , who are also concerned about protecting consumers , especially young people .
Boyer said the group wants to fight the stereotype of women all being young and slim .
The move follows a charter agreed to voluntarily by the fashion industry in France to avoid promoting extreme thinness .
If the proposal becomes law French advertisers could be fined up to half the cost of their advertising campaign , or over $ 54,000 ( US ) , if they do not include the statement .
The law is currently being debated in the French parliament .

The Boeing plant in Everett , Wash. , is assembling the new 787 Dreamliner , which has been plagued with delays related to outsourcing .
The Dreamliner , the first passenger plane to be made mainly with light plastic composites , is now more than two years late and still awaits its first flight tests .

Blue - green algae blooms on Minnesota lakes are linked to a dog death and illnesses , and apparently caused by runoff pollution .
[ social_buttons ]
The death of a dog after it frolicked in a Minnesota lake plagued with blue - green algae was a sad coda for a late summer in the state .
Although no necropsy was done , a spokesperson for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said “ the circumstances and manner of death were consistent with exposure to algal toxins . ”
He added that the MPCA had received reports of several other sick dogs likely exposed to the algae .
Compounding the sadness , the dog that died after exposure in Fox Lake , a black Lab named Sady , was a wedding gift to the dog ’s owners from a friend and soldier killed in Iraq .
Each year , MPCA issues a summer alert about blue - green algae blooms in lakes , chiefly in the southern and southwestern portions of the state .
They ’re often received and filed without much attention .
This year , blooms almost escaped attention because of a cool early summer .
But recent warm , dry weather spawned a September bloom .
Although human deaths are extremely rare from exposure to blue - green algae , but it can cause skin irritation and nausea .
Young children are more susceptible than adults .
MPCA observes , “ There is no single factor that causes an algae bloom .
A combination of factors such as excessive nutrients , warm temperatures , and lots of sunlight all encourage the growth of blue - green algae .
A primary cause , excess nutrients ( e.g. phosphorus ) , is largely due to nonpoint source runoff from agricultural lands ( e.g. , row crops ) , urban areas ( e.g. streets , parking lots , lawns , etc. ) , and point sources , such as wastewater treatment facilities . ”
This week , the MPCA also proposed adding about 400 lakes and river segments to the state ’s list of impaired waters , bringing the total to 3,049 .
About $ 100 million of new money per year from the state ’s Clean Water , Land and Legacy Amendment , approved by Minnesota voters in November 2008 , is dedicated to cleaning up all impaired waters over the next 25 years .

Duany is sometimes ( and unfairly ) likened to a monk laboriously transcribing the texts of the ancients without contributing new ideas for a new time .
But style was n’t what irked him when I brought up the Make It Right project .
It was the whole way New Orleans was approaching rebuilding .
“ When I originally thought of New Orleans , I was conditioned by the press to think of it as an extremely ill - governed city , full of ill - educated people , with a great deal of crime , a great deal of dirt , a great deal of poverty , ” said Duany , who grew up in Cuba .
“ And when I arrived , I did indeed find it to be all those things .
Then one day I was walking down the street and I had this kind of brain thing , and I thought I was in Cuba .
Weird !
And then I realized at that moment that New Orleans was not an American city , it was a Caribbean city .
Once you recalibrate , it becomes the best - governed , cleanest , most efficient , and best - educated city in the Caribbean .
New Orleans is actually the Geneva of the Caribbean . ”
Duany said that many of the shotgun houses in New Orleans were built by the fathers and grandfathers of people living in them today , and few of them meet building codes .
But no one worries about paying mortgages or insurance .
“ The situation is that the housing is essentially paid off , and it allows people to accumulate leisure , ” he said .
“ What ’s special about New Orleans is that it ’s the only place in the United States where you can have a first - rate urban life for very little money . ”
What happened after Katrina , Duany said , was that FEMA and others came to town with detailed requirements for record - keeping and property titles , then insisted on stringent building codes that would make all the houses hurricane - proof .
This might seem like common sense , he said , but it ’s “ essentially unworkable for a Caribbean city . ”
So the central problem , according to Duany : “ All the do - goody people attempting to preserve the culture are the same do - gooders who are raising the standards for the building of houses , and are the same do - gooders who are giving people partial mortgages and putting them in debt , ” he said .
“ They have such a profound misunderstanding of the culture of the Caribbean that they ’re destroying it .
The heart of the tragedy is that New Orleans is not being measured by Caribbean standards .
It ’s being measured by Minnesota standards . ”
As an alternative , Duany argues for “ opt - out zones ” for some of the hardest - hit areas , including the Lower Ninth .
Within these zones , residents could rebuild their homes the way the city was originally constructed : by hand , incrementally , and unencumbered by what Duany calls “ gold - plated ” building regulations or bank requirements .
Such zones exist in rural areas , he says , but have n’t been tested in an urban context .
He suggested that the money spent on the Better Living Through Modern Green Design homes would be far better spent on a widespread , low - cost self - building program .
“ The deal is , you can hammer something together any old way , but you wo n’t have debt .
That should be an option .
Carrying debt requires a great deal of employment , which undermines a culture of leisure .
The key is self - building , ” he told me , and added that it might arise somewhere else in the city , perhaps among the Latino construction workers who arrived on the heels of the storm .
“ It always emerges . ”
3105 Law Street
From his front porch , Mingko Aba can look across the street to the house where he was born 59 years ago .
Actually , he ’s looking slightly downward at it , because his new house is built about five feet up , on piers .
He also has a pretty good vantage point for seeing the progress in his Upper Ninth Ward neighborhood , which flooded but was spared the tsunami that swept homes off their foundations across the canal in the Lower Ninth after the levee broke .
While news reports and disaster movies remind us about tipping points for Arctic melt and sea level rise , some things closer to home get less attention .
Take food supply : new modelling studies show that there are climate tipping points here too , beyond which crop yields will collapse .
Wolfram Schlenker at Columbia University , New York , and Michael Roberts at North Carolina State University in Raleigh used a high - resolution dataset of weather patterns from 1950 to 2005 to discover how yields of three key US crops would respond to increasing temperatures .
“ The single best predictor of a year ’s yield is the amount of time temperatures exceed about 29 °C and the extent to which they do so , ” they say .
“ Below this , warmer temperatures are beneficial for yields , but the damaging effects above 29 °C are staggeringly large . ”

Maize massacred
Overall , the results suggest that yields of maize , cotton and soybean drop by roughly 0.6 per cent for each “ degree - day ” spent above 29 °C .
A degree - day is a measure devised by the team to indicate by how much 29 °C is exceeded and the time spent above that threshold .
At present , agricultural regions across the US spend an average of 57 degree - days above 29 °C during the growing season .
That ’s likely to rise as the world warms .
Using a model of future climate change the researchers found that the number of degree - days above 29 °C in a growing season could rise to 413 by the end of the century if we do not cut greenhouse gas emissions .
This would cause maize yields to fall by 82 per cent .
Even if we reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 relative to 1991 levels – a target that governments are struggling to agree on – yields could still fall by between 30 and 46 per cent .
“ These estimates of yield loss are amongst the best we have , ” says David Bohan , head of the Ecosystem Dynamics and Biodiversity group at Rothamsted Research , UK .
States of hunger
The US is the world ’s largest producer and exporter of crops , accounting for around 40 per cent of global maize and soybean production .
“ If US yields go down a lot , it could drive up prices of staple food commodities all around the world ” , say the researchers .
“ Almost surely the poor would suffer far more that the US would . ”
David Pimentel at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , argues that curbing biofuel production would tackle starvation and high food prices far quicker than curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
“ Some 66 per cent of the world population malnourished , yet the US turns 33 per cent of its corn crops into biofuels , ” he says .

Imagine an alternate timeline where Walt Disney 's most beloved rodent took to the skies to invade Japan .
He 'd ride bats , right ?
And command an army of snakes ?
No ?
Well , the Imperialist Japanese government of the early 1940s must have thought so , otherwise it's hard to explain this propaganda piece demonizing Western culture and influence for young audiences .
All kidding aside , the surreal short does hearken back to a far darker period for American and Japanese relations .
This clip seems to hail from an era prior to World War II , but its implications show an enormously different atmosphere for cultural exchange - especially in terms of importing entertainment .
The moral ?
The cross pollination of Eastern and Western ideas and styles in comics , animation and beyond is a healthy , healthy thing .
Watch the clip after the jump to remind yourself just HOW healthy ...

Not Just Clashing With The Titans
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Monday , 12th of October 2009 - 03:26 PM ]
After reading the press release , below , I am now completely certain that this game is going to be total and utter shit .
They turned an epic story of a SINGLE hero into a fucking multiplayer experience .
A story of one man 's journey to save loved ones as well as quell a war between gods and man .
At least that is a simplified view of the original .
The new one is just a story of Perseus trying to save his family from Hades , played by Ralph Fiennes of Voldemort fame .
How the hell can you make this a multiplayer game ?
Besides trying to placate to the general conditioning that games HAVE TO HAVE multiplayer to be worth anything .
It 's like making a Resident Evil film literally based off the first game .
An hour and a half of silence , with about half an hour of talking .
It 's just too much of a stretch to make it work as a multiplayer style game .
Granted it does have a solo play mode , but it makes no sense to force multiplayer in a game based on a solo " played " film .
I guess they could go the Young Hercules route .
Randomly add characters just to give " air " time to actors that would normal get any .
Just video game characters in this aspect though .

( THEME )
HOST :
Welcome to AMERICAN MOSAIC -- VOA ¡¯s radio magazine in Special English .
( THEME )
This is Doug Johnson .
On our program today :
We play some music nominated for a Grammy Award ...
Tell about a new study of Internet use in the United States ...
And report about the winners of two awards for the best children¡¯s books .
Newberry & Caldecott Award Winners
HOST :
Each year , the American Library Association presents awards for the best books for children .
The Newbery and Caldecott awards honor excellence in writing and art in children¡¯s literature .
The winners were announced at a meeting of the association last month .
Shep O¡ ¯Neal tells us about them .
ANNCR :
A thirteen - year - old boy living in fourteenth century England is the hero of the book that won the Newbery Award for writing .
The book is called ¡°Crispin : The Cross of Lead .¡± Crispin is accused of murder and must run away from his village .
A juggler becomes his protector and teacher .
Crispin was a teenager seven - hundred - years ago .
Yet he was searching for freedom like many young people today .
The head of the committee that names the Newbery Award winner says readers can ¡°see , hear , smell , taste and feel¡± Crispin¡¯s world .
The book was written by Avi , a popular American writer who uses only one name .
Avi is from New York City .
He says he was not a good student in school .
He did not start writing stories for children until he had children of his own .
He says it takes about one year for him to write one book .
Avi urges his young readers to ¡°Listen and watch the world around you .
Do not be satisfied with answers others give you .
Work to get answers on your own .
Understand why you believe things .¡±
The Caldecott Medal for the best artwork in children¡¯s books in the United States went to Eric Rohmann .
Mister Rohmann wrote and drew the pictures for the book ¡°My Friend Rabbit .¡±
In the story , a mouse shares a new toy airplane with his friend the rabbit .
The airplane lands in a tree .
So the rabbit gets an elephant , a crocodile and a hippopotamus to help rescue the plane .
All of these animals fall on and off the pages in a very funny story for young children .
Mister Rohmann made the pictures for the story with woodcuts .
To make a woodcut , the artist cuts designs or pictures in wood .
The artist prints the pictures on paper and then paints them .
The head of the Caldecott Award committee says the pictures show a lot of energy and bright colors .
One group of children said the eyes of the animals tell a lot of the story .
UCLA Internet Study
HOST :
A recent university study asked more than two - thousand Americans who use computers where they get most of their information .
The answer may surprise you .
Mary Tillotson has more .
ANNCR :
The University of California at Los Angeles did the study .
It says about sixty - one percent of the people said the Internet was their most important source of information .
The other answers were books , newspapers , television , radio and magazines .
Jeffrey Cole is the Director of the UCLA Center for Communications Policy .
He says the Internet has become the most popular information source after existing for only about eight years as a communications tool .
Mister Cole says this is the third year that UCLA has done the study .
It is the first time the Internet was the top answer .
Mister Cole said people are able to gather information much quicker now than in the past .
He said this may be the main reason for the increased use of the Internet as an information - gathering tool .
However , the UCLA study also showed a decrease in the number of people who trust the information they find on the Internet .
Two years ago , fifty - eight percent of those questioned said they believed the information on the Internet was true .
In the latest study , only about fifty - three percent of the people said they would trust information from the Internet .
Mister Cole says this could be a problem for Internet information in the future .
How long will it be before people no longer value what they learn on the Internet ?
The study showed the Internet is extremely popular and is continuing to grow .
About seventy percent of Americans now use the Internet .
Sixty percent of them are linked to the Internet at home .
That is an increase of more than thirteen percent in only two years .
The study also showed that almost thirty percent of Americans do not use the Internet .
Their main reason is not understanding the technology .
Some people say they are afraid to try using the Internet .
The UCLA report also showed that the Internet continues to grow as an important business and professional tool .
It said that most Internet users are happy with it .
The users said they are most satisfied to be able to communicate with other people very quickly .

" The environment is a topic on everyone 's lips and it 's pretty difficult to park around here .
So we came up with the idea of an 'eco discount ' of five euros ( £ 4.50 ) to anyone who leaves the car at home , " Ms Goetz told AFP .
A long time ago , Nicolas Cage started a fan war when he was selected to play Tim Burton 's Superman in the final adventure of the Man Of Steel .
Now test pictures have leaked of the actor in the blue suit .

The movie 's screenplay was written by Kevin Smith and eventually rewritten by Wesley Strick .
The whole thing was set to film in 1999 .
But after spending loads of cash , the studio eventually dropped the movie , which centered on Superman 's demise .
This was a good thing , because as much as I enjoy a bad Nic Cage movie , with the yelling on every other emphasis , I do n't think I could handle him as America 's greatest hero .

Four generations of UC Berkeley law school alumni joined activists , community members and lawyers on the Boalt Hall steps to protest former Bush administration lawyer John Yoo ’s return to campus Monday .
The group called for Yoo to be prosecuted and fired from his position as professor of law at UC Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall School of Law for writing memorandums which were used to justify extensive policies on detention and interrogation , even torture .
The Obama administration has so far showed little interest in prosecuting those who worked for the Bush administration .
Despite criticism from protesters and from the National Lawyers ’ Guild about Yoo ’s continuing employment at UC Berkeley , Boalt Hall Dean Christopher Edley has defended Yoo ’s actions as academic freedom .
Chanting “ Yoo should be ashamed , ” and “ I am so over Yoo , ” the crowd assembled outside Boalt Hall at 1:30 p.m.
Monday , closely watched by UC police , as students and professors walked in and out of the building .
The event was organized by the National Lawyer ’s Guild , World Ca n’t Wait and Code Pink , whose members dressed up as “ Pink Police ” and included a dog sporting a pink “ arrest torture ” button .
When the UC Police Department told the event organizers they would not be allowed to use amplifiers outside the building , the speakers either talked loudly or stood on boxes to have their voices heard .
Members of the National Lawyer ’s Guild stressed that Yoo should be held accountable for his actions , which they said had led to the torture of thousands of U.S. political prisoners .
Sharon Adams , a guild member , called Yoo ’s memos “ inane ” and “ secretive . ”
“ In the name of democracy , Yoo did all he could to undermine democracy , ” she said , talking about the much criticized wiretapping and controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding .
“ This is the kind of person who is teaching our next generation of lawyers .
...
He should be prosecuted for war crimes . ”
The infamous Abu Ghraib torture pictures , which came to public attention in 2004 , dotted Boalt ’s steps , with several individuals posing as hooded prisoners in chains , and one of them resembling the iconic man on top of a box .
Dan Siegal , a 1970 Boalt Hall alumnus and nationally known trial and appellate lawyer , said he was angry and frustrated that Edley , a staunch advocate of civil rights , continues to head a faculty which includes a “ war criminal . ”
“ There is little doubt that John Yoo is a war criminal , ” Siegal said .
“ There are some who try to bastardize the situation , as if Yoo wrote a law review .
This person wrote an ideological and legal basis for torture .
I am hoping that if Dean Edley does n’t get wise , we will march down to Yoo ’s office next time . ”
Ann Fagan Ginger , Boalt Hall Class of 1960 , decried Edley using academic freedom as the basis of Yoo ’s actions .
Ginger , who leads the Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Institute in Berkeley , said UC Berkeley students should have the academic freedom to take classes from someone who had not been charged with being a war criminal .
In this post , I would like to share a little jQuery code snippet that makes getting URL parameters and their values more convenient .
Recently , while working on one of my projects , I needed to read and get parameter values from URL string of the current page that was constructed and sent by PHP script .
I came across this short and sweet JavaScript code snippet by Roshambo that does just that .
// Read a page 's GET URL variables and return them as an associative array .
function getUrlVars ( ) { var vars = [ ] , hash ; var hashes = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf ('? ' ) + 1 ) .split ('&' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < hashes.length ; i++) { hash = hashes [ i ].split ('= ' ) ; vars.push ( hash [ 0 ] ) ; vars [ hash [ 0 ] ] = hash [ 1 ] ; } return vars ; }
The function returns an array / object with your URL parameters and their values .
For example , consider we have the following URL :
http://www.example.com/?me=myValue&name2=SomeOtherValue
Calling getUrlVars ( ) function would return you the following array :
{ " me " : " myValue " , " name2 " : " SomeOtherValue " }
To get a value of first parameter you would do this :
var first = getUrlVars ( ) [ " me " ] ; //
To get the second parameter var second = getUrlVars ( ) [ " name2 " ] ;
To make the script syntax to look more jQuery like syntax I rewrote it as an extension for jQuery :
$ .extend ( { getUrlVars : function ( ) { var vars = [ ] , hash ; var hashes = window.location.href.slice(window.location.href.indexOf ('? ' ) + 1 ) .split ('&' ) ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < hashes.length ; i++) { hash = hashes [ i ].split ('= ' ) ; vars.push ( hash [ 0 ] ) ; vars [ hash [ 0 ] ] = hash [ 1 ] ; } return vars ; } , getUrlVar : function ( name ) { return $.getUrlVars ( ) [ name ] ; } } ) ;
Now , if you include the above code in your javascript file , you can get URL parameter values in the following way :
// Get object of URL parameters var allVars = $.getUrlVars ( ) ; //
Getting URL var by its nam var byName = $ .getUrlVar ( ' name ' ) ;
That ’s it !

The vaccine works by making girls immune to strains of a STI A 14 - year - old girl has died after being given a cervical cancer jab as part of a national immunisation programme , but the exact cause of death is unknown .
The pupil was taken ill at Blue Coat CofE School in Coventry shortly after she received the Cervarix vaccine .
She died in the town 's University Hospital .
The local NHS said there would be a " short pause " in the vaccination programme but it would then continue .
The batch of the vaccine used has been placed into quarantine .
The injection protects against a sexually transmitted disease , which is linked to most cervical cancers .
A routine programme of vaccinating 12 and 13 - year - old girls started in September 2008 across the UK using the Cervarix vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline .
A catch - up campaign is now under way for older girls .
The injection offers protection against the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , the most common cause of cervical cancer .
' Urgent investigation '
The girl , who has not yet been named , died at lunchtime on Monday .
We are conducting an urgent and full investigation into the events surrounding this tragedy
Dr Caron Grainger Dr Caron Grainger , joint director of public health for NHS Coventry and Coventry City Council , said their sympathies are with the girl 's family and friends .
She said : " The incident happened shortly after the girl had received her HPV vaccine in the school .
No link can be made between the death and the vaccine until all the facts are known and a post - mortem takes place .
" We are conducting an urgent and full investigation into the events surrounding this tragedy . "
A small number of girls at the school had also reported mild symptoms such as dizziness and nausea but they were not admitted to hospital .
In a statement posted on the school 's website , headteacher Dr Julie Roberts said during the immunisation , " one of the girls suffered a rare , but extreme reaction to the vaccine " .
" A number of other girls also reported being unwell and some were sent home , " she said .
" If your daughter has received a vaccine today we ask that you are extra vigilant regarding any signs or symptoms . "
She listed possible reactions as mild to moderate short - lasting pain at the injection site , headache , muscle pain , fatigue and a low - grade fever .
' Tragic death '
It is thought about a million girls have already safely received the vaccine .
When the national immunisation project was announced , there was some controversy about the selection of Cervarix over Gardasil , which is used by the majority of vaccination programmes worldwide .
It is important we have the results of further investigations as soon as possible to establish the cause of this sad event
Department of Health
Q&A : The cervical cancer vaccine Dr Pim Kon , medical director at GlaxoSmithKline UK , which makes Cervarix , said : " Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of the young girl .
" We are working with the Department of Health and MHRA ( Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ) to better understand this case , as at this stage the exact cause of this tragic death is unknown . "
The global pharmaceutical company added that the vast majority of suspected adverse reactions have related either to the symptoms of recognised side effects or were due to the injection process and not the vaccine itself .
Different vaccine Public health minister Gillian Merron said : " Our deepest sympathies are with the family .
It is important we have the results of further investigations as soon as possible to establish the cause of this sad event . "
In the UK , about 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year and about 1,000 die from it .
The department said Cervarix had a strong safety record .
Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the tragedy needed to be investigated " as a matter of urgency " .
He said : " This again raises the question which we have asked for some time , as to why the government wo n't publish the assessments it made of the relative merits of the two HPV vaccines and why we therefore use a different vaccine to most other comparable countries . "
There are more than 100 types of HPV but only 13 of them are known to cause cancer .
Cervarix protects against two strains of HPV that cause more than 70 % of cases of cervical cancer in women .
Vaccination is not compulsory and consent is required before it is administered to the under - 16s .

Updated on Thursday at 11 a.m.:
Jeff Zucker , CEO of NBC Universal , told employees in an email Thursday morning that " a number of possible things could happen " if part owner Vivendi sells its 20 percent stake in the company .
He did not comment on TheWrap ’s exclusive report Wednesday that NBC Universal is in talks with Comcast for a potential sale .
He wrote :
" Given the attractive nature of our assets , there is always significant interest in NBC Universal , " he wrote in the email .
" That has been amplified lately by the annual discussion with Vivendi about its 20 percent ownership of our company .
Vivendi has been a superb owner of NBC Universal , along with GE , for more than five years .
They have not yet made us aware of any final decisions about their future with us ; should they choose to exit , there are a number of possible things that could happen . "
Meanwhile , CNBC reported Thursday that the negotiations between Comcast and the entertainment company involved spinning off the unit into a new company , with Comcast taking 51 percent economic control of the company .
More to come on this story as developments arise … .
Updated on Wednesday at 5:20 p.m.:
Comcast , the nation ’s leading provider of cable , entertainment and communications products and services , is in talks to buy the entertainment giant NBC Universal from General Electric , according to knowledgeable individuals .
Deal points were hammered out at a meeting among bankers for both sides in New York on Tuesday , executives familiar with the meeting said .
Two individuals informed about the meeting said that a deal had already been completed at a purchase price of $ 35 billion .
But other executives said a deal was not complete , and Comcast denied there was a deal in place :
“ While we do not normally comment on M&A rumors , the report that Comcast has a deal to purchase NBC Universal is inaccurate . ”
A spokeswoman for NBC Universal had no comment .
NBC Universal has been believed to be in play for months , although GE has publicly denied any intention of selling the unit .
In recent weeks , minority stakeholder Vivendi has been apparently preparing to exercise its right to sell 20 percent of the entertainment company in an IPO .
Comcast has been among those rumored to be interested in buying that equity .
But the Tuesday meeting was about a much larger gambit , according to the knowledgeable individuals .
The NBC Universal division of GE , a premium content company , is a likely fit for the cable giant with its massive distribution pipeline .
That is especially the case when the division ’s potential price tag has dropped significantly from a year ago .
Comcast ’s market cap is $ 48.44 billion .
NBC Universal has fallen in value to an estimated $ 35 billion , from about $ 55 billion a year ago .
Other suitors have been rumored to be interested in NBC Universal , including Time Warner .
Time Warner has denied any interest in a purchase .
The talks come after a rough summer for Universal Pictures , which had one of the worst box office runs in the studio ’s recent past .
And NBC has remained mired in fourth place among broadcast networks .
The message transmitted at a tense board meeting in New York in July — where top NBC Universal executives including Jeff Zucker ( pictured above ; at right , with Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts ) , Ron Meyer , Marc Shmuger and David Linde all met with GE ’s CEO Jeff Immelt and Vivendi representatives — was that something had better change soon .
Earnings at the studio have been down drastically from last year for the second quarter in a row .
Judd Apatow’s “ Funny People " brought in only $ 60 million worldwide , while “ Bruno " brought in the same amount domestically .
On the Will Ferell comedy “ Land of the Lost , " Universal lost some $ 40 million .
General Electric originally purchased NBC for $ 6.28 billion in 1985 , and in May 2004 , merged with Vivendi — which owned Universal Studios and cable channels USA Bravo and Sci Fi ( now Syfy ) .
( NBC bought Bravo in 2002 from Rainbow Media . )
At the time , NBC had been the only big TV network that was n’t a part of a media conglomerate and did not have its own production studio before the two companies joined .
Vivendi got $ 3.4 billion in cash as a part of the deal , and GE assumed $ 1.7 billion in debt from Vivendi .
GE took an 80 percent stake in the company and left the remaining 20 percent to Vivendi .
Under the terms of the 2004 deal , Vivendi can has the right to sell its stake , but it can only exercise its option each year from Nov. 15 though the Friday of the first full week of December .
Comcast continues on a spree of its own .
In 2001 , it took on the assets of AT&T Broadband for $ 44.5 billion .
The companies merged and retained the Comcast name .
In February 2004 , the company made an $ 66 billion bid for the Walt Disney Co .
That bid was rejected , but late that year , Comcast entered in a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to buy MGM and its affiliate studio United Artists .
The deal allows Comcast to carry the studios ’ material on cable and online .
Comcast also operates E! Entertainment Television .
A top executive at a major conglomerate had n’t heard about the talks until TheWrap broke the news on Wednesday evening .
" But it does make some sense , " he said .
" They ( Comcast ) have always wanted to be in content business — and now more than ever with their TV Everywhere experiments .
Long shot– ( but ) it is n’t crazy . "
Comcast and Time Warner recently began experimenting with a plan to give cable subscribers premium access to TV content online .
The hope is to encourage consumers to use their Comcast or Time Warner broadband services to watch shows on the cable companies ’ streaming services , rather than outside networks such as Hulu .
NBC , of course is a partner in Hulu , so it ’s unclear just how TV Everywhere would mesh with Comcast ’s potential purchase of the Peacock .

Just yesterday San Francisco saw the unveiling of the world ’s first algae fuel - powered vehicle , dubbed the Algaeus .
The plug - in hybrid car , which is a Prius tricked out with a nickel metal hydride battery and a plug , runs on green crude from Sapphire Energy — no modifications to the gasoline engine necessary .
The set - up is so effective , according to FUEL producer Rebecca Harrell , that the Algaeus can run on approximately 25 gallons from coast to coast !
“ Powering our cars with algae - based fuel could be the next Apollo mission . ”
That ’s what Rebecca Harrell , co-founder of the Veggie Van Organization and producer of the upcoming film FUEL , told me yesterday in front of San Francisco ’s City Hall .
Over the next 10 days she ’ll be joined by Fuel director and Veggie Van Organization cofounder Josh Tickell as they take the Algaeus , along with a caravan of other green energy vehicles ( including the Veggie Van and the biodiesel - powered big green energy bus ) , on a cross-country road trip .
“ It hit us that we needed to drive the car across the country , ” Harrell said .
“ People think of algae fuel as this long - term , far off thing .
But seeing is believing . ”
And of course , the cross-country tour will also serve to promote FUEL , a film about America ’s ongoing dependence on foreign oil .
Unlike many environmentally - themed films that serve up upsetting bits of information without offering concrete solutions ( An Inconvenient Truth , anyone ? ) , FUEL discusses the ways that we can transition away from oil right now .
“ What ’s important for everyday people is information .
People do n’t say ‘ Can you give me something else to be scared about ? ’
They say , ‘ How can I get my car to run on algae fuel ? ’ , Tickell explained .

The members of the Formula One Teams ’
Association are discussing a lot of new ideas at the moment and one of the more interesting is the idea of a joint presentation of the 2010 cars .
Annual launches are an expensive business for everybody as the media has to attend many of them and the teams have to pay for the event and it makes a great deal more sense for all concerned to have one massive event which would cover all the teams .
This is not a bad idea .
The only downside is that the coverage would be less for each team as the main focus would obviously be on the championship contenders .
NASCAR has a similar idea with a four - day tour of the teams in the Charlotte area with interviews with all the big players and the drivers .
Formula 1 teams are rather more spread out but a unified event makes a lot of sense .

I ’m a fond member of the blogging / social networking site , Livejournal .
Over the last few days , I ’ve seen the most incredible shitstorm unfold , over the cack - handed efforts of two rogue academics to research what they were pleased to call ‘ the cognitive neuroscience of fanfiction ’ .
Background
First , a bit of background : Livejournal ( one of the original social networks ) is a vast and varied set of subcultures , and interconnected blogs , dominated by film , TV , book and gaming fans .
It is more counterculture than culture , really : it tends to be left - wing , creative and anarchic .
One of the many subcultures in the mix is fanfiction writing : stories that people write using characters from books , film , music and TV .
Fanfic writing is female - dominated , and some of it ( but by no means all ) is very explicit .
There is fanfic for everything , from Jane Austen through Doctor Who ( rewriting the works of Russell T. Davies ) to The Mighty Boosh .
Fanfic writers have an odd hobby , but they are a pleasant and literate bunch who are much studied by academics .
In fact , academics ( like Henry Jenkins ) completely adore this stuff – it pulls feminism , transgression , social networking and copyright laws all into one place .
What ’s not to like .
The questionnaire is launched
Anyway , a few days ago a friend forwarded me a link to an online questionnaire that she found intriguing .
It was about fanfiction , it seemed a bit amateur , and what did I think of it ?
The link was banner - style , and it looked a lot like the Cosmo - style pop quizzes that are memed all over the place on social networks .
There was a reassuring link to a FAQ page giving the names of the researchers , Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam , and their academic affiliations at Boston University ( the BU links no longer exist ) .
This page also gave a long explanation of their interests in cognitive neuroscience , and what this had to do with fanfiction …
“ We ’re deeply interested in broad - based behavioral data that involves romantic or erotic cognition and evinces a clear distinction between men and women .
Fan fiction matches this criteria perfectly . ”
… Uhuh .
The researchers had apparently also consulted a couple of well - known bloggers in the areas , and got their guidance and feedback and endorsement .
Apart from the fact that the academics were n’t making the changes suggested , it all seemed fine .
The online questionnaire itself ( captured here in two parts on an LJ Dr Who site – you may see an generic age warning for content on some LJ pages ) was a rather different story .
I took a look .
There were 70 questions in all ( one per page ) , starting with some brusque questions about one ’s gender , age and ethnicity .
It even asked for your SAT scores .
The questionnaire proceeded to a number of fantastically detailed and rather odd questions dealing with fanfiction reading habits ; and then it got heavily intimate , asking ( amongst other things ) , exactly what kinds of sexy stories the respondent read and ( deep intake of breath ) whether they ever had rape fantasies .
The questionnaire … does not go down well .
The questionnaire was barely up before LJers started complaining about the content .
LJ people love to complain at the best of times , and there was a lot of ground to cover here :
a) Terrible questionnaire design
b ) Inaccurate , amateurish and homophobic wording
c ) Prurient lines of questioning
d ) No attempt to screen out under - 18s
e ) Lack of the usual information on privacy , anonymity and confidentiality
f ) And ( my favourite ) frequent criticisms of the methodology .
How in the name of heaven the researchers were going to draw any valid conclusions whatsoever about subcortical processing , given their data collection methods ?
What the researchers had n’t bargained for was the thoughtfulness of the response .
Livejournal people are a fairly literate bunch .
Stuff like feminist analysis of television casting decisions is a walk in the park for many of them .
At least some of the people who came across the questionnaire were social researchers , lecturers , feminist academics , and indeed neuroscientists .
They did n’t like what they saw .
Ogi attempts to engage with respondents
The lead researcher opened a journal ( now showing a single entry , an apology ) for the purposes of answering questions about the research ; and in the space of about two days , that journal moved from polite , rather subservient requests for clarification , to a full - on flamewar , as the lead researcher put up his questions for comment .
As he engaged , he revealed more and more of his ( very strange ) thinking ( he ’s deleted his comments on this thread , but you can work some of them out ) , and his subjects began to research him in earnest .
Google is your friend ( and Wikipedia , and Youtube )
Turns out , Ogi Ogas had forgotten to mention a few things :
He was n’t actually affiliated with Boston University any more
While they were indeed neuroscientists , their Ph. Ds were on visual processing and artificial intelligence
The lead researcher ’s Ph.D was funded by the US Department of Homeland Security
The lead author gained earlier infamy as a successful contestant on the American version of ‘ Who Wants To Be a Millionaire ’
And , last but not least , there was another teeny fact missing :
The authors had just signed a substantial book deal with Penguin for a popular science book entitled : ‘ Rule 34 : What Netporn teaches us about the brain . ’
( As one commenter put it : ‘ What ?
You think we ca n’t Google ? ’)
( NB – the literary agency has changed the book title now , to ‘ Rule 34 ’ )
So they asked about these Netporn theories , and then the shit really hit the fan .
It ’s hard to follow the logic , but his theory ( screencapped here ) drew on data - mining of adult sites aimed at men , and posited that explicit fanfiction for women could be equated with male interest in male - to - female transsexuals (?! ) and that both of these things could be used to model subcortical processing ( whatever that is ) in male and female brains .
Or something .
Somewhere around there , people stopped arguing with him and started taking direct action .
The academics started complaining to Boston University , the creatives started creating cat macros , the neuroscientists started writing long introductions to neuroscience and the specialists in gender identity just started screaming .
There were a few more updates , and then Ogi locked his journal .
He issued a few wandering emails , and removed most of his journal ( and indeed many of the comments that he ’d left elsewhere ) .
Naturally , the LJers ( being used to the ways of flamewars ) took screenshots of the more alarming content well in advance .
Aftermath
From beginning to end , Ogi Ogas maintained that he was n’t doing social research , he was just collecting data .
The day after the shitstorm , someone reported their conversation with the University of Boston ’s rearch ethics board : he was n’t formally affiliated , and he did n’t have ethics board clearance .
His university pages have now disappeared , the questionnaire is down , and at time of writing , he seems to be deleting all his comments elsewhere .
On the face of it , this is simply an extreme example of shoddy and unethical research which will reflect badly on anyone who tries to do research online , especially within a community or subculture .
Anyone who approaches that particular community in the future is going to encounter deep suspicion .
It goes further , though .
One of the very odd features of the whole story is that Ogi Ogas and his colleague took a lot of care to approach prominent people .
He got a great deal of help from some of them ( he also got a magnificent brush - off from one , but that ’s another story * ) .
All of those people are writing to explain that he seemed genuine , and they trusted him .
They offered the same critique of the questions that anyone would .
He seemed to listen , but went ahead with his own version .
This is either arrogance or sociopathy .
One of the people he approached has written to apologise for being taken in , and to reprint some of their correspondence .
She warns him that his attempts to research this particular community are probably dead in the water .
In his reply to her , he ’s chirpy .
‘ Eventually we ’re going to go through this all over again with the far right .
It will be interesting to see who throws the meaner punch . ’
And I ’m left thinking : is this the ultimate troll ?
The book is due out in 2010 .
* My favourite part of these people ’s very lengthy smackdown is the grand postmodern refusal :
‘ And so we decline to be interviewed by you ; we decline to be the objects of your fascination ; we decline to be naturalized ; we decline to allow our political project to be cited in support of the very discourses we are trying to question . ’
ETA : When respondents bite back
I actually hesitated in writing this up , because I was worried that mainstream researchers will see this as a distant kerfuffle in an unlikely subculture .
But I agree strongly with the writer at the Rough Theory blog ( see below ) , who suggests that Ogas may fail to take valid community criticisms seriously , because he has so thoroughly Othered them as respondents .
In other words , ‘ they ’re so weird , we do n’t have to be careful with them . ’
The second general learning point for anyone thinking of attempting a controversial online questionnaire , is how quickly things go viral .
Ogas was terribly happy about the response rate ( reliability and validity were not a concern ) ; that same speed of process led , very rapidly , to critique , opprobrium , and direct action .
Before you engage ?
Do us all a favour and go on that Methodology course .

Everyone has the right to go to college and get a good education .
It 's the key to success in the job market .
Not so fast .
If there 's one thing job - hunting in this economy has taught me , it 's that an undergraduate education is vastly overrated as far as success goes .
Notwithstanding the specious right to go to college for free of which today 's youth and leftist politicians often speak , college does not guarantee success in finding or keeping a job in this economy .
It certainly did not help me and millions of other workers avoid layoffs last year .
It means little to those who scan a ream of applications -- all with degrees listed -- and it certainly means nothing unique to harried recruiters at a crowded job fair .
Mind you , it is n't useless per se , but a cursory examination of just some of the great geniuses of history -- Aristotle , Thomas Aquinas , Leonardo da Vinci , the Aztec engineers who built the great city of Tenochtitlán in the middle of soggy lake Texcoco , the Wright brothers , the men who built the Pyramids -- all these people did not go to college as we know it .
Certainly they studied hard and learnt their respective trades over years of time , but no overpriced , ivy covered campuses did they grace .
And of course we hear all the time about successful entrepreneurs who dropped out of college : Bill Gates , Steve Jobs , Mark Zuckerberg ( Facebook ) , Russell Simmons ( Def Jam Records ) , Jawed Karim ( YouTube ) , Ralph Lauren , even the late Michael Jackson .
Yet we still hear the refrain :
Everyone has the right to go to college and get a good education .
It 's the key to success in the job market .
I concede that most of us are n't brilliant entrepreneurs , nor do most of us have a rich daddy who owns a local factory , and the system has seemingly been set up so that most of us must enter into the cut - throat , white - collar world in order to have a hope at being awarded a job with a living wage .
That means earning the hallowed sheepskin .
But does one really learn all the skills and knowledge needed to fully enter into an everyday professional setting ?
The particular management , organizational and computer skills I use in my line of work were not bestowed upon me by a professor in a classroom .
I certainly learned some interesting and enlightening things in the lecture halls , there 's no denying that .
But with the possible exception of my foreign language skills ( though alimented by my own efforts anyway ) , most of the job skills I possess I either learned on the job or in my extracurricular activities .
In order to do that , I had to go outside the classroom , outside the syllabi and recitations and seek out spaces where I could use and learn more .
Reading , reading some more , listening to a lecture , reading yet some more , writing a paper , and taking any number of guessing game multiple choice exams in order to regurgitate reams of information that you cram into your head exhibit your broad knowledge .
Just study what is covered on the exam , and nothing more , and of course one often hears my favorite question :
Are the final grades going to be curved ?
Then it 's more reading .
Little practical application or real - life settings can be found here .
Surely there are exceptions , but this is the general pattern of what passes for education at American universities these days .
For what it 's worth , one might be better off visiting a library and reading all the books in it or going to a museum or getting a private tutor if one really wants to pursue knowledge .
Or at least pursue a vocational degree , where one will learn , really learn , a useful trade and skill .
Instead , we have a generation of people with bachelors and masters degrees who work one or two jobs at McDonalds or Starbucks or toil at the behest of any number of faceless temp agencies just to pay the interest on their student loan debt -- debt with more zeros than any annual salary they can ever hope to see .
So we 've seen that college does n't necessarily prepare one for the real world , and we see that plenty of people who have smarts , drive and ambition have become successful without the hallowed sheepskin , so let 's ask :
What is it really good for , this thing to which we supposedly have a right ?
What an undergraduate degree symbolizes nowadays is neither smarts nor expertise nor discipline nor rigorous intellect nor even adequate job , social , or financial planning skills , since these are not the aims of a modern - day university education .
Rather , it is a way to weed out the cultured workers from the low - brow ; the affluent from the less - affluent ; the pacified from the rough - around - the - edges ; the best and brightest from the dumb sheep ; the ones who " get their hands dirty " with practical skills from those fully indoctrinated in squeaky - clean trivia ( which is what most white - collar work is , anyway ) ; the upper and middle classes from the lower classes .
In short , its function is to help lock out the undesirable proles from the Inner Circle ( be it higher education , government employ , or involvement with the cut - throat , white - collar world ) .
As far as job hunting goes , the hallowed liberal arts university degree is quite useful indeed for approaching the doors to prestige , if not power -- no , not opening them , just increasing the chances of being approved by the genteel gatekeepers and gaining an audience with the Emperor without having the guard dogs set upon you .
And before you say that it used to mean something a long time ago , save for watered - down curricula , keep in mind that in the past only the richest of the rich could go to university , and its role as a gateway to genteel nobility was even more bare - obvious than it is now .
I think this will become more obvious as the world economy continues to deflate and people have to seek ever higher degrees and more debt just to get a secretarial job or ( heaven forbid ) mop floors in a Dunkin Donuts .
In our 21st century society populated by neutered - bourgeois , an undergraduate degree is good for one thing only - - a status symbol for the affluent , upwardly mobile middle - class worker ; an alluring icon of a bourgeois cult .
Indeed , every family in this country has been duped into thinking that this is the only way one can become successful .
We are bombarded with statistics showing that college graduates make more than non-graduates .
After all , high school or college dropouts often end up flipping burgers and making lattes , right ?
Otherwise Uncle Sam lures them into the military to kill poor foreigners for the benefit of the ruling class , although with the wars in the Middle East going so badly , that might be a less appealing career path these days .
I do expect teachers or grad students or other educated professionals will sneer at my skepticism of the education system , and of the Holy Degree and its trappings ; they will scold me , saying that I am foolish for denying the path to salvation via undergraduate education .
Of course , they all have advanced degrees , have clawed their way to the top , have become the new gatekeepers , and ( most critically ) are n't on the unemployment lines , so they can afford to say such things .
Everyone has the right to go to college and get a good education .
It 's the key to success in the job market .
I would strongly recommend to anyone reading this who is of college - age to consider a vocational school or apprenticeship , where one can learn a useful trade that will guarantee a better salary .
The way things are headed , the existing artificial white - collar service economy will begin to wither away , and less employment will be available to those with that hallowed liberal arts degree as we are forced to return to actual industry , production , trade , and thrift .
Oh sure , there are still plenty of opportunities for that fancy - pants work we middle class denizens are taught to strive for .
But do not expect a renaissance of financial prosperity in the future ( i.e. , get used to the term jobless recovery ) , nor should you expect a promise of a fully remunerative career ( this graph from the Economic Policy Institute shows employers are forced to work people harder in the name of increasing productivity whilst wages stagnate due to inflation ) .
In other words , take the modern - day , bourgeois college degree - worshipping evangelist cult with a few grains of organic sea salt .
Blue Peter presenter Andy Akinwolere inside the Tardis CBBC show Blue Peter has launched a competition to design a new Tardis console that will appear in the next series of Doctor Who .
Children aged between six and 12 are invited to create the new control panel which operates the time machine .
For the purposes of the plot , designs for the hexagonal console must incorporate household objects .
The winning design , to be chosen by new Doctor Matt Smith , will appear in one episode of the sci - fi show next year .
Entries will be judged in three different age categories , with the winner of each age group getting to visit the Doctor Who set and meet the cast and crew , including the Doctor .
' Originality and creativity ' Doctor Who production designer Edward Thomas , who is also on the judging panel , advised entrants : " Do n't come along with a design that 's finished and too technical - it needs to have a lot of character .
" It 's about being clever with what you find around the house and make sure it really feels as if the Doctor has put it together . "
The winner will get to meet new Doctor Matt Smith Entries must be sent in by 2 November and more details can be found on the Blue Peter website .
Blue Peter editor Tim Levell said : " This is the latest in a long line of collaborations between Blue Peter and Doctor Who .
" We know our viewers absolutely love Doctor Who and we hope to be blown away by the originality and creativity of their concepts .
" Doctor Who prides itself on surprising its viewers at every turn and who better than a child to come up with the latest design of the Tardis console , " he added .
Four years ago , Blue Peter ran a competition to design a monster to feature in the sci - fi show .
The winning entry - the Abzorbaloff - created by nine - year - old William Grantham from Colchester , was played on - screen by comedian Peter Kay .

The year ’s biggest bike trade show , Eurobike officially starts on Wednesday .

After a quick presentation of facts and figures about the European bike industry ( precis : it ’s doing amazingly well while the rest of Europe ’s economy still struggles ) we were able to get a quick look at a few highlights from Cannondale , Sugoi and Dahon ’s 2010 ranges .
Much more to come over the next few days .
Cannondale reveals Quick , son of Stealth & three - speed Baddie
Based on last year ’s Stealth concept bike , this is Cannondale ’s Quick Ultimate “ sporty trail bike ” .
With a carbon frame and a suite of high - end components it weighs just 8.15 kg and will retail for € 2,499 .
We ’re already hearing a lot at Eurobike about a European trend for people to spend more on bikes , despite the recession , and Cannondale obviously thinks there ’s a market for this machine , which features a very tidily integrated fork and custom seat tube .

Cannondale ’s Bad Boy 3
Cannondale ’s core urban bike line , the Bad Boy bikes , will be even more black for 2010 , according to Peter Kinzel , Cannondale ’s urban project manager .
We ’re amazed he resisted the ‘ none more black ’ Spinal Tap reference so there it is for him .
However , the Bad Boy 3 has gunmetal grey stem and bar , though everything else including the rims and even the disc rotors is black .
In a departure from previous Bad Boys , it also has a three - speed hub .
“ It ’s the future , ” says Kinzel , pointing out that lots of city bikes have three - speeds , which gets you the look of a fixie with a bit of extra practicality .

Sugoi takes to the street
John Stevenson
Another strong trend for 2010 is ‘ ordinary clothes you can ride in ’.
Sugoi , known for serious cycling kit and especially for gear that can keep you going through a Canadian winter , is launching a range of urban gear at Eurobike , including this Mobil Carbon jacket , which is available in both men ’s and women ’s version .
Modelled here by Sugoi ’s European PR Coordinator Katrin Engel , the Mobil Carbon is breathable and water resistant , and has cleverly concealed reflective pieces .
It ’s part of a line Sugoi calls H.O.V. for ‘ Human Operated Vehicle ’ .

Dahon gets bigger , folds helmet
John Stevenson
Dahon caught our eye with their new Ios XL 24in - wheeled folder and Pango folding helmet
The Ios XL is “ a full - size bike [ with ] a compact , convenient fold , ” according to Dahon , and its bigger wheels certainly set it apart from the usual tiny - wheeled folders .
The IOS XL has an easily adjustable tool - less stem for altering the position of the bars .
Matthew Cole/BikeRadar.com
The Freedrive chain system is essentially a chain cover to keep oil , dirt and chain grime from the wearers ’ trousers while riding or lifting the bike .
Matthew Cole/BikeRadar.com
Dahon ’s folding bikes have a pump concealed as part of the seatpost
A Shimano Alfine hub , Dahon ’s trademark pump - in - the - seatpost and integrated front and rear lights make this a well thought out commuting machine .
What also sets it apart is its BioLogic Freecharge dynamo and battery system .
This consists of a lithium polymer battery that ’s charged from the hub dynamo as you ride and that can in turn charge a phone , iPod , GPS , etc , via its in - built USB port .

US Marshals Service involvement
Threat Source Profile
The Subcommittee is also concerned that , as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided , they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose .
If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver , they never recorded their assessments .
Thus , rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a living document , the Marshals added new reports to an ever - expanding file , and their overall assessment never really changed .
These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first - hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him .

was the site of a violent confrontation and siege in northern Idaho in 1992 .
It involved Randy Weaver , his family , Weaver 's friend Kevin Harris , and agents of the United States Marshals Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation .
It resulted in the death of Weaver 's son Sammy , his wife Vicki , and Deputy US Marshal William Francis Degan .
At the subsequent federal criminal trial of Weaver and Harris , Weaver 's attorney Gerry Spence made accusations of " criminal wrongdoing " against every agency involved in the incident : the FBI , USMS , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , and the United States Attorney ( USAO ) for Idaho .
At the completion of the trial , the Department of Justice 's Office of Professional Responsibility formed a Ruby Ridge Task Force to investigate Spence 's charges .
The 1994 Task Force report was released in redacted form by Lexis Counsel Connect and raised questions with the conduct and policy of all the agencies .
Public outcry over Ruby Ridge and the subsequent Waco siege involving many of the same agencies and even the same personnel fueled the widening of the militia movement .
To answer public questions about Ruby Ridge , the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism , Technology and Government Information held a total of 14 days of hearings between September 6 and October 19 , 1995 and subsequently issued a report calling for reforms in federal law enforcement to prevent a repeat of Ruby Ridge and to restore public confidence in federal law enforcement .
Randy Weaver , a former Iowa factory worker and U.S. Army combat engineer often described as a Green Beret , moved his family to northern Idaho during the 1980s in order to " home - school his children and escape what he and his wife Vicki saw as a corrupted world . "
Vicki , the religious leader of the family , believed that the apocalypse was imminent and believed her family would survive the apocalypse in a remote mountainous area .
They bought twenty acres of land on Ruby Ridge in 1983 and began building a cabin .
The Weaver property was located in northern Idaho in Boundary County , on a hillside on Ruby Creek opposite Caribou Ridge near Naples In 1984 , Randy Weaver and neighbor Terry Kinnison had a dispute over a $ 3,000 land deal .
Kinnison subsequently lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay Weaver an additional $ 2,100 in court costs and damages .
Kinnison wrote letters to the FBI , and county sheriff alleging Weaver had threatened to kill the Pope , the President , and John V. Evans , governor of Idaho .
In January 1985 , the FBI and the Secret Service started an investigation .
In February , Randy and Vicki Weaver met with two FBI agents , two Secret Service agents , and the Boundary County sheriff and his chief investigator and were interviewed for hours .
While the Secret Service was told that Weaver was a member of the Aryan Nations and that he had a large weapons cache at his residence , Weaver denied the allegations and no charges were filed .
The investigation noted Weaver associated with Frank Kumnick , who was known to associate with members of the Aryan Nations .
Weaver told the investigators that neither he nor Kumnick were members of Aryan Nations , and described Kumnick as " associated with the Covenant , Sword and Arm of the Lord . "
On February 28 , 1985 Randy and Vicki Weaver filed an affidavit with the county courthouse alleging that their personal enemies were plotting to provoke the FBI into attacking and killing the Weaver family .
On May 6 , 1985 Randy and Vicki Weaver sent a letter to President Ronald Reagan claiming that Weaver 's enemies may have sent the President a threatening letter under a forged signature .
No evidence of a threatening letter has surfaced ; however , the 1985 letter was cited by the prosecutor in 1992 as Overt Act 7 of the Weaver family conspiracy against the federal government .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms first became aware of Weaver in July 1986 when he was introduced to an ATF informant at a meeting of the Aryan Nations .
Weaver had been invited by Frank Kumnick , who was the original target of the ATF investigation .
It was Weaver 's first attendance .
Over the next three years , Weaver and the informant met several times .
In October 1989 , the ATF claimed that Weaver sold the informant two sawed - off shotgun s , with the overall length of the guns shorter than the legal limit set by federal law .
By this time , Weaver had had a falling - out with both Kumnick and the Aryan Nations .
In November 1989 Weaver accused the ATF informant of being a spy for the police ; Weaver later wrote he had been warned by " Rico V . "
The informant 's handler , Herb Byerly , ordered him to have no further contact with Weaver .
Eventually , FBI informant Rico Valentino outed the ATF informant to Aryan Nations security .
ATF agent Byerly had come to regard Kumnick as just a " boastful show - off " and Weaver as even less involved .
In June 1990 , Byerly attempted to use the sawed - off shotgun charge as leverage to get Weaver to act as an informant for his investigation into the Aryan Nations .
When Weaver refused to become ( in his words ) " a snitch , " the ATF filed the gun charges in June 1990 , also claiming Weaver was a bank robber with criminal convictions ( those claims were false : at that time Weaver had no criminal record and the subsequent Senate investigation found : " Weaver was not a suspect in any bank robberies . " )
Weaver denied the sawed - off weapons charge , claiming that the informant had purchased two legal shotguns from him and later shortened the guns .
A federal grand jury later indicted him in December 1990 for making and possessing , but not for selling , illegal weapons in October 1989 .
ATF agents posed as broken - down motorists and arrested Randy and Vicki Weaver when they stopped to assist .
Randy Weaver was told of the charges against him , released on bail , and told that his trial would begin on February 19 , 1991 .
On January 22 , 1991 , the judge in the case notified attorney Everett Hofmeister that he would be serving as Weaver ’s attorney ; Hofmeister made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Weaver .
On that same day , Weaver called U.S. Probation Officer Karl Richins and informed him that Weaver was instructed to contact him on that date .
Richins did not have the case file at that time , so he asked Weaver to leave his contact information and Richins would contact him when he received the paperwork .
According to Richins , Weaver did not give him a telephone number .
Defense counsel Hofmeister sent letters to Weaver on January 19 , January 31 and February 5 asking Weaver to contact him to work on his defense .
On February 5 , the trial date was changed from February 19 to February 20 to give participants more travel time following a federal holiday .
The court clerk sent a letter to the parties informing them of the date change ; however , the notice was not sent directly to Weaver , only to his attorney .
On February 7 , U.S. Probation Officer Richins sent Weaver a letter indicating that he now had the case file and needed to talk with Weaver .
This letter erroneously indicated that Weaver 's trial date was set for March 20 .
On February 8 , Hofmeister again attempted to contact Weaver by letter informing him that the trial was to begin on February 20 and Weaver needed to contact him immediately .
Hofmeister also made several calls to individuals who knew Weaver asking them to have Weaver call him .
Hofmeister did not hear from Weaver before the scheduled court date .
When Weaver did not show up in court on February 20 , the judge issued a bench warrant for failure to appear in court .
On February 26 , Ken Keller , a reporter for the Kootenai Valley Times , telephoned the U.S. Probation Office and asked if the reason that Weaver did not show in court on February 20 was because the letter sent to him by Richins had the incorrect date .
Upon finding a copy of the letter , the Chief Probation Officer , Terrence Hummel , contacted the judge ’s clerk and informed them of the incorrect date in the letter .
Hummel also contacted the U.S. Marshals Service and Weaver ’s attorney informing them of the error .
The judge , however , refused to withdraw the bench warrant .
The U.S. Marshals Service did agree to put off executing the warrant until after March 20 to see if Weaver would show up in court on that day .
If he were to show up on March 20 , all indications are that the warrant would be dropped .
Instead of waiting to see if Weaver would show up on March 20 , however , the U.S. Attorney ’s Office ( USAO ) called a grand jury on March 14 .
The USAO did not present Richins ’ erroneous letter as evidence to the grand jury and the grand jury issued an indictment for failure to appear .
When the Weaver case was passed from ATF to the Marshal Service , no one informed the marshals of the fact that ATF had attempted to solicit Weaver as an informant .
As the law enforcement arm of the federal court , it was the duty of the US Marshals to bring in fugitive Randy Weaver .
Unlike most federal fugitives , who flee across state lines to avoid arrest , Randy Weaver simply stayed at his remote home , threatening to resist any attempt to take him by force .
Weaver was known to have an intense distrust of government and it is believed that the erroneous Richins letter intensified his distrust and may have contributed to his reluctance to appear for trial .
Weaver was clearly suspicious of what he viewed as inconsistent messages from the government and his own lawyer and this inconsistency further enforced his belief that there was a conspiracy against him .
The mixed signals the Weavers received from the various government agencies convinced them that Weaver would not receive a fair trial if he were to appear in court .
Weaver , distrustful of the federal government , refused to leave his cabin .
U.S. Marshals Service officers made a series of attempts to have Weaver surrender peacefully .
Weaver negotiated with US Marshals Ron Evans , W. Warren Mays and David Hunt through third parties from March 5 to October 12 , 1991 , when prosecutor Ron Evans directed that the negotiations cease .
The US Attorney directed that all negotiations would go through Weaver 's court - appointed counsel ; however , Weaver did not have any contact with the attorney and refused to talk with him .
Marshals then began preparing plans to capture Weaver to stand trial on the weapons charges and his failure to appear at the correct trial date .
Although Marshals stopped the negotiations as ordered , they made other contact .
March 4 , 1992 , US Marshals Ron Evans and Jack Cluff drove to the Weaver property and spoke with Weaver posing as real estate prospects .
At a March 27 , 1992 USMS HQ meeting , Art Roderick code named the operation " Northern Exposure " .
Surveillance teams were dispatched and cameras were set up to record activity at Weaver 's residence .
Marshals observed that Weaver and his family responded to vehicles and other visitors by taking up armed positions around the cabin until the visitors were recognized .
Beginning in February 1991 , US Marshals had maintained a Threat Source Profile on Randy Weaver that was later criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee :
Many of the people used by the Marshals as third party go - betweens on the Weaver case — Bill and Judy Grider , Alan Jeppeson , Richard Butler — were evaluated by the Marshals as more radical than the Weavers themselves .
When Deputy US Marshal ( DUSM ) Dave Hunt asked Bill Grider about Randy Weaver : " Why should n't I just go up there ... and talk to him ? "
Bill Grider replied , " Let me put it to you this way .
If I was sitting on my property and somebody with a gun comes to do me harm , then I 'll probably shoot him . "
When this was reported later by the government , Grider 's words were attributed to Weaver as a threat .
The Profile included " a brief psychological profile completed by a person who had conducted no first - hand interviews and was sufficiently unfamiliar with the case that he referred to Weaver as " Mr. Randall " throughout . "
A later memo circulated within the DOJ opined that : " The assumptions of federal and some state and local law enforcement personnel about Weaver - - that he was a Green Beret , that he would shoot on sight anyone who attempted to arrest him , that he had collected certain types of arms , that he had " booby - trapped " and tunneled his property — exaggerated the threat he posed .
" Following an April 18 , 1992 fly - over by a helicopter for the Geraldo Rivera " Now It Can Be Told " TV show , US Marshal Service HQ received media reports that Weaver had fired on the helicopter .
That day in Idaho , a US Marshals team was installing surveillance cameras overlooking the Weaver property at the time of the fly - over .
The field report for Apr 18 , 1992 filed by Marshal W. Warren Mays reported seeing a helicopter near the Weaver property , but not hearing any shots fired .
Weaver then granted an interview with a newspaper reporter in which he , family and friends present that day denied firing on the helicopter .
The helicopter pilot Richard Weiss eventually gave FBI FD - 302 interviews denying that Weaver fired on his helicopter .
The media reports that Weaver had fired on the Rivera helicopter became part of the justification later cited by USMS Wayne " Duke " Smith and FBI HRT Commander Richard Rogers in drawing up the Ruby Ridge Rules of Engagement on August 21 – 22 , 1992 .
Also , in spite of Richard Weiss ' repeated denials that shots had been fired at his helicopter , US Attorney Ron Howen would charge that , as Overt Act 32 of the Weaver 's Conspiracy Against the Federal Government , Randy , Vicki and Harris fired two shots at the Rivera helicopter .
Operation " Northern Exposure " was suspended for three months due to the confirmation hearings for USMS Director Henry E. Hudson .
The Weavers noticed the lack of USMS activity and began to believe the USMS had dropped the case .
On August 21 , 1992 , six marshals were sent to scout the area to determine suitable places away from the cabin to ambush and arrest Weaver .
The marshals , dressed in camouflage , were equipped with night - vision goggles and M16 rifle s. DUSMs Art Roderick , Larry Cooper and Bill Degan formed the recon team , while DUSMs David Hunt , Joseph Thomas and Frank Norris formed an observation post ( OP ) team on the ridge north of the cabin .
At one point , Roderick threw two rocks at the Weaver cabin to test the reaction of the dogs .
The dogs became alerted , and Weaver 's friend Kevin Harris , and Weaver 's 14 year old son , Samuel , emerged and followed the dog Striker to investigate .
Harris and the younger Weaver were hoping that the dog had noticed a game animal since the cabin was out of meat .
Sammy
Weaver told his father he believed the dogs had sensed either a large animal or a man in the woods .
The recon team marshals ( Roderick , Cooper and Degan ) initially retreated through the woods in radio contact with the OP team , but later took up hidden defensive positions .
Later the OP team marshals and the Weavers both claimed that the Weaver dogs alerted to the recon team marshals in the woods after neighbors at the foot of the mountain started their pickup truck .
The recon team marshals retreated through the woods to the " Y " juncture in the trails 500 yards west of the cabin , out of sight of the cabin .
Sammy and Harris followed the dog Striker on foot through the woods while Randy also on foot took a separate logging trail .
Vicki , Sara , Rachel , and baby Elisheba remained at the cabin , at first appearing anxious to the OP team , but later appearing relaxed .
Randy encountered the marshals at the " Y " ; Roderick recalled yelling , " Back off ! U.S. Marshal ! " and Cooper recalled yelling , " Stop ! U.S. Marshal ! "
Later statements by Roderick , Cooper and Randy agreed that Randy responded by cursing and running away .
About a minute later the dog and the boys came out of the woods and a firefight erupted between the marshals and Sammy and Harris .
Accounts differ at this point as to who first opened fire but agree that DUSM Roderick shot and killed Weaver 's dog and that Samuel Weaver fired at Roderick .
Samuel Weaver was shot in the back while retreating , and DUSM Degan was shot and killed by Harris .
The version of the firefight told by DUSMs Roderick and Cooper was that the dog , followed by Harris then Sammy , came out of the woods .
DUSM Degan challenged Harris , who turned and shot Degan dead without Degan firing a single shot .
Roderick then shot the dog once , Sammy fired at Roderick twice , and Roderick fired once again .
Roderick and Cooper heard multiple gunshots from the Weaver party .
Cooper fired two three - shot bursts at Harris and Cooper saw Harris fall " like a sack of potatoes " .
An impact caused leaves to fly up in front of Cooper who then sought cover .
Cooper saw Sammy run away .
Cooper radioed to OP team Dave Hunt that he had wounded or killed Harris .
Harris ' version was that , when the dog followed by Sammy then Harris came out of the woods , the dog ran up to Cooper and danced about as he did in playing with the children .
The dog then ran to Roderick , who shot the dog in front of Sammy , who cursed Roderick and shot at him .
Degan came out of the woods firing his M16 and hit Sammy in the arm .
Harris then fired and hit Degan in the chest knocking him down .
Cooper fired at Harris who ducked for cover .
Cooper fired again and Sammy was hit in the back and fell .
Harris fired about 6 feet in front of Cooper and forced him to take cover .
Cooper announced that he was a US Marshal .
Harris checked Sammy 's body , found him dead , and ran to the cabin .
The ballistics evidence presented at trial ( and cartridge counts on the Marshals ' guns performed by DUSM Mark Jurgeson ) showed : Art Roderick fired one shot from a .223 M16 , Sammy Weaver fired three shots from a .223 Mini-14 , Bill Degan fired seven shots from an M16 while moving at least 21 feet , Larry Cooper fired six shots from a 9 mm
Colt submachinegun , and Kevin Harris fired two shots from a .30-06 M1917 Enfield , for a total of nineteen rounds .
In testimony about the firefight at the 1993 trial , Larry Cooper admitted " You have all these things compressed into a few seconds ....
It 's difficult to remember what went on first . "
The ballistics experts called by the prosecution testified on cross examination by defense that the physical evidence did not contradict either the prosecution or defense theories on the firefight ( trial testimony , Martin Fackler on June 8 , 1993 and Lucien " Luke " Haag on June 10 , 1993 ) .
Fackler testified that Roderick shot and killed the dog , Degan shot Sammy through the right elbow , Harris shot and killed Degan , and Cooper " probably " shot and killed Sammy .
The 1993 trial jury accepted the defense theory of the firefight and acquitted Harris on grounds of self - defense .
In 1997 Boundary County Sheriff Greg Sprungl conducted an independent search of the " Y " and Lucien Haag confirmed that a bullet found in that search matched Cooper 's gun and contained fibers that matched Sammy Weaver 's shirt . )
After the firefight at the " Y " , marshals Hunt and Thomas went from the hillside to a neighbor 's house in order to request assistance from the USMS Crisis Center while marshals Norris , Cooper and Roderick stayed with Degan 's body at the " Y " .
Randy and Vicki went to the " Y " and retrieved Sammy 's body .
Randy , Vicki and Harris placed Samuel 's body in a guest cabin near the main cabin .
Weaver , Vicki , their three daughters and Harris holed up in their house .
From 11:15 a.m. onward , Hunt reported to the Crisis Center in Washington D.C. that no further gunfire had been heard .
The USMS alerted the FBI that a marshal had been killed , and the FBI sent the Hostage Rescue Team ( HRT ) from Quantico to Idaho .
Special Agent in Charge ( SAC ) Eugene Glenn of the Salt Lake City FBI office was appointed Site Commander and Idaho State Police , ATF , Marshals Service , FBI , US Border Patrol and county sheriff 's office were mobilized .
Also on August 21 , 1992 , Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus declared a state of emergency in Boundary County which allowed the FBI to use the Idaho National Guard Armory at Bonners Ferry and , after an initial delay , to use National Guard armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) .
A stand - off ensued for 12 days as several hundred federal agents surrounded the house and negotiations for a surrender were attempted .
On August 22 , the second day of the siege , the FBI HRT sniper / observer teams were deployed to the cabin while an armored personnel carrier carrying negotiators approached to make a surrender callout at the cabin .
Before the deployment , HRT Commander Richard Rogers briefed the sniper / observer teams on special rules of engagement approved for use on Ruby Ridge .
These military - style rules contradicted standard FBI deadly force policy .
Some snipers later described them as a " green light " to " shoot on sight .
" The Ruby Ridge Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) had been drawn up on the basis of reports from USMS and FBI headquarters , bolstered by unconfirmed news media accounts accepted by HQ , that exaggerated the threat posed by the Weavers .
Standard deadly force policy of the FBI was : " Agents are not to use deadly force against any person except as necessary in self - defense or the defense of another , when they have reason to believe they or another are in danger of death or grievous bodily harm .
Whenever feasible , verbal warning should be given before deadly force is applied . "
Under the Ruby Ridge ROE 3 and 4 , the Weaver dogs , the Weaver children and third parties were subject to the standard deadly force policy and could only be shot in self - defense if they presented a danger of death or grievous bodily harm .
However , under the Ruby Ridge ROE 1 and 2 , deadly force against the Weaver adults should be used without the justification of defense and without any verbal warning .
The Denver FBI SWAT team assigned to Ruby Ridge thought the ROE were " crazy " and agreed among themselves to follow the FBI deadly force policy .
However , most of the FBI HRT sniper / observers accepted the ROE as modifying the deadly force policy .
Examples : HRT sniper Dale Monroe saw the ROE as a " green light " to shoot armed adult males on sight and HRT sniper Edward Wenger believed that if he observed armed adults , he could use deadly force , but he was to follow standard deadly force policy for all other individuals .
Fred Lanceley , the FBI Hostage Negotiator at Ruby Ridge , was " surprised and shocked " at the ROE , the most severe rules he had ever heard in his over 300 hostage situations and characterized the ROE as inconsistent with standard policy .
A later Senate report criticized the ROE as " virtual shoot - on - sight orders .
" Before the negotiators arrived at the cabin , an FBI HRT sniper , shot and wounded Randy Weaver in the back with the bullet exiting his right armpit , while he was lifting the latch on the shed to visit the body of his dead son .
( The sniper testified at the later trial that he had put his crosshairs on Weaver 's spine , but Weaver moved at the last second . )
Then , as Weaver , his 16 - year - old daughter Sara , and Harris ran back toward the house , Horiuchi fired a second bullet , which passed through Vicki Weaver 's head , killing her , and wounded Harris in the chest .
Vicki Weaver was standing behind the door through which Harris was entering the house , holding their 10 - month - old baby Elisheba in her arms .
The Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility Ruby Ridge Task Force Report ( June 10 , 1994 ) stated in section I. Executive Summary subhead B. Significant Findings that the second shot did not satisfy constitutional standards for legal use of deadly force .
The OPR review also found the lack of a request to surrender was " inexcusable " , since Harris and the two Weavers were running for cover without returning fire and were not an imminent threat .
The task force also specifically blamed Horiuchi for firing through the door , not knowing whether someone was on the other side of it .
While controversy exists as to who is responsible for approving the ROE that were being followed by the sniper , the task force also condemned the so - called " rules of engagement " allowing shots to be fired with no request for surrender .
Both FBI HQ and the Site Commanders in Idaho re-evaluated the situation based on information they were receiving from US Marshals Hunt , Cooper and Roderick about what had happened on August 21 .
On about August 24 , 1992 , the fourth day of the siege on the Weaver family , FBI Deputy Assistant Director Danny Coulson wrote a memo :
On August 26 , 1992 , 10:53 a.m. , the Rules of Engagement that had been in effect since the arrival of the HRT on August 22 were revoked .
The stand - off was ultimately resolved by sympathetic civilian negotiators including Bo Gritz , Jack McLamb and Jackie Brown .
Harris surrendered on August 30 and Randy Weaver and his daughters surrendered the next day .
Both Harris and Randy Weaver were arrested .
Weaver 's daughters were released to the custody of relatives , although some consideration was given to charging Sara , 16 , as an adult .
Weaver was ultimately acquitted of all charges except missing his original court date and violating his bail conditions , for which he was sentenced to 18 months and fined $ 10,000 .
Credited with time served , Weaver spent an additional 4 months in prison .
Harris was acquitted of all charges .
Defense counsel for Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris alleged throughout their 1993 trial that agents of the ATF , USMS , and FBI were themselves guilty of serious wrongdoing , leading the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to create a " Ruby Ridge Task Force " which delivered a 542 - page report on June 10 , 1994 to the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) .
The report was never officially released , although a redacted version was circulated by Lexis Counsel Connect , an information service for attorneys .
Questions persisted about Ruby Ridge and the subsequent Waco Siege which involved the same agencies and many of the same officials .
The Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism , Technology and Government Information held fourteen days of hearings , ending on October 19 , 1995 .
The hearings were broadcast on CSPAN and confirmed many of the questions raised by the DOJ OPR Report .
Both the internal 1994 Ruby Ridge Task Force Report and the public 1995 Senate subcommittee report on Ruby Ridge criticized the rules of engagement as unconstitutional .
A 1995 GAO report on use of force by federal law enforcement agencies stated : " In October 1995 , Treasury and Justice adopted use of deadly force policies to standardize the various policies their component agencies had adopted over the years . "
The major change was the requirement of a reasonable belief of an " imminent " danger of death or serious physical injury , which brought all federal LEA deadly force policies in line with US Supreme Court rulings ( , 471 U.S. 1 , 18 ( 1985 ) and , 490 U.S. 386 ( 1989 ) ) that applied to state and local LE agencies .
The surviving members of the Weaver family filed a wrongful death suit .
To avoid trial and a possibly higher settlement , the federal government awarded Randy Weaver a $ 100,000 settlement and his three daughters $ 1 million each in August 1995 .
In the out - of - court settlement the government did not admit to any wrong - doing in the deaths of Sammy and Vicki Weaver .
FBI director Louis Freeh disciplined or proposed discipline for twelve FBI employees over their handling of the incident and the later prosecution of Randy Weaver and Harris .
He described it before the U.S. Senate hearing investigating the incident as " synonymous with the exaggerated application of federal law enforcement " and stated " law enforcement overreacted at Ruby Ridge . " mini- series about the Ruby Ridge incident , entitled , aired on May 19 and May 21 , 1996 .
It was based on the bookby reporter Jess Walter and starred Laura Dern as Vicki , Kirsten Dunst as Sara and Randy Quaid as Randy .
The TV series was edited together in movie form asFBI HRT sniper Lon Horiuchi was indicted for manslaughter in 1997 by the Boundary County , Idaho prosecutor just prior to expiration of the statute of limitations for the crime of manslaughter , but the trial was removed to federal court and was quickly dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity .
Kevin Harris was also indicted for the first - degree murder of DUSM Bill Degan ; the charge was dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy because he had been acquitted in the federal criminal trial on the same charge in 1993 .
Randy and Sara Weaver wrote a 1998 paperback book , , about the incident ( the appendix of the book is a reprint of the 1995 Report on the U.S. Senate Ruby Ridge Hearing ) .
The attorney for Kevin Harris pressed Harris ' civil suit for damages , although federal officials vowed they would never pay someone who had killed a U.S. Marshal .
In September 2000 after persistent appeals , Harris was awarded a $ 380,000 settlement from the government .
Randy Weaver and the Siege at Ruby Ridge have been the focus of numerous documentaries .
In quantum mechanics particles can escape from their confines , even if a barrier stands in their way , via a process known as tunneling .
Tunneling is no mere quantum curiosity — tunneling electrons , for instance , are harnessed by scanning tunneling microscopes to observe on the smallest scales .
Those probes can image a surface at the atomic level by detecting the tunneling of electrons from the surface across a small gap to the microscope 's tiny scanning tip .
A paper in this week 's Science adds new depth to tunneling by showing how readily electrons can tunnel out from multiple orbitals in a molecule .
" Until just recently , everyone would have thought that only the most easily available electron could tunnel , " says study co-author Paul Corkum , a physicist at the University of Ottawa and director of Attosecond Science at the National Research Council Canada .
A series of research papers in the past few years has begun to revise that thinking , showing that lower - lying orbitals get into the act , as well .
In the new research , Corkum and his colleagues observed electrons tunneling out of hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) molecules subjected to laser pulses and traced the electrons back to their parent orbitals .
" You would think that the highest one , which has to go underneath the classically allowed barrier by only a little bit , would have a huge advantage , and the [ next ] lower one , which has to go under the barrier by a lot , would be highly suppressed , " Corkum says .
But the team found that the second - highest orbital contributed a measurable amount to the total tunneling current .
Late last year two groups published papers in Science showing how intense laser pulses could be used to liberate electrons not only from the highest molecular orbital but also from the next orbital below .
Markus Gühr , a Stanford University chemical physicist at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park , Calif. , co-authored one of those papers with a view toward examining molecular processes in real - time .
" The general vision that we have in the community is we want to look at chemistry , " says Gühr , who did not participate in the new research .
Probing the way electrons form and break bonds between atoms is critical to tracing the workings of chemistry at the ground level .
" The sensitivity on electrons is really a new crucial step , I would say , " Gühr adds .
In the 2008 work Gühr 's group examined electrons tunneling in nitrogen .
" The nitrogen molecule has the advantage that these two orbitals ... are pretty close together , " Gühr says .
In the hydrogen chloride molecule probed by Corkum 's group , he adds , the orbitals are much farther apart , making the tunneling contribution from the lower - lying one all the more notable .
The hydrogen chloride molecule made a handy test bed for such a tunneling experiment .
When the electron is stripped from hydrogen chloride 's highest orbital , an ion ( a charged version of the molecule ) survives .
But the electron in the next orbital down accounts for the bond between the molecule 's atoms , so when an electron tunnels from that orbital , the HCl molecule breaks apart .
Such a fragmentation is one signature of the lower - level tunneling .
Aside from demonstrating lower - orbital tunneling in a molecule that is less amenable to it , Corkum 's group was also able to show just how often it takes place .
" I would say in the evidence that we presented [ last year ] , and also that other groups presented , it is clear that [ the lower - level orbital ] definitely has a contribution in tunnel ionization , " Gühr says .
" But it is not clear quantitatively to which exact extent . "
Corkum 's group , Gühr adds , has taken the next step of directly quantifying the contribution of the lower orbital — in this experiment , the lower - lying orbital contributed 0.2 percent of the total tunneling current .
Corkum notes that it is exponentially more difficult , but not theoretically prohibited , to get electrons from lower orbitals rather than from higher orbitals .
So although the new results were at first glance surprising , they make sense from a physics perspective .
" I would say our prejudice was wrong , not the theory itself , " Corkum says .

Once upon a time you 'd read it in the newspaper and you knew that a hundred different fact - checkers had checked the story , a sub-editor , an editor , but these days information and news is put up so quickly that , you know , there 's no one there to check it ... — Channel Ten , The 7 pm Project , 21st September , 2009
Ah Sophie , how true .
And certainly , none of these worthy news outlets seems to have bothered to check up on the Levitt Institute .
But as the web - enthusiasts say , the media may get more stuff wrong these days , but it does n't stay wrong for long .
That same day , Media Watch received an email from a very savvy viewer about :
... what appears to be a lovely self fulfilling hoax ... — Email from tipster to Media Watch , 21st September , 2009
Our tipster had checked up on the Levitt Institute .
Though it claims to have been founded in 2007 ...
... I established that their domain www.levittinstitute.org was only registered on 8 September this year .
— Email from tipster to Media Watch , 21st September , 2009
The tipster then Googled the name of the Institute 's founder , Dr Carl Varnsen and found very little , except a reference in Wikipedia to a :
List of Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich people .
— Wikipedia
... where , amid a panoply of Nobel Prizewinners and the like , under :
Other Notable Alumni ... — Wikipedia
... is the entry :
Carl Varnsen Public intellectual and leading sociologist in Australia .
— Wikipedia
Public intellectual ?
How come none of us have ever heard of him ?
Our tipster pointed out :
This reference was added on 11 September 2009 ... — Email from tipster to Media Watch , 21st September , 2009
Of course , there was another bloke who used the name Karl Varnsen as an alias ...

We did some digging of our own .
We sent a camera along to the Levitt Institute 's address in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale .
Does n't look very prepossessing , does it ?
Locked up and derelict , in fact .
And then there 's the report itself .
In amongst paragraphs of impenetrable mathematical gibberish is this sentence :
These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes .
— Report , The Levitt Institute , 12th September , 2009
Enough already .
It 's all a hoax - a quite elaborate one - designed to make the media look like gullible idiots .
Well , it succeeded .
And the perpetrator , we found out , was itself a media company , Zapruder 's Other Films , part - owned by that pillar of rectitude , Andrew Denton .
All was due to be revealed on a new show which starts this very week on this very channel .
According to Andrew Denton The Hungry Beast will be :
" ... an unusual hybrid of journalism , comedy and ... something else ... " — ABC Website - Program Summary , Hungry Beast
Something else like , blatant misrepresentation ?
According to The Hungry Beast 's pre-publicity , its young recruits have been put through a rigorous crash course in journalism .
Being taken through ethics , media law , interview technique , writing for television , story conferencing , camera workshops , it covered a huge amount .
—
Two Thousand website , interview with Hungry Beast web content producer , Elmo Keep
Ethics , eh ?
Well , AAP do n't think much of the ethics of this little exercise .
While this incident has caused us to review our verification procedures , ... any fair - minded observer would understand how this hoax , with supporting website , 10 - page report , and PR people spruiking the results could deceive a busy reporter facing rolling agency deadlines ...
No-matter what the rationale behind this hoax , it is cheap and mischievous .

No doubt many of you would reckon it 's pretty funny too but there 's another lesson for the folk at The Hungry Beast in all this : it 's a cut - throat world out there .
If you think you can put a hoax on the web two weeks before you go to air , without anyone else spotting it you 're living in fairyland .
The Beast is much too Hungry for that .
A disturbing probe into the potential for apparently innocent biscuits ' ability to do harm has revealed that an astounding 25 million Brits have been injured while indulging in some light coffee / tea break snack action , with 500 victims requiring hospital treatment .
That 's according to research outfit Mindlab International , which determined that almost a third of adults had been scalded by hot beverages while dunking , 26 per cent had choked on crumbs and ten per cent had broken a tooth or filling while getting their laughing gear round a biscuit .
Rather more seriously , seven per cent of Britons have dropped a biscuit tin on their foot , three per cent have fallen off a chair reaching for vital nourishment , and an equal percentage have poked themselves in the eye with a biscuit .
Seven per cent admitted to have been bitten while feeding a tasty biscuit morsel to a pet or “ other wild animal ” .
The most extreme example of biscuit - related mishap , however , was the case of the man who got stuck in wet concrete after wading in to retrieve a stray biccy .
Mindlab also carried out a " Biscuit Injury Threat Evaluation " ( BITE ) to determine which was Blighty 's deadliest biscuit .
Mindlab International director Dr David Lewis explained : “ We tested the physical properties of 15 popular types of biscuits , along with aspects of their consumption such as ‘ dunkability ’ and crumb dispersal .
“ Then one of our mathematicians correlated these findings with research data and responses from a nationwide survey of 1,000 adults . ”
The chilling result is that the public would do well to eye the Custard Cream with suspicion , since it topped the list with a BITE risk rating of 5.63 .
That 's compared with 4.34 for your common - or - garden Cookie , in second spot , and 4.12 for next - placed Choc Biscuit Bar .
Those of you who like sucking a Ginger Nut will be relieved to learn that they 're relatively risk - free , rating 2.99 in ninth place .
Anyone not wanting to chance their arm should stick to Jaffa Cakes , since they bottomed the list with an almost harmless 1.16 .
Mike Driver , marketing director for biscuit manufacturers Rocky , which commissioned the survey , concluded : “ Working with biscuits every day , we ’d long suspected they ’re not as innocent as they look - and we were right . "
Here 's the full biscuit risk rating listing :
Custard Cream : 5.64
Cookie : 4.34
Choc Biscuit Bar : 4.12
Wafer : 3.74
Rich Tea : 3.45
Bourbon : 3.44
Oat Biscuit : 3.31
Digestive : 3.14
Ginger Nut : 2.99
Shortbread : 2.90
Caramel Shortcake : 2.76
Nice Biscuit : 2.27
Iced Biscuits / Party Rings : 2.16
Chocolate Finger : 1.38
Jaffa Cakes : 1.16

I love country music .
That ’s why I ’m qualified to make fun of it when it goes awry .
I grew up listening to country and occasionally had to suffer through a stupid lyric or two .
Consider this my revenge .
The following irreverence is spewed with the utmost respect .
Long live country .
1. From “ Bony Fingers ” , Recorded by Hoyt Axton in 1974
Work your fingers to the bone and what do you get ?
Bony fingers !
Bony fingers !
This is not true .
You would not get bony fingers .
You would get calloused fingers , but they would n’t be any bonier .
And he says it with such excitement .
Listen to the song .
It sounds like he ’s won a prize !
Bony fingers !
Yippee !!!
2. From “ I ’ve Been Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart ” , Recorded by Johnny Cash in 1968
I ’ve been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you ’ve got me out of your conscience I ’ve been flushed from the bathroom of your heart
Way to go , Johnny , rhyming “ conscience ” with “ conscience . ”
That was clever and creative .
But , theater of your love ?
Does that mean that her love was a performance ?
That it was n’t real ?
Was she the actor or the director ?
Now , I come dangerously close to worshipping Johnny Cash .
So , I ’ve made up an excuse for the catastrophe that is this song .
He performed it at Folsom Prison , and the inmates thought it was hilarious .
It ’s important for a performer to target his audience .
But man … flushed ?
3. From “ Country Rap ” , Recorded by The Bellamy Brothers in 1987
We got pickup trucks chicken clucks Happy even when we ’re down on our luck
We got fatback that ’s a fact
And if you do n’t know that ’s a country rap .
The neighbor down the roads got a cow for sale Twenty dollars more you get the horns and tail Saturday night we ’re gonna go get drunk Something in the road smells like a skunk .
They actually rap this .
Two middle - aged white guys .
This was the eighties , long before hip hop and country were competing for teenyboppers ’ allowances .
This was the eighties when the country was content to be country , and Nashville could n’t even define hip hop .
That ’s why there ’s no excuse for this song .
And why on earth would you want the horns and tail ?
I had to look up “ fatback ” and this is what I found :
Chiefly South Midland and Southern U.S. the fat and fat meat from the upper part of a side of pork , usually cured by salt .
OK , that ’s just disgusting !
2 . a menhaden .
I had to look this up too .
It ’s an east coast fish used to make oil .
3 . the bluefish , Pomatomus saltatrix .
4 . a mullet .
Another kind of fish , but I ’m tempted to think they meant the hairstyle .
I dare you to come up with a more ambiguous word that ( almost ) rhymes with fact .
4. From “ Dropkick me , Jesus , through the goalposts of life ” , Recorded by Bobby Bare in 1976
Dropkick me , Jesus , through the goalposts of life End over end neither left nor to right Straight through the heart of them righteous uprights Drop kick me Jesus through the goalposts of life .
This song is coined , “ The world ’s only Christian football waltz , ” and while I wish there were more of these , I still have to criticize this one .
I am no football guru , but I have never seen anyone drop kick a field goal .
Nor have I ever seen a punt go through the goalposts .
Does this even make sense ?
And is n’t Jesus supposed to wrap
His loving arms around His sheep , not kick them end over end ?
5 . The entire lyrics of “ I Love ” , Written and Recorded by Tom T. Hall in 1973
I love little baby ducks , old pick - up trucks , slow movin ’ trains , and rain .
I love little country streams , sleep without dreams , sunday school in May , and hay .
And I love you too .
I love leaves in the wind , pictures of my friends , birds of the world , and squirrels .
I love coffee in a cup , little fuzzy pups , bourbon in a glass , and grass .
And I love you too .
I love honest open smiles , kisses from a child , tomatoes on a vine , and onions .
I love winners when they cry , losers when they try , music when it ’s good , and life .
And I love you too .
OK , this guy was just stoned out of his mind .
And I ca n’t stop laughing all of a sudden .
6. From “ Honky Tonk Badonkadonk ” , Recorded by Trace Adkins in 2005
Got it goin’ on Like Donkey Kong
And whoo - wee Shut my mouth , slap your grandma
There outta be a law Get the Sheriff on the phone Lord have mercy , how ’s she even get them britches on That honky tonk badonkadonk ( Aww son )
Aside from the fact that it pisses off every feminist in the universe , I have one main complaint about this song . . . who the hell slaps their grandma ?
That ’s just rude !
And totally illegal !
And is n’t Donkey Kong a male ape ?
So Trace Adkins is saying he ’s attracted to a male ape ?
Or just a male ape ass ?
I ’m so confused .
And , really , did anyone ever call it a badonkadonk before this song came out ?
7. From “ There ’s a Tear in My Beer ” , Recorded by Hank Williams Jr. and Hank Williams in 1990
There ’s a tear in my beer ’ cause I ’m crying for you dear
These are only the first two lines of the song , and the song only gets worse .
Hank Sr. recorded this song , but did n’t release it before he passed away , so it remained forgotten for decades .
Once it was discovered , Hank Williams Jr. recorded it again , and dubbed the two voices together , so the single featured father and son .
Sweet thought .
But there ’s a reason daddy left this one in the attic in the first place .
8. From “ Achy Breaky Heart ” , Recorded by Billy Ray Cyrus in 1992
But do n’t tell my heart , my achy breaky heart I just do n’t think he ’d understand
And if you tell my heart , my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man Ooo
Apparently I am alone in thinking these lyrics are ridiculous because he actually won awards for this .
This song launched his career .
So what do I know ?
What I want to know is , who talks like this ?
Why could n’t he have sung , “ My aching , breaking heart ? ”
That would have been bad enough .
This sounds like he ’s singing to a group of toddlers , “ And who wants their achy breaky sippy cup full of juicy ? ”
9. From “ Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox ” , Recorded by Joe Diffie in 1993
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die Lord , I wanna go to heaven but I do n’t wanna go tonight Fill my boots up with sand , put a stiff drink in my hand Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
Just one question .
If he dies ?
Like he might not ?
10 . From “ I ’ll Come Back as Another Woman ” , Recorded by Tanya Tucker in 1986 .
You never gave me back the love I gave to you .
You just gave me half your heart and that half was untrue .
So I ’ll leave you with a promise , from a heart that ’s heard enough : Someday you ’ll find out that you ca n’t escape my love .
I ’ll come back as another woman , One with all the secrets to your heart .
I ’ll come back as another woman , I ’ll be the one you burn for , That you reach for in the dark .
I ’ll be the one that breaks your devil heart .
You ’ll hear the echo of my promise , ( Ha , Ha , Ha . )
How you laughed and how I cried .
The one you finally give your heart to , ( Ha , Ha , Ha . )
I will leave you crying in the night .
I love Tanya Tucker .
I really do .
Her voice is amazing .
But this song is just creepy .
I do n’t get it .
Is she going to come back from the dead ?
Is she going to be a younger , reincarnated version of the one with a broken heart ?
Or does this mean she is going to go get herself disguised ?
Plastic surgery maybe ?
Did they have that in 1986 ?
Or is she going to steal another woman ’s identity ?
I know , I ’m reaching now , but I just do n’t see how a guy could be a big enough idiot to allow an ex-lover to sneak up on him and seduce him .
Bizarre .
And creepy .
Wow , I ca n’t believe I got through the entire list without making fun of Shania Twain .
Maybe there should be a sequel .
That Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake .
These things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator , for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action ; despair if he fail in his quest , and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed .
Tillinghast had once been the prey of failure , solitary and melancholy ; but now I knew , with nauseating fears of my own , that he was the prey of success .
I had indeed warned him ten weeks before , when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover .
He had been flushed and excited then , talking in a high and unnatural , though always pedantic , voice .
“ What do we know , ” he had said , “ of the world and the universe about us ?
Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few , and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow .
We see things only as we are constructed to see them , and can gain no idea of their absolute nature .
With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos , yet other beings with a wider , stronger , or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see , but might see and study whole worlds of matter , energy , and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have .
I have always believed that such strange , inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows , and now I believe I have found a way to break down the barriers .
I am not joking .
Within twenty - four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised sense - organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges .
Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man , and several unknown to anything we consider organic life .
We shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark , and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight .
We shall see these things , and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen .
We shall overleap time , space , and dimensions , and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation .
When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated , for I knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused ; but he was a fanatic , and drove me from the house .
Now he was no less a fanatic , but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment , and he had written me imperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognise .
As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle , I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows .
The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light , and I sickened at the hollow , altered voice of my host .
I wished the servants were about , and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously .
It seemed strange that old Gregory , at least , should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as I .
It was he who had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage .
Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination .
Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess , but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart , I could not doubt .
Before I had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable ; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree I almost shared his spirit , terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man .
The electricity seemed to be turned off , and when I asked my guide he said it was for a definite reason .
“ It would be too much . . .
I would not dare , ” he continued to mutter .
I especially noted his new habit of muttering , for it was not like him to talk to himself .
We entered the laboratory in the attic , and I observed that detestable electrical machine , glowing with a sickly , sinister , violet luminosity .
It was connected with a powerful chemical battery , but seemed to be receiving no current ; for I recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action .
In reply to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that I could understand .
He now seated me near the machine , so that it was on my right , and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs .
The usual sputtering began , turned to a whine , and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence .
Meanwhile the luminosity increased , waned again , then assumed a pale , outré colour or blend of colours which I could neither place nor describe .
Tillinghast had been watching me , and noted my puzzled expression .
“ Do you know what that is ? ” he whispered .
“ That is ultra-violet . ”
He chuckled oddly at my surprise .
“ You thought ultra-violet was invisible , and so it is — but you can see that and many other invisible things now .
“ Listen to me !
The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us ; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity .
I have seen truth , and I intend to shew it to you .
Do you wonder how it will seem ?
I will tell you . ”
Here Tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me , blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes .
“ Your existing sense - organs — ears first , I think — will pick up many of the impressions , for they are closely connected with the dormant organs .
Then there will be others .
You have heard of the pineal gland ?
I laugh at the shallow endocrinologist , fellow - dupe and fellow - parvenu of the Freudian .
That gland is the great sense - organ of organs — I have found out .
It is like sight in the end , and transmits visual pictures to the brain .
If you are normal , that is the way you ought to get most of it . . .
I mean get most of the evidence from beyond . ”
I looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall , dimly lit by rays which the every - day eye can not see .
The far corners were all shadows , and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
During the interval that Tillinghast was silent I fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of long - dead gods ; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision .
The picture was very vivid for a while , but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception ; that of utter , absolute solitude in infinite , sightless , soundless space .
There seemed to be a void , and nothing more , and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I always carried after dark since the night I was held up in East Providence .
Then , from the farthermost regions of remoteness , the sound softly glided into existence .
It was infinitely faint , subtly vibrant , and unmistakably musical , but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body .
I felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass .
Simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught , which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound .
As I waited breathlessly I perceived that both sound and wind were increasing ; the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive .
I began to speak to Tillinghast , and as I did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished .
I saw only the man , the glowing machine , and the dim apartment .
Tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn , but from his expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much as I , if not a great deal more .
I whispered what I had experienced , and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possible .
“ Do n’t move , ” he cautioned , “ for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see .
I told you the servants left , but I did n’t tell you how .
It was that thick - witted housekeeper — she turned on the lights downstairs after I had warned her not to , and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations .
It must have been frightful — I could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another direction , and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house .
Mrs. Updike ’s clothes were close to the front hall switch — that ’s how I know she did it .
It got them all .
But so long as we do n’t move we ’re fairly safe .
Remember we ’re dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless .
. . .
Keep still ! ”
The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis , and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what Tillinghast called “ beyond ” .
I was now in a vortex of sound and motion , with confused pictures before my eyes .
I saw the blurred outlines of the room , but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognisable shapes or clouds , penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me .
Then I glimpsed the temple - like effect again , but this time the pillars reached up into an aërial ocean of light , which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before .
After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic , and in the jumble of sights , sounds , and unidentified sense - impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form .
One definite flash I shall always remember .
I seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining , revolving spheres , and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape ; this shape being the distorted face of Crawford Tillinghast .
At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body , and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually .
I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland , and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye .
Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight .
Over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which , though vague , held the elements of consistency and permanence .
It was indeed somewhat familiar , for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre .
I saw the attic laboratory , the electrical machine , and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me ; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant .
Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray , and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien , unknown entities .
It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things , and vice versa .
Foremost among the living objects were great inky , jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine .
They were present in loathsome profusion , and I saw to my horror that they overlapped ; that they were semi- fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids .
These things were never still , but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose .
Sometimes they appeared to devour one another , the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight .
Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants , and could not exclude the things from my mind as I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us .
But Tillinghast had been watching me , and was speaking .
“ You see them ?
You see them ?
You see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life ?
You see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky ?
Have I not succeeded in breaking down the barrier ; have I not shewn you worlds that no other living men have seen ? ”
I heard him scream through the horrible chaos , and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine .
His eyes were pits of flame , and they glared at me with what I now saw was overwhelming hatred .
The machine droned detestably .
“ You think those floundering things wiped out the servants ?
Fool , they are harmless !
But the servants are gone , are n’t they ?
You tried to stop me ; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I could get ; you were afraid of the cosmic truth , you damned coward , but now I ’ve got you !
What swept up the servants ?
What made them scream so loud ? . . .
Do n’t know , eh ?
You ’ll know soon enough !
Look at me — listen to what I say — do you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude ?
Do you fancy there are such things as form or matter ?
I tell you , I have struck depths that your little brain ca n’t picture !
I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars .
. . .
I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness .
. . .
Space belongs to me , do you hear ?
Things are hunting me now — the things that devour and dissolve — but I know how to elude them .
It is you they will get , as they got the servants .
Stirring , dear sir ?
I told you it was dangerous to move .
I have saved you so far by telling you to keep still — saved you to see more sights and to listen to me .
If you had moved , they would have been at you long ago .
Do n’t worry , they wo n’t hurt you .
They did n’t hurt the servants — it was seeing that made the poor devils scream so .
My pets are not pretty , for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are — very different .
Disintegration is quite painless , I assure you — but I want you to see them .
I almost saw them , but I knew how to stop .
You are not curious ?
I always knew you were no scientist !
Trembling , eh ?
Trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things I have discovered ?
Why do n’t you move , then ?
Tired ?
Well , do n’t worry , my friend , for they are coming .
. . .
Look !
Look , curse you , look ! . . .
It ’s just over your left shoulder .
. . . ”
What remains to be told is very brief , and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts .
The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and found us there — Tillinghast dead and me unconscious .
They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand , but released me in three hours , after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor .
I did not tell very much of what I had seen , for I feared the coroner would be sceptical ; but from the evasive outline I did give , the doctor told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madman .
I wish I could believe that doctor .
It would help my shaky nerves if I could dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me .
I never feel alone or comfortable , and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when I am weary .
What prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple fact — that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered .
Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend , Crawford Tillinghast .
I had not seen him since that day , two months and a half before , when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading ; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage .
I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine , eating little and excluding even the servants , but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature .
It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin , and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed , the eyes sunken , circled , and uncannily glowing , the forehead veined and corrugated , and the hands tremulous and twitching .
And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness ; a wild disorder of dress , a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots , and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean - shaven , the cumulative effect is quite shocking .
But such was the aspect of Crawford Tillinghast on the night his half - coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile ; such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me , candle in hand , and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient , lonely house set back from Benevolent Street .
That Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake .
These things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator , for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action ; despair if he fail in his quest , and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed .
Tillinghast had once been the prey of failure , solitary and melancholy ; but now I knew , with nauseating fears of my own , that he was the prey of success .
I had indeed warned him ten weeks before , when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover .
He had been flushed and excited then , talking in a high and unnatural , though always pedantic , voice .
“ What do we know , ” he had said , “ of the world and the universe about us ?
Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few , and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow .
We see things only as we are constructed to see them , and can gain no idea of their absolute nature .
With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos , yet other beings with a wider , stronger , or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see , but might see and study whole worlds of matter , energy , and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have .
I have always believed that such strange , inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows , I am not joking .
Within twenty - four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised sense - organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges .
Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man , and several unknown to anything we consider organic life .
We shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark , and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight .
We shall see these things , and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen .
We shall overleap time , space , and dimensions , and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation .
When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated , for I knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused ; but he was a fanatic , and drove me from the house .
Now he was no less a fanatic , but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment , and he had written me imperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognise .
As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle , I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows .
The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light , and I sickened at the hollow , altered voice of my host .
I wished the servants were about , and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously .
It seemed strange that old Gregory , at least , should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as I .
It was he who had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage .
Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination .
Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess , but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart , I could not doubt .
Before I had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable ; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree I almost shared his spirit , terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
Up through the dark emptiness of the house I followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man .
The electricity seemed to be turned off , and when I asked my guide he said it was for a definite reason .
“ It would be too much . . .
I would not dare , ” he continued to mutter .
I especially noted his new habit of muttering , for it was not like him to talk to himself .
We entered the laboratory in the attic , and I observed that detestable electrical machine , glowing with a sickly , sinister , violet luminosity .
It was connected with a powerful chemical battery , but seemed to be receiving no current ; for I recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action .
In reply to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that I could understand .
He now seated me near the machine , so that it was on my right , and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs .
The usual sputtering began , turned to a whine , and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence .
Meanwhile the luminosity increased , waned again , then assumed a pale , outré colour or blend of colours which I could neither place nor describe .
Tillinghast had been watching me , and noted my puzzled expression .
“ Do you know what that is ? ” he whispered . “ ” He chuckled oddly at my surprise .
“ You thought ultra-violet was invisible , and so it is — but you can see that and many other invisible things “ Listen to me !
The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us ; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity .
I have seenand I intend to shew it to you .
Do you wonder how it will seem ?
I will tell you . ”
Here Tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me , blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes .
“ Your existing sense - organs — ears first , I think — will pick up many of the impressions , for they are closely connected with the dormant organs .
Then there will be others .
You have heard of the pineal gland ?
I laugh at the shallow endocrinologist , fellow - dupe and fellow - parvenu of the Freudian .
That gland is the great sense - organ of organs —
It is like sight in the end , and transmits visual pictures to the brain .
If you are normal , that is the way you ought to get most of it . . .
I mean get most of the evidence fromI looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall , dimly lit by rays which the every - day eye can not see .
The far corners were all shadows , and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
During the interval that Tillinghast was silent I fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of long - dead gods ; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision .
The picture was very vivid for a while , but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception ; that of utter , absolute solitude in infinite , sightless , soundless space .
There seemed to be a void , and nothing more , and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I always carried after dark since the night I was held up in East Providence .
Then , from the farthermost regions of remoteness , thesoftly glided into existence .
It was infinitely faint , subtly vibrant , and unmistakably musical , but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body .
I felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass .
Simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught , which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound .
As I waited breathlessly I perceived that both sound and wind were increasing ; the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive .
I began to speak to Tillinghast , and as I did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished .
I saw only the man , the glowing machine , and the dim apartment .
Tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn , but from his expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much as I , if not a great deal more .
I whispered what I had experienced , and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possible .
“ Do n’t move , ” he cautioned , “ for in these raysI told you the servants left , but I did n’t tell you It was that thick - witted housekeeper — she turned on the lights downstairs after I had warned her not to , and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations .
It must have been frightful — I could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another direction , and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house .
Mrs. Updike ’s clothes were close to the front hall switch — that ’s how I know she did it .
It got them all .
But so long as we do n’t move we ’re fairly safe .
Remember we ’re dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless .
. . . The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis , and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what Tillinghast called “ ” .
I was now in a vortex of sound and motion , with confused pictures before my eyes .
I saw the blurred outlines of the room , but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognisable shapes or clouds , penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me .
Then I glimpsed the temple - like effect again , but this time the pillars reached up into an aërial ocean of light , which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before .
After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic , and in the jumble of sights , sounds , and unidentified sense - impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form .
One definite flash I shall always remember .
I seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining , revolving spheres , and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape ; this shape being the distorted face of Crawford Tillinghast .
At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionallyand thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually .
I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland , and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye .
Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight .
Over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which , though vague , held the elements of consistency and permanence .
It was indeed somewhat familiar , for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre .
I saw the attic laboratory , the electrical machine , and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me ; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant .
Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray , and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien , unknown entities .
It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things , and vice versa .
Foremost among the living objects were great inky , jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine .
They were present in loathsome profusion , and I saw to my horror that theythat they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids .
These things were never still , but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose .
Sometimes they appeared to devour one another , the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight .
Shudderingly I felt that I knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants , and could not exclude the things from my mind as I strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us .
But Tillinghast had been watching me , and was speaking .
“ You see them ?
You see them ?
You see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life ?
You see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky ?
Have I not succeeded in breaking down the barrier ; have I not shewn you worlds that no other living men have seen ? ”
I heard him scream through the horrible chaos , and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine .
His eyes were pits of flame , and they glared at me with what I now saw was overwhelming hatred .
The machine droned detestably .
“ You think those floundering things wiped out the servants ?
Fool , they are harmless !
But the servantsgone , are n’t they ?
You tried to stop me ; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I could get ; you were afraid of the cosmic truth , you damned coward , but now I ’ve got you !
What swept up the servants ?
What made them scream so loud ? . . .
Do n’t know , eh ?
You ’ll know soon enough !
Look at me — listen to what I say — do you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude ?
Do you fancy there are such things as form or matter ?
I tell you , I have struck depths that your little brain ca n’t picture !
I have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down daemons from the stars .
. . .
I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness .
. . .
Space belongs to me , do you hear ?
Things are hunting me now — the things that devour and dissolve — but I know how to elude them .
It is you they will get , as they got the servants .
Stirring , dear sir ?
I told you it was dangerous to move .
I have saved you so far by telling you to keep still — saved you to see more sights and to listen to me .
If you had moved , they would have been at you long ago .
Do n’t worry , they won’tyou .
They did n’t hurt the servants — it wasthat made the poor devils scream so .
My pets are not pretty , for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are — Disintegration is quite painless , I assure you — butI almost saw them , but I knew how to stop .
You are not curious ?
I always knew you were no scientist !
Trembling , eh ?
Trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things I have discovered ?
Why do n’t you move , then ?
Tired ?
Well , do n’t worry , my friend , . . . .
Look !
Look , curse you , look ! . . .
It ’s just over your left shoulder .
. . .
” What remains to be told is very brief , and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts .
The police heard a shot in the old Tillinghast house and found us there — Tillinghast dead and me unconscious .
They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand , but released me in three hours , after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor .
I did not tell very much of what I had seen , for I feared the coroner would be sceptical ; but from the evasive outline I did give , the doctor told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madman .
I wish I could believe that doctor .
It would help my shaky nerves if I could dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me .
I never feel alone or comfortable , and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when I am weary .
What prevents me from believing the doctor is this one simple fact — that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say Crawford Tillinghast murdered .
Most homeowners want to make sure their home is safe .
However , it can feel like a high cost .
It does n’t have to be .
You do n’t have to give up the peace of mind since an assortment of solutions exists that keep costs affordable while offering you a good amount of information and insight into your …
Kartika Sari Dewa Shukarnor , seen with her parents , is a former model
An Islamic court in Malaysia has upheld a sentence of six strokes of the cane handed to a Muslim woman who was caught drinking beer in public .
The court appeals panel in Pahang state ruled the sentence on 32 - year - old Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarnor was just .
No date was set for the caning , but if it goes ahead , Shukarnor will be the first Malaysian woman to be caned .
The case has caused controversy in Malaysia , where Muslims are subject to Islamic law in personal matters .
While drinking alcohol is forbidden for Muslims , prosecutions are rare .
Analysts say the government fears that the punishment could damage Malaysia 's reputation abroad .
Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarnor , a mother of two , was arrested for drinking beer in a beachfront hotel in December 2007 .
She previously asked that her punishment be carried out in public , triggering a debate over the use of Islamic laws in the moderate Muslim country .

A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the FBI must release its June 2004 interview with then - Vice President Dick Cheney concerning the leaking of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame .
The Bush and Obama administrations have both sought to keep the interview secret , but Judge Emmet Sullivan has determined ( pdf ) that there is no reason for it to remain sealed now that the Plame investigation has concluded :
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The Court concludes that the agency has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the requested documents were properly withheld in their entirety under any FOIA exemption protecting law enforcement interests .
Limited portions of those documents , however , were properly withheld under exemptions designed to protect information that is privileged or that could impinge on personal privacy or threaten national security . ”
CREW ’s executive director issued a statement expressing satisfaction that “ Judge Sullivan rightly rejected a Justice Department interpretation of the FOIA that would have allowed the government to withhold virtually any law enforcement record even where an investigation has long since been concluded .
We are disappointed , however , that the judge allowed DOJ to withhold portions of some records because the American people deserve to know the truth about the role the vice president played in exposing Mrs. Wilson ’s covert identity .
High - level government officials should not be permitted to hide their misconduct from public view . ”
Justice Department attorneys told Judge Sullivan last summer that they intend to appeal any order to release the documents .
Rep . Henry Waxman first issued a subpoena for the FBI interviews with Cheney and others in June 2008 , citing both testimony by Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby and a book by former White House press secretary Scott McClellan as suggesting that Cheney might have been involved in the outing .
When the Justice Department refused on grounds of executive privilege , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) filed a Freedom of Information request , followed in August 2008 by a lawsuit .
ADVERTISEMENT
In arguing against the lawsuit , the Obama administration has suggested that future presidents and vice presidents might refuse to cooperate with criminal investigations if they knew their statements might become public .

English wine gets help from space
The system can help to optimise harvests , and hopefully wine quality
A number of English vineyards have signed up to make use of a satellite imaging service to boost harvests .
The satellite measures a vineyard 's reflectivity in a number of colours in the visible and infrared .
The Oenoview system , first launched in France last year , analyses the images to determine vine leaf density , soil water content and grape bunch sizes .
The English Wine Producers trade group said that wines made using the system could be available as early as 2011 .
Oenoview was developed by the Institut Cooperatif du Vin in France along with Infoterra , a subsidiary of aerospace firm EADS Astrium .
The system relies on the fact that reflectivity at different wavelengths can give information both about the vines ' foliage and the soil in which they are growing .
The system can be used to assess a range of surface characteristics
The quantity of foliage is linked to the quality of the grapes because it is an indirect measure of the amounts of sugars and tannins contained in them .
There is an ideal time to harvest each bunch , but not all bunches are ready at the same time .
The satellite data cuts the vineyards into two - metre - square " pixels " , corresponding to about four vines each , and the software assigns each pixel a colour - coded " leaf area index " .
" If there is an even distribution of blue or red images in a field , the leaf area index suggests that the grapes can be harvested altogether , " said Oenoview programme manager Henri Douche .
" But if the map shows defined red and blue areas , it helps the owner to care for and harvest sections of the fields to produce top quality wine . "
Julia Trustram Eve from English Wine Producers said : " Innovation is at the heart of the English wine industry and vineyard owners are keen to use technology that complements their wine - making skills .
" Developing a pilot programme to use space technology is a smart and exciting next step . "

Today a federal district court denied the government 's latest emergency motion asking for a 30 - day stay in last Friday 's deadline to release records relating to telecom lobbying over last year 's debate over immunity for corporate participation in government spying .
The new deadline is October 16 , at 4 p.m. Pacific time .
We sought the records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act .
On September 24 , Judge Jeffrey White had ordered the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Justice to turn over many of the records we requested by Friday , October 9 , 2009 .
Last week , the agencies asked him to postpone his order while the government decided whether or not to appeal , which EFF opposed .
Judge
White denied the motion .
On October 8 , the day before the documents were due , the DOJ and ODNI filed an emergency motion asking the Court of Appeals for a 30 - day stay while the agencies continue to contemplate an appeal .
Around noon on October 9 , the Ninth Circuit denied their emergency motion , telling the government it had to file for a motion for a stay pending appeal in the district court first .
Later that afternoon , the government filed again in the federal district court , but once again did not seek a stay pending an actual appeal .
Instead , for the third time , the government insisted it could delay the release of telecom lobbying records while it considered the pros and cons of appealing .
Briefing was complete by noon today , and Judge White denied the third attempt at delay this afternoon .
Judge
White also noted that , even if the government had actually appealed , " in order to obviate the need for the parties to appear once again before this Court before seeking the same redress on appeal , the Court has addressed the pertinent factors it would analyze in denying a motion to stay this action pending appeal , " and found the " equities weigh in favor of denial of a stay . "
In particular , the Court noted the " current administration ’s pointed directive on transparency in government , and the public ’s renewed interest in the question of legal immunity for the telecommunications companies that participated in the warrantless wiretapping program while considering currently pending legislation repealing the amendments to FISA , the Court finds that the public interest lies in favor of disclosure . "
By By Andrew Moran Aug 19 , 2009 in Business Peter Schiff , Euro Pacific President and author of Crash Proof , has forewarned Zimbabwe - style hyperinflation in the future .
Schiff , like Marc Faber , could see the US with Zimbabwe - style inflation , where the Zimbabweans bring barrels of money to pay for a loaf of bread .
Schiff has been on many networks such as CNBC , CNN , Fox News and other investment programs to warn people that “ As painful as it is , this recession is necessary .
We ’re never going to have a vibrant economy if we keep concentrating on reinflating a busted bubble . ”
In 2008 , the potential Connecticut Republican Senate candidate exclaimed that bailouts and government stimulus plans are going to exacerbate the problem (s ) facing the United States economy .
In the middle of the interview , Schiff cites the slashing of interest rates in 2001 and 2002 , “ We stimulated our way out of that recession into this depression . ”
He criticized the government and the Federal Reserve artificially lowering the interest rates to Japan - style rates .
Schiff further added that the government is doing the wrong thing in encouraging consumers to buy more and bailing out companies because it will only make the problem a lot worse than it already is .
“ The government is taking money away from people who are doing it right and giving it to people who are doing it wrong .
That ’s a recipe for disaster .
Why should successful companies be punished to bail out unsuccessful companies ? ”
Peter Schiff currently held a money bomb for his Senate campaign as reported by Schiff told the interviewer that if the government became less involved in many aspects of the free market then runaway costs would not persist , “ If we cancelled student loan programs , universities would charge a lot less .
Prices for insured medical procedures are rising three times as fast as those for uninsured procedures .

As the mainstream media deemed the cash - for - clunkers program to be a success , Schiff disagreed , “ We are spending money to take an asset that works … and destroy it .
What ’s probably going to happen in a couple of years is we ’ll need a bailout for all the people who bought cars with their cash for clunkers money and ca n’t afford to make their payments . ”
In his latest interview with Money News , Schiff continued the same message , “ If you look at 2008 and 2009 together , people who invested outside the United States are in far better shape than people who invested inside .
I expect that to continue . ”

Lettuce grown during the winter months may contain higher levels of toxic rocket fuel
View and Download the report here : Suspect Salads
Lettuce grown in the fall and winter months in Southern California or Arizona may contain higher levels of toxic rocket fuel than is considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , according to independent laboratory tests commissioned by Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) .
In the first - ever tests of perchlorate in supermarket produce , 18 percent of lettuce samples contained detectable levels of perchlorate , and an average serving of these contaminated samples contained 4 times more than the EPA says is safe in drinking water .
EWG estimates that by eating lettuce , 1.6 million American women of childbearing age are exposed daily during the winter months to more perchlorate than the EPA ’s recommended safe dose .
EWG 's findings of perchlorate in retail produce confirm previous tests on greenhouse - grown lettuce seedlings by the EPA and field - grown vegetables by a San Bernardino , Calif .
farm whose irrigation water supplies were contaminated by defense contractor Lockheed Martin 's abandoned rocket - testing facility .
Winter Lettuce Growing Region
Perchlorate , the explosive component of rocket and missile fuel , can affect the thyroid gland ’s ability to make essential hormones .
For fetuses , infants and children , disruptions in thyroid hormone levels can cause lowered IQ , mental retardation , loss of hearing and speech , and motor skill deficits .
Currently there are no enforceable perchlorate safety standards but EWG argues that a national safety standard should be no higher than one - tenth the EPA ’s currently recommended level .
Press -Enterprise :
California newspaper 's lettuce tests also find perchlorate .
Perchlorate contaminates more than 500 drinking water sources in 20 states , serving well over 20 million people .
Among contaminated sources is the Colorado River , which not only provides drinking water for Los Angeles , Phoenix , Las Vegas and other cities , but also irrigates 70 percent of the nation ’s lettuce grown from October to March .
Recommendations
Perchlorate contamination of Lake Mead and the Colorado River must be cleaned up .
The Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture must move quickly to conduct a definitive study of perchlorate contamination in the American food supply , and make all results public .
All future drinking water standards must adequately reflect the potential for exposure through food .
Farmers and landowners must be fully compensated for lost profits and property values .
Irrigation water sources — not just drinking water sources — must be tested for perchlorate .
The Bush Administration ’s current proposal to exempt Department of Defense sites from environmental regulations , including perchlorate cleanup , must not go forward .

Rocket fuel in winter lettuce
Suspect Salads : Toxic Rocket Fuel Found in First Tests of Grocery Store Lettuce
Lettuce grown in the fall and winter months in Southern California or Arizona may contain higher levels of toxic rocket fuel than is considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , according to independent laboratory tests commissioned by Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) .
In the first tests ever conducted for perchlorate in supermarket produce , 18 percent of lettuce samples contained detectable levels of perchlorate , and an average serving of these contaminated samples contained 4 times more perchlorate than the EPA says is safe in a liter of drinking water .
EWG ’s tests on retail lettuce confirm studies showing that vegetables grown with perchlorate - contaminated water or fertilizer can take up and concentrate the toxin .
Based on our tests and federal dietary data , EWG estimates that by eating lettuce , 1.6 million American women of childbearing age — the population of greatest concern — are exposed daily during the winter months to more perchlorate than the EPA ’s recommended safe dose .
Figure A
Perchlorate , the explosive main ingredient of solid rocket and missile fuel , can affect the thyroid gland ’s ability to take up the essential nutrient iodide and make thyroid hormones .
For infants and children , small disruptions in thyroid hormones in utero or during early development can cause lowered IQ ; larger disruptions can cause mental retardation , loss of hearing and speech , or deficits in motor skills . [ 1 ]
There are no enforceable drinking water safety standards at either the state or federal level , but EWG ’s analysis of the latest scientific studies , showing harmful health effects from very low doses , argues that a national perchlorate safety standard should be no higher than one - tenth the EPA ’s currently recommended level . [ 2 ]
Perchlorate in the Colorado River
Sampling by state and federal officials has confirmed perchlorate contamination in more than 500 drinking water sources in 20 states , serving well over 20 million people in California , Arizona and Nevada , and unknown millions elsewhere .
Among contaminated sources is the lower Colorado River — not only a major source of drinking water for thirsty , fast - growing cities including Los Angeles , San Diego , Phoenix and Las Vegas , but a 300 - mile - long irrigation channel for a major part of the nation ’s winter vegetable crop . [ 3,4 ]
Because perchlorate sampling nationwide is spotty — in some states not a single sample has been taken — it is possible that other regionally or nationally significant farming regions are unknowingly using perchlorate - contaminated water .
In January and February 2003 EWG bought 22 commercial lettuce samples for analysis by scientists at Texas Tech University .
The samples included pre-packaged and head lettuces , adult and baby greens , organic and conventional lettuces , from several different distributors .
Four samples contained measurable levels of perchlorate .
The average amount in the contaminated samples was 70 parts per billion ( ppb ) , meaning a typical one - cup serving would contain 4 micrograms ( ug ) of perchlorate .
( Table A. )
The EPA ’s provisional reference dose ( RfD ) for perchlorate in drinking water is 1 microgram per liter . [ 1 ]
Table A. Four of 22 Samples Tested Had Measurable Levels of Perchlorate *
* The level of detection varied by the type of lettuce analyzed , but is estimated to be 30 to 40 ppb perchlorate .
Download this table in PDF format
It should be emphasized that in this small sample , no relationship can be established between perchlorate levels and the variety of lettuce , the way it was packaged , or whether it was grown using organic vs. conventional methods .
In other words , it is a coincidence that our sample of organic baby greens had the highest perchlorate levels of the four contaminated samples .
Our study and earlier tests clearly show that perchlorate contamination is not limited to the type of lettuce , but that any lettuce grown in area where the irrigation water is contaminated may itself be contaminated .
Perchlorate , the explosive main ingredient of solid rocket and missile fuel , can affect the thyroid gland ’s ability to take up the essential nutrient iodide and make thyroid hormones .
For infants and children , small disruptions in thyroid hormones in utero or during early development can cause lowered IQ ; larger disruptions can cause mental retardation , loss of hearing and speech , or deficits in motor skills . [ 1 ]
There are no enforceable drinking water safety standards at either the state or federal level , but EWG ’s analysis of the latest scientific studies , showing harmful health effects from very low doses , argues that a national perchlorate safety standard should be no higher than one - tenth the EPA ’s currently recommended level . [ 2 ]
We ca n’t be certain where the lettuces were grown , or the level of perchlorate in the water used to grow them .
But based on the purchase season and location , the samples most likely came from Imperial County , Calif. , or Yuma County , Ariz .
These two counties , on either side of the Colorado , grow 88 percent of the lettuce sold in the U.S. in January and February .
Virtually all of the Imperial - Yuma cropland is irrigated by the Colorado River , contaminated by waste from a now - closed perchlorate manufacturing plant near Las Vegas . [ 5 ]
Between 500 and 900 pounds of perchlorate a day flow from the site into Lake Mead and down the river .
Perchlorate concentrations of 4 to 16 ppb have been measured in the lake and river , and concentrations of 3 to 6 ppb have been measured near irrigation intakes in Yuma County . [ 6 ]
1.6 Million Women a Day Consume Excessive Perchlorate in Lettuce
To estimate how much perchlorate exposure women of childbearing age get from lettuce , EWG analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) on the actual lettuce consumption , adjusted for body weight , of more than 2,400 women . [ 7 ]
Our analysis shows that of women between the ages of 15 and 44 who ate lettuce with the average level of perchlorate found in the contaminated samples , 57 percent would consume more than the EPA ’s provisional RfD for drinking water .
Thirty - seven percent would get twice as much .
( Figure B. )
Women of child - bearing age are the most important population to consider because fetuses are much more susceptible to harm from perchlorate exposure than adults .
Figure B
One - fourth of the women in the USDA database ate lettuce on a given day , and 18 percent of the winter lettuce samples tested had measurable perchlorate .
Therefore , EWG estimates that more than 2.8 million women of childbearing age in the United States are eating perchlorate - contaminated lettuce each day during the winter months .
About 1.6 million of these women are getting a dose of perchlorate that is greater than the EPA ’s proposed reference dose , and more than 1 million are getting a dose at least twice the RfD .
Based on lettuce production statistics for Yuma and Imperial Counties , which account for 70 percent of the national crop from November to March , about half as many women would be exposed in the fall months . [ 5 ]
( Figure C. )
In spring and summer , very little lettuce is grown in areas irrigated by the Colorado River .
Urgent Need for Action
EWG ’s findings have broad implications not just for the safety of produce , but also for current efforts to set perchlorate safety standards .
If the perchlorate levels in our samples are representative , exposure is not just a problem for people in areas where the water is contaminated , but a national concern for everyone who buys winter lettuce at the grocery store .
Figure C
If these levels are confirmed by further testing , immediate action is needed to reduce perchlorate in lettuce and other vegetables .
We urge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to immediately begin testing lettuce and other crops irrigated by the Colorado River for perchlorate , and make the results public as soon as they are confirmed .
Commercial produce grown in all other areas where water supplies are contaminated with perchlorate must also be tested .
Any growers adversely affected by perchlorate contamination should be fully compensated for crop losses and damage to property values .
Dietary analysis
EWG ’s Lettuce Tests and Dietary Analysis
During the weeks of January 20 and February 10 , 2003 , EWG purchased 22 samples of lettuce from the shelves of seven different grocery stores in Northern California and sent them to be analyzed for perchlorate by scientists at Texas Tech University , which has emerged as a major center for perchlorate - related research .
The samples included pre-packaged and head lettuces , adult and baby greens , organic and conventional lettuces , from several different distributors .
Four samples were found to contain perchlorate at levels that ranged from 30 to 121 ppb and averaged 70 ppb .
[ Note : ppb = nanograms per gram ( ng/g ) lettuce wet weight . ]
There was no relationship between the results and the type or brand of lettuce tested .
Because the detection limit for perchlorate in lettuce is relatively high ( 30 to 40 ppb in lettuce , compared to 1 to 4 ppb in water ) , it is possible that some of the other samples tested also contained perchlorate at concentrations lower than the detection limit .
Although there are no safety standards for perchlorate in food , EPA has been working for more than a decade toward establishing a safe drinking water standard .
In 2002 , EPA proposed a reference dose for perchlorate of 0.00003 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day , which is the dose at which no adverse effect would be expected . [ 1 ]
Based on an average adult body weight of 70 kilograms , and not counting exposures from food , EPA calculated that a safe level for perchlorate in drinking water is 1 ppb , or 1 microgram of perchlorate per liter of water .
Provisional Standard 10 x Too High
The provisional RfD indicates the latest and best assessment of a chemical ’s safe consumption level .
A final , enforceable drinking water standard could be higher or lower than the proposed RfD. Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - CA , has introduced legislation requiring EPA to set an enforceable drinking water standard by July 1 , 2004 , but the agency says it ca n’t meet that deadline .
To provide the margin of safety needed to protect the most sensitive populations , EWG has urged the EPA to set a safety standard of 0.1 ppb , or one - tenth the provisional RfD . [ 2 ]
EWG analysis shows that a one - cup ( two - ounce ) serving of the contaminated lettuce samples would contain , on average , 4 micrograms of perchlorate .
This is four times what the EPA says is safe to drink in a liter of water .
The most contaminated sample contained 7 micrograms of perchlorate per one - cup serving .
But women ’s eating habits vary greatly — some eat very little lettuce ; others may eat a large salad twice a day .
Women ’s body weights also vary .
These variances have important implications for risk analysis because they show that some women can have much higher exposures to perchlorate than others .
To better assess the health risks of perchlorate in lettuce , EWG analyzed USDA ’s 1994 - 1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals database , which monitors the food consumption of thousands of ordinary Americans . [ 7 ]
The database contained information on 2,453 women of childbearing age ( 15 to 44 ) who measured their lettuce consumption over two days .
One - fourth of the women ate lettuce on a given day , with 2 ounces the typical serving .
But some ate up to 10 times as much in a given day .
No differences were found in lettuce consumption by women who were pregnant or breastfeeding , compared to others of child - bearing age .
Using this consumption data and adjusting for body weight , EWG calculated the percentage of women who would exceed EPA ’s provisional RfD under different scenarios .
If the lettuce eaten contained the average amount of perchlorate found in the contaminated samples , 57 percent of the women would get a dose higher than the RfD , and 37 percent would get at least twice as much .
If the woman with the highest lettuce consumption in the USDA database ate lettuce with the highest amount of perchlorate in our samples , she would get a dose that is 44 times the provisional RfD , based on her body weight .
One - fourth of women in the USDA database ate lettuce on a given day and 18 percent of the winter lettuce samples tested had measurable levels of perchlorate .
From those values , EWG estimates that more than 2.8 million American women of childbearing age eat perchlorate - contaminated lettuce daily during the winter months .
Approximately 1.6 million of these women get a daily dose of perchlorate greater than the EPA ’s proposed reference dose , and more than 1 million of them get a daily dose at least twice the RfD .
Health Risks for Children and Adults
Women of child - bearing age are the most important population to consider when assessing the risks of perchlorate consumption because the developing fetus is much more susceptible to injury from perchlorate exposure than adults .
Perchlorate interferes with normal thyroid function by blocking iodide uptake , a necessary building block of thyroid hormones , and can lead to hypothyroidism .
In adults , hypothyroidism is associated with a variety of adverse symptoms such as fatigue , depression , anxiety , unexplained weight gain , hair loss and low libido . [ 2 ]
Although these symptoms can be serious , especially if left untreated , the consequences of depressed thyroid hormone levels on developing fetuses and infants can be devastating :
In a developing fetus or infant , even temporary disruption of thyroid hormones can lead to permanent defects in the developing organism . [ 1 ]
Numerous studies on laboratory animals have shown that perchlorate affects the developing fetus at much lower levels than it affects exposed adults . [ 8,9 ]
Unlike adults , infants and fetuses do not have large stores of thyroid hormones which would enable them to buffer changes in iodide availability and thyroid hormone levels in the body . [ 10 ]
Moreover , recent research has shown how remarkably sensitive the developing fetus can be to small disturbances in thyroid hormone level .
One study found that women whose levels of a particular thyroid hormone measured in the lowest 10 percent of the population during the first trimester of pregnancy were more than 2.5 times as likely to have a child with an IQ of less than 85 and five times as likely to have a child with an IQ of less than 70 .
This was true whether or not these women were clinically hypothyroid , and many women in this group had thyroid hormone levels considered to be in the normal range . [ 11 ]
This is important because it means that perchlorate does not have to alter women ’s thyroid hormone levels dramatically to have critical effects .
There is also evidence to suggest that perchlorate can have effects even at low doses .
An epidemiological study of newborns in Arizona , for example , found that babies born to mothers who drank contaminated Colorado River water during pregnancy had significantly different thyroid hormone levels than infants of mothers who drank uncontaminated water . [ 12 ]
An epidemiological study of thousands of California infants born in 1996 had similar findings , with significant differences in infant thyroid hormone levels of infants whose mothers drank water contaminated with perchlorate levels at just 1 to 2 ppb . [ 13 ]
Nationwide implications
Localized Contamination , Nationwide Implications
Until now , contamination of drinking water supplies with perchlorate has been considered largely a regional concern — most serious in California , Arizona and Nevada , with hot spots in dozens of other states .
But finding rocket fuel in grocery store lettuce means consumers across America are unknowingly getting doses of perchlorate equal to the levels in some drinking water supplies .
Lettuce is the second - most consumed vegetable in the U.S.
The average American consumed 33 pounds of lettuce in 2000 , and the Imperial - Yuma crop accounted for 40 percent of year - round production . [ 14 ]
Decades of neglect at the now - abandoned perchlorate manufacturing facility near Las Vegas , formerly operated by Kerr - McGee of Oklahoma City , have polluted Lake Mead and the Colorado River with perchlorate at levels that typically range between 4 and 16 ppb . [ 1 ]
But concentrations vary widely , depending on rainfall , the time of year , and how well the Kerr McGee facility 's treatment system is working .
From 1997 to 2000 , for instance , the average perchlorate level in Lake Mead was 9 ppb , but reached 24 ppb in November 2000 , and was measuring 14 ppb in January 2003 . [ 15 ]
Although perchlorate levels in the river tend to decrease farther from the Kerr - McGee site , testing near irrigation intakes near Yuma — more than 250 miles downstream — have found perchlorate concentrations ranging from 3 to 6 ppb . [ 1 ]
Water from the Colorado River irrigates more than 1.4 million acres of cropland in California and Arizona . [ 16 ]
It is unlikely that lettuce is the only crop that takes up and concentrates perchlorate , but lettuce is of particular concern because its cultivation uses so much water , the edible portions have a high water content , and so much of the nation ’s lettuce is grown with contaminated water .
In 2001 , almost 70,000 acres in Yuma County and more than 22,000 acres in Imperial County were planted with lettuce . [ 17,18 ]
At the peak of production last winter , 374 truck loads of lettuce were shipped each day from Yuma and Imperial Counties . [ 5 ]
Because we purchased lettuce from grocery stores rather than picking it from specific fields , for most of the 22 samples little is known about where the crops were grown .
However , given the perishability of lettuce ( about a week ) and the time of year the samples were purchased ( January and February ) , it is highly likely that most if not all of the samples were grown in Yuma or Imperial County .
Eighty - eight percent of the winter lettuce eaten in the U.S. ( i.e. , grown from December to March ) is grown in these two counties . [ 5 ]
Lettuce Concentrates the Perchlorate in Water
If the irrigation water was contaminated with 3 to 6 ppb of perchlorate , as measured near irrigation gates in Yuma County , the levels detected in the samples would mean the lettuce concentrated the chemical by a factor of 5 x to 40 x .
More research is urgently needed to answer this and other questions about the prevalence of perchlorate in the American food supply .
Unfortunately , the Colorado River is not the only source of agricultural water that is polluted with perchlorate .
Looking only at commercially harvested lettuce , USDA data show that perchlorate contamination of water or soil is known or suspected in 10 of the 15 leading lettuce - producing counties in the U.S. [ 19 ] ( Table B. )
For example , in late 2002 , a perchlorate plume from an abandoned highway flare factory was discovered in the San Martin area of Santa Clara County , Calif. , contaminating almost 300 public and private wells . [ 20 ]
Santa Clara is the 15th - ranking lettuce - producing county in the nation , with more than 1,200 acres commercially harvested in 1997 .
All but two of the top lettuce - producing counties are in California , where perchlorate contamination has been most widely documented .
Table B. Perchlorate contamination of water or soil is a known or suspected problem in 10 of the 15 top lettuce - growing counties in the U.S .

( b) Known perchlorate user , contamination status unknown
( c) Suspected perchlorate handler , contamination status unknown .

The EPA says there are sites of known perchlorate use in more than 40 states — but the exact number of states is unknown , as some military locations are confidential [ 21 ] — and has stated that sampling is expected to confirm contamination at every site where perchlorate is or has been produced , handled or used . [ 46 ]
So far , nationwide sampling has been spotty and in some states not a single sample has been taken , including many locations where perchlorate contamination is likely . [ 3 ]
It is therefore possible that there are other regionally or nationally important farming regions unknowingly relying on perchlorate - contaminated water .
EWG tests confirm research
EWG ’s study was the first to test produce from grocery store shelves .
Although the findings are unsettling , they were not unexpected : Previous research on perchlorate uptake by vegetation clearly indicates the potential for widespread contamination of lettuce and other crops .
The first known tests of field - grown vegetables were conducted in 1997 by Lucky Farms of San Bernardino , Calif. , after the grower learned that its wells had been polluted with perchlorate from a former Lockheed Martin rocket - testing facility .
This plume of Lockheed rocket fuel has polluted dozens of drinking water sources in San Bernardino County , and the five wells on Lucky Farms property have concentrations of perchlorate ranging from 20 to 130 ppb , averaging 40.1 ppb . [ 4 ]
Lucky Farms tested eight samples of otherwise unidentified “ leafy vegetables ” and “ vegetable matter . ”
Four samples of " leafy vegetables " averaged 4,490 micrograms of perchlorate per kilogram ( ug/ kg , which is essentially equivalent to ppb ) , with a maximum concentration of 6,900 ug / kg .
Perchlorate levels in the “ vegetable matter ” were lower , averaging 213 ug / kg with a high of 420 ug / kg .
Overall , the vegetables were found to have an average of more than 2,600 micrograms per kilogram — thousands of times higher than the 1 ppb EPA considers to be safe in a liter of water . [ 4 ]
Because we do n’t know which wells were used to irrigate which Lucky Farms samples , it is difficult to calculate exactly how much each of the tested vegetables concentrated perchlorate , but using average figures for the amount of perchlorate found in the wells and the vegetables , EWG analysis shows that the vegetables concentrated perchlorate by a factor of 65 x .
This means that perchlorate levels in the vegetables were on average 65 times higher than the levels in the water .
This information came from documents that were subpoenaed in a lawsuit against Lockheed Martin by 800 San Bernardino - area residents who say drinking perchlorate - contaminated water caused a variety of illnesses , including thyroid cancer . [ 4 ]
Tribes Raised Concerns Earlier
However , as long ago as 1998 , Native American tribes , who are among the major producers of Colorado River lettuce , were raising serious questions posed by the recently discovered contamination of the Colorado River .
At a public forum in Henderson , Nev. , the environmental manager for the Yuma , Ariz. , Quechan tribe stated :
“ Irrigation is a way of life for our people .
We have 13,000 acres dedicated to the production of lettuce .
We produce annually eight heads of lettuce for every man , woman and child [ in the U.S. ] .
That food is produced from Colorado River water and 23 million people derive their water supply from the lower Colorado River in three states and two countries .
That ’s how big this problem is . ” [ 22 ]
The tribes urged the government to conduct a study of crops grown with Colorado River water and examine their perchlorate concentration .
At an “ eco-summit ” convened by the EPA in April 1999 , this type of “ market basket ” study was given top priority . [ 23 ]
The attendees included the Air Force , major perchlorate manufacturers and users ( including Lockheed Martin ) and five Indian tribes who produce winter vegetables irrigated by the Colorado River .
Unfortunately , although the Department of Defense pledged $ 650,000 to fund this and other studies , and EPA , USDA and the Food and Drug Administration developed an extensive protocol for the study , and neither this nor any other “ real world ” study was ever conducted .
Defense Department representatives later stated that they had postponed the study indefinitely because it was too expensive . [ 4 ]
The Defense Department did fund a set of studies on hydroponically - grown greenhouse lettuce seedlings .
The first study , conducted in 1999 by the EPA ’s National Exposure Research Lab , found that “ perchlorate was accumulated in the leaves to significant levels ” — factors of 100 x or more . [ 24 ]
This extraordinarily high rate of bioaccumulation would mean that lettuce grown in water with even low levels of perchlorate could deliver large doses of the toxin to consumers — doses far higher than the EPA ’s provisional drinking water standard .
Yet the EPA discounted the results of the 1999 study because the water used was contaminated with concentrations of perchlorate much higher than are typically found in water supplies , the lettuce seedlings were harvested before maturity , and the seedlings were grown in greenhouses rather than typical field conditions .
A second , longer greenhouse study was later conducted , but aside from a brief summary that indicates an “ accumulation of perchlorate into the green tissue , ” results have never been made public . [ 1 ]
In October 2002 , at a perchlorate conference in Ontario , Calif. , when a Department of Defense spokesperson was asked publicly when the data would be released , he replied : “ Someone walked away with the data . ” EPA officials have since indicated that they plan to release the results within the next few months . [ 4 ]
Perchlorate in Other Plants and in Fertilizer
Additional studies have also pointed to the potential for crop uptake of perchlorate when contaminated fertilizer or irrigation water is used .
Several lab studies , for example , have found that a variety of non-crop plants can concentrate perchlorate , with a wide range of concentration factors — from 7.5 x to 25 x in one study , from 0 to 330 x another , and from 30 to 10,000 in yet another . [ 1 , 25 - 27 ]
Additional studies examining the potential of different kinds of plants to bioremediate contaminated areas also found perchlorate accumulation in vegetation , with some species taking up 95 percent of the perchlorate in the irrigation water . [ 29 - 31 ]
All of these studies have found that perchlorate tends to accumulate in the leaves of plants rather than the stems or roots , an important finding for the safety of vegetable crops .
Moreover , recent greenhouse experiments at Texas Tech University have also demonstrated that not only lettuce plants , but other crop plants such as cucumbers , alfalfa and soybeans * can quickly take up and concentrate perchlorate to high levels when grown with contaminated water . [ 27 ]
These findings , as well as another study which found perchlorate in blackberries growing in a contaminated area in Texas , are particularly important .
They indicate that although lettuce has been of greatest concern with regards to perchlorate contamination of food plants , the problem is potentially much larger . [ 27 ]
[ * Perchlorate was found in several parts of the soybean plant , but not in the soybean seeds themselves . ]
The recent experiments on crop plants have also yielded several important insights : Nitrogen levels in the soil affected the rate of perchlorate uptake but not the final concentration ; plants grown for in sand dosed with perchlorate during both the first and fourth week of growth continued to take up perchlorate during all eight weeks of the experiment ; and perchlorate concentrations in vegetation were found to decrease with washing . [ 27 ]
Further research at Texas
Tech is under way to examine how multiple generations of rodents exposed to perchlorate - contaminated food may be affected — including survival and reproduction , thyroid structure and thyroid hormone levels — but no data are yet available . [ 32 ]
Studies of perchlorate accumulation are not just limited to controlled laboratory experiments .
Researchers have found high levels of perchlorate in plants and animals living in contaminated areas such as the Alleghany Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia , the Long Horn Army Ammunition Plant in Texas , the McGregor Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve plant in Texas — not far from President Bush ’s ranch — and the Lake Mead Recreation Site in Nevada .
Species with documented perchlorate concentration include blackberries , salt cedar , crabgrass , goldenrod , crickets , as well as fish , mice , rats , raccoons , birds and frogs . [ 27 , 32 -35 ]
These field studies have found concentration factors in vegetation ranging from 1.5 x to 80 x . [ 1 ]
High levels of perchlorate have also been found in the leaves of field - grown tobacco plants where Chilean saltpeter , which is used as a nitrogen source and is naturally high in perchlorate , had been added to the soil . [ 1 , 36 ]
The concentration factors in this study exceeded 40 x .
Chilean saltpeter is preferred by farmers for growing tobacco in many regions , and EPA researchers have found perchlorate in six of seven brands of cigarettes , cigars and chewing tobacco tested . [ 36 , 37 ]
Citrus farmers , at least in some regions of the country , are also known to prefer Chilean saltpeter fertilizer , but so far no studies have been conducted on citrus juice . [ 1 , 32 ]
Overall , however , contaminated fertilizer is not considered to be a major source for perchlorate in the environment or in food crops .
Chilean fertilizer , the only known source of perchlorate in fertilizer , currently makes up only 0.1 percent of the U.S. fertilizer market . [ 1 ]
Furthermore , the company that distributes Chilean saltpeter has made processing modifications to decrease the concentration of perchlorate in the final product sold .
After much study , there is now “ a consensus among researchers from the EPA , the fertilizer industry , and other federal and state laboratories that currently used fertilizers are negligible contributors to environmental perchlorate contamination . ” [ 1 ]
The studies that have been done on perchlorate uptake from fertilizer are significant , however , because they provide more evidence that plants can take up and concentrate perchlorate — wherever it might be coming from .
EPA : “ No Question That Plants Absorb Perchlorate ”
In its 2002 report documenting the provisional RfD of 1 ppb in drinking water , EPA reviewed the numerous studies on plant uptake of perchlorate and concluded : “ There can be no question that at least some vascular plants absorb perchlorate from their local environments . ” [ 1 ]
This is important because the agency ’s policy in setting drinking water standards is that , once an RfD is established , “ any burden posed by exposure routes other than potable water necessarily requires that the contaminant ’s concentration in a water supply be lowered by an equivalent amount . ” [ 1 ]
In other words , if food is found to contain perchlorate , the drinking water safety standard must be set lower to account for this additional exposure .
Yet despite knowing that the Colorado River is a major source of irrigation water , despite the clear evidence that plants take up and concentrate perchlorate , and despite the lack of data on how much perchlorate might be in U.S. or imported produce , the EPA concluded that “ the available information . . . suggests that foods do not contribute to the body burden . ” [ 1 ]
The California EPA ’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ( OEHHA ) , which is working towards a state drinking water standard for perchlorate , did consider perchlorate exposure through food in its March 2002 proposed public health goal ( PHG ) . [ 38 ]
OEHHA assumed that 60 percent of perchlorate exposure was coming from water and 40 percent was coming from food .
Yet under intense pressure from the chemical and defense industries , the state ’s scientists retreated :
In a revised PHG draft released in January 2003 , OEHHA assumes that only 20 percent of a pregnant woman ’s perchlorate exposure comes from food . [ 39 ]
Although EWG ’s tests of grocery store lettuce do not constitute a definitive study and further research is needed , the results clearly show that food is an important exposure pathway for perchlorate .
All future drinking water standards must adequately reflect this fact .

Growing up in Ireland , the comedian saw England as a strange and foreign place .
So what does he think of the English now that he lives here ?
Mexico is trying to break the influence of the powerful cartel
By Stephen Gibbs
BBC News , Mexico City
They decapitate , torture , and extort .
Then they pray , and donate to charity .
The " Familia " cartel is perhaps the most extreme example of the paradoxical enemy which Mexico faces as it tries to defeat organised crime .
It is a fight which would be much easier if the cartels were simply maverick gangs on the fringe of society .
But they are , in many areas , part of society .
" La Familia was originally a social structure .
And in many ways it still is , " says a former Mexico deputy attorney general and organised crime expert , Prof Samuel Gonzalez Ruiz .
The group is believed to have originated in the 1980s as a loose self - protecting coalition between marijuana and opium farmers in the state of Michoacan .
By the 1990s the farmers , who had formed an alliance with the neighbouring Gulf cartel , were running a profitable smuggling business .
Like other Mexican drug cartels , they were benefitting from the massive , successful , clampdown on drug trafficking led by the US authorities across the Caribbean .
The strategy pushed the flow of drugs west , into Mexican territory .
Quasi-religious La Familia found itself in control of key entry points for cocaine on Mexico's Pacific coast .
La Familia is blamed for many attacks and murders in Michaocan
The leaders of the organisation did not waste the opportunity .
They embarked on a major expansion and diversification programme .
They invested in the production of the synthetic drug methamphetamine in the state .
They took over the local pirate DVD business , and set up a brutal debt collection service .
Research by Prof Gonzalez 's team suggests that 85 % of the legitimate businesses in Michoacan now have some link with La Familia , or with its money .
Income from the group is understood to have funded schools , drainage projects , even churches .
One curious feature of the organisation is that , according to Mexican intelligence documents , it strongly discourages its members from consuming alcohol or drugs , and has a quasi- religious ideology .
The group 's alleged spiritual leader , Nazario Moreno Gonzalez , also known as " El Mas Loco " , or " the maddest one " is understood to have published and distributed his own bible , based on the macho Christian writing of contemporary American author John Eldredge .
" It is clearly an organisational tool , " says anthropologist and analyst Dr Elio Masferrer , of the group 's religious faith .
" It does not matter whether or not the leaders believe in it " .
Notes , signed by La Familia , are often left on the mutilated bodies of their rivals , indicating that they are victims of " divine justice " .
Political power Thousands of soldiers have been deployed to tackle the violence
The last three years have seen increasingly bold attempts by the cartel to intimidate its enemies .
In 2006 , five severed heads were thrown into a night club in the town of Uruapan .
A letter accompanying the heads declared : " only those who deserve to die will die . "
In 2008 , a grenade was thrown into a crowd celebrating Independence Day in Morelia , the state capital .
And earlier this year , in apparent revenge for the arrest of one of the cartel 's leaders , 12 federal police officers were captured , tortured and murdered .
That prompted an all - out assault by the Mexican government .
President Felipe Calderon despatched thousands of additional troops and police to Michoacan , which happens to be his home state .
" Drug trafficking is a symptom of a far deeper sickness in this country
Prof Gonzalez
The government also says it has evidence that La Familia has been using its economic power to buy political power .
In May , federal authorities arrested 10 mayors and 20 other local officials in Michoacan , alleging they had sold favours to La Familia .
The latest arrests in the United States confirm what Mexico has long been warning the US authorities : that the drugs which pour across the border every day bring organised crime with them .
But some believe that particular weaknesses within Mexico have made it especially vulnerable to cartels .
Pervasive unemployment , corruption within law enforcement and huge divisions between rich and poor are the perfect territory in which groups like La Familia can flourish .
" Drug trafficking , " says Prof Gonzalez , " is a symptom of a far deeper sickness in this country " .

This picture was taken by Frank Fournier in Columbia on Saturday 16 November 1985 , a few days after the eruption of the Nevado Del Ruiz volcano .
The landslide provoked by the eruption had already killed 24,000 people as the local authorities had taken no preventive measures despite the warnings of vulcanologists .
In this natural catastrophe , the young Omayra Sánchez was caught in the town of Armero in debris transported by the mud .
For two full days and three nights , rescue workers tried to free her with the whole world following her ordeal on TV or in the papers .
The crane and the hydraulic pump that were needed to clear the debris did n’t arrive in time .
Omarya ’s hips had been injured by metal bars and her legs were trapped .
She was exhausted and despite her impressive faith and calm , she died of a heart attack on 16 November .
Fournier himself won the World Press Photo prize in 1986 for this portrait–which reflected his own feeling of powerlessness .
Omayra ’s agonizing demise , surrounded by journalists and photographers , was followed live on television all over the world , and started a major controversy : in such a situation , would n’t it have been better to offer help rather than to take pictures ?
Is it possible to show the suffering of others without violating their right to have their privacy respected ?
For the photographers , it is of the utmost importance that the public be informed .
For others , broadcasting the drama of Omarya ’s death was obscene .

You can tell that an anti-spam tool is becoming too effective when spammers start trying to work around it .
Such is the case with Spam URL Blacklists ( SURBLs ) , which list domains advertised via spam .
Spamfilters will intercept emails that mention blacklisted domains used in clickable links .
The spammers can use fake sender addresses and send email from cracked hosts and cracked third party mail accounts , but they still get caught as soon as they mention their websites .
This hurts spammers because they only make money when people go to their websites and hand over their credit card details to order fake Rolexes , pills , porn , etc .
To get around this , spammers have been using pages created at free webhosting services and other third party sites where content can be uploaded .
The links only mention the free hosting site , which then redirects to the final spam site .
One service abused for this is Google Groups .
Other services recently seen used are Google Docs , Microsoft Spaces Live and Geocities .
In the case of Google Groups the spammers create mailing lists and upload a spam link to the home page of the new group .
They never use the groups for their intended purpose , i.e. mailing lists .
This effectively makes it impossible to report the abuse via Google ’s abuse handling procedures :
Any archived posting or uploaded document on the Google Groups service has an abuse reporting link , but the home page of the group itself does not !
Obviously , Google never envisaged that spammers would create groups only to have one page of web content that can be advertised via spam .
Here is an example of a spam :

There 's something about dual - screen gadgets that makes any geek warm and fuzzy inside .
Take , for instance , the latest announcement from Asus : they 're planning to release an e-book reader with two distinguishing characteristics : two screens , and low price .
Adding another screen to an e-reader makes perfect sense on paper ; after all , who does n't want to be able to read an e-book the way you read a real book , with two pages visible at all times ?
In practice , I 'm not so sure ; personally I 've always preferred a single page view in all the applications ( various comic readers , Adobe Acrobat , etc ) that offered me the choice .
But who cares - if you do n't like the double page view , you can just use the extra screen real estate for something else : browsing the web , tweeting , updating your blog ; the possibilities are endless .
Asus ' e-reader , which will also fall under the company 's successful Eee line of products , will probably cost around £ 100 ( $ 163 ) , which would make it one of the cheapest such devices on the market .
However , it 's possible that we 'll see several versions ( just try to count all the versions of the Eee netbook , and you 'll get the general idea about Asus ' strategy when it comes to these things ) , with the more expensive version of the device adding support for 3G and more storage .
With the e-book wars heating up , we 're really excited to see a device that innovates in this space while keeping a reasonable price ; according to Engadget , we could see one on the market soon , before the year 's end .
Seen from our planet , the view of Saturn ’s rings during its equinox is extremely foreshortened and limited .
But in orbit around Saturn , Cassini had no such problems in Aug. 2009 .
In this mosaic of images taken on Aug. 12 , the shadows of the planet 's expansive rings are compressed into a single , narrow band cast onto the planet .
Stunningnew views of Saturn from a NASA spacecraft have revealed odd formations in theplanet 's trademark rings , including ripples as tall as the Rocky Mountains .
The newimages taken by NASA ?s Cassini spacecraft show that Saturn ?s icy rings - once thought to be relatively thin - can be miles thick in some points andinclude weird , bright streaks from clouds kicked up by the cosmic clash betweenring particles and interloping space debris .
" It 'slike putting on 3 - D glasses and seeing the third dimension for the firsttime , " said Bob Pappalardo , Cassini 's project scientist at NASA 's JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , in a statement .
" This is amongthe most important events Cassinihas shown us . "
Cassinirecorded the new images of Saturn in the week surrounding the planet ?s
Aug. 11 equinox , a time when its bright bands of rings are edgeon to the sun and nearly invisible as seen from Earth .
The raresight only occurs twice during Saturn ?s long orbit , which takes nearly 30 yearsto complete .
Earth also has two equinoxes a year ( vernal and autumnal ) , withthe autumnal equinox to occur Tuesday .
Saturn ? srings are made up of individual chunks of ice that reach out nearly 85,000 miles ( 140,000 km ) from the center of the planet .
In some spots they are only 30 feet ( about 10 meters ) thick , while others can reach towering heights , thenew images revealed .
The unique lighting conditions brought on by Saturn ? sequinox and the sun illuminated the odd ripples and bumps among the planet ?
srings , which Cassini spied with its camera eyes .
The staggering heights of someformations could be discerned by the shadows they cast , researchers said .
" Wethought the plane of the rings was no taller than two stories of a modern - daybuilding and instead we 've come across walls more than 2 miles [ 3 kilometers ] high , " said Cassini imaging team leader Carolyn Porco at the Space ScienceInstitute in Boulder , Colo .
" Is n't that the most outrageous thing you couldimagine ?
It truly is like something out of science fiction . "
One ripplerises nearly 2 1/2 miles ( 4 km ) above the plane of Saturn ?s rings .
The big blipis caused by the gravitational tug of the planet ?s moon Daphnis .
It is thehighest peak among the rings , mission managers said .
Scientistsestimate that there are about 35 trillion - trillion tons of ice , dust and rock locked upin Saturn ?s rings .
Cassini has been studying Saturn and its rings since it arrivedat the planet in 2004 and is currently in the middle of an extended missionto observe the gas giant ?s equinox period .
" Tounderstand what we are seeing will take more time , but the images and data willhelp develop a more complete understanding of how old the rings might be andhow they are evolving , " said Linda Spilker , Cassini ?s deputy projectscientist at JPL .
Introduction
As many before me have done and many after will no doubt attempt , installing Mac OS X on a non-Apple piece of hardware is often a challenge where I suspect more fail then succeed .
I personally have successfully achieved this more than once and have sought to document the process that I succeeded with in as much detail as possible so that those attempting this can also succeed and hopefully contribute to this article by sharing their experiences .
This guide is all about getting Mac OS X onto your Acer Aspire One netbook ( but could be used for many different netbooks potentially ) .
I ’m using the A150L model which has 1GB RAM and a 120 GB hard disk but any of the Aspire Ones should work perfectly without deviating from any steps in this guide .
In this guide I ’m installing from an 8 GB thumb drive but you could use an external DVD drive and boot from DVD instead .
I will document this guide with as many screenshots and as much detail as possible and perhaps even a screenshow or two for the really tricky parts .
If you run into problems , there ’s a massive community out there willing to provide suggestions or alternatives so just leave a comment and see how it goes !
And finally before you get going , good luck and hopefully in and hour or so you ’ll have a ( practically ) fully functional Hackintosh !
What You ’ll Need / Required Downloads
OK , here ’s your shopping list .
Hopefully you ’ve already got most if not all of the hardware and just need to download the software .
1 x Acer Aspire
One or your choice of Intel / AMD SSE2 hardware
You ’re gonna wipe the drive on this baby so make sure there ’s nothing you want to keep on it ’s hard drive
We can however preserve the restore partition during this procedure so you can restore the AA1 to it ’s original Windows or Linux preload if you like .
1 x USB Thumb Drive ( minimum 8GB )
1 x working MAC to create the bootable thumb drive
It ’s also possible to create the bootable thumb drive using Windows but I have n’t documented that yet !
1 x blank DVD ( optional )
This is only required if : you have problems creating the USB Thumb drive and receive errors when Restoring the iDeneb ISO file to the thumb drive or you would prefer to boot the Acer netbook using a DVD and an external USB DVD drive
1 x DVD burner ( optional )
If you need the blank DVD as above then I ’m assuming you also have the DVD burner , right ?
1 x ISO File iDeneb v1.1 10.5.4 – Universal for Intel / AMD with support for SSE2 I cannot provide you with a download link for obvious reasons but you should n’t have much problem finding it .
( Googling would be a good start . )
When you ’re downloading this save it to your Mac ’s Desktop so we can get to it easily when required
Chameleon Bootloader Download here
Diablo ’s iDeneb 1.4 Tools Download here

Stage 1 – Creating Bootable Thumb Drive
Pre-requisites For This Stage
ISO file downloaded and on the desktop
Working MAC booted up and at the desktop
USB Thumbdrive inserted
Chameleon Bootloader downloaded and extracted to a folder on your Desktop
PC_EFI V10.1 Bootloader download and on your Desktop
Extra.zip downloaded and Extra folder extracted to your Desktop
Steps For This Stage
Warning :
You are following these steps at your own risk .
You can and possibly will destroy all data on the netbook at some point in this install so back it up if it contains valuable files !
Step 1 – Partition The USB Thumb Drive
Open Disk Utility Click Go > Utilities > Disk Utility
On the left side , select your USB Thumb Drive Click the Partition tab on the right Under Volume Scheme select 1 Partition Click Options button Select Master Boot Record > Click OK
On the right , enter a name for your Volume – I ’m using MacBoot In the Format drop down field select Mac OS Extended Click Apply button When asked Are You Sure ? , click the Partition button if you are sure .
Step 2 – Restore The ISO File To The USB Thumb Drive
Still in Disk Utility , click the Images menu and then click Scan Images For Restore …
Browse to where you saved your ISO file ( mine ’s on the Desktop ) , select it and click Scan
At this point , one of two things will happen :
Your scan will be successful in which case you can proceed below when it ’s complete
OR
You will get an error message saying Unable to scan “ filename.iso . ” ( Invalid Argument ) .
If you get this error message then skip down to the Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page .
When you scan is complete , highlight your newly created partition on your thumb drive on the left hand side of Disk Utility Click the Restore tab on the right Drag your thumb drive partition from the left side ( mines called MacBoot ) into the Destination field on the right Drag your ISO file from the Desktop ( or browse for it if you prefer by clicking the Image button ) into the Source field on the right side Select Erase Destination checkbox Click Restore and Restore again
At this point , one of two things will happen
Your Restore process will chug away happily for a little while ( enough time to get a coffee , believe me ) and you can continue with the steps when it ’s finished
OR
You will receive an error message such as : Restore Failure .
Could not find any scan information …
If you get this error message then skip down to the Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page .
Step 3 – Make The Thumb Drive Bootable
If you have n’t already done , close Disk Utility but leave your Thumb Drive inserted Open Terminal .
You can find this in Applications > Utilities
Type diskutil list and press enter .
You will see something similar to image below .
Take a note of the number of the disk under the IDENTIFIER column as circled in red below .
As you can see , mine is 1 ( One ) ( i.e disk1 and disk1s1 )
Now you need to change directory into the i386 directory which is inside the Chameleon directory that you extracted to your Desktop .
You can do this by issuing the cdcommand and typing the remainder of the path which would be something like : cd / Users / your_username/Desktop/Chameleon-2.0-RC2-r640-bin/i386
Tip !
A quick and easy way to do this in Mac OS X is to type cd and then simply drag the i386 folder ( yes using your mouse ) right into the Terminal window and releasing the mouse button .
It will fill in the correct path for you .
Is n’t Mac wonderful 🙂

Stage 4 – Wireless ( WiFi ) Card
Overview
As far as I can tell , this is a lottery and depends what Wireless card you got with your model of Acer Aspire One .
My Acer Aspire
One is the AOA150 - AW and it comes with the Atheros AR5BXB6 and it does NOT work no matter what I do .
So , this stage will document the steps you need to take to replace the wireless card with a reliable , known compatible card for Mac OS X .
Believe me , this will save you hours of wasted time , frustration and heartache and for a meagre few dollars .
You can get a reliable Mac OS X compatible card on eBay very cheaply !
Prerequisites for this Stage
Do some homework ( i.e. googling ) and find a card that will be reliable and stable in your netbook .
A good place to start is by checking the HCL on osx86 project .
Here ’s the link : Hardware Compatibility List .
If you were to ask me what card I recommend , I would choose the BCM94321MC by Broadcom .
This Wireless card is shipped by Apple in some of their Mac Pro’s and is the one I use and it has never let me down once and required zero effort to install .
Literally plug n’ play ( oh how MS does that sound ! )
When you have found your card of choice , ordered it and opened the box you now need to get under your Acer Aspire One ’s hood and replace the card .
Here ’s the instructions :
Steps for this Stage
Turn your Acer Aspire
One upside down and lay flat on a solid surface Remove the battery Under the battery , remove the three small screws Carefully peel back the two black rubber feet to the left and right of the battery area
Remove the screws that are under the black rubber feet Remove the three screws at the opposite side of the case i.e. towards the front of the machine Flip the AA1 back over and open the screen
There are three plastic tabs at the top of the keyboard – Above the F2 , F8 and Pause / Break keys .
Carefully , push these tabs inward with something small and pointy and at the same time gently lever the keyboard upwards by getting under the Esc key .
Once you raised the keyboard enough to get under it properly , gently go around the edges and release the whole thing .
Be careful not to lift it too far as there is a ribbon cable beneath it connecting it to the netbook ’s motherboard .
Once the keyboard released , lift the small black tab on the ribbon cable connector .
Release the ribbon cable .
Set the keyboard aside .
Release the small black tab on the tiny ribbon cable connecting the mouse pad .
Remove 6 screws .
2 on the left , 2 towards the middle and 2 on the right .
Once removed , you need to gently leaver the main casing off .
I did this by getting my finger under the left corner and working my way around .
Once removed , the wireless card is at ooo 6 o’clock - ish … it ’s the little card with two wires stuck onto it and it has one screw .
Remove the screw and disconnect the two wires .
They should just pop off easily .
Now reverse all steps to install the new card you have .
Stage 5 – Card Reader ( SD Only )
Pre-requisites For This Stage
IOSDHCIBlockDevice.kext.zip downloaded and extracted to your Desktop
Steps For This Stage
Open Finder and browse to / System / Library / Extensions Locate the file IOSDHCIBlockDevice .kext and move it to the trash ( enter password if requested )
Now drag the file IOSDHCIBlockDevice .
kext ( the one you downloaded from above ) from your Desktop into the / System / Library / Extensions folder Click Authenticate ( if asked )
Enter your password ( if asked ) Click Applications > Terminal
Enter the following and press enter : sudo chown - R root : wheel / System / Library / Extensions / IOSDHCIBlockDevice.kext

Troubleshooting
Disk Utility Error Message – “ Unable to scan “ filename.iso ” ( Invalid argument ) ”
If you receive this error then try creating a DVD from the ISO image that you are trying to scan .
You can do this by clicking the Burn button at the top of Disk Utility , inserting a blank DVD , selecting your ISO file from the Desktop ( or wherever you have it ) and clicking Burn .
This will create a DVD version of your ISO file .
This DVD will be bootable and if you have an external DVD drive you may plug it into the Acer Aspire and forget about the thumb drive .
Alternatively , if you want to continue with the Thumb Drive option then finish burning your DVD , go back up to Step 2 above ( Restore procedure ) and instead of dragging your ISO file in to the Source field , drag the DVD drive from the left side and continue the rest of the steps .
If it still does n’t work then create a new ISO File from the DVD you just made by clicking the New Image button in Disk Utility and then when that ’s created drag this new ISO File into the Source field instead during the Restore procedure .
Disk Utility Error Message – Restore Failure .
Could not find any scan information .
The source image needs to be imagescanned before it can be restored .
If you receive the above message it means you need to scan your ISO or DMG file before performing the Restore procedure .
You can do this by clicking the Images menu , clicking Scan Image for Restore … , select the image click Scan .
When it ’s finished , try the Restore procedure again .
The 327 - foot - tall Ares I - X rocket sits perched atop Launch Pad 39B at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for an Oct. 27 , 2009 test flight , but it 's not the tallest structure there .
On either side of the pad are 100 - foot fiberglass lightning masts mounted atop 500 - foot towers .
The rotating service structure , or RSS , was retracted from the rocket at midday on Oct. 22 .
NASA ’s new Ares I - X rocket may be the world ’s largest booster currently in service or about to fly , but it is no behemoth when compared to giant rockets of the past and , perhaps , the future .
The Ares I - X rocket is poised to launch on a suborbital test flight on Oct. 27 and rolled out to its launching pad earlier this week .
It stands about 327 feet ( 100 meters ) high — 14 stories taller than NASA ’s space shuttles — and is equivalent in height to its namesake Ares I .
The Ares I booster is designed to launch NASA 's Orion spacecraft slated to replace the shuttle fleet .
“ It gives you a sense of the scale of what NASA does that our flight test rocket is larger than any other rocket in the world , ” Ares I - X deputy mission manager Jon Cowart told SPACE.com .
But the Ares I - X and Ares I rockets are by no means the largest rockets ever built .
In fact , the Ares I - X is the third tallest rocket in history behind a pair of giant boosters built to launch astronauts and cosmonauts to the moon .
But there ’s one future booster that could — when built — steal the “ World ’s Largest ” title from the granddaddy rocket of them all , NASA ’s mighty Saturn V .
Here ’s a look at some of the largest rockets in human history :
NASA ’s Mighty Saturn V
The reigning champion of giant rockets is NASA ’s massive Saturn V , a three - stage booster used to launch American astronauts to moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Like the Ares I -X and NASA shuttles , the towering Saturn V launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
It stood 363 feet ( 110 meters ) high and remains the most powerful rocket ever built , even though the last one flew in 1973 .
The rocket could launch payloads of up to 45 tons to the moon , or 120 tons into Earth orbit .
It weighed 6.5 million pounds ( 3 million kg ) fully fueled at liftoff .
The Ares I - X weighs 1.8 million pounds ( 816,466 kg ) , slightly less than the full Ares I rocket .
That last Saturn V was a modified version that launched NASA ’s Skylab space station .
Smaller versions of the Saturn rocket were used to launch astronauts to Skylab , with the last one — a 224 - foot ( 68 - meter ) Saturn 1B — launching in 1975 to fly Apollo astronauts to meet a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft during the Apollo - Soyuz joint mission .
Ill - Fated N - 1
A close second in the giant rocket race is the former Soviet Union ’s N - 1 rocket , an enormous booster designed to launch cosmonauts to the moon during the Space Race with the United States .
The giant rocket stood nearly 345 feet ( 104 meters ) tall , had five distinct stages and resembled a huge , tapering cone that was about 55 feet ( 17 meters ) wide at the base .
During launch , it weighed 6.1 million pounds ( 2.7 million kg ) and was envisioned to launch payloads of up to 95 tons to space to send cosmonauts to the moon , according to the Russian space history Web site Russianspaceweb.com
But the N - 1 rocket never successfully reached space , despite four attempted launches .
It exploded during all four attempts between 1969 and 1972 .
The former Soviet Union did have other hefty rockets in its space launch inventory .
The enormous D - 1E and D - 1 variants of the Proton used for the 1968 lunar probe missions and 1971 Salyut 1 space station launch .
Neither came close to the N - 1 ’s towering stature .
Today , Russia still uses Proton rockets and smaller Soyuz boosters for to launch satellites into orbit , though cosmonauts continue ride only Soyuz rockets into orbit .
The country is also developing a new family of Angara rockets .
Delta 4 Heavy
Before the rollout of Ares I - X , the tallest rocket in service in the United States ' inventory was the Delta 4 Heavy , a heavy - lift version of the United Launch Alliance ’s Delta 4 booster .
Standing 235 feet ( 72 meters ) tall , the Delta 4 Heavy made its launch debut in 2004 , but suffered a sensor glitch that prevented it from reaching its intended orbit .
The problem was promptly fixed .
The rocket most recently launched a classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office in January .
The Delta 4
Heavy is actually a group of three boosters , each called a Common Booster Core , arranged in a line to give it a three - column look .
At least two more Delta 4
Heavy missions are expected on the books for future classified satellite launches , according to Spaceflight Now .
The rocket is capable of launching payloads of up to 24 tons to low - Earth orbit and 11 tons toward the geosynchronous orbits used by communications satellites , according to Spaceflight Now .
The Delta 4
Heavy is also touted to be able to launch 11 - ton payloads on trans - lunar injection orbit routes toward the moon and 8.8 - ton payloads on Mars - bound trajectories , Spaceflight Now has reported .
The Mightier Ares V ?
The claim by Ares I and Ares I - X on world ’s tallest rocket may be fleeting if NASA ’s plan to build a companion heavy - lift launcher bears fruit .
That giant rocket — the enormous Ares V — would reach a skyscraping height of 381 feet ( 116 meters ) that would surpass the Saturn V and set a new world record .
The rocket is designed to launch 207 tons ( 414,000 pounds ) of cargo to low - Earth orbit and 78.5 tons ( 157,000 pounds ) to the moon .
Designed primarily to haul cargo , the Ares V booster is NASA ’s supply truck for the post - shuttle era .
The rocket consists of a giant core stage flanked by two solid rocket boosters , each slightly larger than the first stage of Ares I .
A so - called Earth Departure stage and Altair lunar lander would sit atop the core stage and be launched into orbit to meet Orion spacecraft carrying moon - bound astronauts .
In place of the upper stage for moon missions , giant cargo modules or even massive space telescopes could be packed away , according to a report by the National Academies of Science .
NASA hopes to have the Ares V rocket in operation for manned moon missions in the 2020s .
Comparison : NASA ’s Space Shuttle Stack
NASA ’s space shuttle fleet may seem puny compared to giant rockets of the past , but its 28 - year flight history makes it a good measuring stick when it comes to booster match - ups .
And , of course , it depends how you measure the shuttles .
On the ground , each NASA space shuttle — there are three orbiters remaining : Discovery , Atlantis and Endeavour – is about 122 feet ( 37 meters ) long from nose to stern and stands 56 feet ( 17 meters ) tall .
They have a wingspan of about 78 feet ( 23 meters ) .
But in launch position , the orbiter is perched on the side of its 15 - story external fuel tank and flanked by two solid rocket boosters .
A shuttle on the launch pad measures 184 feet ( 56 meters ) tall from the tip of the external tank down to the aft skirts of its twin solid rocket boosters .
The space shuttle has a 60 - foot ( 18 meter ) long payload bay that is 15 feet ( 4.5 meters ) wide .
Orbiters can haul large payloads into orbit , making the shuttle the only spacecraft capable of launching massive segments of the International Space Station , which occupied the bulk of the shuttle fleet ’s flight manifest for more than a decade .
NASA has launched 128 shuttle missions since the fleet ’s debut by Columbia in April 1981 .
There have been two failures :
The shuttle Challenger and seven astronauts were lost just after launch in January 1986 due to an O - ring seal leak in a solid rocket booster that led to an explosion .
The shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry in February 2003 due wing heat shield damage .
Seven astronauts were killed .
After each accident , NASA stood down from shuttle flights to make safety improvements .
NASA officials have said the new Ares I rocket , with its top - mounted capsule and launch abort system , will be orders of magnitude safer than the current shuttle design .
In addition to Tuesday ’s Ares I - X launch test , launch abort system tests are scheduled to begin in 2010 , NASA officials have said .

The cult of the NDA
To all those entrepreneurs with innovative , unique business ideas who want to capitalize on them before someone else does , I have one piece of advice :
Get over it .
Riding the tech boom of the late 1990's , there were an immense number of tech companies founded with thousands of innovative , smart new ideas .
As a research analyst at an investment bank during that time , I personally visited with hundreds of these young companies , and even invested personally in a handful , either directly or through my firm 's venture fund .
Every one of these companies believed they had a unique idea , either a piece of technology , a business model , or a way of building a product .
Non-disclosure agreements ( NDA 's ) were the order of the day .
One startup even printed its NDA on the back of visitor 's badges , just like a software " shrink wrap " agreement : " By accepting this visitor 's badge , you agree to the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement . "
At one point , there was even a venture capital conference called NDA , sponsored by the now - defunct ( but apparently rising from the grave ) Red Herring magazine .
Unfortunately , none of these ideas were unique .
Certainly not unique enough to bother signing a formal contract of confidentiality .
In some cases , I visited a half - dozen companies with essentially identical concepts , each blissfully unaware of the others .
Do the math .
If you had an idea , odds are that a sizable fraction of the people with the required expertise and who worry about similar problems have had the same idea at some point .
For the vast majority , it will just be a passing thought , but a few will take the time to do their homework , and maybe even put together a business plan .
If your idea involves , say , high - frequency analog circuit design , then the number of people with the required expertise is small , and your idea might be unique ( on the other hand , if your expertise is in high - frequency analog circuit design , your skills are probably in pretty high demand anyway and you 're less likely to be thinking about starting your own company ) .
On the other hand , if your idea involves improving customer service , or a better way to do mass marketing .... well , there 's tens of millions of people worrying about that same problem , and your idea is probably not unique at all .
Good venture capitalists understand this , and many will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan .
Few entrepreneurs understand it , and many get wrapped up in " protecting their idea " so someone else does n't steal it .
Why the cult of the NDA ?
In our culture , we 've elevated the creative new idea to be the core factor in determining whether a startup succeeds or fails .
Unfortunately , nothing could be further from the truth , but there 's a chain of logic which leads inextricably to the NDA :
1 ) A unique new product or idea is essential to a startup 's success .
2 ) The first company to capitalize on a new product or idea has a unique and sustainable advantage .
3 ) I have a unique idea for a new product or service .
4 ) If others find out about my unique idea , they could bring it to market first , and steal the advantage from me .
5 ) Therefore , by disclosing my idea only under the strictest confidentiality , I preserve an advantage for myself .
Each of these five points is wrong in most cases , though they are a comforting fiction for a young company faced with long odds against success .
1 ) A unique new product or idea is essential to a startup 's success
This is often not the case , since most products and services can easily be replicated by other companies .
The cases where a unique idea is key to success are the cases where a new product or service is dependent upon a very particular skill or invention .
Skills are difficult to replicate , and can be protected through trade secrets ; and inventions can be protected through patents .
Sadly , those cases where the trade secrets and / or patents are both protectable and essential are rare .
The flip side of this is that if the product or idea is truly unique , then the startup is in the position of essentially creating its market from scratch .
This is much more difficult than going to an existing market and winning market share from existing companies .
2 ) The first company to capitalize on a new product or idea has a unique and sustainable advantage .
Many of the most successful technology companies were not the first in their markets , but successful followers which learned from the mistakes of earlier trailblazers .
To take the most obvious example , Microsoft was not the first software company , the first OS vendor , or the first productivity software vendor .
IBM was not the first computer company .
Cisco did n't invent the router , the switch , VoIP , or the firewall .
Google was not the first search engine .
The first two letters of " Yahoo " originally stood for " Yet Another . "
You get the idea .
More often , the long - term winners are the companies with the willingness to adopt good ideas from other places , and the flexibility to learn from the mistakes of the pioneers .
Making mistakes can be very expensive , and being able to avoid certain mistakes can be a competitive advantage .
3 ) I have a unique idea for a new product or service
Probably not .
My own experience is that very few ideas are unique , and in many cases , there are several startups working on the same idea at the same time .
Anyway , in order to market your product or service , you will have to explain it to the industry in great detail .
As soon as you start marketing , your idea is Out There , for others to consider , copy , and perhaps even improve upon .
4 ) If others find out about my unique idea , they could bring it to market first , and steal the advantage from me .
Even supposing that there was an advantage to steal ....
Surprise , surprise , but the rest of the world is not watching your every move waiting to pounce on anything you do .
Unless you 're Bill Gates , but if you 're Bill Gates , you 're not trying to launch a longshot new company on a shoestring budget .
In fact , large incumbents generally do n't take much notice of the startups until after a startup begins to have some success in the marketplace .
Sure , they 'll keep track of developments in the industry , and evaluate new ideas , and maybe even try to build the more promising technology .
Considering that probably 90 % of all venture funded startups never have much impact on an industry , it would be a waste of time to try to stamp out every little company which might someday pose a threat .
They wo n't shift into Killer - Borg - Be-Assimilated - Or-Be-Destroyed mode until after a startup begins causing real pain ; and by that point , the startup should have enough momentum of its own to stand a fighting chance .
5 ) Therefore , by disclosing my idea only under the strictest confidentiality , I preserve an advantage for myself .
Except in very rare cases , this simply is n't true .
There 's is n't any real advantage to be preserved .
More importantly , think of what the entrepreneur is giving up by insisting on excessive secrecy : feedback from others in the industry , including prospective customers , and others who may have tried ( and failed at ) similar ideas .
The opportunity to " debug " a business model or idea at an earlier stage before mistakes are too expensive .
A productive exchange of ideas with other industry experts who may be sympathetic , but can't join you for one reason or another .
What should be confidential ?
The NDA evolved because of the conflict between the desire to keep a business idea secret , and the need to tell others in the industry what a startup is doing .
My philosophy is that if you must disclose something to someone who has no formal relationship to the company , then it is not confidential .
Information which is appropriately confidential includes :
* Trade secrets , unique methods and algorithms , and processes .
* Customer lists and prospect lists .
* Data generated on behalf of a client .
* Information which a third party has asked be kept confidential .
Information which has no business being confidential includes :
* What a company does or plans to do , and what the business model is .
* Industry statistics and forecasts , particularly those prepared by third parties ( I can't even count the number of times I 've gotten published Forrester or Gartner statistics , printed on a page marked " XYZ Confidential " ) .
* Feature lists or product roadmaps .
What really does make a startup successful ?
If it is n't a great new idea , or being first to market , then what really does make a startup a success ?
The vast majority of startups fail , and the real success factors are n't things a company can control , or they 're much harder than just having a great idea .
1 ) The most important success factor is dumb luck .
Being in the right market at the right moment with the right product ( which nobody could have known would be right when you started developing it five years before ) .
The giant order which arrives two days before you run out of money .
Knowing somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody who is a decision maker at a huge customer .
That sort of thing .
2 ) Next most important is execution .
That means paying attention to the details .
Keeping expenses down ( do n't ever forget you 're a starving startup ) .
Hustling to please each and every customer .
Underpromising and overdelivering .
Often it is the failure of incumbents to do these things which creates opportunities for startups .
3 ) Finally , stay focused .
Remember that the objective is to win business and become profitable .
Do n't let internal bickering and politics get in the way , and do n't let setbacks get morale down .
Have you ever watched a baby learn to walk ?
They take two steps and land flat on their butts .
A brief , bewildered expression , then they 're hoisting themselves back up to try again .
It takes strong leadership to keep everyone in a company focused on success when things look bleak , but you need to be that baby .
