Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is poised to win California by the biggest landslide in the history of modern elections - outweighing even Ronald Reagan 's huge wins in his home state - thanks to a crushing margin of support from young voters , independents and Latinos , a new Field Poll shows .
Obama and his vice presidential running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , now lead Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin by a whopping 55 - 33 percent in the nation 's most populous state , according to the Field Poll of 966 likely voters conducted Oct. 18 - 28 .
Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll , said that Obama 's huge lead underscores the Democrat 's solid success in appealing to voter groups that are emerging as the fastest - growing and potentially most influential electorates in the nation .
The Illinois senator is leading McCain in every area of the state , among every age group except voters over 65 , and holds leads in every demographic and income group , as well as among both men and women , the poll shows .
" He really is doing very well among the new emerging voters in California , in the largest areas where the voting population is growing fastest - the Latino vote , the youth vote and the nonpartisan vote , " DiCamillo said .
" These are groups that will have a huge amount of influence down the road . "
With just five days until the November 2008 election , the latest Field Poll also underscores the potential impact of the coming election on congressional races .
Asked their preferences for the U.S. House of Representatives in their district , 50 percent said they are inclined to vote for Democrats , while just 29 percent expressed a preference for Republicans in those seats , the poll showed .
DiCamillo said the latest survey dramatizes some of the historic trends that have , from the start , made a GOP presidential win a serious uphill battle .
" This election is being held at a time when there is overwhelming agreement among Californians and Americans that the country is seriously on the wrong track , " said DiCamillo .
" And it 's being held at a time when the incumbent administration is getting record low job - performance ratings and have gotten them for more than a year . "
" So the opportunity for the party out of office to capture the presidency is very high , " he said .
" It was really up to Obama to convince voters that he was up to the task and make voters comfortable enough with him - and I think he 's succeeded . "
And DiCamillo said the poll also underscores the failure of McCain 's strategy to push the Democrat 's unfavorable ratings higher through negative attacks , DiCamillo said .
The poll shows that despite GOP attacks suggesting Obama is too radical and untested to be president , Obama continues to hold 61 percent favorable ratings with California , compared to 30 percent who view him unfavorably .
But McCain 's standing among voters has fallen since those attacks began .
In January , McCain was viewed favorably by 50 percent of the voters , compared to 28 percent who viewed him unfavorably ; today , more voters see the Arizona senator in an unfavorable light - 47 percent , compared to just 43 percent who view him favorably .
Among the other findings of the Field Poll :
--
The choice of Palin as McCain 's vice president has been viewed through an " extremely partisan " lens , said DiCamillo .
While Republicans view Palin positively by 74 - 19 percent , Democrats and nonpartisans have a very negative image of her ; Democrats hold a 75 - 15 percent unfavorable - favorable rating of Palin , and nonpartisans also have a 65 - 20 percent negative assessment of her , the poll showed .
The Palin pick " really did nothing to broaden the McCain support levels among his own base , " said DiCamillo , who said that Democratic and independent voters tended to see it as a choice that " reflected poorly on his judgment . "
By contrast , Biden is viewed more positively than negatively , by a 57 - 24 percent ratio .
-- McCain is leading among Protestant voters by a 51 - 38 percent ratio , and he holds leads among evangelical Christians with a strong 56 - 34 percent ratio .
But other religions , including Catholics , are overwhelmingly with Obama , the poll shows .
-- Registered Democrats are 85 percent favorable toward Obama , with 7 percent unfavorable , but Republicans are not quite so strong in their support of McCain , with just 80 percent being favorable to the GOP candidate , and 12 percent unfavorable .
The Field Poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points among likely voters .
The lurker bomb that can hover for ten hours ... and then strike its target in the space of a minute
A revolutionary missile that can stalk a target until the perfect moment to strike is being developed by the Ministry of Defence for use against the Taliban in Afghanistan .
The so - called lurker bomb will also be able to shadow British troops for up to ten hours or 100 miles , ready to take out enemy targets with surgical precision at a minute ’s notice .
The 12ft weapon – officially named Fire Shadow and made in Britain by leading missile manufacturer MBDA – will be operated by the Royal Artillery .
It made its first test flight in Wales earlier this year and is expected to be operational by 2010 .
One of the biggest problems facing British troops in Afghanistan is Taliban ambushes .
The insurgents often escape before a counter - attack can be launched because they know the Afghan terrain well , it takes time for air support to arrive , and the British are reluctant to use existing powerful missiles for fear of causing collateral damage such as killing civilians or flattening homes .
Fire Shadow ’s ability to ‘ stooge ’ above the troops means it can be guided to a target within seconds .
And its deadly precision requires only a small warhead of 50lb , compared with the RAF ’s smallest bomb of 500lb .
The Army wants to be able to fire salvos of Fire Shadows , having several in the air at once to hit multiple targets .
The missiles , also known as ‘ loitering munitions ’ , are expected to replace some RAF patrols .
Fire Shadow can be guided to its target by troops on the ground with lasers , by operators in aircraft or helicopters , or by the Army ’s new Watchkeeper surveillance drone .
Lurker bomb :
The 12ft Fire Shadow missile can be launched up to 100 miles away from its target
Once airborne , however , Fire Shadow is unable to return to base .
If it is not used in action , it is brought down in a controlled crash after it runs out of fuel .
Akram Ghulam , head of loitering munitions at MBDA in Stevenage , Hertfordshire , said : ‘ I can see these being used where small , surgically precise effects will have greater utility than an artillery shell or a bomb . ’
MBDA leads the Fire Shadow development team , which cost the MoD £ 74 million in its first year .
It includes British firms Qinetiq , Thales and Roxcel , and several smaller and academic organisations .
The concept of a lurker bomb is the cornerstone of the MoD ’s Indirect - Fire Precision Attack project .
Fire Shadow is one of six projects that include an artillery shell that can electronically ‘ sense ’ its target , a new anti-aircraft missile for the Royal Navy , and advanced guidance for the new Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ( GMLRS ) .
The first GMLRS batteries have already been in action in Afghanistan ’s Helmand area where British troops are operating .
Nicknamed the 70 km sniper – the rocket ’s maximum range – about 250 precision - guided rockets have been fired so far this year , according to an MoD spokesman .
At £ 60,000 a rocket that works out at £ 15 million , a cost that the MoD is well aware of as it seeks to develop Fire Shadow .
‘ We need to get Fire Shadow ’s price to around that , which is a big challenge , ’ said an industry source .

Some recent news out of Google looks to have some big ramifications in the online ad world , at least that 's the take of Search Engine Land 's Greg Sterling .
Google updated its geo-location API to extend beyond mobile phones and work with browsers on Wi-Fi-equipped laptops .
On the face of it , the update means that any Gears - equipped mobile user with a laptop or phone can now be located to within 200 meters , allowing web sites to target location - specific content directly to them at will .
But in terms of online advertising , the ramifications are a bit more interesting .
Google says its original intent behind the Geolocation API was to make it easier for developers to deliver location - enabled web sites on mobile phones .
But now it sees the wisdom of adding laptops into the mix , so it 's added Wi -Fi signals to the API .
The API only works with Gears - enabled browsers , such as Chrome and Android ( and eventually Firefox 3.1 ) .
The API lets developers create locally relevant versions of their web sites without requiring the users to enter their location .
The right localized version just gets dished out automatically .
That is , as long as users decide to opt-in .
Google realizes location - awareness can be kind of creepy and has made it so that the technology wo n't kick in unless a user specifically requests it -- at least twice - - once from Google and once from the online publisher .
Sterling says he sees such location - awareness becoming commonplace in a year or so , and moving beyond Chrome and Firefox to even Microsoft 's IE .
At that point , he sees the advent of super - targeted advertising .
Whereas today , some online ads may be targeted by location at merely the city level , location - awareness within 200 meters gets down to the neighborhood level .
This means users typing the same search keywords can be served different ads based on the income / age / education level of the residents in the block they 're on .
As he explains it :
Of course , the technology and ability to incorporate the requisite Census data is n't quite there yet .
But Google 's provided the base .
Now we just need to wait and see what Google and the advertisers do with it .
( This article originally appeared as a blog at NetworkWorld 's Google 's Subnet )
This story , " Super - Targeted Ads Coming to a Browser Near You " was originally published by Network World .
The new VoteYesForLife.com ad features a host of South Dakota doctors who confirm what most reasonable people already know : there is no medical reason to oppose Initiated Measure 11 .
Anyone who says different is fear mongering and blowing smoke at you to keep abortion as a form of birth control legal and unimpeded .
According to the latest statistics from the South Dakota Department of Health , 84.6 % of the abortions done in South Dakota were because " The mother did not desire to have the child . "
Only 1.9 % of South Dakota abortions fall within the exceptions in Initiated Measure 11 for rape , incest , health of the mother and life of the mother .
Initiated Measure 11 does not interfere in any life - saving medical practice for the mother or her child .
IM 11 is designed to end abortion as birth control , not interfere with life - saving medical care .
Do n't let Planned Parenthood and their allies fool you into keeping 100 % of abortions legal in South Dakota .
Please , for the sake of hundreds of children every year , VoteYesForLife .
Most of my life I have strived to find new and interesting music , but I am often far too busy to really dig deep and find new artists everyday .
Now that I am done with college and have a real job , I find that I have even less time to find new music or even stay up to date with all of the new bands .
I have , however , found some great resources that keep me in the loop with minimal time and effort .
Free Music Listening Sites
Pandora
Pandora is an easy to use music discovery website that has been a favorite of mine for some time .
Pandora allows you to create “ stations ” by putting in your favorite band or bands .
Then , Pandora will play songs from that artist and artists that have a similar sound to your main artist .
I like Pandora for its no frills approach , as it does n’t throw a bunch of extra stuff at you .
Last.fm
Last.fm functions much the same way as Pandora , but focuses much more on the social network side of things .
Of all the websites and services on the list , I use Last .fm the most .
I have found that it has a huge library of tracks that does n’t stop at the end of mainstream .
Their library has exposed me to lots of unknown and underground gems .
StumbleAudio
StumbleAudio was covered in my previous post Discover New Music with StumbleAudio .
It is a great service that is easy to use , but it has a smaller library that is mainly focuses around smaller unknown artists .
The Hype Machine
The Hype Machine is a very unique website , in that , it aggregates all kinds of MP3 blogs from across the Internet into one place .
This way you can find out what bands everyone else is talking about and discover them for yourself .
Musicovery
Musicovery presents a much different experience than most of the other services on this list .
At Musicovery , you choose genre , mood and timeframe in order to discover new music .
This is definitely a very unique way to discover new music and is worth checking out .
Skreemr
Skreemr is an MP3 search engine that returns webpages where MP3’s of the artist you searched are posted .
This allows you to easily listen to your favorite song by that artist .
Skreemr also gives you the option to search for similar artists .
i Like
i Like is a music social network that is similar to Last.fm , but iLike integrates with your iTunes through a sidebar .
This allows you to easily get recommendations from iLike and find more people with similar tastes in order to find find new artists .
thesixtyone
thesixtyone allows its users to “ bump ” up tracks by different artists .
It functions in a way that is very similar to Digg , but it is only for music .
This way you can find great songs and great artists by using the knowledge of the other users on the site .
Amazon
Amazon is a site that just about everyone should be familiar with .
Back before I knew all about the sites listed above , I would go to Amazon and see what else customers bought when they bought an album I liked .
If you keep doing this , you start going down a rabbit hole and can find some great music .
The little snippets that Amazon lets you listen to provide you with a great way to sample the artists as you come across them .
Blogs
What list of places to find music would be complete without blogs ?
There are lots of great music blogs out there that keep you up to date with current artists and events .
I subscribe to Stereogum and Pitchfork in my RSS , and I highly recommend them .
Where else do you discover new music ?

Sister Cecilia has lived in the convent in Rome for 50 years A 106 - year - old American nun living in a convent in Rome could well be one of the oldest voters to cast a ballot in the 2008 US Presidential election .
Sister Cecilia Gaudette , who last voted for President Eisenhower in 1952 , has registered to vote and says she will vote for Democrat Barack Obama .
Although hard of hearing , she keeps herself informed by reading newspapers and watching TV at the convent .
" I 'm encouraged by Senator Obama , " she says .
" I 've never met him , but he seems to be a good man with a good private life .
That 's the first thing .
Then he must be able to govern , " she adds .
Sitting in her modest office in the convent where she has lived for the past 50 years , the diminutive nun appears uninterested in the row inside the American Catholic church over Senator Obama 's support for pro-choice policies on abortion .
Asked about her hopes for the US under an Obama presidency , she says : " Peace abroad .
I do n't worry about the Iraq war because I can't do anything about it .
Lord knows how it will end . "
" It is very complicated , " she said .
" Those Eastern people are not like we are . "
But despite taking part in the 4 November election , Sister Cecilia does not intend to return to the US .
" I have no plans for the future .
I am too old to go back to the US .
Life has changed too much . "
But she still watches " very important events " on TV .
The election comes under this category .

What are these ?
FOR many American professionals , the Labor Day holiday yesterday probably was n’t as relaxing as they had hoped .
They did n’t go into the office , but they were still working .
As much as they may truly have wanted to focus on time with their children , their spouses or their friends , they were unable to turn off their BlackBerrys , their laptops and their work - oriented brains .
Americans working on holidays is not a new phenomenon : we have long been an industrious folk .
A hundred years ago the German sociologist Max Weber described what he called the Protestant ethic .
This was a religious imperative to work hard , spend little and find a calling in order to achieve spiritual assurance that one is among the saved .
Weber claimed that this ethic could be found in its most highly evolved form in the United States , where it was embodied by aphorisms like Ben Franklin ’s “ Industry gives comfort and plenty and respect . ”
The Protestant ethic is so deeply engrained in our culture you do n’t need to be Protestant to embody it .
You do n’t even need to be religious .
But what ’s different from Weber ’s era is that it is now the rich who are the most stressed out and the most likely to be working the most .
Perhaps for the first time since we ’ve kept track of such things , higher - income folks work more hours than lower - wage earners do .
Since 1980 , the number of men in the bottom fifth of the income ladder who work long hours ( over 49 hours per week ) has dropped by half , according to a study by the economists Peter Kuhn and Fernando Lozano .
But among the top fifth of earners , long weeks have increased by 80 percent .
[ digg- reddit- me ] Think calmly and well , upon this whole subject .
Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time .
If there be an object to hurry any of you , in hot haste , to a step which you would never take deliberately , that object will be frustrated by taking time ; but no good object can be frustrated by it .
From Abraham Lincoln ’s first Inagural Address .
Brought to mind by George Packer ’s invocation of it in his excellent piece in the New Yorker on “ The New Liberalism . ”
In a time of crisis , sometimes , much can be lost in the time required for due reflection .
But not often .
And much more often , hasty decisions lead to unanticipated side effects , often worsening the original condition .
Our current media environment punishes daily the patience Lincoln counsels – and rewards the patience , if ever , only on occasion .
This has been the case at least since Bill Clinton , as every prominent political figure is forced to respond to scandal after scandal – and in the midst of this , the bigger picture was lost .
John McCain ’s and Hillary Clinton ’s campaign got lost amidst their daily attempt to win the media war and quash brewing scandals .
Barack Obama managed to stand apart from the daily grind .
He kept his campaign ’s course amidst the tumult .
This was n’t always to his benefit – as it led him to take too long to address the Reverend Wright scandal for example - but in the end , his response worked more effectively than a day - to - day attempt to distract and quash the story would have .
This patience and deliberation is Obama ’s strength .
Now , he must maintain it while he manages his transition and in his administration .
I ’ve been hearing that the Detroit bailout wo n’t be able to pass in this lame duck session of Congress .
I hope this is true – because I think a smart rescue plan for Detroit will work better than the current proposal for a hasty bailout .
We need to ensure that this bill does n’t succeed just because – as George Will pointed out – it follows “ the supreme law of the land … the principle of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs . ”
Yet at the same time , I am not quite as cavalier as many others who have suggested we let these companies simply fail .
It may be just – but it is not prudent in this financial climate .
In a just world , certainly , Lehman Brothers would have failed – but if it were prudently preserved , this financial crisis may not have been precipitated .
Can we risk letting these companies fail now ?
I do n’t believe we can , so we need some kind of rescue plan .
But this rescue plan should be crafted to avoid the exact moral hazard that accompanies any help to an ailing industry .
The plan should be punitive towards the management of these companies .
It should not prop up the companies directly .
My thought is that Obama could propose some Tennessee Valley Authority type project for Detroit – in which the government could offer contracts for green industry jobs in the area – specifically attempting to utilize many of the structures and factories and workers in the area .
They should allow any company to apply for these contracts – and structure it in such a way that they could attempt to buy up the necessary facilities after applying .
The goal of this legislation should not be to prop up General Motors , Chrysler , and Ford – but to rejuvenate the car industry in the area and to utilize as much of the infrastructure and employees already built in the area .
This legislation will not be able to be crafted and debated in the next week .
This will need a new Congress and a new president .
There are many troublesome paths that can be taken here .
To choose the least bad will require patience and deliberation .
Which is why this matter must wait until after January 20th .

This new species of blind , subterranean , predatory ant , Martialis heureka , was discovered in the Amazon .
It belongs to the first new subfamily of living ants discovered since 1923 , and is a descendant of one of the first ant lineages to evolve over 120 million years ago .
A newly discovered species of a blind , subterranean predator — dubbed the " Ant from Mars " — is likely a descendant of one of the very first ants to evolve on Earth , a new study finds .
Christian Rabeling , an evolutionary biology graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin , found the only known specimen of the new ant species in dead plant material on the ground in the Amazon rainforest at the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria in Manaus , Brazil , in 2003 .
Rabeling and his colleagues named the ant Martialis heureka ( " ant from Mars " ) because they 'd never seen an ant like it before .
The ant is well - adapted for its underground home , with a long , pale body and no eyes .
It also has long , slender forceps - like mandibles that researchers suspect the ant uses to capture prey .
M. heureka not only constitutes a new species , but a new genus and subfamily of ants as well .
The new subfamily , one of 21 ant subfamilies , is the first new one to be named by scientists since 1967 .
Rabeling says the discovery , detailed in the Sept. 15 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , will help biologists better understand the biodiversity and evolution of ants .
Ants evolved more than 120 million years ago from wasp ancestors .
Scientists think that ants evolved quickly into many different lineages , specializing to live in the soil , leaf - litter or trees , or in multiple habitats .
DNA taken from the M. heureka specimen 's leg indicates that it belongs at the base of the ant evolutionary tree .
" This discovery lends support to the idea that blind , subterranean predator ants arose at the dawn of ant evolution , " Rabeling said .
This does n't mean that the ancestor to all ants was blind and lived underground , but that these features evolved early in ant history and persisted in the environmentally stable soils of the tropics .
The finding of M. heureka " hints at a wealth of species , possibly of great evolutionary importance , still hidden in the soils of the remaining rainforests , " the authors of the study wrote .
16 The addition of the Peano axioms , like all the other changes made in the system PM , serves only to simplify the proof and can in principle be dispensed with .
17 It is presupposed that for every variable type denumerably many signs are available .
18 Unhomogeneous relations could also be defined in this manner , e.g. a relation between individuals and classes as a class of elements of the form : ( (x 2 ) , ( ( x 1 ) , x 2 ) ) .
As a simple consideration shows , all the provable propositions about relations in PM are also provable in this fashion .
18a Thus x " ( a ) is also a formula if x does not occur , or does not occur free , in a .
In that case x " ( a ) naturally means the same as a .
19 With regard to this definition ( and others like it occurring later ) , cf. J. Lukasiewicz and A. Tarski , ' Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül ' , Comptes Rendus des séances de la Soeiété des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie XXIII , 1930 , Cl. 111 .
20 Where v does not occur in a as a free variable , we must put Subst a ( v|b ) = a .
Note that " Subst " is a sign belonging to metamathematics .
21 As in PM I , * 13 , x 1 = y 1 is to be thought of as defined by x 2 " ( x 2 ( x 1 ) É x 2 ( y 1 ) ) ( and similarly for higher types . )
22 To obtain the axioms from the schemata presented ( and in the cases of II , III and IV , after carrying out the permitted substitutions ) , one must therefore still
1. eliminate the abbreviations
2. add the suppressqd brackets .
23 c is therefore either a variable or 0 or a sign of the form ¦ ¦ u where u is either 0 or a variable of type 1 .
With regard to the concept " free ( bound ) at a place in a " cf. section I A5 of the work cited in footnote 24 .
24 The rule of substitution becomes superfluous , since we have already dealt with all possible substitutions in the axioms themselves ( as is also done in J. v. Neumann , ' Zur Hilbertschen Beweistheorie ' , Math. Zeitschr. 26 , 1927 ) .
25 I.e. its field of definition is the class of non-negative whole numbers ( or n- tuples of such ) , respectively , and its values are non-negative whole numbers .
26 In what follows , small italic letters ( with or without indices ) are always variables for non-negative whole numbers ( failing an express statement to the contrary ) .
[ Italics omitted . ]
27 More precisely , by substitution of certain of the foregoing functions in the empty places of the preceding , e.g. f k ( x 1 , x 2 ) = f p [ f q ( x 1 , x 1 ) , f r ( x 2 ) ] ( p , q , r  k ) .
Not all the variables on the left - hand side must also occur on the right ( and similarly in the recursion schema ( 2 ) ) .
28 We include classes among relations ( one - place relations ) .
Recursive relations R naturally have the property that for every specific n- tuple of numbers it can be decided whether R(x 1 x n ) holds or not .
29 For all considerations as to content ( more especially also of a metamathematical kind ) the Hilbertian symbolism is used , cf. Hilbert - Ackermann , Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik , Berlin 1928 .
30 We use [ greek ] letters c , h , as abbreviations for given n- tuple sets of variables , e.g. x 1 , x 2 x n .
31 We take it to be recognized that the functions x+y ( addition ) and x.y ( multiplication ) are recursive .
32 a cannot take values other than 0 and 1 , as is evident from the definition of a .
33 The sign º is used to mean " equivalence by definition " , and therefore does duty in definitions either for = or for ~ [ not the negation symbol ] ( otherwise the symbolism is Hilbertian ) .
34 Wherever in the following definitions one of the signs ( x ) , ( $ x ) , e x occurs , it is followed by a limitation on the value of x .
This limitation merely serves to ensure the recursive nature of the concept defined .
( Cf. Proposition IV . )
On the other hand , the range of the defined concept would almost always remain unaffected by its omission .
34a For 0 < n £ z , where z is the number of distinct prime numbers dividing into x .
Note that for n = z +1 , n Pr x = 0 .
34 b m, n £ x stands for : m £ x & n £ x ( and similarly for more than two variables ) .
35 The limitation n £ ( Pr[l( x ) ] 2x.[l( x ) ] 2 means roughly this :
The length of the shortest series of formulae belonging to x can at most be equal to the number of constituent formulae of x .
There are however at most l(x ) constituent formulae of length 1 , at most l(x ) - 1 of length 2 , etc. and in all , therefore , at most 1 ¤ 2 [ l ( x ) {l( x ) + 1} ] £ [ l ( x ) ]
2 .
The prime numbers in n can therefore all be assumed smaller that Pr{[l ( x ) ] 2} , their number £ [ l( x ) ] 2 and their exponents ( which are constituent formulae of x ) £ x .
36 Where v is not a variable or x not a formula , then Sb( x v|y ) = x .
37 Instead of Sb[ Sb[x v|y ] z|y ] we write : Sb( x v|y w|z ) ( and similarly for more than two variables ) .
38 The variables u 1 u n could be arbitrarily allotted .
There is always , e.g. , an r with the free variables 17 , 19 , 23 etc. , for which ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) hold .
39 Proposition V naturally is based on the fact that for any recursive relation R , it is decidable , for every n- tuple of numbers , from the axioms of the system P , whether the relation R holds or not .
40 From this there follows immediately its validity for every recursive relation , since any such relation is equivalent to 0 = f ( x 1 x n ) , where f is recursive .
41 In the precise development of this proof , r is naturally defined , not by the roundabout route of indicating its content , but by its purely formal constitution .
42 Which thus , as regards content , expresses the existence of this relation .
43 r is derived in fact , from the recursive relation - sign q on replacement of a variable by a determinate number ( p ) .
44 The operations Gen and Sb are naturally always commutative , wherever they refer to different variables .
45 " x is c - provable " signifies : x Î Flg( c ) , which , by ( 7 ) , states the same as Bew c ( x ) .
45a Since all existential assertions occurring in the proof are based on Proposition V , which , as can easily be seen , is intuitionistically unobjectionable .
46 Thus the existence of consistent and not w - consistent c's can naturally be proved only on the assumption that , in general , consistent c's do exist ( i.e. that P is consistent ) .
47 The proof of assumption 1 is here even simpler than that for the system P , since there is only one kind of basic variable ( or two for J. v. Neumann ) .

CommQuack hires like crazy .
They hire in good times , they hire in bad times .
They hire before , during , and after periods of massive layouts .
Only one department was sheltered from the endless churn of hirings and layoffs — HR .
For a company of ten thousand people , the fact that one thousand of them worked in HR should tell you something .
And the HR staff was busy .
Résumés came in by the hundreds , and those that were n't referrals from existing employees were fiercely fought over so that the first person to grab it could claim the bounty .
The HR staff were paid near - minimum wage rates , and like time - share salesmen , they were paid primarily on commission .
Each referred employee that turned into a hire netted the referrer a cool $ 5,000.00 .
The upshot of this is that this meant that if you were qualified but not referred by someone in HR , you did n't get hired .
The upshot of this is that a lot of unqualified boobs got hired .
After interviews from HR , the candidates would be sent to the departments they hoped to work for , which meant that Grig L. had to conduct many of the interviews .
The Applicants
The hiring process worked out great for the candidates that were in good with HR .
Take Mr. Buttle , for example — his résumé boasted that he was an MCSE with years of experience .
In his many travels , however , one particular object was foreign to him : the mouse .
He fumbled with it a bit and started getting the hang of it , but was angered when his interviewer , Grig asked where he 'd trained for his MCSE .
" It was an Indian college , " he replied defensively , " and they trained us entirely from the command line . "
Another candidate was doing well during his interview , and as a CCNA , he was a strong candidate .
That is , until it became clear that he was n't sure what a router was .
When asked , he confidently explained , " why , routers are all around us !
Whether we 're talking plumbing , electricity ... "
Grig stopped him right there and asked him to point to a router in the room .
Silently , the candidate walked to the wall and pointed at the room 's thermostat .
In another interview , the candidate was n't particularly strong with the technologies used by CommQuack , but hopefully some of his Mac skills would translate .
And they might have too , if he had n't blown the interview by not answering questions , instead smugly whining about how much better everything he 'd seen would be better on a Mac .
Another gentleman 's résumé was two pages long .
Not that this was particularly uncommon — it 's just that usually the first page is n't entirely devoted to one 's mastery of the " man " command .
This might have been excusable in and of itself , but when asked the appropriate gimme question – " how would one find out what switches and options a UNIX command has ? " – he huffed and puffed , and then finally admitted that he used a résumé writing service .
And then there was the " Dr. Applicant " who proudly touted his PhD in philosophy .
On a hunch , one of the interviewers who happened to have an undergraduate in philosophy asked , " so tell me , what is Kant 's Categorical Imperative , and how would you live your life by it ? "
The question was met with a blank stare .
The fact that he could n't remember what his dissertation was about seemed a bit fishy , too .
Finally , a lady with " extensive Apache administration experience " arrived for an interview , and when lobbed a softball question — what would she do if a server did n't launch Apache after a reboot ? — answered confidently , " I 'd reboot it again ! "
And if that did n't fix it ?
" I 'd reboot again ! " Grig repeated the question again , she repeated her answer again .
He had a feeling he could keep this going all day , until finally she gave a different answer — " well that must mean there 's a bigger problem . "
Grig leaned in intently to hear her answer .
" So I guess I 'd return it to Dell . "
The Hire
In a sea of mediocrity incompetents , one of the above applicants seemed to have what it takes — Mr. Buttle was offered a job by another department , and he happily accepted .
So what if he did n't know how to use a mouse ?
He actually was pretty quick with the command line .
Still , that did n't stop him from warming to the new interface .
After a week he was a mousing pro!
Clicking , dragging , double - clicking , even right clicking ( take that , Mac applicant ) !
His newfound mouse mastery was a mixed blessing , however .
He learned how to close and manipulate windows with blinding speed , and found an outlet for his skills : Closing popup windows .
On porn sites .
That he 'd spend all day browsing .
So the team lost one tech .
But I 've got a hunch that the next batch of applicants is right around the corner !
Following up on the previous blog about meditation , I ’ve been digging around for some interesting links on how meditative states correlate with brain waves .
Here ’s a basic rundown on how :
( Graph from crystalinks )
The brain itself emits electromagnetic energy , and this brain activity differs according to its state ( sleeping , awake , thinking etc ) .
There is a growing amount of data about these brain states , specifically on how the act of meditation influences them .
According to this chart , beta waves coincide with thinking / working / activities , while on the other side of the spectrum there is delta , which indicates deep and dreaming / dreamless sleep .
Meditation is often found with alpha / theta waves .
I ’d be curious to know where mindfulness meditation fits in this spectrum .
There are various sound waves that induce or help promote a particular brain state .
Ever hear of the brainwave generator ?
It ’s been around for a few years now ( at least ) .
You can download the program , free and try it out .
It has a very extensive list of different sounds which allegedly help for a number of tasks , from meditating to headaches .
What are your thoughts on it ?
From giving it a shot , I admit it did induce something .
I ’ve tried it to help write papers , but I ’ve found myself having to make an active effort to first clear out all other sounds , sit back and take it in .
There does seem to be some kind of effect , for sure .
I ’m just not sure how extensive it is .
Next up on the list is Holosync .
This project is by far a more extensive one .
I have n’t purchased the program , but there seems to be alot of positive hype about it .
What I did manage to get is a demo CD .
It did seem to have some effect , but not as strong as the Brainwave generator .
This could have been because the Holosync CD had the president speaking for a good majority of the demo , while the sound waves played underneath .
I found it to be a bit distracting .
Without making this too patchy , I think I ’ll end it here , and in the next blog ( part 2 ) I ’ll dive into a related topic : the science behind meditation .
There are a handful of really interesting experiments and debates over meditation and the brain .
Stay tuned !
MINNEAPOLIS - U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann is retreating from a statement she made two days ago that Barack Obama " may have anti-American views . "
The comment by the first - term Republican fueled a surge of campaign donations to her opponent , Democrat Elwyn Tinklenberg .
Bachmann appeared on a WCCO - TV show on Sunday to say she is n't saying that Obama 's views are anti-American .
She says , " That was a misreading of what I said . "
But she says the Democratic presidential nominee 's views are " concerning " and deserve more media attention .
She says if he 's elected it will mean tax increases , socialized medicine and climate change taxes .
Bachmann is running for re-election in Minnesota 's 6th District on the northern edge of the Twin Cities .
The first poster for ’s drama “ ” starringandis online .
The first - time filmmaker Steve McQueen wrote and directed the movie .
The screenplay was written by McQueen and “ Hunger ” first premiered at theearlier this year , opening the ‘ Un Certain Regard ‘ category , follows the last six weeks in the life of Republican Bobby Sands , the IRA hunger striker who died in the Maze prison in 1981 .
“ Hunger ” is expected to start hitting limited US theaters later this year .
It ’s possible for a New Yorker to go weeks without glimpsing a river or a harbor , and to lose track of the fact that Manhattan is both an island and a seaport .
This misapprehension is inconceivable , however , for a user of the Waterfront Greenway , a well - marked thirty - two - mile route for walkers , runners , skaters , cyclists , and other non-motorized travellers .
It follows the Hudson , Harlem , and East Rivers around Manhattan ’s perimeter , with occasional inland detours ( across Dyckman Street , way up beyond the Cloisters ; along the spine of central Harlem ; around a couple of dozen blocks near the United Nations ) .
The Greenway is especially well suited to bicyclists , who , if they are moderately fit and do n’t blow a tire on a broken apricot - brandy bottle , can cover the entire distance in a single leisurely morning or afternoon .
Biking the Manhattan shoreline turns the city inside out , and gives the cyclist firsthand answers to questions that often stump even lifelong residents , such as : are there any decent places in Manhattan to go rock climbing , and what the heck do they keep under the Henry Hudson Parkway ?
Perhaps you yourself rode the Greenway on a recent , spectacular Friday afternoon , beginning and ending at the Battery , where , when you started , a man wearing a broad - brimmed hat was baiting a fishhook with a half - dollar - size crab , which he had selected from a joint - compound bucket at his feet .
If so , here are a few of the other things you may have noticed along the way :
Helicopters and small airplanes flying above the Upper Bay like dragonflies above a swimming pool .
A man wearing a black wetsuit and an orange life jacket , bobbing in the Hudson about fifty feet from shore , using various hand tools to affix four large pink plastic petals to a rotting wooden piling .
According to another man , who was standing onshore and holding a walkie - talkie , the man in the water was “ installing prototypes for an art project , to see how they make it through the winter . ”
The Parthenon - like and perhaps spectacularly luxurious colonnaded rooftop outdoor lounging facility of Larry Flynt ’s Hustler Club , at Fifty - first and Twelfth .
A guy who had been shooting hoops alone on a court underneath the West Side Highway asking another guy , who had been shooting hoops alone on a different court , two courts away , for a little help in retrieving his ball , which had become stuck between the rim and the backboard , and then also asking , “ Wanna play ? , ” and then the two of them continuing to shoot hoops alone but now on courts adjacent to each other .
A man in bluejeans travelling south on a bright - yellow pedicab piled high with driftwood , which presumably he had collected along the river ’s edge , steering with his right hand and using his left hand to give his left leg a downstroke power assist ; and a middle - aged nun in a white habit , veil flapping , riding a regular bike in the opposite direction .
A lost or discarded parking ticket undulating like a miniature magic carpet in the tiny waves a few feet from shore .
A guy fishing with an enormous surf - casting rod a little downstream from the George Washington Bridge and around a bend from the Jeffrey ’s Hook Lighthouse , which was saved from demolition in 1951 by outraged readers of the children ’s book “ The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge , ” by Hildegarde H. Swift and Lynd Ward .
Several hundred pigeons loitering near the center of an otherwise unoccupied playing field , and , on the other side of the bike path , a man in running clothes sticking out his lower lip while doing rapid , shallow pushups on a bench .
A trailer , carrying rowing shells , parked near the magnificent gate of the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse , in Swindler Cove Park , on the Harlem River .
The turreted , thirty - room 1887 mansion of James Anthony Bailey , who was the co-founder , with P. T. Barnum , of “ The Greatest Show on Earth . ”
The mansion , which is at the northeast corner of 150th Street and St. Nicholas Place and is made of limestone , inspired Chester Wickwire , who may or may not have invented the woven - wire window screen , to build an almost identical mansion in Cortland , New York , in 1890 .
Four old guys watching four other old guys eating slices of pizza at a white plastic card table on the sidewalk at 120th and First .
More bollards , cleats , capstans , hoists , and other riverside mooring paraphernalia — some of it freshly painted — than you would think could possibly have an ongoing nautical application in New York City .
A young man transporting a set of golf clubs — which he had stuffed vertically into his bicycle ’s saddlebags — toward Stuyvesant Town .

One of the prevailing myths in society is that everyone on registries are all " violent rapists " or " uncontrollable pedophiles
with hundreds of victims . "
However , landing on a sex offender registry ( or even the prospect of landing on the registry ) is
a very real threat .
Over the years , I have collected some very outlandish cases which have either landed someone on
the registry or have at least made them potentially subject to placement on the registry .

in the press .
Some are worthy of mention here , mostly because they were n’t worthy of attention when they
occurred : 1 . William Kelly was arrested in Maryland in 1987 after dropping off a roll of film that included shots his
10 - year - old daughter and younger children had taken of each other nude .
2 . David Urban in 1989 took photos of
his wife and 15 - month - old grandson , both nude , as she was giving him a bath .
Kmart turned him in and he was
convicted by a Missouri court ( later overturned ) .
3 . A gay adult couple in Florida decided to shave their bodies
and snap their lovemaking , convincing a Walgreens clerk that one of them was a child .
They are suing the Fort
Lauderdale police .4 .
More recently , Cynthia Stewart turned in bath - time pictures of her 8 - year - old daughter to a
Fuji film processing lab in Oberlin , Ohio .
The lab contacted the local police , who found the pictures “ over the line ”
and arrested the mother for , among other things , snapping in the same frame with her daughter a showerhead ,
which the prosecution apparently planned to relate somehow to hints of masturbation .
--
Even though the number
of arrests is not large and the circumstances seem ridiculous , this photo lab idiocy is a serious matter :
It puts all of
us at risk , and it significantly erodes free speech protection by insisting that a photograph of a child is tantamount
to molestation .
Since it is what is outside the frame ( the intention of the photographer , the reaction of the viewer )
that counts legally , we are actually encouraged to fantasize an action in order to determine whether or not this is
child pornography . "

All three united in stony silence .
Who was this man who suddenly jumped

I got my wife and , still soaking wet , jumped into the car and took off .
I could have stuck around and

When I teach Intro to Oceanography this semester and last year , one of the stories that made the greatest impression on my students ( and on me , too ) was the sad account of the “ Great Pacific Garbage Patch . ”
This is an area of the ocean surface in the North Pacific covering between 700,000 square kilometers ( 270,000 sq mi ) to more than 15,000,000 square kilometers ( 5,800,000 sq mi ) , larger than the size of Texas .
It is composed nearly entirely of plastic trash , fishing nets , and other floating garbage , at least 80 % which comes from the land and is non-biodegradable .
The denser areas of garbage are so large they can be seen from satellite views .
Why is so much garbage concentrated in one area ?
It all has to do with the oceanic currents that I teach my Oceanography students about .
The centers of each portion of the ocean is surrounded by a big circular current called a gyre , which usually runs in a clockwise fashion in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere ( due to the Coriolis effect ) .
In the North Pacific , a huge gyre completely surrounds the center of the northern ocean , with the warm fast Kuroshio Current coming up from the tropics past Japan , and the cold slow California Current coming down the eastern edge from Alaska , connected by currents ( North Equatorial , North Pacific ) which travel east or west to connect these in the equator and in the polar regions .
This spiraling current tends to accumulate a mound of water in the middle ( due to the Ekman spiral effect ) that is rather stagnant and does not mix or blend with the boundary currents very well .
It is also at a latitude with permanent high - pressure over it , so there ’s no strong air currents to move it in any particular direction .
Consequently , the centers of ocean gyres are slow and stagnant and tend to accumulate stuff that floats into them , and cannot escape .
In the North Atlantic , the stagnant center of the gyre is called the “ Sargasso Sea ” after the huge floating patches of Sargassum seaweed that floats in the region for decades .
There are garbage patches of smaller size in most of the other oceanic gyres as well .
But in the North Pacific gyre , what stays put is garbage , the largest such patch in the world .

Human skin harbours many bacteria Women have a greater range of different types of bacteria on the palms of their hands than men , US research suggests .
The study also found that human hands harbour far higher numbers of bacteria species than previously thought .
Using powerful gene sequencing techniques , researchers found a typical hand had roughly 150 different species of bacteria living on it .
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study found bacteria types varied greatly between individuals .
The sheer number of bacteria species detected on the hands of the study participants was a big surprise
Dr Noah Fierer
Universithy of Colorado at Boulder
The researchers , from the University of Colorado at Boulder , hope their work will help scientists to establish a " healthy baseline " of bacteria species on the human hand .
This could potentially help them to identify which species are linked to specific diseases .
Lead researcher Dr Noah Fierer said : " The sheer number of bacteria species detected on the hands of the study participants was a big surprise , and so was the greater diversity of bacteria we found on the hands of women . "
The study detected and identified more than 4,700 different bacteria species across 102 human hands in the study .
However , only five species were shared among all 51 participants .
Even the right and left palms of the same individual shared an average of only 17 % of the same bacteria types .
On average , women had 50 % more bacterial species on their hands than men .
Acidic skin Dr Fierer said that the higher bacterial diversity on women 's hands may be due to the fact that men tend to have more acidic skin , which provides a more harsh living environment for the microscopic bugs .
BACTERIA ON WOMEN'S HANDS Enterobacteriales : 400 % more abundant on women Moraxellaceae : 180 % more Lactobacillaceae : 340 % more Pseudomonadaceae : 180 % more Alternatively , differences in sweat , oil gland or hormone production may be key - or the fact that women and men tend to make different use of cosmetics such as moisturisers .
Dr Fierer said the study also found hand washing had little impact on the diversity of bacteria found on an individual 's hands .
While some groups of bacteria were less abundant following hand washing , others were more abundant .
However , the researchers said that washing with anti-bacterial cleansers was still an effective way to minimise the risk of disease , as it seemed particularly to target harmful bugs .
The diversity of bacteria types on the palm was three times higher than that found on the forearm and elbow and appeared to outstrip that found in the mouth and lower intestine .
Important role Dr Fierer said : " We know that skin associated bacteria are likely to have an important influence on skin health , a minority may act as pathogens and many may actually have a beneficial effect , protecting us from disease .
" However , we do not know how differences in bacterial communities may impact skin health and we do not know if specific types of bacteria are more beneficial than others .
" This is an active area of research but our results suggest that answering these questions will be very difficult given that there is so much background variability in bacterial communities between healthy individuals . "
Dr Valerie Curtis , director of the Hygiene Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said science still had much to learn about how bacteria interact with the human body .
She said : " Most are likely to be neutral , just living there without doing any harm or good . "
But she added : " It is thought that having such flora on our hands is probably beneficial , because the bacteria occupy niches which are then unavailable to pathogens . "

WHEN American officials were discussing how to structure their bail - out proposal , a number of economists mentioned that they might want to take a long look at the Swedish model .
In the early 1990s , a Swedish property bust led to a Scandinavian banking crisis .
Here 's what The Economist had to say in January of 1993 :
REGULATORS and politicians in Norway , Sweden and Finland have made the same new year 's resolution : to solve the problems of their ailing banks .
They will not find it easy .
Though the three countries have spent over $ 16 billion propping up their banks in the past three years , many still look shaky .
And critics are slamming state support for distorting competition and delaying long - overdue financial restructuring .
The banks got into trouble in all - too - familar ways .
Financial deregulation gave them greater freedom to lend , which they exploited unwisely .
Scandinavian property went through a nasty boom - and - bust cycle .
And recession ( especially severe in Finland when trade with the former Soviet Union collapsed ) led to mountains of bad debts .
The potential cost of rescuing the banks from their mistakes is soaring .
In October , when Finland 's big banks unveiled their results for the first eight months of 1992 , it became clear that their losses for the year could reach 10 billion markka ( $ 2.2 billion ) , double the 1991 figure .
On January 5th the government asked the Finnish parliament to double the size of a public fund set up to support troubled banks , to 50 billion markka .
Before launching the fund in April 1992 , the government had already dished out 8 billion markka to Finnish banks in a bid to avoid a credit crunch .
The Swedish government is also digging into its pockets again .
On December 23rd it restructured state - owned Nordbanken , one of the country 's biggest and sickest banks .
The bank 's dud loans , almost three - quarters of them property - related , have been hived off into a so - called " bad bank " called Securum AB .
The government is injecting SKr 24 billion ( $ 3.3 billion ) into Securum as equity , and will also guarantee SKr10 billion of loans to the company .
The government also said it would take control of Gota Bank , Sweden 's fourth - largest bank .
In September the government agreed to meet Gota Bank 's obligations after Trygg - Hansa , the bank 's owner and one of Sweden 's largest insurers , said it could no longer afford to support it .
The government has also provided SKr7.3 billion in loans and guarantees to Forsta Sparbanken , the country 's biggest savings bank ...
There has been surprisingly little debate in the three countries over whether so much taxpayers ' cash is being spent sensibly .
One explanation is that , with entire banking systems at risk , officials preferred to prop banks up first and answer questions later .
Another is that the cost is only now becoming clear .
Johan Lybeck , a professor at Gothenberg School of Economics who has written a book on the banking disaster , reckons the cost of bailing out Sweden 's banks will be at least SKr100 billion .
The rescue strategies being pursued in the three countries have common threads .
But there are also big differences .
Sweden , for instance , has gone further than either Norway or Finland in publicly underwriting its financial system .
A law passed on December 18th guarantees that banks and some other credit institutions ( such as mortgage banks ) will meet their commitments on a timely basis .
No limit is set to the amount that can be spend on rescues or to how long the guarantee will last .
Moreover , the state has agreed to back not just deposits but also most subordinated debt and even off - balance - sheet liabilities such as swaps .

Although PHP 5.3 is still in alpha stage and certain features like the PHAR extension or the whole namespace support are still topics of endless discussions it already contains smaller changes that could improve the security of PHP applications a lot .
One of these small changes is the introduction of a new php ini directive called request_order .
request_order is the response of the PHP developers to me preaching for years that using $ _REQUEST is not only deprecated but actually dangerous for PHP applications .
With request_order it is now possible to control in what order $ _REQUEST is created and what variable sources are taken into account .
This finally allows removing cookie data from $ _REQUEST without removing them from $ _COOKIE also .
Because removing cookies from $ _REQUEST might break badly written software request_order is not set by default .
However the recommended setting by the PHP developer is to set it to “ GP ” which means only $ _GET and _POST data is merged into $ _REQUEST with $ _POST data overwriting $ _GET data .
To learn why using $ _REQUEST is a bad idea and what Delayed Cross Site Request Forgeries / Hijacking are continue reading …
$ _REQUEST and Cookies
PHP application developers often use $ _REQUEST instead of $ _GET or $ _POST because they do not care about the source of input .
This has been considered bad practice for a while , because it is actually a violation of the idea behind GET and POST requests : GET is meant to retrieve data , POST is meant to manipulate data .
And others have wrongly claimed that using POST instead of GET is a protection against CSRF .
Nevertheless PHP application developers still use $ _REQUEST a lot , because they cannot see the security threat in using it .
What most of them forget is that $ _REQUEST does also contain $ _COOKIE data and cookies unlike $ _GET and $ _POST data are shared among a ( sub - ) domain .
So an application must actually expect that there might be cookies alien to the application .
These cookies could be an attack on the application but are n’t necessary .
However their presence in $ _REQUEST results in application input filters going crazy or they might influence the application logic .
Therefore it is important to remember that cookies might be legal cookies of another application on the same host .
And it is also important to remember that some browsers like Firefox 2 does allow an application to set cookies valid for a whole country if the domain is like *. co.uk or *. co.kr .
While this allows cross domain user tracking , it also means any application in the country could set a cookie that is seen by your application and considered an attack .
Cookie Denial of Service ( DOS )
Taking this into account it should be obvious that any application blocking requests because of some value appearing in $ _COOKIE or $ _REQUEST is vulnerable to denial of service .
Once an attacker is able to get a cookie into the browser of a user , which is possible through XSS in one application on the same domain or cross domain vulnerabilities in browsers , it will trigger the request blocking in the application with every request .
The user will not be able to use the application anymore unless the cookie expires or he manually deletes it .
However the average user does not have a clue how to delete a cookie , which means he will be denied access forever .
NOTE : Due to PHP ’s way of ignoring trailing spaces in variable names and because cookies might be set ( sub - ) domain wide or path wide , it is not possible for the application to kill the cookie by issuing a simple Set - Cookie HTTP header .
Many open source PHP applications are vulnerable to Cookie Denial of Service because they introduced code similar to the following example to protect against PHP ’s GLOBALS overwrite problem .
if ( isset ( $_REQUEST [ ' GLOBALS ' ] ) ) { die ( " GLOBALS Overwrite attack attempt !!! " ) ; }
Because of this it is possible to deny a user access to a lot of sites in Korea or the UK by just creating a GLOBALS=1 cookie for *. co.kr/*.co.uk in older Firefox versions .
Another attack that hits many PHP applications is creating a cookie called action=logout .
Delayed Cross Site Request Forgeries / Hijacking
When $ _REQUEST is used by an application to react on user input instead of just $ _GET or $ _POST an attacker can inject certain values or actions into an application through injected cookie data instead of just killing it with a Cookie DOS .
This attack is similar to a Cross Site Request Forgery with the difference that it actually hijacks a user request instead of simply forging it and that it happens with a delay :
After the cookie is injected the CSRF is executed the next time the user uses the site .
Because the actual attack relies on hijacking an actual user request that is abused by manipulating by adding or modifying some input variables people might prefer to call it Cross Site Request Hijacking .
It is important to realise that a delayed hijacking is different from just forging the request .
This also means that traditional CSRF protections like form tokens or asking the user for his password are ineffective against this kind of attack .
Because the attack just changes some of the variables within a request the secret form tokens and / or user submitted passwords of the original request will be transmitted correctly .
A vulnerability like this was found and disclosed in phpMyAdmin a while ago .
Within phpMyAdmin it was possible to inject a cookie that would execute arbitrary SQL statements on the server the next the user logged into his phpMyAdmin account .
Another incarnation of this vulnerability class was found within a form software where the admin configuration was handled by code similar to this .
// save only modified admin options // BEWARE THIS CODE IS VULNERABLE foreach ( $_REQUEST [ ‘ options ‘ ] as $ key => $ val ) { if ( isset ( $options [ $key ] ) && $ options [ $key ] != $ val ) { saveOption ( $ key , $ val ) ; } }
In this example an attacker that is able to inject a cookie titled options [ includePath ] into the admin ’s browser will be able to remotely include arbitrary PHP code .
Because the attack relies on Delayed Cross Site Request Forgery / Hijacking the attack is even possible when the admin is not currently logged into the administrative interface .
The payload sleeps and will become effective once the admin tries to change the forum configuration the next time , although there is a CSRF protection in place .
Conclusion
Once PHP 5.3 is out it is recommended for hosters to set request_order to “ GP ” on all the servers running arbitrary PHP applications to protect applications from this kind of Cookie DOS or Delayed Cross Site Request Forgery / Hijacking vulnerabilities .
PHP Application developers on the other hand should finally move away from using $ _REQUEST for user input , because it is cleaner and more secure .
As best as I can remember , there 's a story they tell about the Sufi Muslim saint , Mullah Nasrudin , that goes something like this .
One night he was coming home after dark , and when he came around the corner , he saw what looked to him like a group of suspicious - looking people lurking by the door to his house .
Not knowing they were his students wanting to ask him something , he assumed they were robbers , so he turned around and tried to sneak away .
His students saw the master head back out into the night , and followed him .
Seeing the " robbers " following him , Nasrudin took off running .
His students , used to the master delivering odd parables to them by putting them through physical challenges , took off running after him .
Desperate to escape the " robbers , " the mullah lead his students on a night - time chase through the city , down alleys and over fences and across back yards .
But they were younger than him , and gaining on him steadily , so eventually he resorted to jumping into a trash heap and hiding in the corner , hoping they would n't notice him and would run on by .
It did n't work .
And so Nasrudin looked up and recognized , to his chagrin , the puzzled faces of his own students , just as one of them asked him , " Master , why have you brought us to this trash heap in the middle of the night ? "
And the Mullah Nasrudin answered , " Well , it 's quite complicated .
You see , you are here because of me , and I am here because of you .
" It 's the best parable I know for the subject of election fraud in the United States , this year .
The Democrats , in the interest of preventing Republican election fraud , are doing their flat level best to convince the Republicans that they themselves are engaged in massive election fraud .
The Republicans , in their equally fierce determination to stop that fraud , are doing their flat level best imitation of massive election fraud themselves .
This prompts the Democrats , in increasing desperation , to step up the activities that look like voter fraud to the Republicans , and that prompts the Republicans , desperate not to have an election stolen from them , to step up the activities that look like voter fraud to the Democrats .
Tempers are high , and fears are even higher , and they 've bled out beyond the usual confines of political insider debates into the general public .
The net result is a national hysteria , umpteen - hour lines at the early voting sites by people who are terrified of being cheated if they wait until the actual election day , the Obama campaign threatening to spend the money to put a lawyer on duty not just in every election board office but also in every single precinct in at least some swing states , serious sober calls by journalists for international election monitoring committees , and a level of confidence in the American electoral process rivaling the cynicism over Zimbabwean or Turkmenistani elections , both here among Americans and abroad in the foreign press .
How did we get here ?
It 's a long , and to me deeply fascinating , story , but let me summarize as briefly as I can .
Possibly the second most fascinating story to be left out of Americans ' history textbooks is the process by which organized crime families and mafiosi took over almost all of America 's major cities during Prohibition , and the roughly forty year grueling and inspiringly heroic struggle by crusading prosecutors and journalists and politicians to get our country back from the racketeers .
But even without it being in the textbooks , even with it being an under - studied part of our history , Americans know from folklore that the hardest part of the process was the campaign from the late 1940s to the mid 1970s to clean up our local Election Boards .
Once they got control of the police and could run extortion rackets without fear of prosecution , mafiosi in almost every major city terrified election board officials into looking the other way as they padded the election rolls with fraudulently registered dead or completely non-existent voters .
That way , if an anti-mafia mayor , prosecutor , or judge ever actually won an election , mobsters working in total impunity ( and only the thinest veneer of secrecy ) in the election board 's back room offices would make up out of whole cloth a giant stack of ballots for their guy and stuff them in .
Once Kennedy appointed a whole host of anti-mafia federal prosecutors and muck - raking journalists turned their files over to them , some minor headway got made in federal prosecutions .
But real progress only happened , quite literally , over the dead body of the mafia - allied extortionist FBI director Hoover ; once the FBI stopped covering up for the mafia and started helping the career prosecutors at the Justice Department investigate and make cases , the mafia control over our election boards collapsed like a cardboard shack in a hurricane .
But once you prove that a shadowy conspiracy has been stealing elections and getting away with it , how do you prove that you caught the last of them ?
I mentioned this to a friend of mine in the grocery store the other day , and he snarked that he could n't prove that there was n't an invisible elephant out in the parking lot , either , but that did n't make it likely .
" Sure , " I said to him , " but suppose I proved to you that just the other night somebody 's car was stomped flat by an invisible elephant , in front of witnesses -- would you still feel safe parking out there ? "
Still , that leaves those of who believe that freeing both party 's election judges from the fear of mafiosi assassination of themselves or their families left them free to stop ballot - box stuffing in the awkward position of trying to prove a negative , to prove that something does n't exist .
In fact , we can't do it ; I know from first - hand account that it does still exist , or did at least as late as 2000 when a friend of mine saw a union member from a union I 'm still a bit nervous about mentioning in public make the mistake of trying to vote with one particular fraudulently obtained voter registration card .
How did my friend know this ?
The election judge said to the guy in front of him in the line , " hey , that 'saddress you 're registered at . "
And when the Democrats say that there 's no proof that anything like this ever gets tried any more , or at most once or twice per year , let me tell you that what happened next was that the guy who was trying to double - vote ran out the door , and got away clean .
Thanks to entirely legitimate fear by Democrats that if poor voters saw police officers at the polls they would assume that people were at risk of being arrested on outstanding bench warrants if they tried to vote , something the law does n't allow , there were no police there to chase him .
Can you prove that he did n't try again at a different polling place the same day ?
Not knowing for sure how he got that fraudulent voter registration card , can you prove that there were n't a dozen more like him ?
A hundred ?
A thousand ?
Just in north St. Louis county ?
The Republicans , not entirely illegitimately terrified of ballot box stuffing , have devised what seems to them like the only way to make sure that everybody only votes once .
Ironically , it 's not the simple solution that the Iraqis used , and that many other countries have used : you must dip your finger in indelible ink at the polling place to vote .
That 'd be cheap , and to the extent ballot boxes are being stuffed by in - person double - voters , it would catch them .
Granted , that 's the most unlikely , most expensive , most labor - intensive , and most likely to get caught form of election fraud anybody 's ever invented .
Outside of party primaries where the number of voters is so small , the number of people it would take to even semi-safely stuff a ballot box one vote at a time by hand could almost certainly , with those numbers , make more a difference if they used those same people for perfectly legal campaign activities , and most political insiders I know consider there to be a lot safer and more borderline legal ways to manipulate a primary than to cheat at it .
( If that formerly entirely mobbed - up union of leg - breakers , extortioners , and assassins is still trying to stuff ballot boxes in north county , it almost has to just be out of habit . )
Neither the third world solution , nor the Republican solution , addresses the far scarier possibility of corrupted vote tallying inside the election board offices , but never mind that .
This particular form of fraud is the one that terrifies the Republicans , and they have what seems to them like an entirely fair solution to it : create a nationally regulated form of identification that clearly and unambiguously ties one person to one ID , using photos and biometrics and computerized matching to catch anybody who tries to obtain two of those IDs and requiring formal legal documents that put the burden of proof on the person asking for the ID to prove that they 're entitled to vote in American elections , and then require people to show that ID ( and , ultimately , have their biometrics checked at the polling place ) in order to vote .
Your average Republican voter does n't know anybody who does n't own a car , and assumes that all American voters have driver 's licenses .
( Here in Missouri , the last study on the subject I saw estimated that one in three rural Missouri drivers has no valid driver 's license .
We created a physical economy that requires driving , and then disqualified hundreds of thousands of people from getting licenses , and then expected those people to do what ?
Just lie down and die , instead of trying to get away with it ? )
Your average Republican voter does n't know ( or does n't realize that they know ) anyone who would have a hard time obtaining a certified original copy of their birth certificate .
( A friend of mine was born on an overseas military base , and the only records of her birth were lost in a fire at the Army Records Center decades ago .
A lawyer estimated that it would cost her $ 800 to $ 3000 , depending on whether or not the lawyer had to travel to that country to search hospital records , to actually prove her citizenship . )
Democrats , especially black Democrats , see costs ranging from dozens to thousands of dollars to obtain a voting - qualified form of ID as morally and legally equivalent to the hated " poll tax " that racist white election officials used to keep poor blacks from voting in the Jim Crow era .
So to make sure that even if Republicans find ways to cheat tens of thousands of black voters out of their ability to vote , they 've gone to phenomenal effort and expense to register so many poor voters , and especially poor black voters , that even if the poll tax cheats tens of thousands of them out of their votes , enough will get through to undo the Republicans ' voter suppression efforts .
The Republicans , seeing these thousands of almost impossible to verify voter registrations coming in from homeless people , from people whose poverty forces them to move around a lot , and so on , " recognize " this as the traditional first step in mafia - style ballot box stuffing : invent thousands of fake voters , so if you have to invent fake ballots inside the election board office you have names to use .
They 've responded with lawsuits and private investigators and database searches attempting to use , well , more or less the same software techniques that the major credit - reporting firms use to identify individuals and assemble their credit histories .
They 'd like to use better techniques , but the Democrats keep suing to stop them and winning , so they use what they have .
The result is as famously inaccurate as credit reports are .
If your credit report confuses you with someone else , if two or more people 's loans and repayments ever showed up on your credit report ( which happens to an estimated one in three people , if I recall correctly from my years working in the credit card industry ) , then according to the Republicans ' software models , the two of you probably are one person and if you both try to vote , that 's probably ballot - box stuffing .
So , to prevent it , they pushed through legislation during the years they controlled both the Congress and the White House and the Supreme Court , requiring all records that flag as " possible fraud " in a Republican 's computerized analysis as requiring that voter registration be discarded , to force those people to re-register so we can more carefully check if they really exist , really are entitled to vote , and really are voting once .
Democrats then obtain a list of literally tens of thousands of entirely legal voters who 've been flatly denied their legal right to vote , and scream bloody murder .
Which only " proves " to the Republicans that the Democrats will try to stop any effort , however well intentioned , to prevent ballot box stuffing , so they " must " be covering up ballot box stuffing .
Enough already .
This has already gone way , way too far .
For the love of all holy gods , once this election is over ?
Let 's not wait to find out what new ways of convincing each other that they 're engaged in election fraud the two parties come up with after this year .
Look , here 's my suggestion .
The other night on the Rachel Maddow show , she got a chance to ask Senator Obama if he would agree with her recent ( and surprisingly vicious and strident for her , a serious change from her usually sunny demeanor ) insistence that if local election boards do n't provide enough judges and voting booths to get people in and out in at most a couple of hours no matter what the turnout , that 's a form of poll tax , a way to keep people from voting unless they 're able to afford to go a day without pay and sure that they can do so without losing their job .
He stopped short of going along with her ; he 's more famously conciliatory to both sides than that .
But he did say this : one of the things he'd like to do if elected ( no promise made , just " like to do " or at most " we have to do " ) is do a second iteration of the Help America Vote Act that will , in part , addresses obstacles to voting .
He 's not the only one calling for more federal funding for a second round of HAVA ; the first round of HAVA lead a lot of counties to buy totally unreliable electronic voting machines that are now filling up landfills because nobody in his right mind would use one , and they need more money to buy new and more reliable voting technologies .
There is a very good chance that some small number of billions of dollars will be borrowed in the next year or two , yet another ( and in this case , an entirely legitimate ) federal intervention to protect federal elections .
When that bill comes up , here 's what I 'm going to write to the sponsors , and to my own congressman and senators , to suggest .
Let 's give both parties one billion dollars eachIf the Republicans want to subpoena everybody under the sun looking for ballot box stuffing , want to hire a ton of computer analysts and private investigators to go over the election records to catch duplicate voters , I say " go to it . "
If the Democrats use their billion dollars to subpoena every Republican campaign operative and elected official for possible evidence of intent to knowingly disenfranchise legal voters and hire the private investigators to search those emails and records , I say " go to it . "
Let 's spend the money , take the time , create the media circus of investigations that it would take this one last time to find out just how serious a problem election fraud is , by either or both parties , and put as many people as we can in jail .
And then ?
Once everybody from ACORN to Karl Rove has been investigated all to hell and gone and then either convicted or acquitted ?
Let 's allbefore we turn this country into even more of a laughable third - world banana republic than it 's already becoming .
Because wego on with both parties taking measures to fight the other side 's actual or hypothetical voting fraud that look exactly like what the other side is looking for as evidence of actual or hypothetical vote fraud .
We 're making each other crazy .
And scant hours after I posted that , one of Wired.com 's " Threat Level " columnists , Kim Zetter , posted this : " Republican Politico Admits No Proof of Voter Fraud from Fraudulent Registrations . "
Of course , as I 'm sure some Republican paranoid will point out , " absence of proof is not proof of absence . "
The average American has no idea that GM is run by a bunch of nimrods .
And even if they knew about the Machiavellian machinations behind the automakers ’ recent struggle for survival– including hiring a raft of ex-treasury officials to lobby their former employer for tens of billions of GM bailout bucks – they would n’t care .
That ’s all Inside Baseball stuff .
Joe the Public has enough on their proverbial plate just running the kids to school , keeping food on the table and putting a roof overhead .
But when it comes to buying a new car , well , that ’s a horsepower of a different color .
As they should , American car buyers have acted– and will continue to act– in their own automotive self - interest .
You can debate about the “ perception gap ” between GM and its rivals ’ products until you ’re blue in the state , but the bottom line remains : consumers prefer transplants ’ products .
It is this sharp end decision that has effectively ( if not legally ) bankrupted GM .
And there ’s no indication whatsoever that General Motors has the weaponry needed to reverse this trend .
In fact , there ’s little reason to suspect that GM will EVER have the products needed to sustain the 20 percent plus market share it needs to justify its existence .
I repeat : no matter how many tens of billions GM– or GM - Chrysler– sucks from the federal taxpayer , it has no chance of staunching the wounds that are draining its lifeblood .
Too big too fail or not , taking money from American taxpayers who have exercised their freedom to buy what they want to sustain a company who cannot produce what they want to buy is a special kind of madness ; on a scale that dwarfs even the UK ’s British Leyland debacle .
Morality , ethics , principles and pragmatism aside , there ’s history here as well .
GM ’s decision to marry its fate with Chrysler to stay afloat is pregnant with irony and foreboding .
If Chrysler had n’t suckled on the federal tit back in ’ 79 , and then paid back its loan guarantees , GM ’s current plea for federal assistance may have lacked sufficient credibility to succeed .
Thanks to Snoop Dog ’s golfing buddy , GM can point to Chrysler as a successful model of government intervention in the U.S. automobile industry .
It ’s a simple idea that resonates well even ( especially ? ) with an uniformed public : you did it before ; you can do it again !
Hell , you guys even made a profit from the Chrysler bailout– uh , guarantees !
Yes , well , one small problem : Chrysler ’s about to go away .
Assuming GM merges with Chrysler– hoovering any remaining ChryCo cash and releasing 2 Big 2 Fail ’s song “ Obama ’s Yo Mama ” – the argument that Chrysler is a template for recovery kinda sorta disappears .
In other words , the deal transforms the success of the last bailout– uh , loan guarantees– into an abject failure .
Sure , GM wo n’t touch Chrysler initially – for that very reason .
But the media ai n’t dopes .
They ’ve already picked - up the scent of the story that gives them an instant , persistent info - stiffie : job losses .
As TTAC commentator thalter points out , “ spending government money to facilitate layoffs is not going to sit well with the American people . ”
That ’s doubly true if and when GM ’s monumental management compensation and Cerberus ’ deep pockets come to light .
GM is counting on speed and stealth to get their bailout bucks before the truth hits the public consciousness ( a.k.a. public hearings ) .
CEO Rick Wagoner and his minions know they ’re already behind the eight ball from a PR perspective ; the average American reckons all this trouble is Detroit ’s own fault , for building gas - sucking SUVs rather than … something else .
As sure as eggs is eggs , bailout fatigue , a genuine conservative backlash and the post-election diminution of Michigan ’s political power are all coming down the pike .
And just like the $ 700 b bailout bill , the chances are good that GM will sneak under the wire and get their money .
But here ’s the thing : it will be a Pyrrhic victory .
The attendant publicity may paint GM as a victim , but it will also paint a big ass L ( for loser ) on every single one of its 1,274 products .
Even as GM makes its case to reporters ( under the guise of anonymous sources ) , wooing the politicos and Powers
That be , they ’re stigmatizing their products to the only people who really matter : car buyers .
Zoom back into the micro-level , and this soon - to - be highly publicized bailout will hand American consumers yet another reason not to buy a GM product .
Protect American jobs ?
Of course .
But …
If , indeed , no one wants to buy a vehicle from a bankrupt automaker , it ’s also true that not everyone wants to buy a car from a “ troubled ” one .
Not to put too fine a point on it , when it comes to family finances , there ’s no such thing as a sympathy fuck .
Main advantage Functionality
When it comes to the question of whether this thing does its job or not , the clear answer to that is a total yes .
You can certainly rely on this brace to help you get back on your feet again and to give you that extra power that you need .

Suspected militants risk being shot on sight in Israel
An Israeli teenager has been arrested after he donned a mask and prowled the streets of his town with a big rucksack and toy gun for a school project .
The boy , 15 , was seized by police in the southern town of Ashdod suspecting he was a Palestinian militant .
The student was quoted as saying he was researching police reactions in the town and " just wanted to get an A + " .
The stunt was considered highly risky in Israel , where attackers are often shot by police or civilians .
Ashdod police commander Chief Superintendent Danny Elgarat told the BBC the Jewish teenager in question was " normal " and could even be considered a " gifted " pupil .
Shooting risk
He carried binoculars and wore his father 's military fatigues as he made an appearance near one of the city 's malls .
Anxious residents soon began calling the police , fearing the rucksack contained an explosive device .
After a search , armed officers located the youth , surrounded him and ordered him to freeze , at which point he revealed his identity .
" Had he attempted to flee he would unquestionably have been shot , " the Israeli newspaper Yehdiot Ahranot pointed out .
The youth was later released on bail and was not charged .
" It 's fine - he tested the police reaction , " Mr Elgaret said .
Israel has faced numerous attacks on civilians by Palestinian militants in recent years , although there have been few in the past year .
Ashdod is located not far from the Gaza Strip , which is controlled by the militant group Hamas .
JACKSONVILLE , Fla. , Nov. 4 ( UPI ) -- A Florida school board has voted to keep the name of a Confederate general and early leader of the Ku Klux Klan on one of its high schools .
Members of the Duval County Board of Education dismissed the controversy over having a Jacksonville school named after Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest and said the community 's energy would be better spent helping the district improve its dismal academic record , the ( Jacksonville ) Florida Times - Union said Tuesday .

" The children did n't ask anybody to change the name of their school ; the children asked for help to read and write , " board member Vicki Drake said prior to Monday 's 5 - 2 vote to keep Forrest High as is .
The two dissenting votes were cast by the board 's two African - American members , who agreed with critics who said it was time to change the name that had been applied in 1958 as a rebuke of the Supreme Court 's ruling banning school segregation .
The newspaper said the board heard more than two hours of public testimony , including statements that said Forrest 's early association with the Klan was a bad rap , and that the ex-general had actually become a proponent of civil rights during Reconstruction .

ABC : Three of four Palin friends wo n't commit to voting for her David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday September 9 , 2008
Print This Email This
In the short period since she was announced as John McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin 's personal attitudes and beliefs have remained something of a mystery .
In search of insights , ABC News sent Lisa Fletcher to Wasilla , Alaska to speak to " the women who know her best . "
Fletcher interviewed four of Palin 's closest friends , members of a group who jokingly call themselves " the Elite Six . "
The six women , including Palin , met 15 years ago at an aerobics class and started getting together after class as well .
When asked to reveal something about Palin that no one knows , one woman offered , " She does n't care for cats very much , " and another chimed in , " Oh , yes , she 's afraid of my cat . "
A third added , " She lives off of caffeine and chocolate . "
When asked what the American public really needs to know about Palin , one asserted , " She 's honest as the day is long , and that is a unique personality trait for a politician these days . "
Palin 's honesty has come into question this past week , in light of her claims to have opposed the " bridge to nowhere . "
Although the women told Fletcher that they did n't discuss politics much among themselves , one did venture that there were certain things Palin had done as governor that she did n't agree with , including " the polar bear issue . "
Palin has sued the federal government to stop the listing of polar bears as an endangered species .
" Is it possible to be pro-choice and vote for Sarah Palin ? " Fletcher asked .
A couple of the women responded that they were pro-choice , with the one who seemed to have the most doubts about Palin explaining , " I ca n't necessarily say who I 'm going to vote for .
... I have n't made up my mind yet .
... I do n't agree with everything Sarah says .
... I have n't committed to voting for anybody . "
Another added , " I have never voted for a Republican for presidential and this may be the first time .
...
I 'm real excited to see the debates and make up my mind -- but I 'm not committed . "
Just one of the women said outright that she was voting for McCain because once he selected Palin , " I knew that she would help our nation go forward . "
The fourth woman , the one who had described Palin as honest , declined to answer , saying , " My vote is very personal , and it 's between me and the voting booth ... but I love Sarah to pieces . "

Portable Generator Harnesses Energy From Your Bike
November 4th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Yesterday we took a look at the energy - harvesting bionic knee brace .
Continuing with this trend of human movement - induced energy production , designer Deco Goodman has created the Commuter Cyclist ’s Sustainable Energy Source .
The device , which is located in the rear tail - light assembly , captures energy generated in the seat post spring and the brakes during movement .
Goodman ’s design uses a tower of piezoelectric chips as shock absorbers .
When jostled , the chips generate electricity and charge the portable storage unit attached to the bike .
Unfortunately , Goodman does n’t provide details on the amount of energy created by his device , though it is not unreasonable to think that it would be enough to partially power an iPod or cell phone .
And since the device was created as part of an Infrastructure Design Class this past year , we probably wo n’t see it on the market anytime soon .
Here ’s hoping some enterprising manufacturer contacts Goodman and gets this out on store shelves .

US Dollar Doomed as Credit Crisis Turning into a Currency Crisis
When the precious metals were smashed out of nowhere and the dollar started climbing this summer I became very worried .
I did n't question my conviction that commodities are in a bull market , or that precious metals in particular are undervalued .
I felt something sinister was at work .
Neither move was justified on a fundamental level .
I assumed that something very bad was about to happen and the metals needed to be brought lower in advance of the bad news .
Now we have a glimpse at the ugly consequences foreseen by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
In early September , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized with a financial commitment of USD $ 200 billion from the taxpayers .
Incredibly , the loan limits at the former GSEs were raised from $ 417,000 to $ 729,750 in March when it was more than obvious these institutions needed to be reined in .
Like most bailouts and bank failures , this one was announced on a weekend to limit the impact on the stock markets .
As I mentioned in last month 's issue , Treasury Secretary Paulson was under severe pressure to act , as the Chinese started selling Fannie and Freddie bonds while threatening further retribution .
Common shareholders were left with nothing , while bondholders like Pimco and Asian central banks benefited .
The small investor was stung again , as taxpayer dollars were used to bail out foreigners and wealthy Americans in a policy that Jim Rogers terms “ socialism for the rich . ”
Unfortunately , $ 200 billion is just the tip of the iceberg .
As the government has assumed responsibility for Fannie and Freddie 's $ 5.4 trillion in liabilities , the Congressional Budget Office correctly states that these institutions “ should be directly incorporated into the federal budget . ”
The Bush Administration has strongly opposed this move .
Many commentators claim that the former GSE 's liabilities are not like usual government debt , as the mortgages are backed by homes .
However , Catherine Austin Fitts indicates that many of the Fannie , Freddie and FHA loans are actually fraudulent , as the same property is sold repeatedly to phantom buyers or the property does not actually exist .
At least $ 1 trillion of Fannie and Freddie 's mortgages are already in trouble , and the data on mortgage resets indicates the problem will not end until 2012 .
This bailout effectively doubled America 's publicly traded debt overnight .
On September 14 , the Fannie and Freddie bombshell was followed by the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America for $ 50 billion .
Paulson admitted he was involved with the Merrill Lynch purchase at a steep premium to the market price .
Bank of America is hardly a bastion of stability however , as over half its builders loans “ are considered troubled . ”
The institution is a leading issuer of consumer credit cards , and with the U.S. in a recession , much of this debt will default .
Bank of America already bought subprime lender Countrywide earlier this year in a curious deal where the firm refused to take on many of Countrywide 's liabilities .
On the same day , the 158 - year - old Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy .
After guaranteeing JPMorgan Chase 's purchase of Bear Stearns in March and taking over the mortgage giants , the U.S. Government sternly insisted that Lehman should be allowed to fail .
Not only did this bankruptcy spook the markets and cast doubt on the solvency of other investment banks like Goldman Sachs , but it opened up the Pandora 's Box of counterparty risk .
Holders of swaps and other derivatives who had won bets with Lehman could no longer collect , and these contracts reverted to their intrinsic value - zero .
Investors in Lehman 's stocks and bonds were wiped out as well , and institutions had new losses on their balance sheets that needed to be written off .
Highly leveraged banks were unable to meet their derivative obligations , so they became insolvent .
Fearing contagion , financial institutions sharply raised Libor rates and other measures of interbank lending as they lost faith in their peers ' ability to repay loans , and credit began to freeze up .
After viewing the debacle caused by Lehman 's failure , Paulson and Bernanke decided it was too risky to let another derivatives - laden firm go under .
This time it was n't even a bank they felt compelled to bail out .
AIG was rescued due to its large size and involvement in all kinds of international markets , with the bulk of its business in reinsurance ( insuring other insurers ) .
Not surprisingly , the $ 85 billion loan to AIG prevented a $ 20 billion loss to Paulson 's old firm , Goldman Sachs .
AIG 's involvement in derivatives is consistent with their history of questionable behavior .
The giant insurer had a pre- eminent role in precious metals trading , and was suspected to be one of the large silver shorts before its abrupt departure from the market in 2004 .
In 2005 , then - CEO Maurice Greenberg was forced to resign over an accounting scandal that involved $ 1.7 billion in fraud .
Curiously , no criminal charges were filed unlike a similar situation at Enron .
AIG was just one of many bailouts as this month just kept getting worse .
A few days later , three money market funds administered by Reserve Management Corporation “ broke the buck ” due to investments in Lehman .
Although money market funds had a reputation as an extremely safe investment , clients lost part of their principal and were unable to redeem their funds for a week .
Not reassured by government officials or fund managers , consumers began fleeing the $ 3.4 trillion market .
To prevent a full - blown panic , the U.S. Treasury decided to insure the funds for up to $ 50 billion for current investors .
On September 18 , the Treasury announced it would issue $ 100 billion in new debt to replenish the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet .
The Fed needed the boost after “ Helicopter Ben ” dumped a huge load of dollars into the economy through unconventional means .
In retrospect , this must have been preparation for the expansion of credit through the discount window .
Borrowing by primary dealers and commercial banks exploded last week , doubling to over $ 262 billion .
I doubt it 's a coincidence that on September 21 , the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to convert to bank holding companies , easing the standards for collateral pledged in return for loans .
Not only will these converted firms be able increase their liquidity on very favorable terms , they can court federally insured customer deposits for the first time .
In August , I published a chart of Washington Mutual , and predicted its imminent failure .
WaMu was seized by the FDIC on September 25 , and has filed for bankruptcy .
The majority of branches and assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase .
However , the bank refused to acquire WaMu 's liabilities , leaving shareholders and bondholders out in the cold .
The new CEO of WaMu , Alan Fishman received $ 20 million for less than three weeks of work .
It 's unknown what the burden on the U.S. tax base will be .
The bailouts continued this week , as the U.S. Senate passed a bill on September 28 awarding $ 25 billion in subsidized loans to automakers .
The car companies will not have to make payments for five years .
That was a modest giveaway compared to the FDIC 's involvement in the Wachovia sale the following day .
Citigroup took over the struggling Wachovia Bank , agreeing to absorb the first $ 42 billion in losses with the FDIC assuming the remainder .
Fed chief Bernanke approved the FDIC 's involvement , stating it will help stabilize the markets .
In exchange for $ 12 billion in preferred shares and warrants in Citigroup , the FDIC became liable for losses up to $ 270 billion .
As I predicted , the FDIC is running short of funds to repay depositors in failing banks and may need to borrow tax dollars from the Treasury .
Not surprisingly , the ever larger bailout packages proposed by the Bush Administration have created heavy backlash from the American public .
While many citizens are losing their jobs and their homes , financial executives like John Thain receive multi-million dollar paydays as a reward for their spectacular failures .
Although most media outlets neglected to report it , hundreds of protestors on Wall Street demonstrated against the bailouts last week , many holding signs reading “ Jump ! ”
Despite fear - mongering by President Bush , the last scheme proposed was too much for Americans to bear .
In the Troubled Asset Relief Program bill ( TARP ) , Paulson effectively asked to be the financial dictator of the U.S.
The Treasury Secretary insisted that he needed $ 700 billion to buy whatever toxic assets he chose , without oversight or input from any court or administrative agency .
This bill was rejected by the House of Representatives this week under heavy pressure from angry constituents .
However , a revamped bill with added sweeteners looks likely to pass soon .
Since Congress was not very cooperative , the Federal Reserve added $ 330 billion in bank swaps with foreign central banks to boost the availability of dollars worldwide .
Bernanke also expanded the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) by $ 300 billion for a new total of $ 450 billion .
The TAF has even looser standards than the discount window which was was supposed to be the lender of last resort , but the TAF charges a premium to market rates .
The Fed had already eased its lax standards on September 14 , accepting a wider range of collateral for loans .
So even as the Congress was rejecting a $ 700 billion bailout , the Fed was quietly conducting its own $ 630 billion bailout .
After the House rejected the TARP proposal on September 29 , Paulson , Bernanke , and the rest of the Plunge Protection Team had to make their predictions of dire consequences look correct .
They allowed the Dow to crash 777 points - a new record - while gold soared .
However , the PPT is afraid of causing too much panic among the public , so they orchestrated a rally the following day .
The dollar surged 1.58 , and the precious metals were stomped to force investors out of hard assets into Treasuries and other paper .
This essay was one of the most difficult I have ever written as the situation was so dynamic .
It seemed that no sooner did I explain a Bernanke statement or a Paulson tactic than my writing became out of date , and a fresh crisis would sweep the old one off the front pages .
I believe that the speed of the bailouts indicates desperation in Washington .
The Bush Administration is no longer able to plan far ahead , but must react to swiftly changing market conditions .
Despite Bernanke 's assurances to the contrary , these bailouts mean tremendous inflation of the money supply .
The U.S. can no longer avoid hyperinflation - it is here .
The effects can hardly be overstated when the reserve currency of the world is debased so rapidly .
Empires disintegrate and social upheaval occurs .
Dollar depreciation is not apparent to the masses yet , but once the realization occurs , the social effect will be explosive .
I believe this is why a U.S. Army brigade from the 3rd Infantry Division has been given orders to patrol America “ to help with civil unrest and crowd control .
The dollar is doomed but most people do n't know it yet .
I recently spoke with a friend who was born in Mexico , and he agreed that the American public cannot imagine their currency failing .
While U.S. citizens think that a currency crisis is the end of the world , Mexicans have experienced this multiple times .
The central bank lops a few zeros off the currency and it 's given a new name .
The smart people have moved their wealth into a different form long before that happens .
Even if Jim Sinclair is correct and the U.S. Dollar is rescued by linking it to gold in a Federal Reserve Gold Certificate Total Value Ratio , it will not be the same dollar we know today .
Americans will soon learn to change their mindset from focusing on their return on capital , to worrying about conserving the capital they have left .
We have seen the beginning of this paradigm shift in the run on banks , and the flight to Treasury instruments .
Investors need to insure their portfolio is full of precious metals and other commodity - related assets .
While hard assets have suffered lately , that will inevitably change as mistrust spreads throughout the financial system .
If you position yourself appropriately , your wealth can not only survive the currency crisis but also secure your future .

05 Oct 08 , 14:47 Bail - outs total over 2.2 trillion
Jennifer omits , in her excellent article , the mysterious $ 130bn which was funnelled from JP Morgan to Lehman to cover derivatives exposure .
Most , if not all , of that money came from the Fed .
Surely the most expensive NON - bailout of any firm in history ...

Jennifer , great article , but you fail to account for the fact that currency valuations are in relative terms .
Europe is now in far worse shape than the U.S. is .
This is the reason the USD has risen recently relative to the Euro .
The world is also in a global slowdown which causes deflation ( hence the recent Fed actions have not caused short term inflation ) .
The central banks around the world ( not just the Fed ) will cause world reflation , most liekly by a corodinated rate cut .
I agree the USD is going to be weaker long term , but not the doomsday scenario you predict .
( a weaker USD may actually be better for the U.S. economy as well ; with the deleveraging of the American consumer , consumer demand , which is 2/3 of GDP , will fall .
The weaker USD will help boost exports another factor in GDP ) Eventually the Fed will raise interest rates , which will make the USD stronger and curb inflation .
I beleive we are in for a prolonged stagnant growth period .
Plus can you imagine the world ramifications if the dollar was no longer the reserve currency ?
Any thoughts ?

PARIS
THE 2008 Paris Motor
Show was a showcase for a new generation of electric cars like the Chevrolet Volt and gasoline - electric hybrids like the 2009 Honda Insight .
But perhaps the most technologically advanced model introduced in Paris was the 2012 Volage electric car , by Venturi , Monaco ’s only automaker .
In the context of developing automobiles , 2012 is not far off .
One the one hand , the Venturi has already developed a viable electric car , the Fetish , which it first displayed in 2004 and billed as the world ’s first two - seat electric sports car .
On the other , the Fetish is still not available .
Sales were scheduled to begin this year , but were delayed for undisclosed reasons until 2009 .
Venturi has said it will make only 25 , to be sold at $ 400,000 each .
Although the price of the Volage has yet to be announced , the company said it would cost more than the Fetish , probably around $ 500,000 .
Venturi said each of its cars , which are custom built , would take about four months to complete at its Monaco production facility .
A very limited production run is planned for the Volage , the company said .
The Volage generates power much differently than the Fetish , which relies on an electric traction motor .
The Volage , a joint venture with Michelin , uses Michelin ’s Active
Wheel technology , in which the propulsion system , suspension and other components are housed in the wheels .
A Canadian University Students Association is causing local outrage after deciding to withdraw support for a Cystic Fibrosis charity because Cystic Fibrosis is a “ white disease . ”
If that ’s not bad enough , the same group also noted that it affects mostly men as well
The Carleton University Students Association voted Monday night in favour of choosing a new charity to support during its orientation week in September , in place of Shinerama , which raises money for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation .
The Globe and Mail reported that the student council motion stated that orientation week “ strives to be inclusive ” and “ all orientees and volunteers should feel like their fundraising efforts will serve their diverse communities . ”
Shinerama foundation CEO Cathleen Morrison noted that CF is a fatal genetic disease that affects males and females equally , and although it is more prevelent among white people , it affects people of European , North African , Middle Eastern and South Asian descent , although black and East Asian populations are n’t immune .

Barack Obama may have gotten a post - debate boost , despite some saying it was a tie .
Post debate , Obama 's lead grows
Two days after a presidential debate many commentators scored as a tie , it 's beginning to look like the public saw things differently , as several polls show a small but significant post - debate boost for Barack Obama .
A USA Today / Gallup poll released Sunday showed 46 percent of debate - watchers believed Obama outperformed John McCain , while .
just 34 percent said McCain got the better of the exchange .

Thirty percent of debate - watchers said they had a more favorable opinion of Obama following the debate , compared with just 14 percent who said their opinion of him had worsened .
Respondents whose opinion of McCain changed as a result of the debate were evenly split , as 21 percent said their view of McCain had improved because of it and 21 percent said it had worsened .
The poll surveyed 701 adults who watched Friday 's debate , and all interviews were conducted on Saturday .
Obama 's numbers have ticked up nationally since the debate , the first of three scheduled this year , along with next Thursday 's vice - presidential face - off .
In the Sunday update to Gallup 's daily tracking poll , Obama widened his lead over McCain to 50 - 42 percent .
Friday , in polling that preceded the debate , Obama had a five - point , 49 - 44 percent advantage .
Gallup 's Sunday poll reflected polling from September 25 - 27 , and included just one full day of interviews conducted following the debate in Oxford , Miss .
If Obama 's improvement does stem from his debate performance , his numbers could rise further over the next few days as the proportion of polling conducted after the debate increases .
Similarly , in the Rasmussen Reports automated tracking poll , Obama opened up a six - point , 50 - 44 percent , edge over McCain this weekend in both Saturday and Sunday 's updates .
These numbers seem to match the results of snap polls taken after the conclusion of the debate , which showed Obama winning over more viewers than McCain .
A CNN poll conducted Friday night by Opinion Research Corp. gave Obama a thirteen - point advantage over his opponent , with 51 percent of viewers saying the Illinois senator won the debate and 57 percent saying he exceeded their expectations .
Just 38 percent said McCain 's performance was stronger , though 60 percent said he exceeded their expectations .
A Bloomberg / Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday gave Obama a narrower , 49 - 45 percent edge among debate - watchers , consistent with the lead he held in surveys prior to the debate .
But according to this poll , he scored very high on a question asking which candidate appeared more ' presidential , ' besting McCain 46 - 33 percent .
In a CBS / Knowledge Networks poll conducted just after the debate , Obama led by a similar , fifteen - point margin , with 39 percent of respondents saying he won the debate , compared with only 24 percent who believed McCain came out on top .
And in a focus group conducted during the debate by Democracy Corps , a firm run by Democratic strategists Stan Greenberg and James Carville , Obama made inroads among undecided voters .
Thirty - eight percent of these voters believed Obama won the debate , with 27 percent handing the win to McCain .
And among these focus group participants , two - thirds of whom voted for President George W. Bush in the 2004 election , Obama improved his favorability rating from 40 percent to 69 percent .
While such instant surveys can be unreliable , this weekend 's USA / Today Gallup survey and tracking polls fall in line with their results .
In a Sunday appearance on Fox News Channel , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , one of McCain 's most fervent supporters , defended McCain 's debate performance but acknowledged Obama 's improved standing .
" Sen . Obama helped himself , according to the polls , " Graham told anchor Chris Wallace , " Quite frankly , I thought he presented himself well . "
It was an unassuming little web page that posed a singular challenge : could you build a complete website using less than 5 kilobytes ?
Article Continues Below
5K ? Was contest creator Stewart Butterfield nuts ?
The rules of the 5K Awards , in their entirety , read as follows : “ All HTML , script , image , style , and any other associated files must collectively total less than 5 kilobytes in size and be entirely self - contained ( employing no server - side processing ) . ”
Great .
All he left out was the part about not using a monitor or keyboard .
And the flagellation , of course .
One of the most - respected designers on the web told us privately : “ It ca n’t be done . ”
We nodded sagely .
After all , we routinely lavish at least 5 K per page on JavaScript alone .
And not fancy JavaScript , either .
We ’re talking basic stuff : sniffer scripts , event handlers , maybe a rollover or two .
5 K ? That ’s a comment above a table cell .
5 K for an entire site ?
The very idea was … was … brilliant .
The original 5 K call for entries explained the thinking behind the contest :
[ R ] igid constraints of designing for the web … force us to get truly creative .
Between servers and bandwidth , clients and users , HTML and the DOM , browsers and platforms , our conscience and our ego , we ’re left in a very small space to find highly optimal solutions .
Since the space we have to explore is so small , we have to look harder , get more creative ; and that ’s what makes it all interesting .
The challenge and its rationale electrified the web design community like nothing had done in a long , long time .
With no budget , no PR firm , no sponsors , no caterers , no rented hall , no celebrity judges , no entry fees , no TV cameras , and no real prizes ( not even tee shirts ) , the 5K Awards and its humble call for entries conjured an outpouring of amazing work .
Halfway through the judging , we hated this contest .
Not because the work was bad .
But because so much of it was so very , very good .
Arguably , more great work was submitted to this contest than to many of this year ’s big - time awards shows .
It was nearly impossible to pick a clear winner from among so many instances of sheer creative excellence .
And we could n’t help feeling unworthy , as one artist after another did more with their 5 K than we typically pull off with 50 .
Deep , hurtful shame was what we felt .
Like that time after swimming class .
With that kid .
But we digress .
Why the big to - do ? # section2
Never before had so many given so much to create so little .
Why was everybody so inspired ?
Theory number one : #section3
Designers and web users alike have burned out on big , bloated commercial sites requiring ever - greater connection speeds to deliver ever - diminishing returns .
Here was a chance to get back to the basics of clarity , brevity , and bandwidth .
A chance to escape , however temporarily , the terrible info - glut that the web has become .
And maybe to rub our clients ’ and project managers ’ faces in what the web could be if designers and programmers were in charge .
Theory number two : #section4
Contestants dug it because they got to lose the power tools , and work with their hands again .
Think about the tools we ’ve been given in the past couple of years .
Photoshop and ImageReady not only get the web , they will cut our images apart for us , and code the rollovers if we want them to .
If we wish , we ’ve got Dreamweaver , Fireworks , GoLive and beyond to do still more of the heavy lifting for us .
And with Flash , Shockwave , and Quicktime , we can create nearly any effect we desire .
In a strange way , all that power may inhibit us from imagining differently .
It becomes so easy to open our favorite application , perform our usual tricks , and push the button .
Sure , the 5k reminded us that most of our viewers do not enjoy unlimited bandwidth .
But on a deeper level , it brought back the roots and spirit of the web .
The 5 K was a blast from the ( recent ) past , when we had no serious tools with which to build the web .
When the medium itself was funky and experimental , and millions of dollars did not ride on every click of the mouse .
When we knocked ourselves out to communicate , and maybe even to create beauty , in spite of the medium ’s appalling limitations .
Maybe , like aged and bloated Charles Foster Kanes , we felt trapped in a bubble of success .
And maybe we were longing for Rosebud .
The contestants – and not just the winners – were so into it , one even went so far as to assign single - letter names to his JavaScript variables , in order to shave a few extra bytes .
That ’s dedication .
Actually , that ’s frightening dedication .
We hear this contestant later stuck his hand in the fire because he thought Richard Nixon had asked him to .
Not only did all contestants find ingenious ways to build complete sites in less than 5 K , many actually created sites that were emotionally moving , visually dazzling , sardonically pointed – or all three .
In other words , many of these works would have been better than much of what ’s on the web even if they had used 100 K ( or a thousand ) to make their points .
Indeed , the winning site offered a witty yet powerful critique of the current state of the web via a fully functional e-commerce shopping cart .
In less than 5 K .
Bastards .
The winners , determined by calculating the median values of numerical scores assigned by the judges , are available for your viewing pleasure .
The lessons of 5 k#section5
Limitations are the soil from which creativity grows .
It is possible to create engaging work – witty , pointed , charming , poignant , dazzling , gripping , moving – while respecting the bandwidth and other limitations of the medium .
Since it is possible to do so , and since doing so serves both the audience and the medium , we ought to do more of this , and less of what we usually do .
If we really believe in the web as a powerful , dynamic , and democratic medium , let ’s put our money where our bandwidth is n’t .

US intelligence officials kept a file on former prime minister Tony Blair 's " private life " , a former US navy communications operator claimed today .
David Murfee Faulk , who worked at a listening post in Fort Gordon , Georgia , told ABCNews.com he saw the file on Blair in 2006 .
But he refused to provide details of what the file , held in an intelligence database called Anchory , contained , other than to say it was a file on his " private life " and included information of a personal nature .
Faulk also said he heard " pillow talk " phone calls of Iraq 's first interim president , Ghazi al - Yawer , another key US ally , when he worked as a US Army Arab linguist assigned to a US National Security Agency ( NSA ) facility at Fort Gordon , Georgia , between 2003 and 2007 .
While not illegal to collect information on foreign leaders , the US and the UK have pledged " not to collect on each other " , several former US intelligence officials told ABC .
The NSA works closely and shares data with its British counterpart , the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) .
" If it is true that we maintained a file on Blair , it would represent a huge breach of the agreement we have with the Brits , " one former CIA official said .
In the case of the former Iraqi president , Faulk said the phone calls were to al - Yawer 's fiance , Nasrin Barwari , the minister of public works in the interim government , whom he later married .
Faulk described the al - Yawer calls as " courting , wooing and pillow talk " .
Al - Yawer was the first president of Iraq 's interim government between 2004 and 2005 .
At the same time US intelligence was monitoring al - Yawer 's private calls , George Bush said he was " really honoured " to be greeting him at a meeting in the Oval Office .
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News the agency followed all the laws but declined to comment on the specifics of Faulk 's allegations .
Last month , Faulk was one of two men who revealed that US intelligence officials intercepted the private phone calls of American journalists , aid workers and soldiers stationed in Iraq .
From the " not bad for Free " files :
The Linux Foundation is set to release a report on Wednesday estimating that the Linux ecosystem is now worth $ 25 billion .
The $ 25 billion figure is one that I 'm surprised at because its lower than other forecasts I 've seen over the years .
Or is it ?
I 'm not sure how the Linux Foundation has compiled their numbers as I have not seen their report .
The only tidbit of info I have so far is that the LInux Foundation has valued Google 's use of Linux for Android at $ 1.3 billion worth of R&D .
I would assume that the forecast also includes direct revenues from Linux vendors as well as hardware revenue derived from Linux server sales .
A really accurate forecast would also include revenues from routing hardware ( from Cisco , Juniper , Nortel and others ) that is all powered by a Linux OS .
So why do I think the $ 25 billion figure is a bit low ?
In 2008 , IDC forecast that the Linux ecosystem would be worth $ 49 billion by 2011 .
That report coincidentally was sponsored by the Linux Foundation as well .
IDC pegged the value of the 2007 Linux ecosystem at $ 21 billion .
At that point ( 2007 ) IDC noted that Linux only accounted for 4 percent of the $ 242 billion spent annually on all software .
So yes I suppose that $ 25 billion is an accomplishment that needs to be recognized .
But take it with a grain of salt .
If IDC 's 2008 projection was accurate 2009 / 2010 will see some massive growth - then again maybe IDC was just wrong .
In the context of the overall software market it's also clear that Linux is a player but it certainly has alot of room to grow .

" You and I will be together

I have been tricked by flying too close
to what I thought I loved .
Now the candleflame is out , the wine spilled ,
and the lovers have withdrawn
somewhere beyond my squinting .
The amount I thought I 'd won , I 've lost .
My prayers becomes bitter and all about blindness .
How wonderful it was to be for a while
with those who surrender .
Others only turn their faces on way ,
then another , like pigeon in flight .

In The Arc Of Your Mallet
Do n't go anywhere without me .
Let nothing happen in the sky apart from me ,
or on the ground , in this world or that world ,
without my being in its happening .
Vision , see nothing I do n't see .
Language , say nothing .
The way the night knows itself with the moon ,
be that with me .
Be the rose
nearest to the thorn that I am .
I want to feel myself in you when you taste food ,
in the arc of your mallet when you work ,
when you visit friends , when you go
up on the roof by yourself at night .
There 's nothing worse than to walk out along the street
without you .
I do n't know where I 'm going .
You 're the road , and the knower of roads ,
more than maps , more than love .
The Essential Rumi Coleman Barks
Although few anticipated the global shock waves that accompanied the market slide , internal planners had long been aware that a downturn was in the making .
Even as far back as late - 2001 , when terrorism insurance became a major issue , museums predicted a drop in loans and urged curators to focus on inventive shows drawing from their permanent collections .
Evidence that museums have been more creative with their holdings ranges from MoMA ’s van Gogh exhibition , which uses the museum ’s “ Starry Night ” as its centerpiece , to “ Kirchner and the Berlin Street , ” which revolves around two seminal paintings owned by the museum , although both shows include loans from the United States and abroad .
The Metropolitan Museum of Art , which for years has been presenting shows based on its holdings , will open “ Reality Check : Truth and Illusion in Contemporary Photography ” on Nov. 4 , featuring 30 works from its holdings .
Many predict that the impact of the slowdown will become far clearer at the end of the year , by which time most individuals will have made their annual tax - deductible donations .
Museum officials will also be holding their breath to see whether loyal donors continue to give art or will be forced to sell part of their collections to raise capital for themselves .
“ There is bound to be belt - tightening across the board , ” said Michael Govan , director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art .
“ I imagine a lot of donors who are leveraged will probably be postponing decisions until the first of the year .
A lot of people are waiting to see what happens , which means things will be put on hold . ”
Mr. Govan said that he also wondered how the economic crisis would affect memberships , a crucial revenue stream for all museums .
“ We ’re competing with buying gas and going out to dinner , ” he said .

The Los Angeles museum ’s memberships , which bring in about $ 8 million a year , range from $ 25 at the student level to $ 50,000 for members of the Director ’s Circle ( a status that affords what the museum terms “ intimate dinners with artists and the director ” ) .
Sony 's touted its ten - year plan for the PlayStation 3 often enough that it 's clear the company 's determined to bestow its current console with the same long lifecycle enjoyed by its predecessor -- but as the PlayStation 2 is an exception in console history , it 's a daunting objective .
Sony Computer Entertainment of America product marketing VP Scott Steinberg is charged with making sure all three of Sony 's current gaming platforms fulfill the 10 - year lifecycle plan , orders that come straight down from the top .
" Our motivations and ambitions , of course , are to continue on all three platforms , " Steinberg says as part of an in - depth Gamasutra interview .
" The ten - year strategy is ingrained in all of us .
[ SCEA president and CEO ] Jack [ Tretton ] has brought that to all levels of the organization .
" A veteran of Sega during its Genesis era , Steinberg has had an expansive role with Sony since he joined last September to head up both hardware and software marketing .
PlayStation 2 may be already most of the way through its planned decade , but the lifecycle of the PS3 must be considered newly begun if it's to reach its goal -- and the hardware marketplace is unarguably much more competitive now .
In Steinberg 's eyes , the PS3's " future - proofing , " as well as the balance of its media and gaming capabilities , are what will give the system its legs , as the company plans a " roadmap " of firmware updates and added functionality for the machine .
Steinberg 's assertion that part of the PS3's value lies in its potential to expand and evolve aligns with CEO Howard Stringer 's past statements on his company 's newest console -- in 2006 , Stringer commented , " The price of the PS3 is high , but you 're paying for potential , " a statement that rankled some gamers who were more interested in immediate returns on their dollars .
Sony would rather update a platform than introduce a new hardware iteration , Steinberg says .
" We do not have a planned obsolescence strategy , " he says , pointing to the PSP as another example .
" Whether it 's Skype or some other peripherals , it 's not just a dumb terminal that lies secluded and is n't enhanced with all the recent technologies and opportunities .
" Unsurprisingly , he also sees the Blu-ray Disc format as a significant competitive advantage .
" Blu-ray is bigger , and Blu-ray games are going to be the biggest games in the industry , " he says .
" I think that feeds into [ gamers ' ] choices as well .
... I think there are a lot of great ' a - ha 's that consumers are going to find with music , and the movie store .
... You buy it for a gaming machine , but it delivers on a value proposition .
" Sony also hopes the past will help usher in the future -- Steinberg sees Sony 's ubiquitous PlayStation 2 as something of a Trojan horse .
" Every million units of PS2s we sell in 2008 is just a great opportunity for us to upgrade as they get closer to HD households , " he argues .
" The HD curve is spectacular , and the conversion is happening , so we see that as a natural marketing campaign . "
It seems when push comes to shove it's the people that get shoved .
Although we had little to do with the problems of the financial world it looks as if we are the ones who will pay in the long run .
I have tried to justify this bailout in my mind and it just does n't add up .
I thank both the 228 democrats and the republicans who have held out for a better deal , without their support we would be owing 700 Billion by now .
The problem is we need to get the problem solved and solved sooner than later .
IF Nancy Pelosi would get her head out of her derriere long enough to work with all parties instead of trying to lay a blame blanket on the republicans it might just come together .
Everyone knows the seriousness of the situation and should be willing to work these details out in a package that we can at least swallow without choking .
This package should include the recovery of much of the monies paid out to the candidates as well as the former managers of Fannie and Freddie .
Senator Dodd and Frank should be among those returning this money to the funds .
I will be damned if the public should be responsible for their windfalls .
This package should not make anyone rich nor should it exclude the attempt to renegotiate any home loans that may be salvageable .
Keeping families in their homes and out of foreclosure should be a major part of this scheme .
A salary cap should be placed on any project that benefits from this program including the automakers windfall package .
A complete history of this whole negotiation including names and statements of each participating politician should be made public immediately .
We the people want to know who and why they voted as they did .
No more backdoor meetings and secret agreements between politicians .
Banks should be placed on notice that it is imperative that they move quickly to re-establish a flow of money into the economy in the form of consumer loans .
Auto loans and consumer product loans will help rebuild our sagging economy faster than any government programs .
To be sure the money should not be placed in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury for disbursement as he see 's fit .
The bulk of the money should be put into a trust and trustee 's should be appointed from each party to decide the disbursement of funds .
It 's time for the politicians in Washington to wash their hands and come clean .
Do the job that we sent them there to do .
And that 's my opinion ,
Don
The saga of Samuel “ Joe the Plumber ” Wurzelbacher has become a terrific metaphor for the far - right - wing political strategy : brainwash the working class into opposing a policy that will actually help them .
I agree with John McCain when he states that Wurzelbacher is a victim in this whole escapade ; however , his victimization is a result of the above - referenced brainwashing .
Let ’s not forget how far - right conservatives brainwashed many people into thinking that Iraq was connected to 9/11 .
That charge has always been refuted , but as usual , the media did n’t do its job in helping Americans understand the truth .
By the time the media really mounted its assault on this lie , it was too late — the damage had been done .
The war in Iraq has been a massive detriment to lower income individuals but an economic boon for many of our country ’s wealthiest individuals and corporations .
And now , the far - right conservatives are brainwashing working - class people into believing that Barack Obama is going to raise their taxes .
The now infamous encounter between Joe the Plumber and Obama went something like this : Wurzelbacher told Obama that he had been a plumber for 15 years and was getting ready to buy a company that would make about $ 280,000.00 a year .
Under Obama ’s tax plan , his business would be taxed higher .
If Obama was as snide and sarcastic as me , he could have responded by saying , “ Yeah , and your point is … ? ”
Joe the Plumber and advocates of his sentiment seem to believe that this plan tramples on the American Dream .
Of course !
I mean , we all can imagine the type of deterrent effect that this will have on business growth :
“ So , are n’t you going to try to grow your small business ? ”
“ Are you kidding !
If I make more money , then I ’ll have to pay more taxes .
No thank you , sir ! ”
“ But , wo n’t you still make more money than you do now even after taxes are deducted ? ”
“ That ’s besides the point .
I ca n’t stand the thought that the money I make might be helping the government or somebody in a lower economic position than me .
Who do you think I am ?
Jesus Christ ? ”
Now , there has been a lot of unnecessary character assassination of Wurzelbacher .
For example , the revelation that he ’s not a licensed plumber , or the claim that he ’s nowhere near financially fit to purchase the company he talked about .
The truth is that you would be amazed at how many people in this country are not properly licensed for their trade .
Joe has been plumbing for 15 years : he ’s a fucking plumber .
I ’m not advocating improper licensing , but hell , in some courts failing to properly license might not even hurt your case .
Unfortunately , claims like these have allowed the McCain campaign to make a frowny face and say that the liberal elite media is being mean to Joe the Plumber .
I guess McCain is in no way culpable despite mentioning “ Joe the Plumber ” 15 - some times in a nationally televised presidential debate .
Regardless , this ends up overshadowing the fact that there are a couple of problems with the assertions Joe made to Sen.
Obama .
First of all , Joe appears to have mistaken company income with company value .
While he might be correct that the company he hoped to purchase was worth $ 280,000 , the actual income that the company pulls in annually is under $ 250,000 .
Consequently , this company would not see a tax increase under Obama ’s plan .
Joe the Plumber even admitted this fact recently to a reporter .
However , there is minimal utility in discounting Joe ’s claims simply because of factual discrepancies .
Let ’s say hypothetically that Joe really was planning on purchasing a company that made $ 280,000 .
The Tax Foundation did an analysis revealing that , in such a scenario , Joe the Financially Sound Company Owner would pay $ 773 more in taxes under the Obama plan than under the McCain plan .
I got out my abacus and chart of logarithms to do the math : it ’s a move from $ 280,000 to $ 279,227 .
Gosh , how will he feed his family , pay his bills and fuel his jetski ?
But Obama did a terrible , terrible thing in his response to Wurzelbacher : he uttered the phrase “ spread the wealth around . ”
Sacre bleu !
Joe later admitted in an interview with Fox News Radio that it sounded like socialism to him .
I agree with him , but to me it sounds like Democratic Socialism .
We could argue about whether that ’s what Obama wants to do and whether it would be a bad thing , but I just want to show that this is another example of brainwashing .
The Rush Limbaughs of the world hear that off - the - cuff phrase , and to them it sounds like “ WORKING MEN OF THE WORLD UNITE ! ” Barack Obama = Stalin .
Case closed .
But this is like looking into the Louvre through a peephole , and saying , “ Yup , I get it now . ”
Never mind that historically Marxist regimes have consistently been ignorant distortions of what Karl Marx actually preached .
So that ’s the latest brainwashing scheme by the far right : they ’ve dusted off the ol ’ “ Red Scare . ”
But I think that their tactic is going to fall on deaf ears this time around .
When the average American is struggling to take care of his or her family while AIG executives are drinking milk from a golden titty , a generic phrase like “ spread the wealth around ” actually sounds pretty enticing .
But honestly , do you believe that Obama could get away with ( or even attempt to ) establish America as a communist nation ?
If you do , I ’m sorry to tell you this , but you ’ve been brainwashed .
I recently saw a commentator on TV who summed up the point I ’ve been trying to make here very nicely :
“ If you do n’t go out and find out … your own information , then you ca n’t really sit there and give a good argument .
I mean , you ca n’t express your own opinion .
That ’s what makes it your own opinion : you went out , you read about it , you learned about it , and then you have your own opinion .
Your opinion is not given to you …
You really gotta find out facts . ”
The man who said that was Joe the Plumber .
I could not agree with him more , and I wish he had given this advice to Joe the… Oops .
We have atheist buses in Britain .
We have atheist buses in Washington , D.C. :
Will we have atheist buses in Australia ?
Not anytime soon .
Three separate slogans were proposed to APN Outdoor — the company that handles bus advertising in most Australian capitals .
Atheism :
Because there is no credible evidence
Celebrate reason : Sleep in on Sunday mornings
Atheism : Celebrate reason
The company said no to all three ads .
( Even the last one ?
Really !? )
This , after the atheist group in question had already raised $ 16,000 ( approximately $ 10,316 in US dollars ) for the ad campaign .
President of the Atheist Foundation of Australia David Nicholls appeared on the radio show The Religion Report to discuss this discrimination with host David Rutledge :
David Rutledge : Can you speculate as to why they might be refusing to run this ?
David Nicholls :
Well it could be just cultural censorship .
As [ Richard ]
Dawkins said , we ’re brought up to believe that religion has some sort of privileged status .
To offer even a mild criticism of it is seen as something very strident , and that ’s out of bounds to do that .
The Atheist Foundation is not a religion , we are not criticising religion , we are saying celebrate reason .
So I think that there is a rejection of atheists having their name out there .
David Rutledge : Are you surprised by that ?
In a country like Australia , one of the most secular societies in the world , that this would happen ?
David Nicholls : I ’m disappointed , but not overly surprised .
Religion has a very great hold on societies , even democratic societies and in fact it has too great a hold in democratic societies .
… David Rutledge :
So what ’s your next move ?
Now that APN Outdoor have said that they can’t accommodate a bus campaign , would you say it ’s dead in the water or do you have other options to pursue ?
David Nicholls :
Well there are a few options , there are billboards but APN controls them they have n’t got back to us on that .
Any company really has the right to refuse a service to a customer , but in this instance , you have to wonder .
Just consider the proposed wording : Celebrate Reason .
I mean is it vindictive , inflammatory , offensive ?
No , it ’s not , it ’s none of those , and I really have to ask , why have we been refused ?
It ’s not as though they ’re opposed to controversy .
In Adelaide I believe , in the recent past , the APN buses had all across the back of a bus or some buses , the message , “ John 3:16 ” which is the most famous Biblical passage “ That God so loved the world that he gave his only son … ”
Now atheists find that offensive , and there ’s lots of atheists in Australia , but we would n’t prohibit its display .
APN Outdoor had no comment on the story .

Every San Francisco election has something that captures the nation 's attention - and this year it 's Proposition R , the proposed renaming of a sewage - treatment plant after George W. Bush .
It 's not the first time voters have had a chance to slap the outgoing commander in chief .
In 2006 , San Franciscans passed an advisory measure , with 58 percent of the vote , calling for Bush 's impeachment .
This year , Prop .
R would rechristen the $ 220 million Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant near Ocean Beach in honor of Bush .
Some may think it a joke .
It 's not .
Public Utilities Commission spokesman Tony Winnicker says his shop has been advised by the city attorney that if the measure passes Tuesday , the name must change .
That means replacing the lettering outside the plant and reprinting all the informational brochures handed out to schoolchildren and others who take field trips there .
The estimated cost : about $ 50,000 .
" The potential irony here is that this is a modern facility that protects the ocean and the environment every day , " Winnicker said , " and I 'm not sure that 's the right legacy for President Bush . "
No , but there would be no mistaking the smell .
The players club : Politics has long been the playground of millionaires .
This election , however , the billionaires have taken over the table .
The biggest player this time out in California is billionaire Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens , co-owner of Clean Energy Fuels Corp .
The company has pumped $ 19 million into Proposition 10 , the $ 5 billion state bond that would set up a rebate program for alternative - fuel vehicles .
According to Judy Dugan , research director of the nonpartisan Consumer Watchdog in Santa Monica , Pickens ' company controls 70 percent of the compressed natural gas sold in the United States and would stand to make a fortune fueling the newly subsidized trucks and cars .
However , Yes on 10 spokeswoman Amy Thoma tells us that the way the measure is drafted , " there 's no guarantee any one company or type of fuel will benefit . "
Next up , the father and son tag - team billionaires John and Peter Sperling , who head up the for - profit University of Phoenix online college .
Peter Sperling has sunk $ 9 million into Proposition 7 , which would require that California get half its electricity from renewable sources by 2025 .
Renewable energy is something near and dear to papa John Sperling , who is interested in investing in the emerging technology .
Then there 's Orange County billionaire Henry Nicholas III , founder of the high - tech firm Broadcom Corp .
Nicholasspent $ 4.5 million to back Proposition 9 , which would add crime victims ' rights to the state Constitution and make it more difficult for criminals to be paroled .
Marsy 's Law , as the proposition is known , is named after Nicholas ' sister , a UC Santa Barbara student who was killed by her boyfriend in 1983 .
Oddly enough , Henry Nicholas now finds himself on the wrong end of the law , having been indicted over the summer on federal fraud and narcotics charges that included allegations he provided prostitutes and drugs to customers .
He 's even accused of having slipped Ecstasy into the drinks of unwitting executives .
Nicholas has pleaded not guilty to all the charges .
Billionaire investor and liberal activist George Soros spent $ 1.4 million in support of Proposition 5 , which would expand treatment programs for most drug offenders as an alternative to prison and make it harder to put parole violators back behind bars .
And the aforementioned John Sperling has kicked in another $ 500,000 .
And we have n't even begun to talk about all the $ 1 million contributors to both sides of the Proposition 8 same - sex marriage fight .
Lights , camera , hero !
Three years after the teachers , nurses and firefighters kicked his backside up and down the state , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger may finally get one of his measures approved by voters .
And he 's using a firefighter , of all people , as the closer .
At issue is Proposition 11 , Arnold 's bid to have an independent commission redraw the state 's legislative district lines .
The Field Poll shows the measure ahead by 45 to 30 percent , with a big 25 percent still undecided .
Enter Luke Perisin , a firefighter from Orange County who cut a TV ad for Schwarzenegger 's plan - thus giving the impression that firefighters across the state are behind the measure .
They are n't - at least , their union is n't .
But all you need is one guy on your side , because voters love firefighters - a lesson Arnold learned in spades when a negative TV campaign starring firefighters and nurses helped drive the governor 's poll numbers into the toilet in 2005 .
It 's a lesson the governor is now using to his advantage .
Big bang : Supervisor Chris Daly 's 2005 ballot measure to ban handguns in San Francisco had an even bigger backfire than we told you about last Monday .
The National Rifle Association and others successfully challenged the legality of the measure - and now the Board of Supervisors has been asked to sign off on a $ 380,000 settlement to cover the cost of the lawsuit .
It turns out that in addition to paying the NRA 's legal fees on a case that Mayor Gavin Newsomand others said was doomed from the start , the city attorney 's office spent $ 200,000 of its own on the lawsuit .
Assuming that supervisors sign off on the settlement Tuesday , that would bring the bill for the ballot stunt to $ 580,000 .
But hey - it did make a nationwide splash .
And finally : Franco Gianelli went to a small copy store in Daly City the other day to fax a document , and quickly discovered just how bad the economy has gotten .
After Gianelli borrowed a stapler to fasten three sheets of paper together , the clerk asked him for 2 cents - to cover the cost of the staple .

Simple Homemade T.E.A. Laser .
By Nyle Steiner K7NS Oct 2007 .
Upper picture :

Lower picture :
An ultraviolet beam from a T.E.A. laser ( partly visible on the far right ) passes first through the bottle on the right ( water with laundry whitener , blue glow ) and then continues through the bottle on the left ( water and highlight pen ink , green glow ) until it strikes a piece of paper ( covered with highlight pen ink , green spot ) .
When I read about TEA lasers recently though , that all changed .
Here is a laser that is built from aluminum foil , a dielectric and some pieces of aluminum .
It is amazing to think of a laser project where a simple 4 to 6 KV DC power supply is the most elaborate component .
Why I am building TEA lasers can be explained very simply :
There is a great deal of satisfaction in the idea of having built your own laser .
These lasers are fascinating and they emit a very powerful fun field in addition to their ultraviolet beam .
In spite of the simplicity , the idea of building a TEA laser of my own seemed very intimidating .
After all , it is a laser and some of the conditions necessary for it 's operation are very extreme .
A high voltage transition must be faster than several nanoseconds and the capacitors have to have extremely low inductance values in order to get that kind of speed .
I had the concern that my lack of expertise in the field of laser technology would make it difficult for me to solve any problems if it did n't work .
As it turns out however , all of these extreme conditions are very easy to produce .
It did not take long to get a laser working reasonably well .
My wife may not agree but , I find that it easier to make a working TEA laser than it is to make a batch of cookies .
There are two main objectives in mind as I write this article .
One is say that yes , the TEA laser also works for me even though I am not an expert in laser technology .
The other objective is to demystify the homemade TEA laser and address many of the concerns that I was plagued with in the beginning such as : How critical is the electrode rail alignment ?
What if I make the foil plates the wrong size ?
Just how straight must the laser electrode pieces be ?
What happens if I do n't make the laser the right length ?
What types of dielectric material will work ?
How much voltage is really required ?
Must it be filtered ?
Will an AC supply work ?
What about the polarity of the voltage applied ?
How can you possibly make a spark that jumps between two long electrodes , cover their entire length ?
This article is mostly a detailed description of things that I found to work well .
Not being a laser expert , I would recommend reading the professors web site ( in my links section ) or similar material for more details on how TEA lasers work and their characteristics .
If I understand it right , TEA stands for Transverse Excitation at Atmospheric pressure .
What is being Lased ?
It is just plain air and yes , at atmospheric pressure .
Air must be very good for building lasers because it is classified as super radiant , meaning no mirrors are required to get laser action .
We are breathing a very good laser material .
TEA lasers produce a beam of ultraviolet light in very short pulses but I have managed to run them at a rep rate of up to 120 hz , making them appear continuous .
The ultraviolet output can easily be seen when it strikes UV fluorescent materials commonly found around home .
The most critical part of making a TEA laser is in making the capacitors .
According to what I have read , the inductance inherent in these capacitors must be very low .
Using too thick of a dielectric will cause too much inductance for the laser to work .
Aluminum foil plates works as well as anything .
Do n't worry about having pieces of sheet aluminum cut .
The aluminum foil plates tend to cling to the dielectric , making thin , tight , low inductance capacitors .
Once you have these foil capacitors made as described here , you can get many different strips of metal ( usually aluminum ) to work well as the laser electrode rails .
Typical Construction
Start with a flat piece of particle board approx .
8 1/2 " by 12 "
Cover this board with aluminum foil .
This will be a common electrical ground plane .
Let the foil hang over the back edge as shown .
This will make it easy to connect to the power supply ground .
Lay the plastic dielectric on the foil as shown .
Notice that a section of the base foil ( right end of picture ) is not covered by the dielectric .
This section of foil is left bare in order to make contact with the spark gap assembly .
Lay two 3 " X 10 " pieces of foil as shown so that there is approx 1/8 " of space between them .
To prevent unwanted arcing , the edges of both pieces of top foil should never be less than 1/4 " from the edge of the dielectric whenever base foil is directly beneath .
This is now a basic TEA laser base consisting of two capacitors .
At this point you can add any laser electrode rail configuration that you choose whether it be angle aluminum , rod , bars or even combinations of different shaped pieces .
Below , I will describe some that I have tried .
The " Against The Wall " Laser Electrode
The above picture was also taken after a considerable amount of operating time on the laser .
The dielectric is clear but notice how it has turned frosty white near the edge of the top aluminum plate .
This flat vertical face of aluminum will be one of the laser electrode rails .
The other laser electrode rail will be a piece of aluminum with a thin edge facing this flat wall , typically , at a distance of approx 1 mm and raised slightly so as to not touch the dielectric .
I call this the " against the wall " configuration .
This is unlike most other TEA laser electrode configurations I have seen which have a thin edge on both sides .
I really like making TEA laser electrodes this way .
This method is very versatile and I have been getting great results from it .
From my observations , this " against the wall " type of laser electrode configuration works as well or better than traditional configurations I have tried , that use a thin edge on both sides .
This configuration allows you to experiment with many different shapes and sizes of thin edge material to face against this vertical wall of aluminum .
Pieces shorter or longer than this basic 10 " angle aluminum wall will work as a laser as long as they do n't overlap the dielectric at a point causing a short .
Making The Other Laser Electrode Rail
I put one end of a piece of 18 gauge ( .040 ) bare copper wire one foot long , into a vise and stretch hard from the other end until it is very straight .
Thicker wire will also work well if you can get it straight .
I then put it on the bottom of the angle aluminum piece about 1/16 " from the edge .
I file a small notch about 1/16 " from the edge , in each end of the angle aluminum .
This allows the wire to be bent around the ends holding it in place .
The two electrodes are now each sitting on top of a separate piece of foil and are at this point electrically insulated from each other .
The laser is very stable .
Once the electrode spacing is adjusted , it will usually stay that way for long periods of use .
An obvious improvement though , would be to make some kind of screw adjustment on each end .
I hope to get around to trying that soon .
Making A DC Path Between The Electrodes
Left picture : A resistor can simply be laid across the two angle aluminum strips .
No physical attachment is necessary .
The laser works just fine with the resistor just sitting there .
The resistor value is definitely not critical and can be anything between 1 k to 1meg .
A value of around 100 k is my choice because it allows the laser to operate at reasonably high rep rates without much possibility of effecting the laser operation in any way .
Right picture :
As an alternative to the resistor , a handmade coil of approx 20 turns can be laid across the two sides .
As far as I have been able to observe , there is no difference in performance when using the resistor or the coil .
Personal preference would play the biggest part .
I made the laser work quite well at a very high rep rate ( 120 Hz ) by running the laser straight from the NST with no series resistor or rectifier .
This made the 100k resistor start to burn up .
In this situation , the coil was a better choice .
At lower rep rates , there is absolutely no problem with the resistor .
Spark Gap Assembly
The spark gap assembly is a 6 - 32 x 3/4 " screw put through a piece of 1 1/2 " long angle aluminum .
A cap nut is put on the end of the screw .
The spark jumps between ground and another 1 1/2 " piece of angle aluminum sitting on top one of the foil plates .
With the foil plates being the same size as I have made them , there is little difference which side of the laser the spark gap is on .
Contact with the ground foil and mechanical stability are enhanced by putting a weight on the spark gap assembly .
The gap is adjusted by sliding the assembly until a spark jumps regularly .
I usually get best results when the gap is between 1/16 " and 1/8 " wide .

Sparkbangbuzz TEA Laser FAQ
At first the idea of building a homemade TEA laser seemed intimidating in spite of it 's simplicity .
I was plagued by many questions .
Below is an attempt to answer many of them using my observations and experiences .
What safety concerns are associated with this TEA laser ?
I take no responsibility for safety in this project .
If you build this laser , you do it at your own risk .
I personally feel however , that working with this laser is less hazardous than going shopping if proper precautions are taken .
That is only my opinion though .
Below are some thoughts and suggestions about safety .
The most obvious safety concern would be the high voltage that is used .
When using a one megohm resistor in series with the power supply , safety can be improved by having the resistor away from the laser .
This will limit the amount of current that can flow through you if you accidentally touch the wrong parts .
This laser also produces ozone .
There are some who will tell you that ozone is detrimental to health .
I can not tell you for sure that this device is free of x-ray radiation .
I have never heard of anyone having any problems with x-rays while doing open air high voltage experiments , especially when the voltage is below about 15 kv .
Care should be taken to make sure that the beam never hits your eyes .
Extra care should be taken since the beam is invisible ultraviolet light .
When working with this laser , hearing protection should be worn .
The sparking from this laser produces very potent pops that are very loud and irritating .
I can't imagine how exposure to them could be anything but strain on your hearing .
What kind of power supply is necessary ?
I have found with my TEA lasers , that power supply polarity makes little if any difference .
Any power source that can charge the capacitor part of this laser up to 4 to 6 kv can be used .
I have been using a NST ( neon sign transformer ) with excellent results .
I normally use a high voltage rectifier in series with a 300 k to 1 megohm resistor .
No filter capacitors are needed .
Safety is better when no filter capacitors are used .
It is great to have a Variac driving the input of the NST so that many levels of HV can be tried .
A good resistor can be made by connecting five 1/2 watt 1meg resistors in parallel .
Make five of these parallel configurations and put them in series ( a total of 25 resistors ) .
You now have a 1meg 12.5 watt resistor that can be tapped for different values .
I found some high voltage rectifiers on ebay but one for this task can be made by putting 15 1N4007 diodes in series .
Each diode should also be paralleled with a 10 meg resistor .
The resistors are needed to equalize the reverse voltage drop across the diodes .
I have been using one that I made this way for rectifying 6kv and have had no problems .
Each 1N4007 is good for 1 kv reverse voltage .
Why then am I using 15 of them to rectify 6kv ?
If the laser capacitors are charged up to 6 kv then the diode sees double that amount on the reverse unused portion of the cycle .
During the reverse cycle , the transformer voltage and the charged capacitor voltage are in series across the diodes .
I have also been able to run TEA lasers that are directly connected to the output of the NST using no series resistor or diode .
The laser when connected this way will pulse at 120 hz since it is firing on both the negative and positive half of the 60 hz ac high voltage .
I believe however that the dielectric is under the greatest stress when running at this rep rate so I tend to run them at lower rep rates using the series resistor and diode .
Any voltage source , static generator or whatever , that can charge this laser up to 4 kv or more , should work just fine .
What is the best material to use for the capacitor plates ?
In a state of intimidation when attempting to make my first TEA laser , I had a sheet metal shop cut some pieces of .062 aluminum to use as the base and capacitor plates .
I did get these pieces to work but I soon tried using ordinary aluminum foil , as I had seen others use , and found that it worked as well or better than the thicker pieces of aluminum sheet metal .
The thin flexible aluminum foil has a surprising tendency to cling to the dielectric because of the electrical HV electrostatic attraction .
This tends to make the capacitor have very low inductance which is necessary for a TEA laser to work .
What size should the foil capacitor plates be ?
While experimenting with the " Double L " electrode configuration , I used 1 inch wide angle aluminum .
These electrodes each had a one inch flat bottom that would sit intimately against the surface .
I was able to get very observable laser action while these electrodes were just sitting on the dielectric , without any top foil plates at all .
There was more laser output of course when I did use capacitor plates below these electrodes .
What about relative size of the foil capacitor plates ?
What kind of material should be used for the dielectric ?
The only question about dielectric materials is not if they will work but merely how long they will work before breaking down under the HV stress and shorting the capacitor .
Every dielectric material that I tried worked well .
One of the best of common materials seems to be Mylar ( trade name for Polyester ) .
I have been using a piece of 8 1/2 X 11 inch material 4mil thick ( from a photocopy shop ) used to make overhead transparencies .
I do n't know if it is mylar , acetate or what but it has been holding up for a long time , works very well and is an excellent choice .
At this time , this 4 mil transparency material has never yet failed under a lot of operation using 5.5 KV .
Polypropylene or flexible vinyl sheets usually last just a few minutes .
The charging and discharging of the capacitors puts a lot of stress on the dielectric .
What should the thickness of the dielectric be ?
The thickness of the dielectric is a critical parameter .
For TEA lasers to work , the capacitors must have a very low self inductance so that the discharge across the electrodes can happen in an extremely short time ( several nanoseconds ) .
A capacitor made with a thin dielectric has less self inductance than a capacitor made from a thicker dielectric .
Thus if the dielectric is too thick , there is no laser action .
The 4 mil dielectric material that I have been using most of the time works great .
I also used a piece of 8 mil mylar and it worked well with perhaps a bit less output .
The optimum dielectric would be to use as thin as can be used without breaking down .
The professor 's web site says that 2,5 mil mylar is very good .
As soon as I can get a hold of some 2.5 mil Mylar I will be anxious to try it .
At the professors web site he points out that capacitors made from normal .062 thick printed circuit material can not be made to work as a laser because it 's thickness causes too much inductance in the capacitor .
He points out that a thinner but harder to obtain pc material works ok .
There is no need though , to worry about using pc material to make capacitors for a laser .
Pc material is expensive and a pain to work with if you are etching it .
The foil and plastic capacitors work very well .
A good material for the base and to build the capacitors on , is to use a good flat piece of 3/4 " particle board .
How critical is the construction of the laser electrode rails with regard to straightness , shape , length etc . ?
The laser electrodes , where the actual laser action takes place between them , are usually a couple of long pieces of straight aluminum with thin edges that face each other approx 1 mm apart .
The adjustment of this spacing is critical but easily done .
The idea of making electrodes parallel enough to discharge along their entire length is intimidating especially if you have ever tried to do this along a very long spark gap .
Under normal conditions it is perhaps impossible to get a spark jumping across a long narrow pair of electrodes , to cover their entire length .
You will always get a tiny bright spark at one place at a time .
This was one of the reasons the TEA laser before building one , seemed intimidating .
As it turns out in the case of TEA lasers , the extremely fast voltage transition between the electrodes creates a discharge across their entire length .
Adjustment for this condition is relatively easy .
There are many materials and methods that work well for making TEA laser electrode rails .
I have seen and tried everything from aluminum welding rod to angle aluminum and they all seem to work .
My favorite right now is the use of angle aluminum .
Angle aluminum tends to be very straight and it resists the tendency to flex during adjustment .
It is also a very common material that can be purchased at almost any hardware store .
Try to avoid using anodized aluminum .
I was able to make it work but I had to remove the anodized finish on the facing discharge edges and wherever contact was to be made against the aluminum foil plates .
TRUST ME !!
ANODIZED FINISH IS EXTREMELY HARD AND REMOVING IT IS NO PICNICK !!
You can tell if aluminum is anodized by using an ohmmeter .
Just touch both test probes to the aluminum .
If it is anodized , the meter will indicate open circuit .
If it is not anodized , the meter will indicate zero resistance .
Anodized aluminum also tends to have more of a frosty white appearance .
1/8 " diameter aluminum rod works well but tends to flex during adjustment especially when there is three of more weights holding it down against the foil .
Most of the lasers that I made from rod also had the tendency to put out a broader beam ( bigger spot on a fluorescent piece of paper ) .
The pieces of aluminum should be thin at the point where they oppose each other .
I found that angle aluminum .047 " thick works very well .
1/16 " ( .063 " ) thick aluminum works almost as well but I could not get the flat edge of 1/8 aluminum to work at all ( unless using the inverted V configuration described below ) .
The edge creating the discharge also needs to be raised slightly ( typically about 1/16 " ) so that it is not touching the dielectric below .
For some reason , lasers work much better this way .
I was able to get two electrodes ( two pieces of angle aluminum ) that were sitting right down against the dielectric to work but adjustment was much more difficult and there was less output .
I have been getting excellent results using pieces of 1 " angle aluminum .047 " thick and 10 inches long .
I also get excellent laser action when just one of the two opposing electrodes has a thin edge .
One of the opposing electrode rails can be a flat surface .
This configuration is shown in the photos .
The angle aluminum on the flat side is simply set flat on the foil .
This is perhaps my favorite configuration because it is so easy to test many different electrode shapes and materials against the flat electrode .
TEA lasers made this way work very well .
I call this the " Against The Wall " electrode rail configuration .
One of my favorite ways of making the thin electrode rail ( opposite the flat wall ) is to put a piece of 18 ga copper wire near the bottom edge of a .047 " thick piece of angle aluminum ( see photos ) .
This wire keeps the edge up away from the dielectric while making contact with the foil very near the discharge edge .
I tend to get good bright output from a laser built this way and the spot seems to be as good and tight as any of the methods I have tried .
Another excellent " against the wall " electrode rail can be made with a piece of 1/8 " thick angle aluminum .
As I mentioned a while ago , I could get very little if no laser action using a 1/8 " thick electrode edge .
However , if the angle aluminum is put in an inverted V position ( see photos and drawings ) , you get a very good sharp corner that faces the opposite " wall " .
This also makes an excellent laser .
The inverted V rail is more difficult to set a weight on top but whenever I have used this method , the 1/8 " thick piece of angle aluminum was heavy enough by it self to work well .
Two pieces of 1/8 " angle aluminum can also be used in a double upside down V configuration as shown in the drawing .
This also works very well .
The two pieces being the same height , in this configuration , makes it easy to put a weight on top of both of them using an insulator .
How long must the electrode rails be ?
I have put a video on youtube that shows one of my 3 " long TEA lasers working .
See my links section .
In the video , I can pick it up and aim it at different targets .
I see the possibility of a maximum electrode length beyond which there would be no further gain in laser output because of speed of light or current flow limitations or something similar but , I can not say as I am not a laser expert .
How wide can the area of contact between the electrodes and aluminum foil be ?
It seems that narrower is better .
I believe electrode rails that are sitting on the aluminum should not be wider than about one inch .
Contact with the aluminum foil should be made all along the electrode length and as close to the electrode edge as possible in order to minimize inductance .
What about bright sparks that jump between the electrodes in addition to the blue glow ?
With these TEA lasers .
The hot spots are common and almost unavoidable .
I have managed on a couple of occasions to have a laser work with just the blue glow having no hot sparks at all .
I think it may have had something to do in part with the top foil plates being shorter than the electrodes and not being too wide .
From all of my humble observations , I have not observed any detrimental effect caused by these hot sparks when compared to not having hot sparks .
Lasers that have had hot sparks and the few that I made that had no hot sparks , seem to work the same .
I am speculating with my limited knowledge of laser physics , that the laser action occurs first and is finished before the hot sparks occur .
From my experience , I would say that amateurs building TEA lasers need not worry much about the hot sparks across the electrodes .
How do you adjust the electrode spacing ?
Almost every T.E.A. laser that I have made works reasonably well when the space between the laser electrodes is adjusted to a width of 1 mm .
I found a paper clip that was made of exactly 1 mm diameter wire .
A handy electrode spacing tool was made by bending this paper clip straight and filing any burr off of its end .
The laser electrode spacing is adjusted by putting the end of this wire between the electrode pieces and pushing them together against the wire .
This is done on both ends of the laser electrodes .
Sometimes slight width adjustments beyond this will optimize the output of the laser .
The biggest breakthrough though , in my ability to make TEA lasers work well was the addition of a piece of plastic on each end of an electrode ( see photos ) .
These pieces of plastic are very easy to grab hold of ( without getting zapped ) for adjusting the electrode spacing .
With my hands resting on the table I find it relatively easy to make fine electrode spacing adjustments .
The hot sparks that jump between the electrodes are a good indicator of how parallel the electrodes are .
If they are not parallel , the sparks will tend to be concentrated near one end .
Pulling that end slightly farther apart will usually move the sparks more toward the middle or to the opposite end .
Try moving the sparks in this way while using different electrode spacings .
Do this while watching a piece of sensitive paper near each end of the laser .
When you get the adjustment right , you will experience the excitement of seeing a spot appear on one or both of the pieces of paper .
When this happens you have a working laser !
The paper can be made very ultraviolet sensitive by covering it with ink from a yellow highlight pen .
An improvement would be some kind of screw adjuster at each end of the electrode rails .
These lasers typically emit a beam out of both ends simultaneously .
It is sometimes possible however , to get the beam to emit from just one end by slightly widening the laser electrode spacing at that end .
What about using mirrors on a TEA Laser ?
I did just a little bit of experimenting with a mirror on one end of the TEA laser .
The mirrors that I used were far from anything you would consider to be of laser quality .
One of the mirrors that I tried was an aluminized front surface type that I made many years ago .
Therefore I would say that I do not yet have much to say on the subject of applying mirrors to TEA lasers .
Whenever I tried using a mirror however , I put it on the end opposite the sensitive paper .
I aligned the mirror by watching its reflection on the paper and aligning the reflection so that it was exactly on top of the spot made by the beam .
In these cases , I did not observe anything that seemed significant in spot brightness .
If you adjust the electrode gap to make the beam emit out of one end , how does that compare to using a mirror on the end of a laser that is putting a beam out of both ends ?
That is a good question that I can not answer yet .
How do you make the spark gap ?
The construction of the spark gap is done pretty much as the photos show .
It appears to be quite obvious that inductance in the spark gap assembly has less of a detrimental effect than it does in the capacitors and electrode rails .
You can see from the photos that current flows through a relatively great distance ( up one angle aluminum and down another ) as it passes through the spark gap .
If current had to flow this far up and away through the electrode rails , there would be absolutely no laser action .
A path like this through the electrode rails would create a prohibitive amount of inductance yet , the laser works just fine with a path like this through the spark gap .
A TEA laser will work well with almost any spark gap that is placed between one of the capacitor plates and ground .
A TEA laser will also work very well when one of the electrode rails is used as one side of the spark gap .
A grounded piece of metal can simply be placed near one of the electrode rails .
The distance across the spark gap can be between 1/16 to 1/8 inch .
You have not said much in this article about the theory of TEA lasers and how they work .
Where can I find out more about them ?
One of the best places to go is to the Professors Web Site .
Mark Csele gives a lot of great info about TEA lasers and lasers in general .
You can find his site by putting TEA laser on google or going to my links section .

We all know alkaline batteries are really bad for the environment if you do n’t dispose of them properly .
The right thing to do is send them to special recycling centers but hundreds of tons end up in landfills where their toxic innards seep into the earth .
Perhaps a good solution is the Energy Seed , an LED lamp post powered by trashed alkaline batteries .
The idea is to encourage people to throw their batteries away into the Energy Seed .
There ’s a slot for nearly every size battery .
The unit combines any left over juice from all the batteries to power a super efficient LED ring .
Of course once the bins are full , we ’re left with the same original problem .
Somebody has to collect all those spent batteries and recycle them .

New iPhone App Measures Your Car's Environmental Impact
October 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The Greenmeter , recently released by Hunter Research and Technologies , is an iPhone application with a mission : to keep track of your car ’s carbon footprint and fuel efficiency .
The program uses a multitude of variables to make its calculations , including weather conditions , cost of fuel , and vehicle weight .
More advanced measurements such as drag coefficient , vehicle pitch , and rolling resistance can be calculated using estimates available on the company ’s website .
The Greenmeter is most accurate if placed on the dashboard or console between the two front seats .
Just be careful that you do n’t run into the problem of staring at the screen more than the road .

The mass imprisonment philosophy that has packed prisons and sent corrections costs through the roof around the country has hit especially hard in California , which has the largest prison population , the highest recidivism rate and a prison budget raging out of control .
According to a new federally backed study conducted at the University of California , Irvine , the state ’s corrections costs have grown by about 50 percent in less than a decade and now account for about 10 percent of state spending — nearly the same amount as higher education .
The costs could rise substantially given that a federal lawsuit may require the state to spend $ 8 billion to bring the prison system ’s woefully inadequate medical services up to constitutional standards .
The solution for California is to shrink its vastly overcrowded prison system .
To do so , it would need to move away from mandatory sentencing laws that have proved to be disastrous across the country — locking up more people than protecting public safety requires .
In addition , the state also has perhaps the most counterproductive and ill - conceived parole system in the United States .
More people are sent to prison in California by parole officers than by the courts .
In addition , about 66 percent of California ’s parolees land back in prison after three years , compared with about 40 percent nationally .
Four in 10 are sent back for technical violations like missed appointments or failed drug tests .

More than 10,000 children remain hospitalized in China 's tainted milk scandal , Chinese health officials revealed , while the country defended its dairy products Thursday at a meeting of the World Trade Organization .
The Health Ministry said in a statement on its website Wednesday that 10,666 children were still in hospitals after drinking milk contaminated with melamine , an industrial chemical that can cause kidney stones and lead to life - threatening kidney failure .
BETTER LIFE : An American mom's quest for answers on Chinese candy
No new deaths have been recorded , it said .
The scandal has so far been blamed for the deaths of four babies and the sickening of about 54,000 other children in China .
But the effects of the scandal continue to be felt , forcing the government to deal with festering health and public relations issues .
China 's food exports have increasingly suffered , with more than 30 countries restricting Chinese dairy imports and in some cases all Chinese food products .
At a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Geneva , Chinese officials sought to limit the damage Thursday , saying Beijing was making enormous efforts to deal with the problem and maintaining no new cases of contamination had been detected since Sept. 20 .
The officials also contended the contamination had been accidental , contradicting a World Health Organization assessment that the chemical was added deliberately .
Dairy suppliers have been accused of adding melamine — used in making plastics , paint and adhesives — to watered - down milk to make it appear rich in protein .
Melamine , like protein , is high in nitrogen , which is what quality tests measure .
Until this week , there had been no standards in China for the amount of the chemical allowed in food products .
Under Health Ministry guidelines released Wednesday , melamine is now limited to one part per million for infant formula and 2.5 parts per million for milk , milk powder and food products that contain more than 15 % dairy .
Levels of melamine discovered in batches of tainted milk powder have registered as much as 6,196 parts per million .
Wang Xuening , a ministry official , acknowledged that small amounts of melamine can leech from the environment and packaging into milk and other foods , but said deliberate tainting was forbidden .
In the U.S. , the Food and Drug Administration says its experts have concluded that eating 2.5 parts per million of melamine — a minuscule amount — would not raise health risks , even if a person ate food every day that contained it .
China 's Asian neighbors , meanwhile , continued to pull Chinese - made products after tests revealed melamine .
Singapore 's food safety agency said Thursday it found traces of melamine in samples of blueberry and chocolate flavored Cadbury Choclairs and Panda Dairy - brand Whole Milk Powder imported from China .
And in Hong Kong , authorities said melamine had been found in EDO Pack Almond Cacao Biscuit Sticks produced by Hong Kong company EDO Trading Co. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press .

Obama looks to rewrite nation 's electoral map THE ENDGAME : Last battles are being fought almost entirely on what has been GOP turf
Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Obama looks to rewrite nation 's electoral map 1 / 8 Back to Gallery
Democrat Barack Obama enters the final lap of his presidential bid with the chance to remake the nation 's electoral map , with polls showing him leading in at least a half - dozen states that President Bush carried in 2004 .
Republican John McCain hopes a last - minute shift by undecided voters could help him capture toss - up states like Florida , Ohio , Indiana , Missouri and North Carolina and reverse Obama 's momentum in Virginia , Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico and Iowa .
With the exception of Pennsylvania , a traditionally Democratic state where McCain is making a last - ditch stand , the entire campaign is being fought on GOP turf .
In a sign of the uphill climb McCain faces , even reliably red states such as Montana , Georgia and North Dakota are up for grabs .
Obama heads into election day in an enviable position : Democrats are flocking to the polls in huge numbers in early voting , especially African Americans .
He has extensive get - out - the - vote operations even in GOP strongholds like Indiana .
He has enough surplus cash that he 's running last - minute TV ads in Arizona , McCain 's home state , which would only turn blue in a shocking upset .
The McCain campaign still sees a path to victory , but it 's a narrow one .
He must hang on to both of the big swing states Bush won narrowly in 2000 and 2004 - Ohio and Florida - while avoiding losses in GOP bastions like Virginia , Indiana and North Carolina .
He is playing for an upset victory in Pennsylvania - which backed Democrat John Kerry in 2004 and has 21 electoral votes - in case Obama wins one or more red states that are now leaning his way .
Swing states
In the RealClearPolitics ' average of polls on Sunday , Obama was ahead , at least slightly , in most swing states : Colorado ( 5.5 percentage points ) , New Mexico ( 7.3 ) , Nevada ( 5.8 ) , Virginia ( 3.8 ) , Pennsylvania ( 7 ) , Florida ( 4.2 ) , Ohio ( 4.2 ) and North Carolina ( 0.3 ) .
McCain had edges in Arizona ( 3.5 points ) , Georgia ( 3 ) , Montana ( 3.8 ) , Missouri ( 0.7 ) and Indiana ( 0.5 ) .
The Obama camp is convinced it will hold all of the states Kerry won in 2004 , including Pennsylvania , which would give the Illinois senator 252 electoral votes .
He would need just 18 more electoral votes to get to the 270 required to win .
Obama 's campaign has been built around a strategy of setting up several paths to victory - whether it 's flipping a big state like Ohio or Florida , or stitching together wins in several smaller states .
A worrisome sign for McCain is the advantage Democrats are seeing in early voting , reversing an edge Bush enjoyed four years ago .
In North Carolina , 2.6 million people have already voted , with Democrats outpacing Republicans 51 percent to 31 percent , according to state figures .
In Colorado , where more than half of the vote may come in before election day , a recent Associated Press poll showed Obama leading 57 percent to 34 percent among early voters .
" We 're getting some clues that Obama is doing very well among early voters , " said Michael McDonald , an election expert at George Mason University whose Web site tracks early voting .
" It becomes very difficult for McCain to make up ground on election day .
...
He would have to get somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the remaining vote to win some of these states .
It would seem impossible . "
McCain 's hope
The McCain camp believes late - deciding voters will turn the race around .
McCain 's chief pollster , Bill McInturff , predicted last week that the roughly 8 percent of undecided voters would break sharply for the GOP nominee , giving McCain a net gain of three to four percentage points .
Pew Research Center 's final pre-election survey , released Sunday , suggested that undecided voters would slightly favor McCain , which narrowed Obama 's lead to 52 percent to 46 percent among likely voters in the poll .
In 2004 , late - deciders split in favor of Kerry , 52 percent to 47 percent , according to Pew 's research .
" It has not been terribly decisive " in past elections , Carroll Doherty , the poll 's associate director , said of the undecided vote .
" Just look in 2004 .
It did n't carry John Kerry over the top even though most of the people who said they decided in the last week voted for him . "
Obama 's hope
Obama is hoping to ride a surge in African American turnout to victory in North Carolina , Virginia and possibly an upset in Georgia .
About 2 million of Georgia 's 5.6 million voters have cast early ballots , and 35 percent of them were black - a turnout bigger than African American 's 29 - percent share of the state 's electorate .
Obama 's biggest gains could come in the Mountain West , in states where demographic changes are making states more competitive for Democrats .
In Nevada , Colorado and New Mexico , the Illinois senator is expected to win by big margins among Latinos .
He also has used his fundraising edge to outspend McCain 3 - to - 1 on television ads in Colorado in the campaign 's final weeks .
Obama is also faring better than expected in Indiana , a state that has n't voted for a Democrat since 1964 and that Bush won by 21 points in 2004 .
While the state tilts toward the GOP , Obama has set up 44 field offices , hired 200 paid staffers and visited the state 48 times since January .
Polls show a tight race .
" I still think McCain may eke out a win , but not for lack of trying on Obama 's part , " said Robert Dion , a political scientist at the University of Evansville .
McCain backers are taking heart from some polls showing slight tightening in the race nationally and in a few battleground states .
Republicans seized on a recent Rasmussen poll suggesting that Obama had only a four - point lead in Pennsylvania , down from a seven - point edge three days earlier .
Governor 's warning
The state 's Democratic governor , Ed Rendell , has warned that Obama could lose if Democratic turnout is n't huge .
G. Terry Madonna , director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College who 's been polling in Pennsylvania since 1992 , said most state polls have shown Obama with a steady lead of 10 to 12 points for weeks .
The Democrat is outperforming McCain in the Philadelphia suburbs , a key swing area , and will get a boost from the 500,000 newly registered Democratic voters , he said .
" I 've studied my state 's politics for 35 years , and I 've never seen anyone five days out come back from a 12 - point deficit , " said Madonna , whose Keystone State poll , released last week , showed Obama leading 51 percent to 39 percent .
" If he wins the state , it will be historic . "
Today while reading PHP :: Impact ’s refactoring guideline post I was reminded about collections .
As you probably know , arrays are very flexible in PHP and probably a good choice for many data storing tasks .
Strictly typed languages usually use “ generic ” collection classes instead of arrays .
They are kind of like PHP arrays which the programmer can tell which type of items to accept .
This is of course only natural when you do n’t have dynamic typing , but it can also be useful for avoiding programming errors , so I thought I ’d try making a basic generic collection class in PHP …
A basic generic collection
The idea was to make a simple class that could be used as a generic collection .
You would have to be able to tell it which type it stores , and it would need to make sure that it wo n’t accept any other types .
By using some features from SPL , we can also make it work more like an array and not a class : implementing Countable , IteratorAggregate and ArrayAccess makes it possible to handle classes similar to arrays in looping , count ( ) calls and accessing them by index .
Code
As always , the code for the class is available here , in my svn repo .
The class gives you some basic methods for playing with it : add ( ) , remove ( ) , get ( ) , exists ( ) , count ( ) , set ( ) , which all should be quite self explanatory .
Here ’s an usage example :
// This collection only accepts strings $ coll = new CU_Collection ( ' string ' ) ; // Add a string and echo it $ coll -> add ( ' This is a string ' ) ; echo $ coll [ 0 ] ; // This will throw an InvalidArgumentException $ coll -> add ( 1000 ) ; // This collection only accepts strings $ coll = new CU_Collection ( ' string ' ) ; // Add a string and echo it $ coll - > add ( ' This is a string ' ) ; echo $ coll [ 0 ] ; // This will throw an InvalidArgumentException $ coll - > add ( 1000 ) ;
The collection also works with classes : Instead of ‘ string ’ , pass it ‘ SomeClass ’ in construct , and then it will only accept instances of SomeClass .
There are two limitations here , though :
The collection only accepts numeric indexes , and you ca n’t use interfaces or base classes as the type .
Adding interface support could probably be done through reflection , or by modifying the code which checks the type a bit .
Pension gap divides public and private workers Johnnie Nichols , a civilian Defense Department employee , contributes to a federal pension that will let him retire at age 56 , after 32 years of service .
His wife , Kimberly , a math teacher at a private business college , has no pension after two decades of teaching and running a horse farm .
Their marriage reflects the new world of retirement : government employees who have secure benefits and private workers who increasingly are on their own .
" If we were both in her shoes , we'd be in a world of hurt , " says Nichols , 45 , an information technology manager in Middletown , Ind .
" We would n't be able to retire until age 67 . "
As the first wave of 79 million baby boomers heads to retirement , the nation is dividing into two classes of workers : those who have government benefits and those who do n't .
The gap is accelerating in every way — pensions , medical benefits , retirement ages .
Retired government workers are twice as likely to get a pension as their counterparts in the private sector , and the typical benefit is far more generous .
The nation 's 6 million retired civil servants — teachers , police , administrators , laborers — received a median benefit of $ 17,640 in 2005 , according to the Congressional Research Service .
Eleven million private - sector retirees covered by traditional pensions got $ 7,692 .
Governments ' generosity could have serious consequences for taxpayers and pensioners .
Some states — including Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , New Jersey , Ohio and West Virginia — have troubled retirement systems that may require huge tax increases , spending cuts or even defaulting on promised benefits .
The U.S. government has a bigger unfunded liability for military and civil servant retirement benefits ( $ 4.7 trillion ) than it does for Social Security ( $ 4.6 trillion ) .
The pension gap will continue to widen because governments pump far more money into employee pensions than companies do .
Civil servants earn an average of $ 12.38 an hour in benefits , about $ 5 an hour more than private - sector workers , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The difference was just $ 2.70 an hour in 1995 .
Pension promises have " gotten out of hand , " says Peter Hanson , 73 , chairman of NAI James E. Hanson Inc. , a real estate firm in Hackensack , N.J .
His firm offers a healthy private pension — up to 25 % of compensation , given to employee retirement accounts — but it is tied to profits and given as a lump sum , not a lifetime promise of benefits .
Supporters of government pensions say the decline in private pensions is the problem , not the generosity of public retirement plans .
" Rather than lower the bar for public employees , we need to stabilize retirement programs for everyone , " says Richard Ferlauto , director of pension and benefit policy for the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , a union with 1.4 million members .
He acknowledges public pensions are getting more scrutiny .
" People want to know , ' Why should you have more security than us ? ' " he says .
" It 's pension envy . "
A sharp contrast State and local governments have sweetened retirement benefits during the past decade at a time when corporations have soured on them because of their cost .
Only 18 % of private workers now have traditional defined benefit pension plans , compared with more than 80 % of government employees .
Contrary to a widely held notion , the extra government benefits are n't compensation for lower pay .
Most government workers are paid more than private employees in similar jobs , and the wage gap is growing .
A typical full - time state or local government worker made $ 78,853 in wages and benefits in the third quarter of 2006 , $ 25,771 more than a typical private - sector worker , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports .
The difference was $ 7,604 in 2000 .
The compensation advantage holds true for all types of public workers , from teachers to laborers and managers .
Better benefits for government workers is the biggest reason for the growing compensation gap .
" The government is in direct competition with us for employees .
It 's hard to compete against these benefit packages , " says James Bellis , owner of Tree Tech , a 120 - worker tree trimming company in Randolph , N.J. His company has a 401 ( k ) plan that matches up to 2 % of employee pay .
By comparison , tree trimmers working for a government in New Jersey would get a pension benefit worth more than three times that .
Superior retirement benefits for civil servants can be traced to the establishment of Social Security , which originally did not cover government employees , says E.J. McMahon , a pension expert at the Manhattan Institute , a conservative think tank that deals with economic policy .
Today , three - fourths of government workers participate in Social Security , but their overall benefits have not been reduced accordingly , he says .
The boost in benefits since the 1960s reflects the rising power of public employee unions , which have thrived as industrial labor unions and the benefits they won have eroded , he says .
The growing benefit gap makes government an increasingly attractive employer .
Anneliese Crosby , 46 , who codes medical records at a private hospital in Manchester , N.H. , is trying to get a government job for financial reasons — better pay , benefits and job security .
The hospital recently ended its pension plan for new employees .
That did n't affect Crosby , but her retirement depends mostly on contributions to her tax - deferred retirement account .
" It 's scary .
I feel like I need a second job or to be on the lookout for a new job , " she says .
" I should put more in my retirement account , but I can't afford it . "
Her solution : Apply for a similar job at a Veterans Affairs hospital .
She 'd get a pay raise , better benefits and a secure future .
" My ex-husband keeps encouraging me to get a government job , and he 's right about that , " she says .
Pensions for civil servants often are superior to private pensions in subtle ways that make a huge financial difference .
For example , government pensions : • Generally base benefits on a worker 's top three earning years .
Private pensions typically base benefits on the top five years of pay , which lowers the average .
• Often let retirees add the value of overtime , unused leave and other benefits into the pension formula .
The results can be extreme .
Dover , N.H. , Police Chief William Fenniman , 46 , added more than $ 200,000 for severance , sick leave and other payouts into his three - year salary average when he retired in January .
This will boost his retirement benefit to as much as $ 125,000 a year , more than he made as chief .
• Permit early retirement at age 50 or 55 with less of a benefit reduction than private pensions .
• Provide free or subsidized medical care for retirees under age 65 and supplemental coverage after that for those on Medicare .
• More often provide automatic cost - of - living increases to benefits .
Baby boomer retirements will force governments to confront the rising costs of civil servant benefits .
The U.S. government 's unfunded retirement obligation grew $ 200 billion last year to $ 4.7 trillion .
That 's the amount the government would need today , set aside and earning investment returns , to pay for promised retirement benefits .
' You have to be aggressive ' Before 1984 , federal workers had a defined benefit plan and no Social Security .
Today , new employees have Social Security and a pension that is part defined benefit plan ( lifetime monthly payments ) and part defined contribution ( a lump sum at retirement ) .
The pension is more generous than most private pensions , but workers have to pay more to take advantage of the plan .
" You have to be aggressive about making contributions if you want a good retirement , " says Nichols , the Defense Department employee .
Unlike private pensions , though , the federal system still encourages early retirement .
" The sweet spot for me is about age 56 .
When I run the numbers , the system almost forces me to retire " early , Nichols says .
For example , he expects to qualify for a free supplemental annuity at age 56 that provides a benefit equal to what he'd get at age 62 under Social Security .
Another big incentive to retire early :
Most governments offer health insurance to early retirees until they qualify for Medicare at 65 .
Massachusetts spent $ 377 million on retiree medical benefits last year .
The state 's unfunded liability for such costs is $ 13.3 billion , nearly as much as its actual debt of $ 18.5 billion , which is counted separately .
" It 's a burden on taxpayers , of course , " says Delores Mitchell , executive director of the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission , which runs the program .
But she does n't foresee major benefit cuts .
" States have a tradition of treating retirees well . "
Medical insurance may be the most vulnerable benefit because it has fewer legal protections than pensions , which often are guaranteed in state constitutions .
Orange County , Calif. , recently slashed promised retiree medical benefits , cutting its liability from $ 1.4 billion to $ 600 million .
The county has n't done anything about its pension problem .
" Pension benefits are like a lobster trap .
You can get in , but you can't get out , " says John Moorlach , an Orange County supervisor who has tried to reduce retirement benefits for government workers .
He blames elected officials for awarding unsustainable retirement benefits to win support from employee unions .
" Elected officials love to give generous retirement benefits because they do n't cost anything today and they 'll be out of office when the payments come due , " Moorlach says .
" And the public ?
Eyes droop with boredom when you bring up the topic . "
Taxpayers on the hook
The financial soundness of civil servant pensions varies across the country .
Government pensions are , on average , in a similar condition as private pensions — about 20 % below the assets needed to be properly funded .
But some states , especially in the industrial Midwest , have severely troubled pensions .
" The taxes needed to pay for these promises would push many of these states ' economies into a death spiral , " Chicago bankruptcy lawyer James Spiotto says .
He says public employee unions should not overestimate legal protections for pension benefits .
Localities can shed their obligations in a bankruptcy filing , and states , as sovereign governments , can ignore the requirements , he says .
" Unions can win all the litigation and still lose because the judgments can't be enforced , " Spiotto says .
Tim Lee , executive director of the Texas Retired Teachers Association , says unions understand the cost of the retirement benefits .
He says his association 's top goal is improving the financial health of the pension fund , not winning new benefits .
As expensive as government pensions are to taxpayers , civil servants do n't feel the benefits make them rich .
Frank Caron , 49 , maintains lab equipment at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
He makes about $ 40,000 a year .
He has contributed heavily to his pension , including an extra $ 74 a week to restore pension credit for earlier government jobs .
That will let him retire : • At 55 with 47 % of pay ; • At 60 with 72 % of pay ; • Or at 65 with 103 % of pay .
He also will have medical benefits and be eligible for Social Security at 62 .
" I 've worked hard to have my ducks lined up in a row for retirement , " he says .
Up to 100 dead in coordinated terror , India blamed previous attacks on Pakistan
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , November 26 , 2008
Coordinated attacks across Mumbai , India ’s financial capital , which have killed up to a hundred people and injured hundreds more , are likely to be blamed on a terrorist organization linked to the Pakistani ISI , providing further justification for controversial U.S. bombings inside Pakistani territory and heightened rhetoric against Pakistan on behalf of President elect Barack Obama .
Terrorists armed with AK - 47’s and grenades conduced a series of rampages on hotels , restaurants and public transport facilities today , killing around 80 and injuring over 250 people .
Initial reports that terrorists had seized western hostages were later dismissed by Indian government officials .
With the corporate media desperate to pin the blame in order to score much needed propaganda points for the ailing war on terror , suspicion is likely to fall on Pakistan , a country that President elect Barack Obama openly threatened during his presidential campaign .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The bombings in Mumbai will also likely silence questions about controversial U.S. bombing raids inside Pakistani territory aimed at terrorists , strikes that have repeatedly killed innocent civilians .
It is commonly asserted that the Pakistani ISI helps fund and train terrorists .
Journalist Stephen Schwartz notes that several terrorist and criminal groups are “ backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army , the country ’s ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state . ”
Author Daniel Byman states , “ Pakistan is probably today ’s most active sponsor of terrorism . ”
Indeed , Indian police claimed that the Pakistani ISI directed the July 2006 train bombing in Mumbai which killed 186 people , which was blamed on the Islamist militant group Lashkar - e - Toiba , an organization based in Pakistan .
Look for the same organization or an affiliated group to be blamed for today ’s attacks .
As Bloomberg reports today , “ The government has previously blamed terrorist attacks on organizations linked to foreign powers , without offering evidence or making arrests .
Local media often blame the attacks on groups backed by Pakistan or Bangladesh , without identifying the security officials who provided the information . ”
With shrill corporate media outfits begging for a scapegoat to be used as war on terror propaganda , it wo n’t be long before an Al - Qaeda - Pakistan link is claimed .
Indeed , early reports already state that the attacks are “ thought to be linked to Al - Qaeda , ” offering no evidence and in spite of the fact that an unknown group , Deccan Mujahideen , has clamed responsibility for the massacre .
The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in India , suggesting this is where the terrorist group was based .

Right Wing Talk Show Host Endorses Obama
The conservative movement continues to denounce John McCain , and moves towards supporting an unlikely candidate , Senator Obama .
Michael Smerconish , best known perhaps for his unrelenting neoconservative views , and being a fill in for Glenn Beck , Bill O’Reilly , and Chris Matthews on his Philadelphia based program he stated :
“ My conclusion comes after reading the candidates ’ memoirs and campaign platforms , attending both party conventions , interviewing both men multiple times , and watching all primary and general election debates .
John McCain is an honorable man who has served his country well .
But he will not get my vote .
For the first time since registering as a Republican 28 years ago , I ’m voting for a Democrat for president . ”
Michael Smerconish , 10/17/08
This is just the most recent in a long line of endorsements for Senator Obama from the conservative movement .
The highest profile conservative to endorse recently was the National Review founder ’s son , Chistopher Buckley .
Buckley was forced to resign from his father ’s creation after endorsing Senator Obama in a passionate editorial .
Others that have endorsed Senator Obama include Julie Nixon Eisenhower , Andrew Bacevich , Francis Fukuyama , Christopher Hitchens , Dorothy King , and Andrew Sullivan , among a host of others .

Many in Kenya hope that with Barack Obama as President , they will see more US support for development projects in their country , as well as an influx of eco-tourists .
Barack Obama has many relatives living in Kenya , but they are n’t the only ones rooting for him today .
Pretty much all Kenyans , including Cabinet ministers , religious leaders and businesspeople , said a victory by Obama would be good for the country .
[ social_buttons ]
Kenya has long been a popular destination among eco-tourists and some hope that with Obama as president , more will be drawn to visit the country .
Despite the uphill struggles faced by Kenya ’s environmentalists , the tourism industry is definitely doing its part to save the country ’s fragile wilderness .
“ Change is coming to Kenya and the world at large .
Kenya is bound to benefit particularly in tourism , where people would want to visit the land where the President ’s father came from , ” believes Forestry and Wildlife minister Dr Noah Wekesa .
Others believe that he will positively influence development and infrastructure projects .
“ My brother may not directly influence the development in the village , ” half - brother Abongo Malik Obama said , “ But there are things that he stands for , and it is the people who believe in those things who will make moves to improve living standards , ” he told reporters in Kogelo .
The Daily Nation wrote : “ Black people the world over , and Kenyans in particular , are happy that one who traces his ancestry from the continent has a chance of leading America , and will , therefore , be in a position to influence the destiny of the world . ”
However , many have warned that Obama will not be able to do much to bring benefits to Africa , and that historically he has n’t shown much interest in the continent .
Regardless , Obama ’s relatives prepared to roast a bull in celebration today , and across the country people are praying for an Obama victory .

" It had been caught up in a wider review undertaken prior to the start of the Hyundai A - League to ensure that national or political flags are not brought into games inappropriately , '' Mr Buckley said .
" In this instance I believe it 's a case of the interpretation of ' political ' going too far and the ban has been an unintended consequence of our spectator code of behaviour . ''
Melbourne Victory chief executive Geoff Miles said the club was happy with today 's decision .
" We 're pleased that the FFA reviewed this , reviewed the policy , and clarified the Eureka flags are not caught under the prohibited flags , a policy which intended to cover any flags apart from the Australian national flag , '' he said .
" I think it probably really only came to light this weekend about the issue and in the end it does n't matter what 's been the catalyst ( for today 's reversal ) , we believe that it 's a good commonsense approach and one our fans will appreciate . ''
Mr Miles said the club had always believed supporters should be able to carry the flag , which is used as a signal of unity .
" We challenged the change of policy because we did n't believe there was a significant issue with the Eureka flag , '' he said .

Age exclusive on the controversial ban : SOCCER fans who fly the Eureka flag at A - League games will be kicked out of Docklands Stadium and have their flags confiscated .
In a move descendants of Eureka Stockade diggers have described as outrageous , the Football Federation of Australia has forced Melbourne Victory to tell its supporters the flag is banned because it is a political symbol .
In an unprecedented move , the club itself has also criticised the ban and urged the federation to reconsider .
Fans of the Victory have flown the famous standard , with its white cross and five white stars on a blue background , since the club was formed , and consider it to be a symbol of unity .
" The Eureka flag was actually the first emblem of the first Victory supporters ' group .
We 've had the Eureka flag at our games since day dot , and all of a sudden it 's got political connotations and we can't fly it , " said Adam Tennenini , leader of the Blue and White Brigade supporters ' group .
" We see it as a symbol of unity and respect among all supporters .
It 's a true Victorian symbol as well .
The FFA sees it as a political statement — us against them . "
Under federation regulations , no " flag or emblem which might be considered national or political " is allowed at games , other than the Australian flag .
The rule was brought in to ensure ethnic and political tensions were not played out in the stands at A - League games .
Mr Tennenini said he was told by security guards at Saturday 's game against Sydney FC that anybody flying the flag would be kicked out of the club 's next home game on November 21 .
Mr Tennenini said fans now planned to bring as many Eureka flags to the game as possible , in defiance of the ban .
Melbourne Victory chief executive Geoff Miles said last night that the club had challenged the ban privately , but was now publicly backing its supporters .
" We believe that the flying of Eureka flags really is n't adversely affecting , polarising or disenfranchising our supporters or opposition supporters , " Mr Miles said .
" The Eureka flag is a historic symbol in Victoria and Australia , and while it can be associated with political unions and movements , at its core Eureka represents Australians coming together as a collective for a cause they believe in .
" Our supporters have had the capacity to fly the Eureka flags for the past three years … a review of this regulation will be looked upon very favourably . "
The Eureka flag was first flown as a symbol of the resistance of the gold miners during the Eureka Stockade rebellion in 1854 .
Since then , it has been co-opted by both ends of the political spectrum , but is now listed as an object of state significance on the Victorian Heritage Register , and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006 .
Paul Murphy , founder of Eureka 's Children , a group made up of descendants of the 1854 rebels , yesterday described the ban as outrageous .
" Whenever you see the flag , whether it 's farmers in Mildura , soccer fans or on building sites , it simply means ' I 'm pissed off with whoever 's in charge ' , " said Mr Murphy , whose great - great - grandfather , Michael Canny , was wounded at the Eureka Stockade .
" It 's an act of free expression and I would encourage those supporters to fly it as an act of defiance , with the best wishes of the Eureka descendants . "
Under the Howard government , the Australian Building and Construction Commission banned the flying of the flag on all worksites because of its union connotations .
Predictably , Mr Murphy said , the response of union members was to fly the flag as prominently as possible .
" The ABCC tried that on last year and all it did was inflame the unionists , so the unionists now show up with every bloody version of the flag they can , " he said .
" We 've always said that it 's about unity .
There were 20 nationalities at Eureka , and if the Melbourne fans are flying it as a symbol of unity , it shows that symbol is still valid . "
From the sublime to the ridiculous , years of promise in bringing the internet to the television screen is finally starting to deliver .
We ’ve covered Sony and Samsung entering the race to deliver internet to the lounge room , now add Panasonic and Phillips to the list .
Panasonic ’s VieraCast will incorporate content from EuroSport , Bloomberg , Google ’s Picassa and YouTube , with more in the pipeline with the first sets to go on sale in the northern spring 2009 .
Phillips ’
Net TV service will also be built into sets going on sale in 2009 .
In terms of marketshare , the only company missing from the list is the US number three player LG .
Although they have yet to demonstrate an internet enabled television , LG is the company that brought the world the internet refrigerator , and currently supports internet access in their Blu-ray players , allowing users to stream or download content from Netflix .
It ’s not a matter of if LG will join the party , it ’s only a question of when .
2009 will be the year of internet television .
All major players will offer internet connectivity in some form or another across parts of their product range .
But availability does n’t deliver ubiquity .
Television sales are interesting in the context of the US downturn , actually rising as the economy slowed .
Two factors today are driving sales : the affordability and desirability of large screen televisions , and the impeding switch to digital television .
Both apply nearly equally across Western countries .
We want our big screens , and word of mouth and clever marketing is driving demand for HD .
Where as a television may have remained in the family for 20 years in the past , we willingly update our television sets every 5 years or so now to keep up with the Jones ’ .
The economics of replacement exist , if you do n’t have a big screen now you may have budgeted it as a future purchase .
If you have a big screen now , you may be wondering whether it ’s big enough , a question I ’ve already asked myself about our 18 month old 40 ″ Sony Bravia .
I know I ’m not about to go out and replace my set , but as prices continue to fall and screens get bigger , it ’s conceivable that in the next 2 - 3 years , I ’ll be upgrading again .
But what defines one set to another ?
Sony , Panasonic , Phillips and Samsung believe that internet access will be a selling point in driving future sales .
Some will offer a more open platforms than others , and users will be given a variety of choices .
If considering the same sized television , with the same screen resolution , inputs , at the same price , and one has internet access , it ’s pretty obvious which one consumer will choose .
The differentiation will then drive supply , as those not offering internet enabled televisions will scramble to match the competition .
Features will improve , the range will expand , until ultimately we get to the point where every new television offered for sale will become internet enabled .
2015 will be 6 years after internet television hits the big time .
Even if we take a television replacement cycle out to 6 - 8 years , enough people will be in the market to drive the adaption forward so that internet functionality wo n’t be a driver , it will become just another standard feature as technology such as OLED become the new focal points .
Every television set will offer internet connectivity , as those that did n’t offer access have ceased selling , or been upgraded to keep up .
In 2015 , the idea that your new television set is n’t internet enabled will be foreign to general populous .
So long broadcast television
When I wrote about the death of broadcast television , I mentioned the rise of the internet enabled television as the driver of the nail into traditional televisions nail .
What I did n’t know then was how quickly this change would come around , and even months ago I could n’t have predicted that in 2009 internet enabled televisions would be everywhere .
I ’m still putting the death at 10 to 20 years , but what we are seeing now can only hasten the downfall of broadcast television .
Take it as a given that by 2014 the majority of people will have an internet enabled television , and that by the end of the decade all bar a small few will have digital delivery of content in their lounge rooms .
We can look no further than the content deals already being cut with this first generation of internet televisions that cable channels in particular are scrambling to offer their content on demand digitally , and smart television companies will follow , because they will realize that to reach their audience , digital content delivery will win out over broadcast television when everyone has access via their remote control .

In Capitol Hill official - speak , it ’s called the “ transitional suite . ”
In reality , the harshly lit warren of numbered cubicles in the bowels of the Rayburn House Office Building is the private purgatory of members of Congress who are no longer needed .
Mere weeks after losing power , defeated or retiring US representatives move to this temporary basement setup from the comfortable office suites where they previously worked .
Here they pass their final days in office , each soon - to - be ex-legislator and his or her staff issued a single work space measuring approximately 5 ’ x5 ′ .
The cramped cubicle accommodates little more than a tiny desk , a laptop , a phone , and a box of Kleenex .
Bob Beauprez , a former two - term Republican congressman from Colorado who left office in 2006 to pursue an unsuccessful run for governor , recalls his own transition from elected office .
“ Anybody who ’s been through [ this ] who does n’t look in the mirror and wonder if anybody cares anymore … ” he says , trailing off .
“ You go through a little bit of withdrawal .
I was significant yesterday — today I ’m not . ”
In the weeks prior to December 1 , when departing members of the House must vacate their offices for the transitional suite , the mood in B - 339 Rayburn is decidedly more upbeat .
During this period , it serves as the temporary quarters for newly elected House members , who are quickly swept up by a whirlwind of activity that includes orientation sessions and postelection parties and mixers .
“ When you ’re part of the arriving class , it ’s a beehive of activity , ” says David Williams , the chief of staff to Rep. Steve Kagen ( D - Wisc. ) , who has escorted both arriving and departing members through the transition process .
“ It ’s Grand Central Station at rush hour .
When you ’re there with the departing members , it ’s Grand Central on Christmas Day .
It ’s empty .
In fact , it ’s pretty morose . ”
On a recent afternoon , Helene Flanagan , a Hill staffer who has helped to coordinate congressional transitions for 27 years , took me on a brief tour through the 3,900 - square - foot basement suite , then in the process of being set up for the roughly 50 new members expected in the House .
She described both the mechanics and mood of the changeover .
“ I always say the freshmen members of Congress are like freshmen in college , ” Flanagan told me , standing among a bank of cubicles .
“ They ’re wide - eyed and happy to be here . ”
On arriving , she says , it ’s straight down to business as new members of Congress are bombarded with information , ranging from ethics tutorials to staffing options .
“ It ’s like taking a fire hose to the poor souls , because we provide them with so much information .
We get a lot of deer - in - the - headlight looks . ”
After Thanksgiving , the new members of Congress are moved into their permanent offices , which are assigned through a lottery process .
“ Oftentimes , they are surprised how small the office space is , ” says Flanagan , adding that it can come as a particular shock to those who held high - flying jobs prior to entering public service .
After moving in , members meet with an architect to design the layout of their offices .
If the office is due for new carpeting or drapes , the members - elect can choose replacements from an array of swatches .
But when it comes to carpeting , there is one firm rule , Flanagan says :
One color per office suite .
“ To save them from bad taste , ” she explains .
It is n’t all work for the freshmen , who are inundated with invites to parties and luncheons held by fellow lawmakers , special interest groups , and lobbyists .
It ’s a little - known fact that the strict rules [ PDF ] on gift giving and lobbying that apply to sitting members do not cover members - elect .
During an orientation session on congressional ethics in 2006 , a Hill staffer who managed the transition for a newly elected Democrat recalls the trainer joked to the freshmen members , “ Now is the time to get any expensive gifts out of the way . ”
The staffer provided a schedule of the orientation period , during which his boss was invited to eight receptions and four meals in the span of five days .
“ I took home a bottle of wine , a white chocolate Capitol Dome filled with chocolate nougat , and a tote bag , ” the staffer says .
The new lawmaker got the wine plus a fruit basket .
For departing members , these transitional weeks are less glamorous .
While their replacements are rubbing elbows with the party leadership , the departees are offered resume writing and retirement planning seminars — even therapy sessions , if needed .
Overnight these members go from dealing with issues of national import to attending to administrative minutiae .
Among other things , they must ensure that all the equipment in their office , which technically belongs to the citizens of their districts , is accounted for .
If so much as a laptop is missing , the member is held personally liable .
“ If they do n’t pay , we take it out of their paycheck , ” says Flanagan .
An archivist is on hand if they wish to submit their papers to a library or university .
( It ’s up to them to handle any last - minute shredding . )
For Beauprez , who served on the powerful Ways and Means committee , through which many of the House ’s most important bills pass , the postelection period came as a shock .
“ You go from being in the middle of the nation ’s business to suddenly the phone does n’t ring , ” he says .
“ There ’s no mail that goes through .
There ’s nobody to respond to . ”
Of his final weeks as a congressman , Beauprez recalls , “ We had about two weeks of wrapping - up work after the election .
That ’s the most awkward part , when you know you ’re not coming back but you ’ve still got an obligation to finish the job you were elected to do .
You ’re just kind of sweeping out the corners of the room . ”
Dude , you 're getting a Dell ( NASDAQ : DELL ) earnings report !
Thursday afternoon !
Are you excited yet ?
Read on to learn whether you should be .
What analysts say :
Buy , sell , or waffle ?
Twenty - nine analysts follow Dell , one fewer than last quarter .
They give the stock 14 buy ratings , 11 holds , and four sells .

On average , they expect to see sales rise 5 % to $ 16.4 billion .
Earnings .
Profits are predicted to drop 6 % to $ 0.32 per share .
What management says :
Never mind what Dell management says .
The most current picture of the PC market today comes instead from archrival Hewlett - Packard ( NYSE : HPQ ) , which released preliminary earnings numbers this morning .
Without going into too much detail ( fellow Fool Tim Beyers covered the bases on this report ) , H - P reported market share gains ( from Dell ? Lenovo ?
Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) ? ) , better - than - expected earnings , and raised guidance for the rest of this year .
What management does :
That provides a stark contrast to the story at Dell , where we 've watched gross , operating , and net margins slide for some time now .
Margins 5/07 8/07 11/07 2/08 5/08 8/08 Gross 17.0 % 18.3 % 18.7 % 19.1 % 18.8 % 18.2 % Operating 5.3 % 5.8 % 6.0 % 5.9 % 5.8 % 5.6 % Net 4.4 % 4.8 % 5.0 % 4.8 % 4.8 % 4.4 %
One Fool says :
Further confusing the picture , the last we heard from Dell , things were getting worse .
Back in August , Dell ended its Q2 earnings report with a forecast of " continued conservatism in IT spending in the U.S. "
In September , Dell warned that this " conservative " demand was " further softening " in Q3 .
Since then , we 've seen Dell 's pessimism confirmed both upstream and downstream in the retail channel , in the form of earnings warnings from both Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) and Best Buy ( NYSE : BBY ) .
And yes , I suppose you could call Circuit City 's bankruptcy filing a warning of sorts as well .
Despite the pessimistic outlook , though , Dell also told us in September that it expected to grow faster than the industry for the full year .
H- P's report of market share gains , however , suggests that that may not be how things are playing out .
Tune in Thursday , and we 'll see whether Dell can help us make any sense of this mess .

Possible inequality = special stipulations
by Jeremy Hooper
Oh , the joys of being a gay person planning a post - November California wedding -- they simply never end !
Want an example of just one ?
Well here is a section of a vendor contract that was just sent to this writer and his fiancé .
As you will see , our contract had to be specifically altered in order to accommodate our special needs :
Jealous , engaged heteros ?
You do n't see this stuff in Modern Bride !
Your thoughts
It could actually turn out to be a good thing .
Because those vendors , now , have a bonafide interest in the outcome of the vote .
You should take the opportunity to suggest to them that their ( financial , vocal , volunteer ) support of " No on 8 " could benefit their bottom line .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Oct 17 , 2008 6:12:21 PM
What : Silent Witness - No on 8 Visibility Event When : 1:15 pm , Sunday , October 19th Where : Cherry Bean , 332 Main Street , in Old Town Salinas

By By Sadiq Green Oct 12 , 2008 in Politics Republican John McCain ’s supporters hate Barack Obama and can barely contain their rage .
At campaign stop after campaign stop , the McCain entourage is looking like it ’s on the “ Straight Hate Express ” , as supporters hurl expletives at the Democrat .
It should be pointed out that the McCain campaign was not the blame in igniting this explosive issue .
The racial Although the McCain campaign was already in The anticipation prior to the last debate was that Senator McCain would unleash a similar attack upon Senator Obama , but it never occurred during the nationally televised town hall meeting .
Instead , McCain took the show on the road and before angry supporters painted the picture of his rival as a shady , suspicious terrorist sympathizer and It worked .
With each rally the crowds grew angrier and more hate filled .
As McCain and Palin took turns painting Obama as anti-American , with Plain going so far as to suggest the Democrat does not support the troops in Afghanistan , the more agitated their supporter grew .
The hate started to boil over last week as crowds shouted “ kill him , ” “ terrorist , ” " bomb Obama " and “ off with his head ” as they turned their hate toward Senator Obama .
Some in the all White McCain rallies expressed fear over the prospect of an Obama presidency .
It will probably go down as the turning point in the 2008 general election campaign .
Race has been in the backdrop of this election since Senator Obama announced his candidacy .
For a time even his racial “ credentials ” were being questioned by Blacks who were unfamiliar with his life story and did not identify with the Hawaiian born senator .
Many Blacks did not feel a historical connection to Obama , perhaps because his father was a foreigner and not a Black man in the tradition of the southern United States .
Once he cleared that hurdle , he faced the aforementioned criticism from Senator Clinton that he did not understand the issues facing the working class and that he was an elitist .
Many political observers viewed Clinton ’s charge as an appeal to White , working class voters who had doubts about Obama due to his race .
That was evident after primaries in West Virginia and Kentucky as primary voters stated as much .
For many Blacks it was a reminder of a time when simply possessing an education and clinging to middle class sensibilities would subject one to the charge of being “ uppity . ”
The McCain campaign ’s tactics in recent days have borrowed heavily from the playbook of the Jim Crow era in America .
It has principally been a call to “ patriotism ” to combat a subversive force [ Obama ] who does not share the values of God fearing Americans and who sympathizes with the enemy [ Arab Muslims ] and share their world view .
Thus the perpetual invoking of his middle name of Hussein .
It has been a rather sinister , yet effectively targeted , strategy to drive a wedge between White working class voters and Senator Obama .
Outside of the raucous McCain campaign rallies some evidence of the strategy ’s effectiveness can be heard in the reluctance of White , union voters to throw their support behind Senator Obama ; despite their union ’s endorsement and his alignment with their issues .
It ’s enough to make Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms rise from the dead .
There has perhaps been no other presidential campaign in recent history that has traded so heavily upon cultural animus to disparage a candidate .
I offer that even the late Alabama Governor George Wallace ’s “ state ’s rights ” campaign and Richard Nixon ’s “ southern strategy ” was not as “ in your face ” as what is occurring at McCain rallies .
With some supporters expressing violent thoughts when referring to Senator Obama , the campaign has entered into a dangerous new phase where some
White voters feel they are at liberty to make life threatening remarks , or commit acts , against Senator Obama and his family .

Senator McCain ’s attempt to tone down the rhetoric of his supporters was met with boos .
It may perhaps be too little , too late in a campaign that the nation must now be concerned has the potential to ignite a racial firestorm before and after Election Day on November 4 , no matter who prevails .
Lets hope not .

It may perhaps be too little , too late in a campaign that the nation must now be concerned has the potential to ignite a racial firestorm before and after Election Day on November 4 , no matter who prevails .

Make no mistake about it , some of the scenes are reminiscent of White Citizen Council meetings during the heyday of Civil Rights Era when Whites implored their civic leaders to protect the virtue of their community by keeping Negroes in their place .
It should be pointed out that the McCain campaign was not the blame in igniting this explosive issue .
The racial fuse was lit during the Democratic primary by Senator Hillary Clinton 's campaign when it labeled Obama an elitist .
They then feigned ignorance when she spoke of her religion while esposing questions about Obama's .
Since that time , and even earlier just by virtue of him being Black , the Illinois Senator has been walking a tightrope ; trying to remain race neutral while race shadowed his every move .
Now those racial demons have been awakened by a Republican campaign that sees its chances for victory fading in the fog of the nation ’s economic meltdown .
Although the McCain campaign was already in full negative mode , they made news recently by announcing that they were going to ratchet up the rhetoric .
Just prior to the second presidential debate the McCain campaign did just that and attacked Senator Obama for his supposed relationship former Weather Underground member William Ayers .
The Republican ticket , seeing its hopes fade in battleground states such as Michigan and Ohio , decided to invoke Ayer ’s name despite the fact that he and Senator Obama have only had a casual acquaintance tied to community activities .
Furthermore the acts of the Weather Underground were committed during the Vietnam War era when the senator was a child , and even the lead prosecutor of the Weathermen has expressed outrage in the McCain campaigns portrayal of the Illinois Senator .
Leading the charge for team McCain has been running mate Sarah Palin , an ironic development given that she was on the verge of being severely reprimanded by an investigation in her home state that eventually concluded she abused her power in attempting to fire a state official .
The anticipation prior to the last debate was that Senator McCain would unleash a similar attack upon Senator Obama , but it never occurred during the nationally televised town hall meeting .

Adoptions are down , and more abandoned pets are coming in .
Some pet owners “ ca n’t even afford food , ” an official said .
The Paulson plan as a carry trade play .
John Berry :
Bloomberg.com : Opinion :
There might be a gem in the Treasury 's plan to buy $ 700 billion of dubious mortgage - related assets .
Call it the biggest carry trade in history .
It might just put as much as $ 60 billion a year in the government 's coffers ....
The government will get the $ 700 billion by selling a range of Treasury securities to the public with yields of 3 percent to 4 percent .
With investors around the world clamoring to buy risk - free Treasuries , the market should be able to absorb the jump in supply without a significant increase in yields .
Contrast that with likely yields on the troubled assets for which there currently is no market .
No one can be sure how big a haircut there will be on the assets Treasury buys , though if it 's 50 percent or more , their yields should be 10 percent or higher .
That is , the government will be borrowing at 3 percent to 4 percent to buy assets yielding 10 percent or even 12 percent .
Conservatively , that spread on an investment of $ 700 billion should generate income of $ 40 billion to $ 60 billion annually .
Obviously , there 's no way to be sure of the income from this carry trade ....
We can be certain that the spread is going to be very wide ....
The income from the carry trade will make a big difference on the impact of the bailout on the federal budget ....
Do the arithmetic .
Suppose the government buys $ 700 billion worth of assets after a 50 percent haircut , holds them for four years and then sells them for 40 percent of par .
That would be a capital loss of $ 140 billion .
Meanwhile , the carry trade has earned perhaps $ 50 billion a year , or $ 200 billion over the four years -- an overall profit of $ 60 billion -- and lower budget deficits .
Remember , there are no taxes affecting this deal ....
[ T ]he risk to taxpayers is much less than you might think based on the congressional debate over the plan offered by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ...
I swear , this is the best Republican circular firing squad evah !
According to Sarah Palin , it was the RNC
According to the RNC , it was the McCain campaign
And Fred Barnes throws consultant Nicole Wallace under the Straight Talk Express and says it was her .
Unsurprisingly , now it 's suspected that Nicole Wallace is the " unnamed McCain campaign worker " feeding the media all the stories about the diva - like behavior of Sarah Palin .
Rachel Maddow talks about the McCain campaign meltdown :
It is just too schadenfreude - licious
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York held an emergency meeting on Friday evening with top financial market representatives to discuss recent market developments , a Fed official said .
“ Senior representatives of major financial markets met at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Friday evening to discuss recent market developments , ” a Fed official told Reuters .
The official said New York Fed President Timothy Geithner , U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox were among the participants in the meeting .
Financial markets have been on tenterhooks over the future of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and whether the struggling investment bank , whose stock value has collapsed , may or may not be able to find a buyer .
The talks at the New York Fed took place as discussions between Lehman and other parties continued .
The Treasury and Fed have been involved in talks regarding Lehman ’s future .
Earlier on Friday , a source familiar with the thinking of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Paulson was “ adamant ” no public funds be put on the line to help facilitate a sale .

Today I want to publish the first half of a ‘ debate ’ .
The topic is whether bloggers should promote their content on Digg .
In this post Josh Klein argues the negative .
Later in the week I ’ve asked a big Digg users to tackle the flip side .
If you ’re promoting on Digg , you ’re losing your blog money .
The web is crowded , attention spread thin .
It may not cost you a $ 70,000 full page print ad , but building a following requires patience and passion .
It ’s almost 2009 , and the social media personal brand is n’t an early adopters ’ secret anymore .
Promoting your blog can be free , but not costless .
When you ’re down in the trenches , scouring online guides for tips and tactics on how to drive traffic to your blog , you sometimes miss the big picture , the strategy .
You do n’t have a limitless amount of time or money , so you need to decide what not to do .
It ’s not always about “ how to ” — sometimes it ’s about “ which to ” .
Like all social media , Digg costs time -– and lots of it -– so I want to make sure your time is well spent .
I ’m not here to tell you Digg does n’t work ; there are plenty of people reading right now who have hit the front page and gotten that famously temporary blast of traffic .
But how many of those people have turned it into a sustainable strategy for making money ?
Did they do it after reading the same “ Top 10 Ways to Win on Digg ” guide as 100,000 other traffic - hungry bloggers ?
I ’m here to tell you the juice is n’t worth the squeeze .
For those who are n’t familiar with Digg ( yeah right ) , here ’s a snippet from the about page :
“ Digg is a place for people to discover and share content from anywhere on the web .
From the biggest online destinations to the most obscure blog , Digg surfaces the best stuff as voted on by our users .
You wo n’t find editors at Digg . ”
That requires some translation .
Here ’s what it really means ( with tongue planted firmly in cheek ) :
“ Digg is a place for 18 - 24 year old males to read about Internet gossip .
From the smallest local news rags to the wittiest satire websites , Digg surfaces the stuff most entertaining to our users as determined by our large staff of editors . ”
The problem is Diggers are n’t Doers .
Digg ’s mission is to be distracting .
People use Digg as a sanctuary , to be bounced from page to page as a momentary respite from their day jobs as knowledge workers .
Unless your website ’s tagline is “ Distract Yourself Here , ” it does n’t match the Digg demography .
The value you provide , no matter how high , will not match a Digger ’s expectation , and he will eventually move on .
This makes visitors from Digg unqualified traffic .
You might convert a few here and there , but it ’d be like corralling a horde of anti-war protesters into an Army recruitment office ; it does n’t matter how many you get , they ’re not going to join .
And what did it cost to get those visitors ?
How many people did you ask to Digg your submission ?
How much time did you spend wooing a power user ?
How much did you water down your content so you could submit the Top 10 Ways Ducks Quack ?
I talk alot about value , so here ’s the truth about Digg as succinctly as possible : your time is better spent elsewhere .
What else could you be doing for every hour you spend with Digg ?
Do n’t get me wrong ; I enjoy entertaining myself on Digg as much as you , but we ’re talking about making money here people .
There are no shortcuts , just good ideas and bad ideas .
Digg is not the right place to promote your blog .
If you want to really espouse the lessons of social media , find the people who matter and , you know , talk to them .
Try forums , for one , or other blogs .
If you ask Darren in the comments below , maybe he ’ll let me come back and talk about those soon .
If not , maybe try shaking hands and kissing babies .
Just stay away from Digg .
Josh Klein advises Fortune 500 companies on their web strategies and writes a blog about making websites that matter to human beings .
PS from Darren : Stay tuned for the flip side of this topic .
In the next couple of days I ’ve got a post from a big Digg using blogger who will tackle the topic of why Digg IS a site bloggers should consider spending time on .
John Walters Backs a Mexican Proposal Far More Sweeping Than U.S. Measures He Has Opposed
( Washington , D.C. ) The Marijuana Policy Project today congratulated White House “ drug czar ” John Walters for backing a Mexican government proposal that would remove criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana .
“ I ca n’t believe I ’m actually saying this , but John Walters is right , ” said MPP executive director Rob Kampia .
“ We heartily second his support for eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana users in Mexico , and look forward to working with him to end such penalties in the U.S. as well . ”
On Oct. 22 , The New York Times reported Walters ’ public support for a drug decriminalization proposal by Mexican President Felipe Calderon , quoting Walters as saying , “ I do n’t think that ’s legalization . ”
Under Calderon ’s proposal , individuals caught with small quantities of marijuana would receive no jail sentence or fine and would not receive a criminal record so long as they complete either drug education or , if addicted , drug treatment .
Unlike proposals supported by MPP , the Mexican president ’s proposal would also decriminalize possession of small amounts of heroin , cocaine and methamphetamine .
“ It ’s fantastic that John Walters has recognized the massive destruction the drug war has inflicted on Mexico and is now calling for reforms there , but he ’s a rank hypocrite if he continues opposing similar reforms in the U.S. , ” Kampia said .
“ The Mexican proposal is far more sweeping than MPP ’s proposals to decriminalize marijuana or make marijuana medically available , both of which John Walters and his henchmen rail against . ”
In a March 19 , 2008 , press release from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , deputy director Scott Burns called a New Hampshire proposal to impose a $ 200 fine rather than jail time for a small amount of marijuana “ a dangerous first step toward complete drug legalization . ”
With more than 25,000 members and 100,000 e-mail subscribers nationwide , the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana policy reform organization in the United States .
MPP believes that the best way to minimize the harm associated with marijuana is to regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol .

Since we were old enough to flush , we have been amazed by the miracle of sewage .
How disorienting and constipating to learn that this miracle is not quite a miracle , per se .
London - based science journalist Rose George 's book about the subject , The Big Necessity : The Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why It Matters , explores every possible use of feces , from hilarious practical joke to energy supply in China .
The facts are so staggering , you 'll want to read them while sitting down .
You know where :
Eighty percent of the world 's illness is caused by fecal matter .
A gram of feces can contain 10 million viruses , 1 million bacteria , 1,000 parasite cysts , and 100 worm eggs .
Bacteria can be beneficial : the human body needs bacteria to function , and only 10 percent of cells in our body are actually human .
Plenty are not .
Small fecal particles can then contaminate water , food , cutlery , and shoes - and be ingested , drunk , or unwittingly eaten .
One sanitation specialist has estimated that people who live in areas with inadequate sanitation ingest 10 grams of fecal matter every day .

As with the space race , China is on the forefront of advances in human excrement , George says .
It 's not just innovation in toilet technology like the ping pong john below : the energy that comes from the fermenting of feces is called biogas , and pig feces and human feces are the primary source to fuel stoves for cooking .

Can biogas fuel my PSP ?
Because that would be the only capitalist application of this process I can currently think of .
We highly recommend George 's book , which you can find here .
Excerpts from the book [ Slate ]
Neal Hefti , the man responsible for the " energetic " theme tune for the TV series Batman , has died aged 85 , the LA Times reports
The former big band trumpeter , arranger and composer passed away on Saturday at the end of a long career , encompassing multiple film scores and collaboration with some musical greats including Count Basie and Woody Herman .
Hefti's theme for Batman - which ran from 1966 to 1968 - became a Top 40 hit and secured the 1966 Grammy Award for best instrumental theme .
He admitted , though , that it was a tough nut to crack , taking more than a month to complete .
He recounted to Jon Burlingame , author of TV's Biggest Hits : " I tore up a lot of paper .
It did not come easy to me .
I just sweated over that thing , more so than any other single piece of music I ever wrote .
I was never satisfied with it .
I was almost going to call them and say , I can't do it .
But I never walk out on projects , so I sort of forced myself to finish . "
Burlingame described the musical solution as " perfect : bass guitar , low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm , while an eight - voice chorus sings ' Batman ! ' in harmony with the trumpets .
It was part serious , part silly : just like the series . "
The LA Times has more on Hefti's life and achievements here . ®

http://www.obfuscated.org/2008/09/29/help-me-write-idiomatically-correct-python/
This is my modified solution to that small problem , solved in Python and Haskell .
Note that in Python operations among sets and dicts items are very fast , so it 's better to perform them on already created sets .
This takes two sorted sequence of items , and returns a list of pairs in sorting order :
def cmpseq ( seqa , seqb ) : a = set ( seqa ) b = set ( seqb ) s = sorted ( s1 | s2 ) return [ ( ( x if x in a else None ) , ( x if x in b else None ) ) for x in s ] print cmpseq ( [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] , [ 2,4,6,8,10 ] )
Output :
[ ( 1 , None ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , ( 3 , None ) , ( 4 , 4 ) , ( 5 , None ) , ( None , 6 ) , ( None , 8 ) , ( None , 10 ) ]
A partially lazy version of that Python code can be produced by returning :
return ( ( ( x if x in s1 else None ) , ( x if x in s2 else None ) ) for x in union )
Now I try to translate that code in D , using my libs .
There are several ways to do it .
D language has no boxed integers .
You can define them , but no other parts of the language use them .
So it may be better to use the simplest possible thing , so I 've used pairs of pointers to items ( integers here ) .
The D GC will take care of not delete items referenced still .
This works only with arrays as inputs , but it 's easy to generalize ( this code requires the Set data structure of the libs to have the opOr ( ) method too , it 's implemented but commented out still waiting for more testing ) :
import d.all ; Struct !( T* , T* ) cmpArr ( T ) ( T [ ] seq_a , T[ ] seq_b ) { auto a = set ( seq_a ) ; auto b = set ( seq_b ) ; auto s = sorted ( a | b ) ; return map ( ( T x ) {return toStruct ( x in a ?
&x : cast ( T *) null , x in b ?
&x : cast ( T *) null ) ;} , s ) ; } void main ( ) { putr( cmpArr ( [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] , [ 2,4,6,8,10 ] ) ) ; } A possible output :
[ toStruct ( 0x12FEC8 , null ) , toStruct ( 0x12FEC8 , 0x12FEC8 ) , toStruct ( 0x12FEC8 , null ) , toStruct ( 0x12FEC8 , 0x12FEC8 ) , toStruct ( 0x12FEC8 , null ) , toStruct ( null , 0x12FEC8 ) , toStruct ( null , 0x12FEC8 ) , toStruct ( null , 0x12FEC8 ) ]
It can be modified to accept general iterables :
Struct !( BaseType1 !( Tya ) * , BaseType1 !( Tya ) * ) [ ] cmpArr( Tya , Tyb ) ( Tya seqa , Tyb seqb ) { alias BaseType1 !( Tya ) TyItem ; static assert ( is ( TyItem == BaseType1 ! ( Tyb ) ) , " Different base type " ) ; auto a = set ( seqa ) ; auto b = set ( seqb ) ; auto s = sorted ( a | b ) ; TyItem * none = null ; return map ( ( TyItem x ) {return toStruct ( x in a ?
&x : none , x in b ? &x : none ) ;} , s ) ; } The code can be improved more to allow it to digest for example an iterable of ints and an iterable of longs .
That 's O ( n ) code , but input data is sorted , so it can be solved in O ( n ) .
The following works only on arrays as inputs , but it can be generalized some ( not much tested ) :
Struct !( T* , T* ) [ ] cmpArr( T ) ( T[ ] seq_a , T[ ] seq_b ) {
T* pa = seq_a.ptr ; T* pb = seq_b.ptr ; T* enda = pa + len( seq_a ) ; T* endb = pb + len( seq_b ) ; ArrayBuilder !( Struct !( T* , T* ) ) result ; result .
reserve = max ( len ( seq_a ) , len( seq_b ) ) ; while ( pa != enda && pb != endb ) if ( * pa < * pb ) { result ~= toStruct ( pa , cast ( T * ) null ) ; pa ++ ; } else if ( * pa > * pb ) { result ~= toStruct ( cast ( T * ) null , pb ) ; pb++ ; } else { result ~= toStruct ( pa , pb ) ; pa ++ ; pb++ ; } while ( pa != enda ) { result ~= toStruct ( pa , cast ( T * ) null ) ; pa ++ ; } while ( pb != endb ) { result ~= toStruct ( cast ( T * ) null , pb ) ; pb++ ; } return result.
toarray ; } But as you can see the code is quite more hairy .

Is compassion a skill that can be perfected , like playing a musical instrument or competing in sports ?
A study published this spring suggests : Yes .
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin assert that cultivating compassion and kindness through learned meditation practices can make a person more empathetic .
Previous studies have pinpointed the insula and anterior congulate cortices in empathetic responses .
Researchers recently investigated the voluntary generation of compassion in this neuronal network by asking participants to engage in compassion meditation , and measuring their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The participants were Tibetan monks with a minimum of 10,000 hours of meditation practice .
Sixteen of these subjects were matched with age - matched controls with no previous meditation experience .
The controls were taught the basics of compassion meditation 2 weeks prior to commencing the research .
To study brain activity , scientists presented both emotional and neutral sounds during meditation and comparison periods .
( Sounds included a distressed woman , a baby laughing , and background restaurant noise . )
This allowed participants to keep their eyes slightly open , but not focus on visual stimuli , as is typical of meditative practices .
The fMRI scans revealed activity in the insula and the temporal parietal juncture in the right hemisphere — two areas of the brain that detect and respond to emotions .
The activity was increased in response to negative sounds compared to positive or neutral sounds .
Notably , the activity was much higher in the expert meditators than the novices .
The researchers concluded that the brain can , therefore , be trained to exhibit more powerful responses to empathy .
People can learn to regulate thoughts and emotions and promote happiness and compassion through practicing compassion meditation regularly .
Techniques for compassion meditation include concentration exercises that train attention , behavioral training such as practicing generosity , and cognitive strategies of self - reflection and visualizing the suffering of others .
The long - term goal for practitioners of compassion meditation is to decrease egocentric traits , allowing altruistic behaviors to arise more frequently .
Scientists hope that these techniques may be useful for teaching compassion to children and adolescents and decreasing bullying and violence , as well as helping people prone to depression learn compassion for themselves .
The researchers are planning a study to examine brain changes over a longer period of time of people who practice compassion meditation .
Meditation practices impact physiological pathways that regulate stress and disease - causing processes .
Much attention is focused on meditation to improve attention , develop mindfulness , and calm the mind .
However , there is now evidence that physiological processes are activated in meditation focused on cultivating compassion .
An additional study found that engaging in compassion meditation might reduce stress - induced immune and behavioral responses .
Contemplative strategies have been used for centuries by various societies to encourage kindness and compassion .
The ambition to cultivate positive feelings , including the wish for happiness for others and the wish to relieve others ’ sufferings , is certainly noble .
Hopefully , practice makes perfect when it comes to compassion .

More families with children are becoming homeless as they face mounting economic pressures , including mortgage foreclosures , according to a USA TODAY survey of a dozen of the largest cities in the nation .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Local authorities say the number of families seeking help has risen in Atlanta , Boston , Denver , Minneapolis , New York , Phoenix , Portland , Seattle and Washington .
“ Everywhere I go , I hear there is an increase ” in the need for housing aid , especially for families , says Philip Mangano , executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness , which coordinates federal programs .
He says the main causes are job losses and foreclosures .
Other factors have been higher food and fuel prices hitting families with “ no cushion , ” says Nan Roman of the National Alliance to End Homelessness .
Many mayors have 10 - year plans to end homelessness and had reported progress until this year .
The most recent official count , in January 2007 , found 671,888 people living on U.S. streets or in shelters , down 12 % from January 2005 .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Researchers have developed a new anti-reflective coating that boosts the efficiency of solar panels and allows sunlight to be absorbed from almost any angle .
Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute researchers say they 've made advances in absorption of sunlight .
Scientists from the Future Chips Constellation ( FCC ) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York have created the coating using nanotechnology -- engineering devices on a molecular scale .
They are hopeful that it can transform the solar energy market in the coming years .
A typical untreated silicon solar cell absorbs just over two thirds of the sunlight it receives .
But with the FCC 's nanoengineered coating , that figure rises to 96.21 percent .
In their paper : " Realization of a near perfect antireflection coating for silicon solar energy utilization , " published in the scientific journal Optics Letters , researchers report that gains in absorption were consistent across the entire spectrum of sunlight -- ultraviolet , visible light , and infrared .
" To get maximum efficiency when converting solar power into electricity , you want a solar panel that can absorb nearly every single photon of light , regardless of the sun 's position in the sky , " said Rensselaer physics professor Shawn - Yu Lin , and head of the FCC research team .
" Our new anti-reflective coating makes this possible . "
Comprising of seven tiny layers , each 50 to 100 nanometers in height , the coating is made of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide nanorods positioned at an oblique angle .
The FCC team found that stacking the coatings one on top of another enhanced the anti-reflective properties of each layer .
Having a series of layers also helps to " bend " the flow of sunlight which assists in capturing light that would otherwise be reflected off .
Lin , an expert in nanostructure photonics and a pioneer in the field of photonic crystals , says that the new coating could be applied to just about any photovoltaic material .
Conventional solar technology has thus far dictated that solar panels be mounted on south - facing roofs , or in locations where the sun source is unrestricted and strong .
But this new coating could change all this .
It would also mean that large scale solar farms , like the giant array in Alentejo , Portugal , could increase their output while saving on energy used to track the sun .
" The anti-reflective coating requires multi-layer coatings which are slightly more complex than the typical single - layer ones , " Lin told CNN .
" However , the thickness of each individual layer does not need to be precise .
This makes manufacturing easier . "
Lin is currently exploring partnerships and licensing arrangements , and estimates the product could be on the market as soon as the next two to three years .
" The economics of modern day solar cells depends largely on the thickness of the substrate ( 500 - 1000 micrometers ) and the processing cost for making the junctions .
Our coating has a thickness of 0.7 to 1 micrometer .
The additional cost for incorporating our antireflective coating should not exceed two to four percent of that for existing solar cells , " Lin said .
The only downside that Lin and his team have found so far is that the nanorods can be fragile .
Future research will focus on protecting them better and investigating the use of a thin porous film to make them more robust .
In response to the paper 's publication , Professor Darren Bagnall from the Nanoscale Systems Integration Group at the UK's University of Southampton told CNN , " It 's a really impressive surface , and to get down to reflectivity from all angles of 3.5 percent is pretty impressive .
But it 's really only going to deliver maybe four or five percent more power from the solar cell . "
Bagnall is himself trying to nanoengineer surfaces for solar cells by mimicking the surface of moth eyes , which possess excellent antireflective surfaces .
He says that the FCC paper is only talking about the amount of light that 's transmitted to the device , not the efficiency of the device itself .
" Reflection is a relatively small part of the problem , " he said .
Jeremy Leggett , founder of Solar Century , a leading UK solar - energy company , also gave a cautious welcome to the new research .
" I 've seen this before from other university research groups and there is a world of difference between nice results in the lab and commercially viable products , " Leggett said .
" But at some point one of them is going to work . "
Leggett believes that the future is already very bright for the solar industry .
He says that $ 150 billion was invested in renewable energy last year , with $ 28 billion of that going to photovoltaics .
" With the current efficiencies , we are one of the fastest growing markets in the world .
Solar is the fastest growing clean technology with existing technology .
Any other increases in efficiency are going to be the icing on a very nice cake . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices dropped another 5 percent to a seven - month low on Tuesday , extending the steepest two - day slide since 2004 as mounting economic turmoil sent investors fleeing to safer havens .
The losses came despite U.S. supply disruptions after Hurricane Ike crashed through the Gulf of Mexico last week and left a quarter of the nation ’s energy output idled .
“ People are getting out of commodities and getting into safer havens , like bonds , ” said Andy Lebow , broker at MF Global in New York .
U.S. crude for October settled down $ 4.56 at $ 91.15 a barrel , adding to losses of more than $ 5 on Monday .
Prices have dropped about 10 percent in two days , the biggest slide since December 2 , 2004 .
Brent crude fell $ 5.02 to $ 89.22 a barrel .
“ If the economic turmoil continues , demand will continue to drop , ” said Jonathan Kornafel , Asia Director at U.S. - based options trader Hudson Capital Energy .
“ It ’s a bit of panic in the markets . ”
Monday marked the worst day on Wall Street since markets reopened after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , with investors fleeing to safer havens , such as gold and bonds , after news of Lehman Brothers ' LEH.N bankruptcy and the sale of Merrill Lynch MER.N .

Growing problems at insurer American International Group AIG.N added to fears about the financial sector 's stability and the outlook for the global economy .
“ If AIG tanks , that will be the big one .
AIG has more to do with the oil price right now than the Saudis do , ” said Larry Grace , an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong .
Slowing demand due to economic weakness in the United States and other top consumer nations has sent crude prices tumbling from record highs over $ 147 a barrel in July .
European shares fell on Tuesday amid concerns over AIG , driving up the yen and government bonds .
But a report that the Federal Reserve was mulling a loan package for AIG trimmed losses late in the day .
Federal Reserve policy - makers stopped short of lowering U.S. interest rates at a meeting on Tuesday , opting for the time being to soothe rattled financial markets with central bank lending facilities rather than rate cuts .
The slide in oil prices came despite reports that Hurricane Ike toppled several oil and natural gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico , signaling that a full recovery of output from the region could be slow .
Threats from hurricanes since late August have already cut more than 20 million barrels of oil supply from the Gulf and idled a quarter of U.S. refinery capacity -- digging into supplies and sending gasoline prices up at the pumps .
U.S. gasoline stockpiles are already running at their lowest level since November 2000 , and could drop to their lowest on record due to the effects of Ike , according to a Reuters poll of analysts .
In 2002 , the Bush administration ’s National Drug Control Strategy set a goal of reducing illegal drug use by 25 percent in five years .
This was followed by an unprecedented campaign of persuasion ( more than 100 different anti-drug advertisements and commercials ) and law enforcement as the number of annual arrests for marijuana possession climbed above 700,000 — higher than ever before , and greater than the combined total for all violent crimes .
Now that the first five years ’ results are available , the campaign can officially be called a failure , according to an analysis of federal drug-use surveys by Jon Gettman , a senior fellow at the George Mason University School of Public Policy .
The prevalence of marijuana use ( as measured by the portion of the population that reported using it in the previous month ) declined by 6 percent , far short of the 25 - percent goal , and that decline was partially offset by a slight increase in the use of other illicit drugs .
As a result , the overall decline in drug use was less than 4 percent .
Dr. Gettman ’s report was sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project Foundation , a group opposed to current drug laws , but it draws on the same five years of federal drug - survey data used by John P. Walters , director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
When the data became available this year , the White House ’s press release hailed the numbers as evidence of “ tremendous progress ” after five years , but the press release failed to mention the original goal of a 25 - percent reduction in overall drug use .
Instead , the White House highlighted reductions for specific drugs ( like cocaine ) and among specific groups ( like teenagers ) .
Such selective press releases , Dr. Gettman told me , have been the norm for two decades because there ’s been so little overall progress in the federal war on drugs .
In 1991 , he noted , the official National Drug Control Strategy ’s goal was to reduce number of illicit drug users in America to 7.25 million within a decade .
But a decade later , in 2002 , the number was actually 19.5 million , and by last year it had risen to 19.9 million , Dr. Gettman said .
“ If you look at the National Drug Control Strategy for any particular year , ” he told me , “ you ’ll see it is written to convey the notion that we ’re close enough , we ’re getting acceptable results .
Compare reports over five or six years , you get a different impression .
Compare them over ten to fifteen years , and it is crystal clear the results are in no way acceptable . ”
The latest results come after a five - year campaign that , by the count of the Marijuana Policy Project , involved at least 127 separate anti-marijuana TV , radio and print ads and 34 press releases focused mainly on marijuana , in addition to 50 reports from the White House drug office and other federal agencies on marijuana or anti-marijuana campaigns .
The number of marijuana arrests set a record every year after 2003 , exceeding 775,000 last year , and federal authorities also cracked down on clinics dispensing marijuana for medical purposes .
In its press release , the White House hailed the results of its anti-marijuana campaign by pointing to a trend among young people aged 12 to 17 : “ Current marijuana use among this age group declined from 8.2 percent in 2002 to 6.7 percent in 2007 . ”
But how meaningful or permanent is that reduction , and how much it does have to do with the anti-marijuana campaign ?
As Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project notes , there was an even larger reduction in the rate of cigarette smoking — from 13 percent to 9.8 percent — among those same youths over the same five - year period , and there were n’t hundreds of thousands of people being arrested for tobacco possession every year .
Dr. Gettman said that the best long - term data on drug use by teenagers , from the University of Michigan ’s Monitoring the Future Survey , gives little reason for encouragement .
In 2007 , the survey found that 14.2 percent of 10th - graders reported using marijuana in the previous month .
That looks like an improvement when compared to the 18.7 - percent rate in 1998 , but not by comparison with the 8.7 - percent rate in 1991 .
“ The dominant trend over the last 35 years , ” Dr. Gettman said , “ is that marijuana remains easy for teenagers to acquire , and this means the risk , from the perspective of concerned parents and educators , has remained unchanged for over a generation .
Government has failed for over 35 years to prevent teenagers from having access to marijuana , and it consistently deflects responsibility for that failure through public relations campaigns that , at their core , attribute the problem to bad parenting . ”
The £ 6 million squatters : Artist gang flies the black flag of anarchy over Mayfair mansion
In its day it must have ranked among the most elegant residences in London .
Hyde Park is just down the road and some of the most expensive houses in the land can be seen from its upper windows .
Previous occupants have included industrialists , politicians and titled gentry .
Squatters : ( left to right )
Girl known only as Bob , Tom Crouse - Smith and Stephanie Smith at 18 Upper Grosvenor Street , Mayfair
But yesterday this £ 6.25 million Mayfair mansion – owned by the billionaire Duke of Westminster – was revealed as the latest address to be invaded to a group of squatters calling themselves the Da !
Collective .
They got in after posing as builders in high visibility jackets .
Then they changed the locks and flew a Union Flag dyed anarchist black from its flagpole .
Just after noon yesterday a 21 - yea - rold woman in a mask and a raggedy mini-skirt stood on a balcony overlooking puzzled passers - by , and read aloud a statement about liberty and legality .
Then she disappeared behind the French doors to return to the fading splendour of what she and her companions proudly declared to be the finest and most grandiose addition to a property portfolio which , if they actually owned it , could be worth up to £ 100 million .
Making themselves at home :
The group have changed the locks and reconnected the electricity , insisting that they will be paying the bills
Rights :
Under the laws squatters can claim ownership of a property if the original owner has not tried to claim it back for 12 years
Inside , sleeping bags and stained mattresses have been spread out on bare floorboards .
Logs and branches decorate one room and their half - finished artworks , including a Trojan Horse - style head crafted in newspaper , are scattered around the 30 or so rooms in the six - storey house .
Quite how the scruffy band of artists , teenagers , students and activists managed to occupy the house so easily is doubly puzzling .
First , because they appear not to have come to general public attention until a Time
Out magazine article trumpeted their success this week as ‘ the coolest mansion in Mayfair ’ .
Second , because they got in not just without anyone important challenging them , but under the noses of armed police .
The group has been living in the property for the last month since clambering in through an open window on the first floor
Three of a kind :
The squatters call themselves the Da ! collective
Number 18 Upper Grosvenor Street is less than 50 paces from the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square , supposedly one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the capital .
The house is leased by British Virgin Island - registered Deltaland Resources from the Duke of Westminster ’s Grosvenor Estate .
Stephanie Smith , who gave the balcony speech and describes herself as an artist , insists the house was being ‘ left to rot ’ .
Certainly the Grade II listed 1730s mansion has seen better days .
Some furniture and decor remains , but bare wires hang from some walls and floorboards have been ripped up in places .
Its centuries - old elegance has surely never borne witness to the lifestyle preferred by its current inhabitants – who number around a dozen at any one time .
One – who said he was a gap year student – wheeled a bicycle out through the imposing front door and said he was setting off to scavenge food from supermarket waste .
Last night the group planned to illuminate the outside walls and windows with a light show , and to allow like - minded visitors to view the art .
Panelling in one room has been scrawled on to form an exhibit and an oak door has been festooned with coloured plastic bags .
The house is one of several large central London properties the group has occupied .
Neighbour : TV chef Richard Corrigan 's new restaurant is just down the road
The squatters maintain they have done nothing illegal and declared : ‘ Squatting is not a criminal offence .
If the owners want to kick us out they ’ll have to apply for an eviction notice . ’
Da ! has a website on which it pictures properties the collective has turned into squats .
The mastermind behind the group is Simon McAndrew , an architecture student who lives in a West London apartment on full housing benefits of nearly £ 17,000 a year , plus unemployment and child benefits .
His wife Bogna , 28 , said the couple are expecting a second child .
McAndrew , 29 , has attracted a following of well - educated middle class squatters .
His wealthy mother Aban , 54 , told how she finds her ‘ free spirited ’ son ’s lifestyle ‘ difficult to reconcile ’ .
Stephanie Smith , wearing an elaborate face mask , reads a statement from Da !
Collective alongside a black anarchist flag
Members of the group do n't appear to be typical squatters , one appears to be wearing designer glasses and another has expensive - looking headphones

Meeting Your Needs :
When shopping for one of the best 2020 laptops , it pays to do your homework .

Mistakes to Avoid
Watch the Upgrades :
When you see a price advertised for a laptop , remember that the price quote is often for the minimum configuration of features and components .
While you often can upgrade components before ordering , you will see the price climb quickly .
Make sure that the components quoted in the price match your needs .
Poor Quality Computers :
If a price for a laptop seems to be surprisingly low , take a close look at the brand of the laptop and make sure the components are of a high quality .
Off - brand laptops may contain components that are of a poor quality , which may cause the unit to fail .
Go for the cpu Intel processors , which are quality .
Most Important Laptop Features
RAM
The memory , or RAM , is the area of the portable computer where the currently loaded software resides , providing quick access for the CPU .
The more RAM your computer has available , the faster and more effectively it will work .
CPU
The CPU is the notebook computer ’s processor .
As you type a document , watch a movie , or play a game , the CPU will perform the processing on the digital file , allowing the computer to do the work you want it to do .
Newer processors that run at higher clock speeds ( measured in GHz ) can perform the work faster .
The naming process of CPUs makes it easy .
An Intel core i5 is not as fast as a core i6 for instance .
Storage
Storage refers to the internal storage unit of the laptop , where you ’ll save documents and photographs .
A storage unit for a newer computer will be a solid state drive ( SSD ) , which works fast and has no moving parts , but it is more expensive than a traditional HDD ( hard disk drive ) with spinning platters .
Screen Size
A large screen makes it easier to multitask and have multiple windows 10 windows open on the screen .
And if you plan to watch TV shows or movies on your portable computer , a large screen will make the process more enjoyable .
Some screens also have a wide viewing angle , which allows multiple people to simultaneously see the screen clearly .
Screen Resolution
Most laptop screens have a high resolution that ’s better than full HD resolution .
4 K resolution screens are n’t very popular yet however .
Touchscreen
A laptop that is a two - in - one device will offer a touchscreen display , allowing you to use the unit as a traditional laptop or as a tablet .
However , a touch - enabled laptop usually will cost more .
Battery Life
Good battery performance is a must in a laptop .
After all , part of the reason you want a laptop is for its portability , which means working from battery power .
You need as many hours of battery life as possible .
Weight
Weight is a key component for a portable device like a laptop , as you ’re going to be carrying it from place to place .
Size
Most laptops are very thin devices , especially the best laptop brands .
If you choose a smaller than average laptop , just make sure that the keyboard fits your hands .
And you will want accessories too , like those from razer blade .
Which Best Laptops in 2020 Are Right For You
The most important factor to consider when looking at the entries in the best laptop 2020 list is ensuring that you find a unit that will perform the tasks that you need .
Some people will want a two - in - one that they can use as a tablet or a laptop .
Others may want more of a gaming laptop , which will require top - end processing power and plenty of RAM .
Or you could be someone who needs a laptop that ’s extremely versatile , offering the ability to perform numerous different tasks without being heavily weighted toward one type of task .
Before shopping , make a list of the things you need to have in a laptop and set a maximum budget , and you ’re sure to be able to find a great laptop that can work for you !
Some popular best laptops of 2020 currently are the HP Spectre x360 , HP Elite Dragonfly , Macbook Pro 16 - inch and the Zephyrus g14 .

[ 29th Oct 2008 Edited to add a report of touchscreen issues ]
A fully electronic voting system was piloted in the Finnish municipal elections on the 26th of October , 2008 .
Electronic Frontier Finland ( EFFI ) had criticised the pilot program for years , recently [ link |

http://www.om.fi/Etusivu/Ajankohtaista/Uutiset/1224166604122|Ministry of Justice revealed ] that due to a usability issue , voting was prematurely aborted for 232 voters .
The pilot system was in use in three municipalities ; this amounts to about 2 per cent of the electoral roll .
Seats in the municipal assemblies are often determined by margins of only a couple of votes .
It seems that the system required the voter to insert a smart card to identify the voter , type in their selected candidate number , then press “ ok ” , check the candidate details on the screen , and then press “ ok ” again .
Some voters did not press “ ok ” for the second time , but instead removed their smart card from the voting terminal prematurely , causing their ballots not to be cast .
This usability issue was exacerbated by Ministry of Justice instructions , which [ link |http://www.vaalit.fi/sahkoinenaanestaminen/aanestyksen_kulku.html|specifically said ] that in order to cancel the voting process , the user should click on “ cancel ” and after that , remove the smart card .
Thus , some voters did not realise that their vote had not been registered .

A voter had repeatedly tried to click on “ ok ” , but either due to system lag or touchscreen sensitivity problems , it took “ minutes ” to get the button press registered .

I approached Texas Monthly ’s cover story on “ The Top 50 BBQ Joints in Texas ” this summer the way a regular reader of People might approach that magazine ’s annual “ Sexiest Man Alive ” feature — with the expectation of seeing some familiar names .
There was no reason to think that the list ’s top tier — the five restaurants judged to be the best in the state — would look much different than it had the last time a survey was published , in 2003 .
In recent years , Hollywood may have seen some advances in physical training and cosmetic surgery , but barbecue restaurants still tend to retain their lustre much longer than male heartthrobs do .
In fact , I ’ve heard it argued that , absent some slippage in management , a barbecue restaurant can only get better over time : many Texas barbecue fanatics have a strong belief in the beneficial properties of accumulated grease .
In discussions of Texas barbecue , the equivalent of Matt Damon and George Clooney and Brad Pitt would be establishments like Kreuz Market and Smitty ’s Market , in Lockhart ; City Market , in Luling ; and Louie Mueller Barbecue , in Taylor — places that reflect the barbecue tradition that developed during the nineteenth century out of German and Czech meat markets in the Hill Country of central Texas .
( In fact , the title of Texas Monthly ’s first article on barbecue — it was published in 1973 , shortly after the magazine ’s founding — was “ The World ’s Best Barbecue Is in Taylor , Texas .
Or Is It Lockhart ? ” )
Those restaurants , all of which had been in the top tier in 2003 , were indeed there again in this summer ’s survey .
For the first time , though , a No. 1 had been named , and it was not one of the old familiars .
“ The best barbecue in Texas , ” the article said , “ is currently being served at Snow ’s BBQ , in Lexington . ”
I had never heard of Snow’s .
That surprised me .
Although I grew up in Kansas City , which has a completely different style of barbecue , I have always kept more or less au courant of Texas barbecue , like a sports fan who is almost monomaniacally obsessed with basketball but glances over at the N.H.L. standings now and then just to see how things are going .
Reading that the best barbecue in Texas was at Snow ’s , in Lexington , I felt like a People subscriber who had picked up the “ Sexiest Man Alive ” issue and discovered that the sexiest man alive was Sheldon Ludnick , an insurance adjuster from Terre Haute , Indiana , with Clooney as the runner - up .
An accompanying story on how a Numero Uno had emerged , from three hundred and forty - one spots visited by the staff , revealed that before work began on the 2008 survey nobody at Texas Monthly had heard of Snow ’s , either .
Lexington , a trading town of twelve hundred people in Lee County , is only about fifty miles from Austin , where Texas Monthly is published , and Texans think nothing of driving that far for lunch — particularly if the lunch consists of brisket that has been subjected to slow heat since the early hours of the morning .
Texas Monthly has had a strong posse of barbecue enthusiasts since its early days .
Griffin Smith , who wrote the 1973 barbecue article and is now the executive editor of the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , in Little Rock , was known for keeping a map of the state on his wall with pushpins marking barbecue joints he had been to , the way General Patton might have kept a map marked with spots where night patrols had probed the German line .
I could imagine the staffers not knowing about a superior barbecue restaurant in East Texas ; the Southern style of barbecue served there , often on a bun , has never held much interest for Austin connoisseurs .
But their being unaware of a top - tier establishment less than an hour ’s drive away astonished me .
I know some of the Texas Monthly crowd .
In fact , I once joined Greg Curtis , the former editor , and Steve Harrigan , a novelist who ’s had a long association with the magazine , on a pilgrimage to Lockhart , which some barbecue fans visit the way the devout of another sort walk the Camino de Santiago .
I know Evan Smith , who was the editor of the magazine when this latest barbecue survey was published and has since been promoted to a position that might be described as boss of bosses .
I could n’t imagine Smith jiggering the results for nefarious purposes — say , telling his staff to declare a totally unknown barbecue place the best in Texas simply as a way of doing what some magazine editors call “ juicing up the story . ”
I took him at his word when , a few months after the list was published , he told me how Snow ’s had been found .
His staff had gone through the letters written after the 2003 survey complaining about the neglect of a superior specialist in pork ribs or the inclusion of a place whose smoked sausage was n’t fit for pets — what Smith , who ’s from Queens , refers to as “ Dear Schmuck letters . ”
He did acknowledge that his decision to name a No. 1 — rather than just a top tier , as in the previous barbecue surveys — came about partly because everyone was so enthusiastic about Snow ’s product but partly because its story was so compelling .
Smith himself was not in a position to confirm the quality of the product .
Being from Queens is not the only handicap he has had to surmount in his rise through the ranks of Texas journalism : he has been a vegetarian for nearly twenty - five years .
( The fact that he is able to resist the temptation presented by the aroma of Texas pit barbecue , he has said , is a strong indication that he will never “ return to the dark side . ” )
As a longtime editor , though , he knew a Cinderella story when he saw one .
It was n’t just that Snow ’s had been unknown to a Texas barbecue fancy that is notably mobile .
Snow ’s proprietor , Kerry Bexley , was a former rodeo clown who worked as a blending - facility operator at a coal mine .
Snow ’s pit master , Tootsie Tomanetz , was a woman in her early seventies who worked as the custodian of the middle school in Giddings , Texas — the Lee County seat , eighteen miles to the south .
After five years of operating Snow ’s , both of them still had their day jobs .
Also ,
Snow ’s was open only on Saturday mornings , from eight until the meat ran out .
“ And then Joel did n’t come in today , so I had to do all his pillaging . ”

Shopping
My conversation with Evan Smith took place in a Chevrolet Suburban travelling from Austin toward Lexington .
I ’d been picked up at my hotel at 7:20 A.M.
The Texas Monthly rankings had attracted large crowds to Snow’s , and , even four months later , we were n’t taking any chances .
Greg Curtis and Steve Harrigan were with Smith in the back seats .
Harrigan was one of the people who , having been tipped off between the time the feature was completed and the time the magazine came out , hurried over to Snow ’s like inside traders in possession of material information not available to the general public .
He seemed completely unrepentant .
“ I took my brother and brother - in - law and son - in - law and nephew , ” he said , smiling slyly .
Next to me in the front seat , Paul Burka was doing the driving .
Greg Curtis once reminded me that “ all barbecue experts are self - proclaimed , ” but Texas Monthly had enough faith in Burka ’s expertise to send him to Snow ’s late in the selection process as what Smith calls “ the closer . ”
It was up to Burka to confirm or dismiss the judgment of the staffer whose assigned territory for the survey included Lexington , and of Patricia Sharpe , the editor in charge of the project , and of a second staffer sent in as a triple - check .
Some people at the magazine had predicted that Burka would n’t like Snow ’s barbecue simply because it bore Pat Sharpe ’s imprimatur .
“ Paul thinks Pat ’s judgment of restaurants is fancy and white tablecloth and Pat thinks Paul is a philistine , ” I heard from the back seat .
“ And they ’re both right . ”
When I spoke to Pat Sharpe a couple of days later , she bristled at the accusation that she is a person of elevated taste .
“ I ’ll eat barbecue in the rattiest joint there is , ” she said in her own defense .
Burka , on the other hand , seemed unconcerned about being called a philistine .
He is a large man with a white mustache and a midsection that reflects a forty - year interest in Texas barbecue .
Having grown up in Galveston , which is not a barbecue center , he innocently started eating what he now describes as “ ‘ barbecue ’ that was one step removed from roast beef ” while he was a student at Rice , in Houston ; he had his true conversion experience on a trip to Lockhart with Griffin Smith in 1967 , when they were both in law school at the University of Texas .
Burka , who worked for five years in the Texas state legislature , writes about politics for Texas Monthly .
Speaking to him as the Suburban rolled toward Lexington , I was reminded of the Austin brought to life in “ The Gay Place , ” Billy Lee Brammer ’s marvellous 1961 novel about an L.B.J. - like governor called Arthur ( Goddam ) Fenstermaker .
That Austin was essentially a two - company town — the university and the state government — and I always pictured those connected with both companies sharing irreverent observations of the passing scene while consuming a lot of beer in the back of Scholz ’s beer garden .
It is an Austin that is sometimes difficult to discern in a much larger city of slick office buildings and computer - company headquarters and the mother church of Whole Foods , which actually offers barbecue in the meat department of its Austin stores .
( “ Organic barbecue , ” Burka muttered , when somebody brought that up . )
The first time Burka went to Lexington to check out Snow ’s , he arrived just before noon .
“ It looked like it had never been open , ” he said .
“ It was deserted . ”
When he finally got there at a time when meat was still available , he was convinced .
In fact , he was rhapsodic , particularly concerning the brisket ( “ as soft and sweet as cookie dough ” ) and the pork butt .
Smith believed that Burka ’s description of the latter — “ the butt was tender and yielding ” — was in need of some editing , but , without having to consume any critters personally , he was persuaded by Burka ’s report .
Snow ’s was to be named the best barbecue in Texas , and Evan Smith never had any doubt about what would happen as soon as that designation was on the newsstands .
“ I basically said , ‘ Congratulations and I ’m sorry , ’ ” he told me , “ because I knew what would happen . ”
“ That brings up the subject of remorse , ” I said .
“ You mean remorse on their part ? ” Smith asked .
“ No , remorse on your part — remorse for having turned the place into an ugly scene . ”
“ We do n’t publish Best - Kept Secrets Monthly , ” Smith said , as he got out of Burka ’s Suburban .
He sniffed confidently , presumably to reassure himself that , despite the aroma , he would have no trouble limiting himself to coleslaw and potato salad .
Then he marched across the street toward Snow’s BBQ .
Regular consumers of Hill Country style
Texas barbecue know what to expect when they walk into an establishment that is said to offer the real article .
I had never been to Louie Mueller ’s , in Taylor , before this trip , but when Greg Curtis and I went there the day before the Snow ’s outing for what we referred to as some warmup barbecue , the place looked familiar .
At a Texas barbecue joint , you normally pick up a tray at the counter and order meat from one person and sides from another .
The person doling out the meat removes it from the smoker and carves it himself .
It is sold by the pound — often brisket and pork ribs and sausage and beef ribs and chicken and , in some places , clod ( beef shoulder ) .
The carver serves it on some variety of butcher paper .
If , despite having worked with smoke in his eyes for many years , he is of a generous nature , as the carvers at Mueller ’s are known to be , he might slice off a piece of a brisket ’s darkened outside — what would be called in Kansas City a burnt end — and , before you ’ve ordered anything , place it on your tray as a small gesture .
( Given the quality of Mueller ’s brisket , it is a gesture that can make a traveller feel immensely pleased about being back in Texas . )
A couple of slices of packaged white bread are also included .
Usually , the only way to have a brisket sandwich in central Texas is to make your own .
A Texas barbecue joint is likely to have neon beer signs on the walls , and those walls are likely to have been darkened by years of smoke .
At Mueller ’s , a cavernous place in a former school gym , there is a large bulletin board festooned with business cards , and most of the cards by now look like specks of brownish parchment .
In a restaurant serving Hill Country barbecue , there may be bottles of sauce on the tables , but the meat does not come out of the pits slathered in sauce .
I remember a sign at Kreuz Market announcing that the management provided neither sauce nor salads nor forks .
In central Texas , you do n’t hear a lot of people talking about the piquancy of a restaurant ’s sauce or the tastiness of its beans ; discussions are what a scholar of the culture might call meat - driven .
Geographically , Lexington is not in the Hill Country — it ’s in ranch land , northeast of Austin — but ethnically it is .
Burka told me that a politician from Lee County once said to him , “ It ’s the Germans against the Czechs , and the Americans are the swing vote . ”
Snow ’s BBQ turned out to have the sort of layout found in a place like Kreuz Market , except in miniature .
It ’s a small dark - red building that has room for a counter and six tables — with a few more tables outside , near the cast - iron smokers that in Texas are referred to as pits , even if they ’re not in the ground .
A sign listed what meats were available , all for $ 8.45 a pound : sausage , brisket , pork , pork ribs , and chicken .
The sides offered were “ Mrs. Patschke ’s homemade coleslaw and potato salad , ” plus free beans .
There were only a couple of people ahead of us in line .
Burka stepped up to the counter to order .
“ Are there five of you ? ” the young woman slicing the meat asked , as Burka tried to figure out how many pounds we needed .
“ Well , ” Burka said , glancing at Evan Smith .
“ Four , really .
One is . . . he has a big meal coming up . ”
“ You ’re ashamed of your friend , ” I whispered to Burka .
“ You ’ve abandoned him . ”
“ I just could n’t say the V - word , ” Burka said .
He looked sheepish — not , I would guess , a normal look for him .
I had warned the Texas Monthly crowd that if they were looking for confirmation of their ranking by an objective outlander , someone from Kansas City was not likely to provide it .
A jazz fan taken to a rock concert might admire the musical technique , but he probably would n’t make an ecstatic rush to the stage .
As we sat down at one of the outside tables , under a galvanized - tin covering , I told them that they could expect the sort of response that a proud young father I know has received during the past year or so whenever he e-mails me pictures of his firstborn : “ A perfectly adequate child . ”
Still , what Burka had ordered was good enough to make me forget that we were eating a huge meal of barbecue at a time on Saturday morning when most people were starting to wonder what they might rustle up for breakfast once they bestirred themselves .
I particularly liked the brisket , although I could n’t attest that it was as soft and sweet as cookie dough .
In Kansas City , it is not customary to eat cookie dough .
Although Snow ’s hours may seem odd to a city dweller , they seem normal in Lexington .
Saturday is traditionally when farmers and ranchers from the surrounding area come into town , and at twelve - thirty every Saturday there is a cattle auction in yards that are just down the street from Snow’s .
From 1976 to 1996 , in fact , Tootsie Tomanetz , who is known far and wide in Lee County as Miss Tootsie , served barbecue every Saturday at a meat market that she and her husband ran in Lexington .
Miss Tootsie ’s husband is half Czech and half German .
She was born Norma Frances Otto , German on both sides , and her father liked to say that when she married she went from having a last name that could be spelled backward or forward to having one that could n’t be spelled at all .
Before the Tomanetzes opened their store , Miss Tootsie had put in ten years tending the pits at City Meat Market , in Giddings .
In other words , Kerry Bexley , who ’s forty - one , could have a certainty about Miss Tootsie ’s gift that was based on having eaten her barbecue virtually all his life .
After lunch , if that ’s what you call a large meal of meat that you finish just before 9 A.M. , I had a chat about Snow ’s origins with its management team .
We talked near the pits , so Miss Tootsie could pull off sausage links now and then .
“ I felt like with her name and barbecue and my personality with people we could make it work , ” Bexley told me .
He ’s a short , outgoing man whose résumé includes — in addition to rodeo clown — prison guard , auctioneer , real - estate agent , and shopkeeper .
He already had the location — a place where he ’d run a farm and ranch store in 1992 .
The name came from a nickname he ’d had since before he was born .
According to the family story , his brother , then four years old , was asked whether he was hoping for the new baby to be a boy or a girl , and he replied , not unreasonably , that he would prefer a snowman .
Kerry ( Snowman ) Bexley and Miss Tootsie opened Snow ’s in March of 2003 — Bexley had built the pits — and it did well from the start .
“ For the most part , we cooked two to three hundred pounds of meat , ” Bexley told me .
“ We sold out by noon . ”
In the weeks after the Texas Monthly feature was published , Snow ’s went from serving three hundred pounds of meat every Saturday to serving more than a thousand pounds .
At eight in the morning — six or seven hours after Miss Tootsie had arrived to begin tending the pits — there was already a line of customers , some of whom had left home before dawn .
Bexley said that one Saturday morning , when there were ninety people waiting outside , a local resident asked permission to gather signatures along the line for a petition , only to return a few minutes later with the information that there was n’t one person there from Lee County .
Some locals expressed irritation at being shut out of their own barbecue joint .
At times , Bexley and Miss Tootsie felt overwhelmed .
There were moments , they say , when they wished that the tasters from Texas Monthly had never shown up .
Then Bexley added three brisket pits , Miss Tootsie got some help , Snow ’s for a time quit taking pre-orders by phone except for locals , and the amount of meat prepared every Saturday levelled off to about eight hundred pounds .
Most of the time , Bexley and Miss Tootsie are grateful for the additional business .
Not long after the survey appeared , Snow ’s BBQ started selling T - shirts that had on them not only “ Voted # 1 BBQ in Texas ” but a motto that Bexley ’s wife had suggested —
“ Smokin ’ the good stuff . ”
Looking around for a way to extend the newly famous Snow ’s brand without sacrificing the quality of the product , Bexley has hit on mail order , and is hoping to have that under way soon .
Snow ’s already has a Web site .
Bexley and Miss Tootsie are also pleased by the personal recognition .
They ’ve worked hard .
Most people in Lee County work hard without anybody ’s noticing .
Whether or not Kerry Bexley and Tootsie Tomanetz ever feel able to give up their day jobs , they have received the sort of pure validation that does n’t come to many people , no matter what their field of endeavor .
“ Miss Tootsie gets some recognition now for what she ’s actually done all her life , ” Bexley said .
“ She ’s now ” — he turned to Miss Tootsie — “ seventy - four ?
Excuse me for asking . ”
“ No , I ’m just seventy - three , ” Miss Tootsie said , smiling .
“ You add a year every time . ”
“ What did you do when you heard that you were No. 1 ? ” I asked .
“ When we found out we were No. 1 , ” Bexley said , “ we just set there in each other ’s arms and we bawled . ” ♦
Previously , Herman Daly wrote a guest post on the Steady State Economy , outlining core suggestions on how to overhaul our banking , financial ( and value ) systems .
I encourage everyone to read it ( if short on time , please read the conclusion ) .
Professor Daly was Senior Economist at the World Bank before leaving to teach Ecological Economics at University of Maryland 's School for Public Policy .
He was also the catalyst for me to leave my own financial career and return to school to study the real economy ( i.e. what we call the human economy is only a small part of a larger closed system ) .
Below the fold are his thoughts on the current crisis ( current being defined as last 30 - 40 years or so ) .
( For comparison , here are links to what ' mainstream ' economic icons George Soros , and Bill Gross are saying . )
The current financial debacle is really not a “ liquidity ” crisis as it is often euphemistically called .
It is a crisis of overgrowth of financial assets relative to growth of real wealth — pretty much the opposite of too little liquidity .
Financial assets have grown by a large multiple of the real economy — paper exchanging for paper is now 20 times greater than exchanges of paper for real commodities .
It should be no surprise that the relative value of the vastly more abundant financial assets has fallen in terms of real assets .
Real wealth is concrete ; financial assets are abstractions — existing real wealth carries a lien on it in the amount of future debt .
The value of present real wealth is no longer sufficient to serve as a lien to guarantee the exploding debt .
Consequently the debt is being devalued in terms of existing wealth .
No one any longer is eager to trade real present wealth for debt even at high interest rates .
This is because the debt is worth much less , not because there is not enough money or credit , or because “ banks are not lending to each other ” as commentators often say .
Can the economy grow fast enough in real terms to redeem the massive increase in debt ?
In a word , no .
As Frederick Soddy ( 1926 Nobel Laureate chemist and underground economist ) pointed out long ago , “ you cannot permanently pit an absurd human convention , such as the spontaneous increment of debt [ compound interest ] against the natural law of the spontaneous decrement of wealth [ entropy ] ” .
The population of “ negative pigs ” ( debt ) can grow without limit since it is merely a number ; the population of “ positive pigs ” ( real wealth ) faces severe physical constraints .
The dawning realization that Soddy ’s common sense was right , even though no one publicly admits it , is what underlies the crisis .
The problem is not too little liquidity , but too many negative pigs growing too fast relative to the limited number of positive pigs whose growth is constrained by their digestive tracts , their gestation period , and places to put pigpens .
Also there are too many two‐legged Wall Street pigs , but that is another matter .
Growth in US real wealth is restrained by increasing scarcity of natural resources , both at the source end ( oil depletion ) , and the sink end ( absorptive capacity of the atmosphere for CO2 ) .
Further , spatial displacement of old stuff to make room for new stuff is increasingly costly as the world becomes more full , and increasing inequality of distribution of income prevents most people from buying much of the new stuff — except on credit ( more debt ) .
Marginal costs of growth now likely exceed marginal benefits , so that real physical growth makes us poorer , not richer ( the cost of feeding and caring for the extra pigs is greater than the extra benefit ) .
To keep up the illusion that growth is making us richer we deferred costs by issuing financial assets almost without limit , conveniently forgetting that these so ‐called assets are , for society as a whole , debts to be paid back out of future real growth .
That future real growth is very doubtful and consequently claims on it are devalued , regardless of liquidity .
What allowed symbolic financial assets to become so disconnected from underlying real assets ?
First , there is the fact that we have fiat money , not commodity money .
For all its disadvantages , commodity money ( gold ) was at least tethered to reality by a real cost of production .
Second , our fractional reserve banking system allows pyramiding of bank money ( demand deposits ) on top of the fiat government ‐issued currency .
Third , buying stocks and “ derivatives ” on margin allows a further pyramiding of financial assets on top the already multiplied money supply .
In addition , credit card debt expands the supply of quasi‐money as do other financial “ innovations ” that were designed to circumvent the public ‐interest regulation of commercial banks and the money supply .
I would not advocate a return to commodity money , but would certainly advocate 100 % reserve requirements for banks ( approached gradually ) , as well as an end to the practice of buying stocks on the margin .
All banks should be financial intermediaries that lend depositors ’ money , not engines for creating money out of nothing and lending it at interest .
If every dollar invested represented a dollar previously saved we would restore the classical economists ’ balance between investment and abstinence .
Fewer stupid or crooked investments would be tolerated if abstinence had to precede investment .
Of course the growth economists will howl that this would slow the growth of GDP .
So be it — growth has become uneconomic at the present margin as we currently measure it .
The agglomerating of mortgages of differing quality into opaque and shuffled bundles should be outlawed .
One of the basic assumptions of an efficient market with a meaningful price is a homogeneous product .
For example , we have the market and corresponding price for number 2 corn — not a market and price for miscellaneous randomly aggregated grains .
Only people who have no understanding of markets , or who are consciously perpetrating fraud , could have either sold or bought these negative pigs‐in‐a‐poke .
Yet the aggregating mathematical wizards of Wall Street did it , and now seem surprised at their inability to correctly price these idiotic “ assets ” .
And very important in all this is our balance of trade deficit that has allowed us to consume as if we were really growing instead of accumulating debt .
So far our surplus trading partners have been willing to lend the dollars they earned back to us by buying treasury bills — more debt “ guaranteed ” by liens on yet ‐to‐exist wealth .
Of course they also buy real assets and their future earning capacity .
Our brilliant economic gurus meanwhile continue to preach deregulation of both the financial sector and of international commerce ( i.e. " free trade " ) .
Some of us have for a long time been saying that this behavior was unwise , unsustainable , unpatriotic , and probably criminal .
Maybe we were right .
The next shoe to drop will be repudiation of unredeemable debt either directly by bankruptcy and confiscation , or indirectly by inflation .
Sarah Palin knows a thing or two about abuse of power when she says John McCain is ready to put a stop to it :
Last weekend heavy storms crashed through Yemen , one of the poorest countries in the world .
The wind , rain and lightning killed a number people initiallly , but the subsequent flooding took a much larger toll , in both lives and property .
The hard - hit Hadramaut region is home to the ancient walled city of Shibam , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , nicknamed the " Manhattan of the desert " .
The structures in Shibam and neighboring villages are mud-brick construction , and were damaged badly by the rain and flooding , many collapsing when their foundations were undercut .
The World Health Organization has estimated that 180 people have died , mostly in building collapses , though that number is likely to change as debris is cleared away .

Atlanta , Ga. – Airlines in the United States rejoiced upon receiving an intercepted recording from the terrorist group al - Qaeda , according to reports from government and flight industry insiders .
Details of the message ’s content were sketchy but included a statement from high - ranking officers in the terrorist organization that claimed the group was “ finished trying to hijack planes ” and that the add - on charges for flight amenities and overall stinginess of the airlines were the main reasons for their new policy of “ never flying again ” .

Former attorney general Lord Goldsmith defended his legal advice Legal advice given to Tony Blair by the attorney general prior to the Iraq war was fundamentally " flawed , " a former law lord has claimed .
Lord Bingham said Lord Goldsmith had given Mr Blair " no hard evidence " that Iraq had defied UN resolutions " in a manner justifying resort to force " .
Therefore , the action by the UK and US was " a serious violation of international law , " Lord Bingham added .
Lord Goldsmith said he stood by his advice to the then prime minister .
The Liberal Democrats say that Lord Bingham 's comments made a full public inquiry " unavoidable " into the decision to invade Iraq .
Responding to Lord Bingham 's criticism , Lord Goldsmith insisted the invasion of Iraq was legal .
" I would not have given that advice if it were not genuinely my view , " he said .
' No weapons ' Lord Bingham , a former Lord Chief Justice , made his comments in a speech on the rule of law at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law in London .
He referred to a written parliamentary statement made by Lord Goldsmith on 17 March 2003 in which he confirmed that war on Iraq would be legal on the grounds of existing UN resolutions .
Lord Bingham said : " This statement was flawed in two fundamental respects .
Many nations other than ours took part in the action and did so believing that they were acting lawfully
Lord Goldsmith
Former attorney general " It was not plain that Iraq had failed to comply in a manner justifying resort to force and there were no strong factual grounds or hard evidence to show that it had .
" Hans Blix and his team of weapons inspectors had found no weapons of mass destruction , were making progress and expected to complete their task in a matter of months . "
Lord Bingham also criticised Lord Goldsmith for failing to make clear that only the UN Security Council could judge whether there had been compliance and , if appropriate , authorise further action .
" If I am right that the invasion of Iraq by the US , the UK and some other states was unauthorised by the Security Council there was , of course , a serious violation of international law and of the rule of law , " he said .
Lord Goldsmith said his critic was " entitled to his own legal perspective " .
" But at the time and since then many nations other than ours took part in the action and did so believing that they were acting lawfully , " he said .
He also said the UN resolution that Iraq was deemed to have defied - 1441 - did not need further determination by the Security Council .
Lord Chancellor Jack Straw backed Lord Goldsmith , arguing that his advice " was shared by many member states across the world " .
This is a damning condemnation of what was an unjustified invasion
Nick Clegg , Lib Dem leader " I do not accept Lord Bingham 's conclusions , which do not , I am afraid , take proper account of the text of Security Council Resolution 1441 nor its negotiating history , " Mr Straw said .
But Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Lord Bingham 's claims made a full public inquiry into the government 's decision to go to war " unavoidable " .
" Lord Bingham 's stature means that his devastating criticism cannot just be brushed under the carpet , " Mr Clegg said .
" This is a damning condemnation of what was an unjustified invasion which we now know to have flouted international law . "
Former lord chief justice Lord Bingham retired from the bench in July .
Lord Goldsmith stepped down from his post as attorney general last year .

Audio Transcript : Arizona Turning Blue
With John McCain ’s nomination as the official Republican nominee for President the assumption is that at least one state – Arizona – is guaranteed to vote for him .
Conventional wisdom holds that Arizona is a red state and given our voting record , rightly so .
Arizona has voted Republican ( as a state ) for the last 20 + years .
However , the statistics paint a different picture .
I ’d like to propose that it ’s entirely possible that John McCain loses Arizona come this November 4th , especially if Barack Obama and the Democrats focus attention on the state .
Arizona has consistently been less GOP friendly than the general discourse suggests .
In fact I ’d go so far as to argue , that a large part of the reason it ’s still a predominantly Red state is gross misconception among Democrats and Independents .
Most assume that Arizona is Red , their vote is pointless , and as a result they do n’t bother to vote at all .
The catch is , voting registration numbers and recent voting behavior suggest something altogether different .
For example , look at the re-election and support for Governor Janet Napolitano , a Democrat .
Also , consider conservative Republican J.D. Hayworth ‘s recent loss to Democrat Harry Mitchell .
According to the Arizona Secretary of State ’s website September 2008 registered voter numbers are as follows :
Active
Active Republicans – 1,061,591
Active Democrats – 957,859
Active Independents ( Other ) – 759,159
Active Libertarians – 17,278
Active Green Party – 3,467
Total Active State Voting Population : 2,799,390
Inactive
Inactive Independents ( other ) – 177,830
Inactive Democrats – 151,777
Inactive Republicans – 158,887
Inactive Libertarians – 5,160
Inactive Green – 1,326
Total Inactive State Voting Population : 494,980
In looking at these figures what jumps out is that there are 1.6 Democrats & Independents ( 1,717,018 ) for every 1 Republican and Libertarian ( 1,078,869 ) .
This is potentially deceptive as Libertarians and Independents typically are not loyal to either party .
Polls from the 2006 election found that “ The independent voters surveyed said they plan to support Democratic candidates over Republicans by roughly 2 to 1 ” [ WSJ ] which is on - par with other information I ’ve seen .
Especially when one takes into account that a large portion of the more liberal youth demographic trends towards registering as Independents .
Also potentially significant is the disproportionately high number ( 177,000 ) of inactive independent voters in the state that may play a role in this election .
The Independent vote has historically been very friendly towards McCain , embracing his reputation as a Maverick .
As a moderate , McCain enjoyed heavy support from Independent and Democrat voters in Arizona , which largely offset the mixed support he historically has had from his own party .
Fact :
In the 2008 primary John McCain received the lowest percentage of support from his own state .
Obama won 65 % of Illinois , Clinton won 57 % of New York , Huckabee won 60 % of Arkansas , Romney won 51 % of Massachusetts , while McCain only took home 47 % of the votes in the Arizona Republican Primary .
[ Source Dems , Reps ] .
This information begs the questions : Will Independents and Libertarians support John McCain ?
A question that largely hinges on their perception of him .
With the credibility of the Straight Talk Express brand imploding in September and his image as a Maverick reformer disintegrating , it ’s entirely possible that his shift to the far right on policies , and the selection of Sarah Palin as running mate will cost him Arizona .
Ironically , these voters are his core base and the people who know him best .
I encourage you all to do your research through non-partisan fact checking organizations .
I highly recommend www.factcheck.org and www.politifact.com.
Thanks for reading and , as always , I ’d love to hear your thoughts – any additional information / research you have found , or of any additional non-partisan resources that might help voters make an educated decision .
As shelter is the largest single expense for most people , the ongoing " Financiapocalpyse " could see more people trading that Tudor for a four - door .

Great Orion Nebulae

Explanation : The Great Nebula in Orion , also known as M42 , is one of the most famous nebulae in the sky .
The star forming region 's glowing gas clouds and hot young stars are on the right in this sharp and colorful two frame mosaic that includes the smaller nebula M43 near center and dusty , bluish reflection nebulae NGC 1977 and friends on the left .
Located at the edge of an otherwise invisible giant molecular cloud complex , these eye - catching nebulae represent only a small fraction of this galactic neighborhood 's wealth of interstellar material .
Within the well - studied stellar nursery , astronomers have also identified what appear to be numerous infant solar systems .
The gorgeous skyscape spans nearly two degrees or about 45 light - years at the Orion Nebula 's estimated distance of 1,500 light - years .

Among older people , a host of newer drugs and treatments are making it easier to be sexual , and in some cases unfaithful — Viagra and other remedies for erectile dysfunction , estrogen and testosterone supplements to maintain women ’s sex drive and vaginal health , even advances like better hip replacements .
“ They ’ve got the physical health to express their sexuality into old age , ” said Helen E. Fisher , research professor of anthropology at Rutgers and the author of several books on the biological and evolutionary basis of love and sex .
In younger couples , the increasing availability of pornography on the Internet , which has been shown to affect sexual attitudes and perceptions of “ normal ” behavior , may be playing a role in rising infidelity .
But it is the apparent change in women ’s fidelity that has sparked the most interest among relationship researchers .
It is not entirely clear if the historical gap between men and women is real or if women have just been more likely to lie about it .
“ Is it that men are bragging about it and women are lying to everybody including themselves ? ” Dr. Fisher asked .
“ Men want to think women do n’t cheat , and women want men to think they do n’t cheat , and therefore the sexes have been playing a little psychological game with each other . ”
Dr. Fisher notes that infidelity is common across cultures , and that in hunting and gathering societies , there is no evidence that women are any less adulterous than men .
The fidelity gap may be explained more by cultural pressures than any real difference in sex drives between men and women .
Men with multiple partners typically are viewed as virile , while women are considered promiscuous .
And historically , women have been isolated on farms or at home with children , giving them fewer opportunities to be unfaithful .
But today , married women are more likely to spend late hours at the office and travel on business .
And even for women who stay home , cellphones , e-mail and instant messaging appear to be allowing them to form more intimate relationships , marriage therapists say .
Dr. Frank Pittman , an Atlanta psychiatrist who specializes in family crisis and couples therapy , says he has noticed more women talking about affairs centered on “ electronic ” contact .
Have you ever experienced unconditional love ?
What is really unconditional love ?
Let ’s find out !
I am sure you will start loving everyone unconditionally !
Have you ever felt so much love that your day comes only by bringing a dull smile on your lover ’s face ?
Sometimes , the easiest feelings are hard to explain .
And at some other time , it is easy to see true love through actions instead of listening to it through romantic words .
Unconditional love is such a feeling that can never be explained , but only every day can be experienced in small ways .
Announcements of love and gifts are covered with the glitter of unconditional love .
Do you think that you love someone without unconditionally ?
I tell you a story that happened a few years ago .
There was once a teenage boy who loved a teenage girl .
He was in love for some years and loved one another very much .
They both lived in the same neighborhood and used to meet each other each evening and spent time together till dinnertime .
For every summer holidays , the girl and her brother sister went for three months to stay in the place of their grandparents for summer .
And the boy , he disappeared every time the girl disappeared all the time .
One summer , when she went on her vacation , she really wanted to show her how much she missed her .
She decided to give her a diamond ring .
The boy wanted to propose to that girl .
He went around the city to all the jewelers he could remember .
He was only 17 years old , and most of the jewelers either laughed at him or thought he was fooling around .
But he did not give up
When he went shopping in the window , he started learning smart dresses so that the jewelry store would take him more seriously .
And after all , a few days after searching , he bought the right ring for his girlfriend , who wanted to buy it .
It was a platinum ring with a beautiful clear diamond which was beautifully shining .
It was the most beautiful thing she had seen .
He saw it second , he just knew that he was the ring he was looking for .
He expressed confidence and accidentally asked the staff how much of it was spent .
And when she heard that she spends a little more than four thousand dollars , her heart drowned .
Young boys did not earn enough and most of the parents did not earn enough in one month .
When her friends heard of the passion of buying a ring , they thought that she was crazy .
Most people have bought themselves a used car with that kind of money .
The boy did not care .
He wanted that ring .
She can imagine the happy face of her girlfriend when she sees that ring and she all looks after her , her smile and her happiness .
They calculated their barriers the next day .
His parents paid him fifty dollars in a week .
In three months , he will have only six hundred dollars .
It was nowhere near to buy any ring .
That boy needs more money , much more money .
He started looking for summer jobs and finally found one in a clothing store where he could earn up to seven dollars per hour , and five days a day , about fifty dollars in a day .
It was a good start .
He did not tell his parents about the job , but he believed that he was in the place of a friend of the game all day .
He calculated his daily savings and felt that he had to reduce his expenditure on lunch and he had to take jobs for a few weeks if he had an opportunity to make the necessary funds .
Every now and then , she will go back to the jewelry store and see whether the ring was still waiting for it or not .
He also asked the employees to keep them separate , because he was definitely going to buy a ring soon .
His best friend was joking around the whole day jokingly , but he left them all to work from morning till evening .
As soon as she used to come down to bed every night , she could imagine how happy she would be to see her girlfriend ring , and how excited she would be .
Every night , he was tired after a long day ’s work , but he was very excited to sleep quickly .
Soon , in the months gone by , the hidden manipulation of secret money also increased significantly .
He does not spend any money on the whole summer holidays and can save almost every penny for a dream ring .
In some days , he also left lunch so that he could save more money .
And a good day , a few days before returning to his girlfriend home , she had counted her savings under the torch late at night .
He made an obsolete smile .
He had made money .
About three months of pain and hunger was paid !
The next morning , he arranged his earnings and savings in a bundle and spied out in the jewelry shop where the staff was waiting for him .
He was also happy for the young boy .
And finally , he put the ring in his hand and smiled .
It was a beautiful thing .
His girlfriend will love it He could not think of anything else .
Right there , she was the happiest teenager in the world .
A week later , his girlfriend came home .
They were really happy to be happy with each other again and had missed each other a lot .
There was no information about the ring bought for him or his work .
That idea made them feel more excited .
Next night , she took her out for dinner .
It was an expensive restaurant that had tables spread in the garden .
And after the end of the meal , the young teenage boy fell on his knees in front of the girl .
The girl did not know what she was doing , in fact , 17 years old does not go to a knee .
As he rested on a knee , he deliberately faded and carefully read a handwritten love letter with burnt edges .
It was a beautiful love letter .
The girl smiled .
The boy slipped his hand into his coat pocket .
And from this , there emerged an elegant shiny box with a blue ribbon .
The girl looked surprised .
He never believed that it would be a ring .
The rings are expensive , everyone knows that .
When he opened the small box , his eyes widened and beautiful stones appeared in his eyes .
She was shocked and full of surprises .
He was stuck for happy words and positive reactions because he asked him to marry him , not soon , but someday , because he was the one who wanted to spend his whole life .
He smiled and his face shone with joy and love .
He loved the boy a lot , and could never imagine that he would work for him in the summer to buy a ring .
But in that moment , taking care of all the boys was his beautiful smile .
When he saw his beautiful smile , he remembered all the hard work and efforts he had made to bear for three months .
But then , at the exact same time , she was completely convinced that she was just worth it to bring a happy smile on her face .
And this is the truth is unconditional love is everything .
If you can unselfishly love someone else , in return not to get anything back , but in reality to make someone else happy , this is unconditional love .
And trust me this feeling is the best feeling anyone could ever have .
So , stop expecting and start loving everyone unconditionally .
London will be the first city to test out new bomb - proof garbage cans , which are also going to multitask as recycling bins with LCDs that stream travel info and news .
Security concerns ( AKA fear of terrorists dropping bombs in them ) have kept rubbish bins out of subway stations and many of the city 's streets since the mid-80's , causing frustration among citizens , not to mention what amounts to forced littering .
The new cans , developed by British company Media Metrica , weigh one ton each , and were tested in the lifeless deserts of New Mexico for five years to ensure they are completely , totally indestructible , can absorb heat from explosives , prevent shrapnel spread , and extinguish " fireballs . "
Eh .
Put 'em in New York City -- someone will surely figure out how to utterly destroy them in 24 hours or less .
The Real Value of Solar Power for Your Home
Researchers have announced a solar energy breakthrough that could lead to its more widespread use with their achievement of the highest efficiency ever for one type of solar cells .
The photovoltaic cells , called dye - sensitized solar cells or Gräztel cells , could expand the use of solar energy for homes , businesses and beyond , the researchers say .
Gräztel cells are cheaper to make than standard silicon - based solar cells , but until now they have had serious drawbacks .
They have not been efficient enough at converting light into electricity , and their performance dropped after relatively short exposures to sunlight .
The research , conducted by Peng Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues , including Michael Gräztel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , inventor of this type of cell in 1991 , involves photovoltaic cells composed of titanium dioxide and powerful light - harvesting dyes .
The team used a new type of ruthenium - based dye to help boost the solar cells ' light - harvesting ability .
The new cells showed efficiencies as high as 10 percent , a record for this type of solar cell ( efficiency is the ratio of useful energy delivered by a system to the energy initially supplied ) .
Most silicon - based solar cells have efficiencies of around 12 percent .
But manufacturing silicon is not cheap .
The current cost of electricity from silicon - based solar panels for houses or businesses is 25 cents to 40 cents per kilowatt - hour , roughly triple what most people pay their utility company .
Organic solar cells , another up - and - comer , typically convert only 3 percent of incoming sunlight into electricity .
The new cells also showed greater stability at high temperatures than previous formulas , retaining more than 90 percent of their initial output after 1,000 hours in full sunlight .
Gräztel cells can also be made into flexible sheets or coatings .
The research will be detailed in the Nov. 13 issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry C , a publication of the American Chemical Society .
More statement than science

The 20th century was defined by the battle between two global superpowers ; the United States and The Soviet Union .
Aside from the nuclear missiles and mountains of debt , one of the most noticeable strands of the competition between the two nations was the space race .
After the USSR launched Sputnick , the first man-made satellite launched into orbit , the two nations went back and forth , launching rocket after rocket in an attempt to one - up the other .
In 1961 , President Kennedy urged us on to the moon – something for which the Soviets were aiming for as well .
As the two programs battled neck in neck , it forced NASA to take chances to try and beat the Ruskies , like sending the first Saturn V rocket we tested all the way to the moon with a trio of intensely brave astronauts strapped to the top .
We made it first , of course , planting an American flag on the moon and then going back a handful of times to collect rocks , explore the terrain and play some golf .
Nearly ten years later , we met up with the Soviets in space , shook hands from 100 miles up and then launched the re-usable space shuttle program , abandoning the moon and the great metaphor and goal it represents .
The Soviets , by the way , never made it to the moon .
In 1989 the Soviet Union collapsed under its own weight and the US assumed the role as the world ’s only superpower , getting fat and lazy in the way of the unchallenged .
The space program also stagnated , focusing on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station and other earth - orbital experiments .
It ’s all very impressive and amazing that we can get there and back , but it ’s not particularly awe - inspiring .
We have had no competition and our space program reflects that .
Now , in the 21st century , America ’s power is on the wane as new superpowers are rising from Asia .
And as the US prepares to shut down its space program for a few years ( relying totally on Russia to get our astronauts to and from the space station ) , the world ’s two most populous countries are beginning to stare each other down over a rocket engine , as both China and India have now stated their goals to get to the moon .
The launch of Chandrayaan - 1 , as the vehicle is called ( it means , roughly translated , “ Moon Craft - 1 ” ) comes about a year after China ’s first moon mission .
The Indian mission is scheduled to last for two years , prepare a three - dimensional atlas of the moon and prospect its surface for natural resources , including uranium , a coveted fuel for nuclear power plants , according to the Indian Space Research Organization , or I.S.R.O.
Allusions to an Asian space race could not be contained , even as Manmohan Singh , the Indian prime minister , was due for a visit to China later in the week .
“ China has gone earlier , but today we are trying to catch them , catch that gap , bridge the gap , ” Bhaskar Narayan , a director at I.S.R.O. , told Reuters .
Just like when we did it , the race to the moon is more statement than science .
The moon mission , in addition to demonstrating technological capacity , can also potentially yield commercial gains for India ’s space program .
India ’s ability to put satellites into orbit has already resulted in lucrative deals , including from Israel , which has sent up a satellite via an Indian launcher .
“ It is proof of India ’s technical capability in an advanced area of science , ” said Dipankar Banerjee , a retired army general who heads the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies here .
“ India wants to be counted as one of the emerging players in Asia .
Space is of course an important part of power projection . ”
Aside from the pride such missions can instill in a nation , the scientific breakthroughs could be myriad .
The United States , meanwhile , continues to languish .
I agree with nearly nothing the president and this administration has done , but I do support President Bush ’s efforts to get us back to the moon by 2015 and on to Mars .
I think giant , seemingly unattainable goals remind us of what we can accomplish when we all work together .
The cost is , well , astronomical , but I believe the benefits are worth the risk .
Plus , it would remind the world once again that not only do we have a big military , we have a big scientific brain that we use for peaceful purposes as well .
Speaking of which , there ’s an odd similarity between the Indian Space Agency ’s logo :
and the logo of Starfleet :
while the Chinese logo :
looks like a combination of the Starfleet logo and the Federation logo :
Meanwhile , on our side of the world , both presidential candidates have plans for our space program .
both support continued exploration , including going back to the moon and on to mars .
But only one candidate seems to understand the power that a great vision can hold over a nation to help bring us together , even in difficult times .
“ When I was growing up , NASA united Americans to a common purpose and inspired the world with accomplishments we are still proud of .
Today , NASA is an organization that impacts many facets of American life .
I believe NASA needs an inspirational vision for the 21st Century .
My vision will build on the great goals set forth in recent years , to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and ensure the fulfillment of NASA ’s mission .
Together , we can ensure that NASA again reflects all that is best about our country and continue our nation ’s preeminence in space . ”
There ’s also a really cool logo to go with it , via Wired on October 22 , 2008 :
The Obamanauts have compiled a head - to - head comparison of the candidates ’ stances on space , and are also encouraging pro-space voters to make calls to undecided Florida voters to encourage them to vote for Obama .

A MAN who downloaded lifelike computer game - style pictures of child pornography has been spared jail in one of the first cases of its kind in the country .
Robul Hoque was given a community punishment , but was ordered to sign on the sex offenders ’ register for five years and undertake a treatment programme .
The 32 - year - old created hundreds of images involving incest and child abuse which were found on a computer when police raided his home in October 2006 .
Many of computer - graphic images were so realistic they were considered by a jury during a trial at Teesside Crown Court to be indistinguishable from photographs .
Police forensic experts said after the case that it was a legal first which had prompted calls for new legislation to tackle computer - generated child pornography .
The jury convicted Hoque of making six indecent images of a child after being told they must find him guilty if they believed they looked like photographs .
The images were part of an online comic strip which Hoque downloaded in the summer of 2000 , which involved child abuse and incest , the court was told .
During the trial , David Brooke , prosecuting , said one of the images was entirely computer - generated , the other five were a “ mish - mash ” of computer graphics and real photography .
Judge Peter Bowers told unemployed Hoque , of Hardwick Road , South Bank , Middlesbrough , that he would not have been prosecuted had the images not been so realistic .
The judge said : “ This was highly unusual case because the children involved were very much the product of a computer image .
Effectively , they crossed the line of what is illegal and what is lawfully permitted .
If it had been purely a comic strip it would have been perfectly lawful . ”
After the hearing , Ray Savage , a forensic computer analyst for Cleveland Police , who has worked in the field for 13 years , said : “ To my knowledge this is the first case of its kind .
“ The jury examined nine ‘ Lara Croft ’ - type images – not of Lara Croft , but computer - generated cartoon images of the quality you would see in a game like Tomb Raider .
“ They were selected from among 1,235 images in total , covered by the indictment , which ranged from very crude ink and line drawings to the most sophisticated computer - generated ‘ photographs ’ . ”
He said new legislation was being considered aimed at dealing with pseudo - photographs .
He said such cases previously involved cutting , pasting and merging of photos .
“ Until today , we have never had computer graphic or cartoon - type images deemed as pseudo - photographs and put before the court .
To date it has not been an offence to have this kind of material .
“ Though no actual child has been abused , it helps to feed the demand . ”
Hoque , who looks after his elderly mother and has no previous convictions , said he came across the material through an internet search and became curious about comic - style pictures .
Cleveland Crown Prosecution Service ’s Crown Advocate and hi-tech crime specialist , Harry Hadfield , said developments in computer software had enabled the creation of indecent images which were not photographs , but were so realistic that they look like photographs
He added : “ The outcome of this case has established that these detailed images of child sexual abuse qualify as indecent pseudo - photographs of children , the making of which is illegal . ”
With just four weeks until the election , John McCain is facing an increasingly steep path to the presidency , as the economic crisis and Barack Obama ’s financial edge tilt the political landscape to the Democrat ’s advantage .
After two of the closest presidential races in history , the candidates are battling for a dwindling number of states as they scavenge for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House .
Both sides say the contest is competitive ; the second of three presidential debates takes place tonight in Nashville , starting at 6 Pacific time .
McCain , however , clearly faces the tougher road .
After pulling out of Michigan , a Democratic - leaning state he hoped to snatch away , the Republican nominee faces an exceedingly slim margin for error as he defends a number of must - win states .
Chief among them are Ohio and Florida , the states that decided the last two presidential elections .
Polls show they are once again close .
Obama , by contrast , has expanded the competition to several states that Republicans usually count on , including Virginia , Colorado , Nevada , Indiana and North Carolina .
Obama even hopes to pick off an electoral vote here in Nebraska , a Republican stronghold that allows its five electoral votes to be split , awarding three of them by congressional district .

“ It ’s always tough for Democrats , ” Steve Achelpohl , the Nebraska party chairman , conceded .
“ But given the general unhappiness with the state of the country , he ’s got a decent chance .
So why not try ? ”
Obama is targeting Omaha and its surrounding area , an urban patchwork in this mostly rural state , which has a growing young population and a number of black and Latino residents .
The Illinois senator already has a running start , having advertised for months as a way to reach voters just across the river in Iowa .
Republicans scoff at the attempt .
In 50 years of presidential elections , Nebraska is second only to Utah in support for the GOP ticket .
( The state has voted 61.1 % Republican to Utah ’s 61.6 % , according to the Almanac of American Politics . )
All six statewide offices are held by Republicans , the GOP controls the unicameral Legislature , and all five members of Congress are Republican .
The state has not sent a Democrat to the House in 16 years .
“ One thing the Obama campaign obviously has is a big pile of money , ” said Mark Quandahl , chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party .
“ When a campaign is as lavishly funded as the Obama campaign , they ’re obviously going to have to find places to spend money . ”

National polls give Obama a small but steady lead over McCain , built as the financial crisis has consumed the country .
But the race for president is actually a series of contests fought state by state or , in the case of Nebraska and Maine , congressional district by congressional district .
( Most states are winner - take - all .
After quitting Michigan , McCain strategists said they would redeploy forces to Maine , the other state that apportions its electoral votes , to fight for one its four electors . )
The attempt to split off a vote illustrates the lengths the candidates are going to win an electoral college majority , mindful of the exceedingly close outcomes in 2000 and 2004 .
“ If you win an electoral vote from the other side , that ’s a swing of two votes , ” said Robert Hardaway , a University of Denver expert on the electoral college .
“ In a close race , that could make the difference . ”
Strategists for the two sides are sifting daily reams of data -- opinion polls , voter registration numbers , TV ad logs -- to decide how to spend their money and where to schedule the presidential hopefuls and their running mates .
As they plot their maps , each candidate starts with the 2004 results .
If nothing changed and McCain won every state Bush carried , the Arizona senator would have 286 electoral votes and keep the White House in Republican hands for a third straight term .
But replicating Bush ’s success is a tall order for McCain , given the unpopularity of the incumbent and the economic upheaval that , surveys indicate , is hurting Republicans more than Democrats .
Polls show voters place more trust in Obama when it comes to handling the economy .

They also have McCain trailing or tied with Obama in a half dozen states Bush won in 2004 : Ohio , Florida , Nevada , Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado .
McCain is tied or only slightly ahead of Obama in two other Bush states , Missouri and Indiana .
McCain could afford to lose a few Bush states -- Iowa and New Mexico seem most likely -- if he wins some that Democrats carried in 2004 .
Topping his list is Pennsylvania , which has 21 electoral votes and may be the closest thing to a must - win for Obama .
Polls show the race there is close .
Strategists also talk up McCain ’s prospects in Minnesota , Wisconsin and New Hampshire ; the latter two are highly competitive , as they were four and eight years ago .
But giving up on Michigan and its 17 electoral votes was a major concession ; it was the second - largest of the 2004 states McCain hoped to convert and one the Obama camp was most worried about keeping .
Even now , the campaign is maintaining its Michigan operation and continuing TV ads .
Strategists for McCain say Obama has fared well in places like North Carolina and Indiana because the Democrat has been running largely unopposed .
Once Republicans start investing money and resources , those states “ will snap back aggressively in our favor , ” said Greg Strimple , a McCain advisor , who also expressed confidence that Florida , a perennial target of both parties , will land in the GOP column .

But any money spent on states McCain should take for granted is money he cannot spend on states he hopes to win from Obama .
While McCain is getting a financial boost from the richly funded Republican National Committee , his own campaign spending is capped at $ 84 million .
Obama , who chose not to accept federal financing , can raise and spend unlimited sums .
“ If you look at the radio , who ’s playing offense and who ’s playing defense , McCain ’s playing offense in only four states , ” said David Plouffe , Obama ’s campaign manager .
“ We ’re playing offense in 11 or 12 states , including states McCain never thought he ’d have to defend . ”
With so many contests so close , there are several plausible outcomes that could yield a 269- 269 electoral college tie , which would pitch the election into the House of Representatives .
“ It ’s never happened , ” said the University of Denver ’s Hardaway , who said the chances are extremely unlikely .
“ But that ’s not to say it could n’t . ”
Given that , Obama ’s effort to break off an electoral vote in Nebraska and McCain ’s attempt to win one in Maine are not the fliers they might seem .

On an evening last week , a half - dozen Obama volunteers gathered in a church parking lot to canvass a working - class neighborhood on Omaha ’s north side .
Weeds grew up through cracks in the sidewalk .
Many of the homes -- paint peeling , porches buckling -- had seen better times , as , apparently , have many of those inside .
Cindy Hare , 47 , one of the few to answer the door , said she had had it with Bush , the Republican Party and an economy “ that ’s gone straight to hell . ”
The registered independent plans to vote for Obama and figures many of her neighbors will too , even if some are wary of electing a black president .
“ People want a change , ” Hare said as her three dogs barked in the background .
“ So let ’s do it in a big way . ”

Astronaut Donald Pettit , STS - 126 mission specialist , configures the Water Recovery System ( WRS ) rack in the Destiny laboratory of the International Space Station while space shuttle Endeavour is docked with the station on Nov. 19 , 2008 .
Thisstory was updated at 10:31 a.m. EST .
After daysof glitches and tweaks , a new recycling system designed to turn astronaut urineback into drinking water is apparently working well aboard the InternationalStation .
The spacestation ?s urine processor , part of a larger wastewaterrecycling system , worked non -stop for a full four - hour test and longer lateMonday to the delight of astronauts and NASA engineers .
The systemis crucial if the space station is to jump to double - sized , six - personcrews next year .
? Notto spoil it , but I think up here we ?re feeling , the appropriate words are ?
Yippee !??
station commander Michael Fincke said after the four - hour mark .
? Therewill be dancing later , ?
Mission Control joked back .
Finckesaid it made a few noises like a ? washing machine in a spin cycle ?
for a shorttime but then went back to normal .
Anothervital test at the station early Tuesday checked the health of a massivestarboard side gear designed to turn the station ? s right side solar arrays sothey always face the sun and maximize power production .
Endeavourshuttle astronauts performed a four - spacewalkoverhaul on the vital 10 - foot ( 3 - meter ) gear over the last week to replacedamaged bearings , lubricate it and clean out metal shavings that had cloggedits intricate mechanism .
The test ranabout three hours , or two laps around Earth for the station , with flightcontrollers finding that the gear was running smoother and drawing less powerthan it did before its unprecedented spacewalk clean and lube job .
Spacestation flight director Ginger Kerrick said flight controllers will be keepinga close eye on the power levels and vibrations from the starboard solar arraygear , but it will likely take several months before engineers will know theresults of the Endeavour crew ?s repairs .
Urinerecycler results encouraging
The urinerecycler is part of the station ? snew Water Recovery System delivered by Endeavour last week to collectastronaut urine , sweat and other wastewater and distill it back into potablewater for drinking , food preparation , bathing and oxygen generation .
The systemis part of a $ 250 million regenerative life support designed to sustain largerspace station crews with fewer supply runs from visiting spacecraft , with thefirst six - person crew due to arrive at the orbiting lab next May .
But thesystem ?s urine processor only worked in spurts over the last few days , operating from as little as two hours to a peak performance of about 3 1/2hours .
NASA extended the Endeavour crew ? s stay at the space station by an extraday Monday to allow more time to work with the balky device .
Fincke and Endeavourastronaut Don Pettit removed a set of washer - like vibration dampeners fromthe system during their first repair attempt Sunday .
On Monday , the added apair of support brackets to hold the system ?s centrifuge in place moresecurely .
Monday ?
sovernight test set a new bar .
Mission Control shut the unit down after thesuccessful test and then restarted it for a new trial early Tuesday morning .
? I 'd liketo congratulate the entire team because we 've been operating for four hours andtwo minutes now , ?
Fincke said before going to sleep late Monday .
Finckeloaded the urine processer up with a new batch and told Mission Control not toworry about running out .
? We ?ve gota full tank of yesterday ?s coffee here ready to fill up at any time , ?
Finckesaid .
? Soundslike a dirty job , but somebody ?s got to do it , ?
Mission Control replied .
Themachine is designed to spend about four hours distilling water from astronauturine .
Endeavour astronauts will return samples of the processed water back toEarth for analysis , though NASA engineers plan to run more tests for 90 daysbefore astronauts can begin drinking it .
? Ithink if we can get past the four - hour mark , I think we ?re going to be good , ?Pettit said .

After a period of relative prosperity and renewed confidence , Argentines are living through another moment of uncertainty .
The failed effort to raise taxes on farmers , and now a move by Mrs. Kirchner to nationalize some 86 billion pesos ( nearly $ 26 billion ) in private pension funds , has raised fears that the government is short on cash .
Mrs. Kirchner said the pension takeover was necessary to safeguard retirees ’ savings from turbulence in the global economy .

But the move , which requires legislative approval , has alarmed international investors , who see it as an admission that the government will grab whatever cash it needs to avoid losing political support before regional elections next year .
Now Argentines are getting that familiar feeling of being let down by their government again .
Millions were caught flat - footed in December 2001 , when the government tried to limit withdrawals of bank savings .
The measure backfired , causing a panic as Argentines rushed to pull out whatever they could .
The country then defaulted on billions of dollars of loans , and the government sharply devalued the currency .
An economic malaise pushed more than half the country below the poverty line by late 2002 , before a strong recovery began .
These days , there are browsers but few buyers at the Innocenza beachwear shop in the garment district .
Its orders for bikinis are off by more than 15 percent .
“ This is very frustrating , because we prepared hard for the season , ” said Ariel Fritzler , the company ’s commercial director .
“ People are paralyzed with uncertainty ; they do n’t know what to do .
There is a definite feeling that 2001 could happen again . ”
In many ways , Argentina is still living out the consequences of its last economic crisis .
The previous government of Néstor Kirchner , Mrs. Kirchner ’s husband , complicated matters by keeping utility prices artificially low and , more recently , “ fudging ” inflation figures to try to maintain popular support and avoid higher debt payments , said Rafael de la Fuente , chief economist for Latin America for BNP Paribas .
“ Although you could see the cracks in the edifice , it was going O.K. until we had this credit crunch , ” Mr. de la Fuente said .
Now , “ people are losing faith in the government ’s ability to fund itself , ” he said .

In 2001 , Ranjit Chandra had published a study in Nutrition Research , which is just as exciting as it sounds , about how some multivitamins he had patented could reverse memory problems in old folks .
Curiously , the exact same paper had been submitted to the British Medical Journal and had been rejected after reviewers said it had " all the hallmarks of having been completely invented . "
So it was the medical equivalent of everything Scientologists believe ; only pawned off as real .
So it was like everything Scientologists believe .
Unfortunately for Chandra , he had n't just lied , he lied big .
If you 're a hunter and you claim to have shot a deer that was the size of a dump truck , most folks will smile and nod and let it go at that .
If you claim to have shot Bigfoot and have his carcass at home and write a paper about it and submit it to world famous journals for others to read about , you have committed what some people refer to as " lying like a retard . "

The claims Chandra made in his study were so amazing they started getting mainstream media attention and were printed in the New York Times which meant more people who can tell their assholes from grape jelly got a hold of it and noticed he was full of shit .
This in turn lead people to wonder what else the good doctor had been doing all his life .
In the 1980s , Chandra was contracted by Ross Pharmaceuticals , now Abbott Nutrition , and makers of such things as Similac , Ensure and other vaguely nauseating healthy liquids , to do a study on their products and food allergies in newborns .
Nestle and Mead Johnson hopped on board as well and Chandra just needed to find 288 newborns to do his work .

" Dammit , we need more babies . "
A year later , the study was done despite the fact he did n't have nearly enough babies .
Now that 's Science !
More impressive than how Chandra got the study done was his results that showed the Nestle and Mead Johnson formulas protected babies from allergies but the Ross Pharmaceuticals brands did not , even though they make the stuff from pretty much the same ingredients .
In a move that signals the start of the our clean energy future , the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Environmental Appeals Board ( EAB ) ruled today EPA had no valid reason for refusing to limit from new coal - fired power plants the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming .
The decision means that all new and proposed coal plants nationwide must go back and address their carbon dioxide emissions .
â€ œTodayâ€™s decision opens the way for meaningful action to fight global warming and is a major step in bringing about a clean energy economy , â€ said Joanne Spalding , Sierra Club Senior Attorney who argued the case .
â€ œThis is one more sign that we must begin repowering , refueling and rebuilding America.â€ 
â€ œThe EAB rejected every Bush Administration excuse for failing to regulate the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States .
This decision gives the Obama Administration a clean slate to begin building our clean energy economy for the 21st century , â€ continued Spalding
The decision follows a 2007 Supreme Court ruling recognizing carbon dioxide , the principle source of global warming , is a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act .
â€ œCoal plants emit 30 % of our nationâ€™s global warming pollution .
Building new coal plants without controlling their carbon emissions could wipe out all of the other efforts being undertaken by cities , states and communities across the country , ” said Bruce Nilles , Director of the Sierra Clubâ€™s National Coal Campaign .
â€ œEveryone has a role to play and itâ€™s time that the coal industry did its part and started living up to its clean coal rhetoric.â€ 
The Sierra Club went before the Environmental Appeals Board in May of 2008 to request that the air permit for Deseret Power Electric Cooperativeâ€™s proposed waste coal - fired power plant be overturned because it failed to require any controls on carbon dioxide pollution .
Deseret Powerâ€™s 110 MW
Bonanza plant would have emitted 3.37 million tons of carbon dioxide each year .
â€ œInstead of pouring good money after bad trying to fix old coal technology , investors should be looking to wind , solar and energy efficiency technologies that are going to power the economy , create jobs , and help the climate recover , â€ said Nilles .
To get background information and see how the case unfolded click here .
A copy of the decision can be found here ( PDF )
This is HUGE .
Basically it means that coal power plants MUST use the most up to date ( and most expensive ) methods to control CO2 available .
Do n’t expect one red cent to be invested in coal for the next ten years .
Instead look for all that money to be directed towards wind , solar , and geothermal .
This one is big people , this one is big .

A new analysis suggests that economic growth may not be sustainable ( Image : ilco , stock.
xchng )
Things may seem bad now – with fears of a world recession looming – but they could be set to get much worse .
A real - world analysis of a controversial prediction made 30 years ago concludes that economic growth cannot be sustained and we are on track for serious economic collapse this century .
In 1972 , the seminal book Limits to Growth by a group called the Club of Rome claimed that exponential growth would eventually lead to economic and environmental collapse .
Advertisement
The group used computer models that assessed the interaction of rising populations , pollution , industrial production , resource consumption and food production .
Most economists rubbished the book and its recommendations have been ignored by governments , although a growing band of experts today continues to argue that we need to reshape our economy to become more sustainable .
Now Graham Turner at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) in Australia has compared the book ’s predictions with data from the intervening years .
‘ Steady state economy ’
Changes in industrial production , food production and pollution are all in line with the book ’s predictions of collapse in the 21st century , says Turner .
According to the book , the path we have taken will cause decreasing resource availability and an escalating cost of extraction that triggers a slowdown of industry , which eventually results in economic collapse some time after 2020 .
“ For the first 30 years of the model , the world has been tracking along an unsustainable trajectory , ” he says .
According to Herman Daly of the University of Maryland , Turner ’s results show that we “ must get off the growth path of business as usual , and move to a steady state economy , ” stopping population growth , resource depletion , and pollution .
Yet Turner reckons his report [ pdf format ] shows that a sustainable economy is attainable .
“ We would n’t have to go back to the caves , ” he says .

More than three times as many officials will be able to access sensitive information on every child in England and Wales held in the forthcoming ContactPoint database than estimates circulated by the government suggest , research by The Register has found .
ContactPoint is now scheduled to launch in January .
It will store and share data including every child 's name , home address and school , and information about their legal guardians .
The government has argued it could help prevent cases similar to the horrific death of Baby P , whose tormentors were convicted at the Old Bailey yesterday .
Publicly available staffing figures from education authorities , the NHS , social services and other organisations show that more than one million government employees will have access to ContactPoint .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) has told parliament that only 330,000 will use the delayed centralised data sharing system .
DCSF ministers Lord Adonis and Kevin Brennan have told both houses of parliament " the number of users is estimated to be around 330,000 " .
Use versus access
The lesser figure has been repeatedly highlighted by ContactPoint 's critics as reason to fear it will be open to abuse .
News that the true number of users could top a million will provide them with more ammunition to attack the government 's security claims .
Although ministers have emphasised the numbers who will " use " ContactPoint rather than be able to access the database , it 's the latter that is seen as most important by campaigners , who are concerned the database will be easily trawled by abusive former partners seeking a reunion , for example .
At time of publications DCSF had not respond to requests for comment on the much wider access to ContactPoint our research reveals .
Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have pledged to scrap ContactPoint .
Maria Miller , the Tories ' shadow minister for children , schools and families told The Register : " An independent review by Deloitte in February said that urgent changes needed to be made to ContactPoint before the government could implement it .
Now more problems are emerging with ContactPoint and still the government thinks it is acceptable to introduce it .
" They have grossly underestimated the number of people who will have access to children ’s data and now more children will be put at risk .
ContactPoint should be scrapped . "
The Conservatives want to replace ContactPoint with a smaller system that will only hold data on children deemed at risk .
Officials wrote to councils in October arguing against the alternative scheme .
DCSF later apologised for the breach of civil service political impartiality rules .
The total number of government employees who will have access to ContactPoint among only GPs and the police is more than 323,000 , official figures show .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hosted a " retreat " for world leaders on Friday aimed at " converting intentions expressed at a Group of 20 summit in Washington this month " into concrete recommendations ahead of the next G - 20 meeting in London in April .
However , he admitted that only 10 national leaders were among the 34 or 35 high - level delegates who turned up , and no conclusions were announced .
Even the heads of the IMF and Worldbank skipped the meeting , citing conflicting schedules .

Ban said he still hopes the conference can come up with concrete plans as well as updating a 2002 Monterrey Consensus on aid to developing countries ahead of the next G - 20 meeting in London in April .. ( Full )

Citi criticized for $ 400 million stadium sponsorship Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008

As worldwide banking conglomerate Citigroup accepts a $ 306 billion government aid package and prepares to lay off 52,000 workers , it wo n't be trimming back a $ 400 million stadium deal .
Congressman Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) appeared on CNN Tuesday morning to declare that industry executives need to realize their place as they show up in Washington to beg for taxpayer money .
" Citi remains committed to its relationship with the New York Mets , " the conglomerate 's Vice President of Public Affairs , Luis Rosero , said in a Monday statement .
" The sponsorship of Citi Field is an important marketing priority for the company . "
" We 've got Citigroup coming to the Congress , cashmere hat in hand , begging for money to stay afloat .
They got $ 25 billion a few months ago , [ they 're ] now getting another $ 20 billion and all kinds of other sweeteners , " said Cummings , senior member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , on Tuesday .
" They come to us saying , ' Look , Congress .
We 're on a respirator .
We 're about to die , ' but ... they 're adamant about holding on to a deal whereby they can plaster their name on the front of a stadium in New York ... I have a problem with that , and my constituents do too . "
Citigroup , Rep. Cummings said , did " very well " for many years without help from stadium naming rights .
" Suddenly now they need it ?
Come on , give me a break .
" And I think the American people are saying ' give me a break . '
There 's another piece of this that I 'm very concerned about , and that is that the ... companies lining up , wanting to get government money , while my constituents are losing their jobs , losing their homes , going through difficult times not knowing how they 're going to make it , but ... still , they see their tax dollars being used for things like this . "
Citigroup , Cummings added , is hesitating to follow through on earlier promises to help prevent customers ' foreclosures as part of the deal .
" They need to understand that this is a new day , " he said .
" They 've got a new owner : the United States government and the citizens of this country . "

I am amazed at how many people think that suddenly with a 10 percent gain on Monday that somehow the market is now in good shape .
This could not be further from the truth .
Massive percentage swings occur during economic turbulent times .
You do not want to see 10 percent up or 10 percent down days .
What you do want to see is a market that is steadily moving up based on earnings reports and an economy that is growing at a healthy pace .
During this week , the market had the worst consumer confidence report ever .
The rating came out at 38 when the market was expecting 52 which was already a horrible number .
The fact of the matter is the middle class American is getting hosed from every front as if Wall Street was using multiple fire hydrants to pump and drain their problems onto the taxpayer .
This bailout of the financial culprits who caused this mess now looks to have a provision of allocating a large number of the fund to compensating executives .
Compensating executives ?
They should get zero compensation and we should actually be putting criminal provisions .
To allocate compensation is an utter joke in the face of the economic pain being faced by the majority of the country .
For those that think economic market volatility is good let us look at some historical numbers for the Dow :
Out of the top 10 daily percentage gains in history , 7 occurred during the Great Depression , 1 during the 1987 market meltdown , and 2 during our current crisis .
In fact , out of the top 20 daily percentage gains in history 17 occurred during the Great Depression .
Remind us again how massive upswings are good again ?
They are not .
They signify fear and massive movements in and out of the market .
The average investor does n’t even stand a chance at the moment .
Even with these massive up swings , where does the Dow stand from the peak reached last October ?
Even after the historical upswing , the Dow is still down a stunning 36 percent in one - year .
Keep in mind this is also factoring in that only a few weeks ago A.I.G. was removed from the index of 30 stocks and replaced with Kraft .
What a convenient time .
If A.I.G. were still in the mix , it would be lower .
So now we ’ve seen the top up days .
What about the Dow ’s worst days ever ?
Out of the top 20 daily percentage down days , 9 occurred during the Great Depression , 2 occurred during the 1987 crash , 1 in 1997 , 1 after 9/11 , 1 in 1899 , 1 during the 1907 panic , 1 during 1917 , and 3 in our current crisis !
Think about that , over 100 years of history and the only time in history that had more volatility was during the Great Depression .
You also have to keep in mind that the market crash hit in October of 1929 but the bottom was not reached until 1932 .
If we once again look at a 5 year chart of the Dow , it looks like the bottom fell out in September of 2008 :
So even though a 10 + percent jump in one day may feel like an injection of cocaine and provide immediate relief , the longer term consequences are much more dire .
You do not want the economy operating like a maniac going all over the map .
Employment is rotten , earnings are in the dumps , state budgets look like a house party the morning after , and employers are still cutting jobs .
Oh , and our Fed just slashed rates again throwing the U.S. Dollar under the bus once again to appease his central bank masters .
Oil shot up in tandem .
These are the guys that are supposedly protecting us ?
Time to get these folks out of political power .

Sara Seager , a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said it was significant that the planets in both cases seemed to be associated with disks of dust , particularly Fomalhaut , one of the brightest and closest stars known to be host to a massive disk .
“ Fomalhaut is like a Hollywood star to astronomers , so we have some personal excitement here , ” Dr. Seager said .
“ It feels like finding out that one of your four closest friends just won the lottery big time ”
Alan Boss , a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , said the triple - planet system in Pegasus was particularly promising , “ as we expect planets to form in systems in general , whereas spurious background interlopers will generally appear as single ‘ planets . ’ ” But he and others cautioned that much more study of these objects was necessary and that the masses imputed to them were still highly uncertain .
Being able to see planets directly opens the door to spectroscopic observations that can help determine the composition , temperature and other physical characteristics of planets and allow for comparisons with one another and with their parent stars .
Dr. Macintosh said he hoped to train a spectroscope on his new planets as early as Monday .
The new images are the fruits of a long campaign by astronomers to see more and more of the unseeable .
In particular , it is a triumph for the emerging technology of adaptive optics , in which telescope mirrors are jiggled and warped slightly many times a second to compensate for the atmospheric turbulence that blurs star images .
The problem in seeing other planets is picking them out of the glare of their parent stars , which are millions of times brighter , at least in visible light .
As a result , planet hunters usually look for infrared , or heat radiation , which is emitted copiously by planets still shedding heat from the process of formation .
For their observations , Dr. Marois and his colleagues used the 8 - meter in diameter Gemini North and the 10 - meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii , both of which had been fitted with adaptive optics .
Then they processed the images with a special computer program , which Dr. Marois described as “ a software coronagraph , ” for processing the images .

Beginning on Wednesday , Comcast , the largest broadband service provider in the U.S. , is going to start capping the total amount of data you can transfer using their broadband connection — to 250 GB per month .
With this move , the cable company will become the symbol of a new Internet era , one that is both monitored and metered .
It is an era that threatens to limit innovation and to a large extent , the possibilities for new startups .
I have been very vocal about the short - sightedness of this decision being made by Comcast ( and some other carriers ) , and along with my colleague Stacey Higginbotham , have been covering the story pretty closely .
It is a clear and present danger to the way we use the Internet in this country .
In order to give you a better understanding of the issues at hand , I have teamed up with my old friend Muayyad Al - Chalabi , an alumni of Bell Labs and until recently an analyst with The Monitor Group , to release this white paper , “ Broadband Usage - Based Pricing and Caps Analysis . ”
In this paper , we aim to highlight the possible unintended consequences of such policies , among them the stunting of growth and innovation of web - based applications .
And of course , higher costs .
Plus :
The strategy ignores the high degree of dependency “ interactions ” between power users and the rest of the network .
The power users do n’t act in isolation and in fact represent the hubs in any scale - free network ; sequestering them and overcharging them will result in either low usage or worse , higher costs .
Given the growth trend due to consumers ’ changes in content consumption , today ’s power users are tomorrow ’s average users .
By 2012 , the bill for data access is projected to be around $ 215 per month .
Strategic pricing involves the recognition that changing prices alone cannot solve the challenges facing carriers .
Carriers are taking the easy way out trying to protect the “ walled garden ” rather than figuring out how to innovate in service delivery and harvesting more value from the overall content and applications opportunity .

Reactive programming ( I. ) - First class events in F #
I believe that the LINQ project and changes in C# 3.0 and VB 9 are interesting because they allow rewriting of many ideas from functional programming .
An ability to express queries easily is one of these ideas , but it is definitely not the only one .
There are many other interesting ideas .
The C# 3.0 language is n't primary a functional language , so it is n't easy to discover the idea if you use only C# , but it is possible to implement it if you know the idea already .
I already wrote a few interesting C# examples that were inspired by some functional idea .
I 'm a big fan of the F# language , so it is not a surprise that I started with an F# version of the problem and then looked at the way to do the same thing in C# .
In particular , this is how my article about building dynamic queries in C# came to the existence - the F# version used FLINQ and Quotations [ 2 ] and then I demonstrated how to do the same in C# using expression trees [ 3 ] .
Another example is my article about asynchronous programming in C# using iterators [ 4 ] , which shows how to implement something like F# asynchronous workflows [ 5 ] using iterators in C# 2.0 .
Functional Reactive Programming
Today , I 'm going to look at another very interesting idea from functional programming .
It is called Functional Reactive Programming and it comes from the Haskell community .
You can find a list of related Haskell projects here .
However , similar things ( though they are not purely functional and somewhat simplified ) are available in the F# language as well .
Don Syme introduced them in his blog post called " F# First Class Events : Simplicity and Compositionality in Imperative Reactive Programming " [ 1 ] .
In this article , I 'm going to briefly introduce the implementation available in F # and I 'll extend it a little bit to allow some more interesting things .
In the second article from this series , I 'll show how to implement the same thing in C# 3.0 ( and in VB 9 too ! )
Actually this relation between functional programming in F# and C# is the key topic for my book Real - world Functional Programming in .NET .
The book will discuss some of the topics that I 'll introduce in this article in a larger detail .
In this article I 'll talk about events only , but the second important part of functional reactive programming is the use of continuous , time - varying values ( such as the position of mouse or the time ) .
In the book , this will be discussed as part of the Chapter 15 and events are the key topic for Chapter 16 .
Working with events in F #
Let 's briefly look at the features that are already available in the F# language and libraries .
In F# , you can work with events as if they were ordinary objects ( in functional terminology , we 'd say values ) .
This means that you can write a function that takes an event as an argument and returns an event .
This allows us to write various functions for processing events .
We 'll demonstrate this soon , but first let 's create some form that we can use for testing .
The following example shows how to create a Windows Form with a small green ellipse somewhere on the form .
You can see the expected result in the attached screenshot .
If you paste the source code to the F# interactive , a form should appear ( Note , you can open the code in Visual Studio , select it and hit Alt +
Enter to run it in the F# interactive ) :
# light open System .
Drawing open System .
Windows .
Forms // Generate random location for the ellipse let rnd = new System .
Random ( ) let x , y = rnd .
Next ( 550 ) , rnd .
Next ( 350 ) // Create the main form let frm = new Form( ClientSize=Size ( 600,400 ) ) //
Add event handler to paint the ellipse frm .
Paint.Add( fun e -> e. Graphics.FillRectangle ( Brushes .
White , 0 , 0 , 600 , 400 ) e. Graphics.FillEllipse( Brushes.DarkOliveGreen , x , y , 50 , 50 ) ) frm .
Show ( )
Nothing very exciting so far ; n this example we used events in the traditional way .
This means that we used the Add method to attach a handler to the event and we specified the event handler in a lambda function ( which is just like anonymous delegate in C# 2.0 or function in C# 3.0 ) .
This is the usual way for attaching handlers to events in C# too , with the difference that you use built - in += operator .
Processing event streams
Now , let 's finally take a look at the F# way of processing events .
We 'll extend the example to display some message when a user clicks on the ellipse .
Traditionally , you 'd write an event handler that would get MouseEventArgs as an argument .
It would test whether the position of the cursor is inside the ellipse and then show the message .
However , there is another way we can think about events .
You can imagine that event such as MouseDown is a stream of information about the clicks .
Once you click on the form , new information appears in the stream and we can process it .
When we think of events in this way , we can see that events ( or event streams ) are very similar to lists or other collections .
This means that we can use techniques for working with collections for processing events .
I already wrote about functions for working with lists in F# in my F# overview [ 6 ] , but very briefly - you can use functions like filter and map for working with lists .
The first one returns a list with elements for which a given predicate is true .
The second one uses the given function to transform an element ( for example a number n ) into something else ( for example a type that contains the original number and its square ) .
Let 's take a look at an example that demonstrates this :
> [ 1 .. 10 ] |> List.filter ( fun n -> n % 2 = 1 ) |> List.map ( fun n -> ( n , n*n ) ) ; ; val it : ( int * int ) list = [ ( 1 , 1 ) ; ( 3 , 9 ) ; ( 5 , 25 ) ; ( 7 , 49 ) ; ( 9 , 81 ) ]
In this example , we took a list of numbers from 1 to 10 .
Then we filtered it using List. filter , so the result contained only odd numbers .
Finally , we used the List.map function to transform the list into a list that contains a number and its square .
We 're using the pipeline operator ( written as |> ) to sequence the operations .
This simply means that the result of the operation on the left side will be used as an argument for the next operation in the pipeline .
You can see that the result printed by the F# interactive contains squares of all odd numbers in that range .
You may be wondering why I am talking about lists here , when I promised an article about events .
The answer is that functions like this make perfect sense for working with events as well .
We can use filter to ignore events that are not interesting for us ( such as when the user clicks outside of the ellipse ) and we can use map to turn information about the click into something more interesting , such as a message that we 'll show to the user .
Let 's finally implement the code that handles clicks on the ellipse using these event processing functions :
> // Utility function to calculate the distance open System let dist ( x1 , y1 ) ( x2 , y2 ) = Math .
Sqrt( Math .
Pow ( x1 - x2 , 2.0 ) + Math. Pow ( y1 - y2 , 2.0 ) ) ;; val dist : float * float -> float * float -> float > let evtMessages = frm.MouseDown |> Event.filter ( fun mi -> //
The distance between click location and // the center of the ellipse is less than 25 dist ( float mi.X , float mi . Y ) ( float ( x + 25 ) , float(y + 25 ) ) < 25.0 ) |> Event.map ( fun mi -> //
Return message that we 'll show to the user if ( int ( mi.Button &&& MouseButtons .
Left ) <>
0 ) then " Left button " elif ( int ( mi.Button &&& MouseButtons .
Right ) <>
0 ) then " Right button " else " Some trick ! " ) ;; val evtMessages : IEvent < string >
We are n't yet done with the application , but we did two important steps .
Let 's take a look at them in detail .
We first used the Event . filter processing function .
The predicate that we gave it tests whether the center of the ellipse ( x + 25 , y + 25 ) is close enough to the location of the mouse click .
The mi value represents MouseEventArgs , so the location of the click is stored in ( mi.X , mi . Y ) .
The next processing function we 're using is Event.map .
This takes the information about the click and returns some string depending on the button that was used .
I entered the code to the F# interactive , so that we can see what the result is .
As you can see , this creates a value called evtMessages that has a type IEvent < string > .
This is the F# representation of events .
This means that the result is an event that will be raised when the user clicks on the ellipse .
The values carried by the event will be of type string .
The only thing that we need to do now is to add handler for the event and display the message in the message box .
Our goal is to get something like the message in the screenshot on the right side .
Reacting to events
The evtMessages value is an ordinary event , so we could use its
Add method just like we used Add method of the frm .
Paint event earlier .
However , F# gives us more ways to do this and it's a good idea to use the same approach that we used in the previous listing to filter the event stream .
We need to do two things - first , we 'll need to add some additional text to the message and second , we want to display the message box .
This can be written using two primitives .
You know the first one already - we 'll use Event.map to turn the event stream with simple messages into a stream that contains messages that we actually want to show to the user .
In the next step , we 'll use Event.listen .
This is a processing function that simply calls a function we give it when the event is raised and does n't do anything else .
This means that it ends our event processing code and returns unit , which is just like void in C# .
We 'll use two more functional tricks - partial function application and function composition .
These are in detail explained in my F# book , but you can get some idea from the F# overview [ 5 ] that I wrote some time ago .
evtMessages |> Event.map ( sprintf " Hey , you clicked on the ellipse .
Using : %s " ) |> Event.listen ( MessageBox .
Show >> ignore )
This time we 'll writing processing code for the evtMessages value , which is an event that we constructed in the previous example .
In the first line , we use the Event.map function to format the message .
We use the sprintf function and give it a format string that specifies that the function should expect a string as an argument .
This means that the type of the expression in parentheses will be a function that takes a string and returns a string .
This is compatible with what Event.map expects - it is a function .
We used partial application , which means that we omitted the last argument and used the expression as a function value .
The second line uses Event. listen to show the message box .
As other functions for processing events , this one also expects a function as an argument .
The function will get string as an argument and should n't return anything , because Event. listen terminates the event processing .
In the example , we use function composition operator ( >> ) to create a function that will take a string , call MessageBox .
Show and then ignore the value returned by the MessageBox .
Show ( we have to add ignore , because MessageBox .
Show returns a DialogResult and Event.listen expects that nothing will be returned ) .
Summary
In this article , we 've looked at an example that demonstrates the idea behind reactive programming and working with events as values in F# .
I have n't discussed all the details - there are many other operations such as Event.map and Event .
filter that you can use to combine event processing code in different ways ( and these are indeed discussed in my book ) .
In the next part of this mini-series , we 're going to look how to implement the same ideas in C# .
I 'll also introduce my project , which is an implementation of LINQ query operators for events that I call Reactive LINQ .

A Blimp Building Adventure Turned Ugly by Alfonzo Smith
While traveling , I stopped at a Zany Brainy store and saw that they had a blimp for sale .
It 's called Airship Earth , and it's a great big balloon with a map of the Earth on it , and two propellers hanging from the bottom .
You blow up the balloon with helium , put batteries in it , and voila , you have a radio control indoor blimp .
I 'd seen these things for sale in Sharper Image catalogs for $ 60 - $ 75 .
At Zany Brainy it was on clearance for $ 15 .
What a deal !
Last night my wife was playing tennis and it was just my daughter and me at home .
I bought a small helium tank at a party store , and we put the blimp together .
Let me tell you , it 's quite a blimp .
It 's huge .
The balloon has a 3 - ft diameter .
We blew it up with the tank , attached the gondola with the propellers , and put in batteries .
Then we balanced the blimp for neutral buoyancy with this putty that came with it , so it hangs in the air by itself neither rising nor falling .
It was easy and fun .
Then I blew up another balloon and made Mickey Mouse helium voices for my daughter .
My three year old loved it .
We flew the blimp all over the house , terrorized the dog and attacked the fish tank .
The controls were so easy my three year old daughter could fly it .
Let 's face it , blimps are fun .
Alas , the fun had to end and my daughter had to go to sleep .
I left the blimp floating in my office downstairs , my wife came home , and we went to bed , and slept the sleep of the righteous .
It is important to know that my house has central heating .
I have it configured to blow hot air out on the ground floor and take it in at the second floor to take advantage of the fact that heat rises .
The blimp , which was up until this moment a fun toy , here embarked on a career of evil .
Using the artificial convection of my central heating , the blimp stealthily departed my office .
It moved silently through the living and drifted to the staircase .
Gliding wraithlike over the staircase , it then entered the bedroom where my wife and I lay sleeping peacefully .
Running silently , and gliding six feet or so above the ground on invisible and tiny air currents it approached the bed .
In spite of its noiseless passage , or perhaps because of it , I awoke .
I awoke the way you awake at 2:00 AM when your sleeping senses suddenly tell you that the forces of evil on converging upon you .
I awoke the way you awake when you suddenly know that there is a large levitating sinister presence hovering towards you with menacing intent through the malignant darkness .
Sometimes I do wake up in the middle of the night thinking that there are large sinister and menacing things floating out of the darkness to do me evil .
Usually I open my eyes , look and listen carefully , decide it was a false alarm , and go back to sleep .
So , the fact that I awoke in such a manner was not all that unusual .
On this occasion , I awoke to the sense that there was a large menacing presence approaching me silently out of the gloom , so I opened my eyes , and there it was !
A LARGE SILENT MENACING PRESENCE WAS APPROACHING ME , AND IT COULD FLY !!!
Somewhere in the control room of my mind a fat little dwarf in a security outfit was paging through a Penthouse while smoking a cigar with his feet up on the table , watching the security monitors of my brain with his peripheral vision .
Suddenly he saw the LARGE SILENT SINISTER MENACING FLOATING PRESENCE coming at me , and he pulled every panic switch that my body has .
A full decade 's allotment of adrenaline was dumped into my bloodstream all at once .
My metabolism went from " restful sleep mode " to " HOLY SHIT !
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE OR DIE !!!! mode " in a nanosecond .
My heart went from twenty something beats per minute to about 240 ... even faster .
I always knew this was going to happen .
I always knew that skepticism and science were mere psychological decorations and vanities .
Deep in our alligator brains we all know that the world is just chock full of evil and monsters and sinister forces aligned against us , and it is only a matter of time until they show up .
Evolution knows this too .
It knows what to do when the silent terror comes at you from out of the dark .
When 50 million years worth of evolutionary survival instinct hits you all at once flat in the gut at 200 mph it is not a pleasant sensation .
Without volition , I screamed my battle cry ( which is indistinguishable to the sound a little girl makes when you drop a spider down her dress — not that I 'd know what that sounds like , ) and leapt out of bed in my underwear .
I struck the approaching menace with all my strength and almost fell over at the total lack of resistance that a helium balloon offers when you punch the living shit out of it with all the strength that sudden middle of the night terror produces .
Its trajectory took it straight into the ceiling fan which whipped it about the room at terrifying velocity .
Seeking a weapon , I ripped the alarm clock out of the wall and hurled it at the now High Velocity Menacing presence ( smashing the clock and
putting a nice hole in the wall . )
Somehow at this moment , I suddenly realized that I was fighting the blimp , and not a monster .
It might have been funny if I did n't truly and actually feel like I was having a legitimate heart attack .
I went to the bathroom and literally retched into the toilet while shaking uncontrollably with the shock of the reaction I 'd had .
Unbelievably , both my wife and daughter had completely slept through the incident .
When I decided that I was n't having a heart attack after all , I went back into the bedroom and found the blimp which had somehow survived the incident .
I took it to the walk - in closet and released it inside where it floated around with the air currents released from the vents in there .
I closed the door , this sealing it in , and went back to bed .
About 500 years later I fell asleep .
At 7 a.m. my wife awoke .
Remember , she had been playing tennis and was n't aware that we have assembled the blimp the previous evening , and that is was now floating around the walk - in closet .
The dynamic between the existing air currents of the closet and the suction caused by opening the door was enough to give the blimp the appearance of an Evil Sinister Menace flying towards her .
This time the blimp did not survive the encounter ... nor almost , did I , as I had to explain to my angry spouse what motivated me to hide an evil lurking presence in the closet for her to find at 7 a.m .
I can order replacement balloons on the Internet but I do n't think I will .
Some blimps are better off dead .

OpenStreetMap contemplates licensing

Maps are cool ; there 's no end of applications which can make good use of mapping data .
There is plenty of map data around , but it 's almost exclusively proprietary in nature .
That makes this data hard to use with free applications ; it 's also inherently annoying .
We , as taxpayers , own those streets ; why should we have to pay somebody else to know where the streets are ?
Your editor likes to grumble about such things ; meanwhile , the OpenStreetMap project ( OSM ) is busily doing something about it .
OSM has put together a database and a set of tools making it easy for anybody to enter location data with the intent of producing a free mapping database with global coverage .
It is an ambitious project , to say the least , but it 's working :
Right now on each and every day , 25,000 km of roads gets added to the OpenStreetMap database , on the historical trend that will be over 200,000 km per day by the end of 2009 .
And that does n't include all the other data that makes OpenStreetMap the richest dataset available online .
OSM data is not limited to roads ; just about any point or track of interest can be added to the database .
If current trends continue , OSM could well grow into the most extensive geolocation database anywhere - free or proprietary .
And those trends could well continue ; one of the nice aspects of this kind of project is that no particular expertise is needed to contribute .
All you need is a GPS receiver and some time ; some OSM local groups have even acquired a set of receivers to lend out to interested volunteers .
This is our planet , and we can all help to map it .
All this work raises an interesting question , though : under what license should this accumulated data be distributed ?
Currently , the OSM database is covered by the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike 2.0 license .
It is a copyleft - style license , requiring that derived products be made available under the same license .
So , for example , if a GPS navigator manufacturer were to include an enhanced version of the OSM database in its products , it would have to release the enhanced version under the CC by - SA license .
The OSM project is not happy with this license , though , and is looking to make a change .
The attribution requirement is ambiguous in this context ; do users need to credit every OSM contributor ?
Does making a plot of OSM data with added data layered on top create a derived product ?
But the scariest question is a different one : can the CC by - SA license cover the OSM database at all ?
Copyright law covers creative expression , not facts .
The information in the OSM database is almost entirely factual in nature ; one cannot copyright the location of a street corner .
So what OSM is trying to protect is not the individual locations , but the database as a whole .
Copyright law does allow for the protection of databases , but that law is far more complex than the law for pure creative works , and it varies far more between jurisdictions .
Europe has a specific ( though much - derided ) database right , the US has far weaker database protections , and other parts of the planet lack this protection altogether .
So it may well be that , if some evil corporation decides to appropriate the OSM database for its own nefarious , proprietary purposes , there will be nothing that the OSM project can do about it .
So the project is thinking of making a switch to the Open Database License ( ODbL ) , which is still being developed .
It , too , is a copyleft - style license , but it is crafted to make use of whatever database protection is available in a given jurisdiction .
To that end , the ODbL is explicitly structured as a contract between the database owner and the user .
In any jurisdiction where database rights are not recognized under copyright law , the contractual nature of the ODbL should provide a legal basis to go after license violators .
But the use of contract law muddies the water considerably ; there are good reasons why free software licenses are carefully written to avoid that path .
Contracts are only valid if they are explicitly and voluntarily entered into by all parties .
If the OSM cannot show that a license violator agreed to abide by the license , it has no case under contract law .
The project has a plan to address this problem :
To ensure that potential users are aware of and agree to the contract terms , we are proposing to require a click - through agreement before downloading data .
( All registered users would agree to this on signing up so will not need a further click - through on each download . )
Registration and clickthrough licensing are obnoxious , to say the least .
But , in any case , the only people who will go through that process are those who obtain the database directly from OpenStreetMap .
The ODbL allows redistribution , naturally , and it does not require that explicit agreement be obtained from recipients of the database .
So it is hard to see an outcome where copies of the database lacking a " signed " contract do not proliferate .
Additionally , reliance on contract law makes it very hard to get injunctive relief , weakening any enforcement efforts considerably .
The ODbL includes an anti-DRM measure ; if a vendor locks down a copy of the database with some sort of DRM scheme , that vendor must also make an unrestricted copy available .
This license tries to distinguish between " collective databases " ( which are not derived works ) and " derivative databases " ( which are ) .
Drawing layers on top of an OSM - based map is a collective work ; tracing lines from such a map is a derivative work .
It is , in general , a complex bit of work .
It is complex enough that a number of OSM contributors are wondering if it's all worth it .
Jordan Hatcher is one of the authors of the ODbL , and he supports its use with OSM , but even he understands the concerns that some people have :
The [ Science Commons ] point is that all this sort of stuff can be a real pain , and is n't what you are really doing is wanting to create and manipulate factual data ?
Why spend all the time on this when the innovation happens in what you can do with the data , and not with trying to protect the data in the first place .
There is an active group with OSM which is opposed to this kind of licensing and would , in fact , rather just get down to the task of collecting and distributing the data .
They express themselves in terms like this :
One thing I really love about OSM is the pragmatic , un-political approach :
You do n't give us your data , fine , then we create our own and you can shove it .
Not :
You do n't give us your data , fine , then we create a complex legal licensing framework that will ultimately get you bogged down in so many requests by prospective users who would like to use our data and yours but cannot and you will sooner or later have to release your data according to the terms we dictate and then we will have won and the world will be a better place .
These contributors would rather that OSM release its data into the public domain - or something very close to that .
Rather than put together a complicated license , they prefer to just publish their data for anybody to use as they see fit .
There have been all of the usual discussions which resemble any " GPL vs. BSD " licensing flame war one has ever seen - except that the OSM folks appear to be a very polite crowd .
It comes down to the usual question : will the OSM database become more complete and useful if those who extend it are forced to contribute back their changes ?
The public domain contingent clearly does not believe that any improvements to the database obtained via licensing constraints will be worth the trouble .
So it seems likely that there will be some sort of fork involving the creation of a smaller , purely public - domain OSM database .
It may well be an in - house fork , with the public domain data being merged into the larger , more restrictively licensed database for distribution .
Regardless of how that goes , this split raises issues of its own : how are the two databases to be kept distinct in the face of cooperative additions and edits ?
Any relicensing of the database also brings up another interesting question : what to do about all of the existing data , which may or may not be copyrighted by those who contributed or edited it ?
The license change may well require a process of getting assent from all contributors and purging data obtained from those who do not agree .
This proposed timeline shows how the project is thinking about working through this task .
It is hard to imagine this process going entirely smoothly .
The OSM community clearly has a set of thorny issues to work out .
Given that , it 's not surprising that this process has already been dragged out over the better part of a year .
How this issue is eventually resolved will certainly serve as an example - not necessarily a good example - for other projects working on free compilations of factual data .
Let us hope that OSM can come to a solution which lets this project continue to grow and generate a valuable database that we all will benefit from .

Ron Paul was a Republican candidate for president in 2008 and 2012 , and a very popular political figure among " Reagan conservatives " ; while in the Republican party , his leanings are more towards anarcho - capitalist Libertarian in his views .
Ron Paul : Fundamentalist Christian Creationist
Ron Paul is an evangelical fundamentalist Christian who does not accept evolution .
When asked about his response in a recent debate regarding acceptance of the theory of evolution and if it should be taught in public schools , he responded :
At first I thought it was a very inappropriate question for the presidency to be decided on a scientific matter and I think it 's a theory ... the theory of evolution and I do n't accept it as a theory .
He did not answer whether he supported teaching of it in public schools .
His answer betrays the fact that he does not understand the difference between everyday use of ' theory ' ( a guess or conjecture ) and the scientific use of theory . [ 1] [ 2 ]
Evolution question asked at 2:45 ( - 7:03 ) .
What he says : a ) " I thought it was a very inappropriate question ... for the presidency to be decided on a scientific matter . "
Asking whether a presidential candidate accepts evolution is not like giving them a pop quiz in organic chemistry .
It 's a test to see whether their public decisionmaking skills are compromised by the strength of their religious beliefs .
Evolution is not scientifically controversial at all , and it's not even necessarily religiously controversial .
The Bible is filled with parables and metaphors , and there is absolutely no reason not to see the Genesis story as one , as a metaphorical description of the creation of the universe and humanity .
A candidate who cannot accommodate his religious views with universally accepted science is dangerous for the public to put their trust in , and that 's why asking if they believe in evolution is relevant . b)
" It 's a theory -- the theory of evolution -- and I do n't accept it . "
Of course , evolution is n't a theory in the layperson 's usage of the word , the way Ron Paul means it , as a sort of hopeful guess .
Evolution is as much a theory as the theory of gravity .
I do n't need to fight this particular battle again tonight , but I will note that the " just a theory " defense is among the lamest possible , and really ill befits a doctor . c )
" I think it 's a theological discussion ... "
If you asked someone , " Why do objects fall down , " and they said , " I think that 's a theological discussion , " you 'd back away slowly .
The truth of evolution is not a matter decided by theological discussion , but by science .
I think the best answer religious anti-evolutionists can give when asked this question is to tell the truth : " I know that evolution is a scientific fact , but I also have religious beliefs that say there is more in the world and its history than science can ever know .
I choose my religious beliefs as a source of truth over science in this matter . "
The fact that so many antievolutionists can't acknowledge this indicates an amount of self - deceit that is unhealthy and unworthy of the public trust .
Ron Paul on The Supreme Court and the Judicial branch of government
Ed Brayton writes , " I am on record praising many of Ron Paul ’s positions , but I ’ve also said that while I think he is refreshing on many issues of executive power and bill of rights issues I can not support him .
And the most powerful reason why I can’t support him is because I think his ideas on other issues are extraordinarily dangerous .
And nothing exemplifies that more than the We The People act that he has sponsored in the House .
This is a court - stripping bill , one that would reverse decades of case law that protects freedom and equality in a thousand different ways .
Here is the core of the bill : "
The Supreme Court of the United States and each Federal court– ( 1 ) shall not adjudicate– ( A ) any claim involving the laws , regulations , or policies of any State or unit of local government relating to the free exercise or establishment of religion ; ( B ) any claim based upon the right of privacy , including any such claim related to any issue of sexual practices , orientation , or reproduction ; or ( C ) any claim based upon equal protection of the laws to the extent such claim is based upon the right to marry without regard to sex or sexual orientation ; and ( 2 ) shall not rely on any judicial decision involving any issue referred to in paragraph [ 3 ]
" This would reverse not only Roe v Wade but Griswold v Connecticut and Lawrence v Texas and every other ruling related to a right to privacy as well .
That means the states could once again outlaw homosexuality and the use of contraception ( and if you do n’t think there are powerful political interests that favor doing both of those things , you have n’t been paying attention ) .
It erases virtually every single church / state ruling in the last century , allowing public schools to once again force students to read the Bible aloud and to recite state - composed and mandated prayers .
That is every bit as crazy as Newt Gingrich ’s absolutely insane anti-judiciary policy proposals .
And it is an absolute deal - breaker for me . " [ 4 ]
Ron Paul does not believe in separation of church and state
The War on Religion by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
As we celebrate another Yuletide season , it ’s hard not to notice that Christmas in America simply does n’t feel the same anymore .
Although an overwhelming majority of Americans celebrate Christmas , and those who do n’t celebrate it overwhelmingly accept and respect our nation ’s Christmas traditions , a certain shared public sentiment slowly has disappeared .
The Christmas spirit , marked by a wonderful feeling of goodwill among men , is in danger of being lost in the ongoing war against religion .
Through perverse court decisions and years of cultural indoctrination , the elitist , secular Left has managed to convince many in our nation that religion must be driven from public view .
The justification is always that someone , somewhere , might possibly be offended or feel uncomfortable living in the midst of a largely Christian society , so all must yield to the fragile sensibilities of the few .
The ultimate goal of the anti-religious elites is to transform America into a completely secular nation , a nation that is legally and culturally biased against Christianity .
This growing bias explains why many of our wonderful Christmas traditions have been lost .
Christmas pageants and plays , including Handel ’s Messiah , have been banned from schools and community halls .
Nativity scenes have been ordered removed from town squares , and even criticized as offensive when placed on private church lawns .
Office Christmas parties have become taboo , replaced by colorless seasonal parties to ensure no employees feel threatened by a “ hostile environment . ”
Even wholly non-religious decorations featuring Santa Claus , snowmen , and the like have been called into question as Christmas symbols that might cause discomfort .
Earlier this month , firemen near Chicago reluctantly removed Christmas decorations from their firehouse after a complaint by some embittered busybody .
Most noticeably , however , the once commonplace refrain of “ Merry Christmas ” has been replaced by the vague , ubiquitous “ Happy Holidays . ”
But what holiday ?
Is Christmas some kind of secret , a word that can not be uttered in public ?
Why have we allowed the secularists to intimidate us into downplaying our most cherished and meaningful Christian celebration ?
The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers .
On the contrary , our Founders ’ political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs .
Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , both replete with references to God , would be aghast at the federal government ’s hostility to religion .
The establishment clause of the First Amendment was simply intended to forbid the creation of an official state church like the Church of England , not to drive religion out of public life .
The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America , with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance .
Throughout our nation ’s history , churches have done what no government can ever do , namely teach morality and civility .
Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong , and hence have little need for external government .
This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion : Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people ’s allegiance , and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state .
Knowing this , the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion , chipping away bit by bit at our nation ’s Christian heritage .
Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war .
Ron Paul - December 30 , 2003
Theology , not Politcs Members of Congress from both political parties outdid themselves last week in heaping praise upon Pope John Paul II in the wake of his passing .
Many spoke at length on the floor of the House of Representatives , and some even flew to Rome for his funeral .
I ’m happy to witness so many politicians honoring a great man of God and peace .
The problem , however , is that so few of them honored him during his lifetime by their actions as legislators .
In fact , most members of Congress support policies that are totally at odds with Catholic teachings .
Just two years ago conservatives were busy scolding the Pope for his refusal to back our invasion of Iraq .
One conservative media favorite even made the sickening suggestion that the Pope was the enemy of the United States because he would not support our aggression in the Middle East .
The Pontiff would not ignore the inherent contradiction in being pro-life and pro-war , nor distort just war doctrine to endorse attacking a nation that clearly posed no threat to America – and conservatives resented it .
September 11th did not change everything , and the Pope understood that killing is still killing .
The hypocritical pro-war conservatives lauding him today have very short memories .
Liberals also routinely denounced the Pope for maintaining that Catholicism , like all religions , has rules that cannot simply be discarded to satisfy the cultural trends of the time .
The political left has been highly critical of the Pope ’s positions on abortion , euthanasia , gay marriage , feminism , and contraception .
Many liberals frankly view Catholicism as an impediment to the fully secular society they hope to create .
Both conservatives and liberals cannot understand that the Pope ’s pronouncements were theological , not political .
He was one of the few humans on earth who could not be bullied or threatened by any government .
He was a man of God , not a man of the state .
He was not a policy maker , but rather a steward of long - established Catholic doctrine .
His mission was to save souls , not serve the political agendas of any nation , party , or politician .
To the secularists , this was John Paul II ’s unforgivable sin – he placed service to God above service to the state .
Most politicians view the state , not God , as the supreme ruler on earth .
They simply cannot abide a theology that does not comport with their vision of unlimited state power .
This is precisely why both conservatives and liberals savaged John Paul II when his theological pronouncements did not fit their goals .
But perhaps their goals simply were not godly .
Unlike most political leaders , the Pope understood that both personal and economic liberties are necessary for human virtue to flourish .
Virtue , after all , involves choices .
Politics and government operate to deny people the freedom to make their own choices .
The Pope ’s commitment to human dignity , grounded in the teachings of Christ , led him to become an eloquent and consistent advocate for an ethic of life , exemplified by his struggles against abortion , war , euthanasia , and the death penalty .
Yet what institutions around the world sanction abortion , war , euthanasia , and the death penalty ?
Governments .
Historically , religion always represented a threat to government because it competes for the loyalties of the people .
In modern America , however , most religious institutions abandoned their independence long ago , and now serve as cheerleaders for state policies like social services , faith - based welfare , and military aggression in the name of democracy .
Few American churches challenge state actions at all , provided their tax - exempt status is maintained .
This is why Washington politicians ostensibly celebrate religion – it no longer threatens their supremacy .
Government has co-opted religion and family as the primary organizing principle of our society .
The federal government is boss , and everybody knows it .
But no politician will ever produce even a tiny fraction of the legacy left by Pope John Paul II .
Ron Paul - April 12 , 2005
Ron Paul does not accept scientific reality of global warming
Ron Paul does not accept the global scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change [ 5 ] .
He has said :
I think some of it is related to human activities , but I do n't think there 's a conclusion yet .
There 's a lot of evidence on both sides of that argument . [ 6 ]
When asked if he considers climate change a major problem threatening civilization , he responded :
Q : " Do you think CO2 is part of the air quality issue ? "
A : " ...CO2 comes from ocean waters and volcanoes ... the degree to where the blame goes deserves discussion ... I think everyone should read both sides of it . "
CO2 does not come from the oceans human activity produces more than 100 times the amount of CO2 compared to volcanoes .[ 8 ] there is no credible scientific discussion over whether recent climate change is due to human activity .
Every national science academy of every major industrialised country on the planet confirms recent climate change is due to human activity . [ 9 ]
What global climate change ?
" We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto , Japan in December , 1997 , and any other similar proposals .
The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment , hinder the advance of science and technology , and damage the health and welfare of mankind .
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide , methane , or other greenhouse gases is causing or will , in the foreseeable future , cause catastrophic heating of the Earth 's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth 's climate . "
- Ron Paul , address to Congress , June 4 , 2009 [ 10 ]
Ron Paul 's anti-regulatory position and what that means
Ron Paul supports the free market , which will bring us marvels of civilization such as :
No minimum wage .
Do you like working for a dollar an hour ?
A dollar a day ?
Closing the border .
Food prices will skyrocket .
No environmental regulations .
Companies will be able to pollute your drinking water and air lawfully .
The horror stories about fracking pollution are allowed because the natural gas strengthens our energy security .
Do you want every industry to have that kind of zero- accountability free reign to poison you in order to fatten their margins ?
Monopolies , everywhere .
Do n't like 6 media conglomerates owning all media in the US ?
Try 3 . Try 1 .
Ron Paul wants to end Medicare and Social Security
Speaking to MSNBC host Cenk Uygur , Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul said if he were elected President of the United States he would try to transition the country off of Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security .

Ron Paul on ' States Rights '
In 1997 , Paul introduced a Constitutional amendment giving states the power to prohibit the destruction of the flag of the United States .
In June 2003 , he voted against a Constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical " desecration " of the flag of the United States .
He believes that prohibiting flag burning is a state power , not a federal power . [ 11 ]
Ron Paul is often claimed as a " man of principal " but the notion that Freedom of Speech , the First Amendment to the Constitution can be suspended or altered state - by - state clearly undermines a fundamental ideal upon which America was founded .
You can not have it both ways .
States rights is typically a scheme that allows legislators to move controversial issues out of the federal venue and into a regional venue that can and will more - easily be manipulated by special interests .
Ron Paul Using Congress to Enforce his religious beliefs
Ron Paul sponsored / introduced HR1094 , the Sanctity of Life Act of 2007 [ 12 ] , and again as HR2533 , The Sanctity of Life Act of 2009 [ 13 ] , bills that stated that " Life begins at conception " , effectively attempting to turn abortion in murder and place it under federal jurisdiction , in addition to being an un-ambiguous attempt to use the United States Government to impose his personal religious beliefs .
Ron Paul on voting records and consistency
Ron Paul on the Constitution and Freedom of Speech / Expression
In opposition to people burning flags in protest of American policy , in 1997 , Ron Paul introduce , House Joint Resolution 80 : to amend the Constitution of the United States to grant the government the right " to prohibit physical destruction of the American flag . " [ 14 ]
Ron Paul was the only member of congress to vote against a ban on lead in children 's toys
Rep. Ron Paul , M.D. , ( R - Texas ) the former Republican and Libertarian Party candidate for president , cast the only vote against banning lead in toys in the House of Representatives : [ 15 ]
Alarmed by a year of recalls targeting millions of tainted toys , the House voted overwhelming Wednesday to ban lead and other dangerous chemicals from items such as jewelry and rubber ducks that could end up in kids ’ mouths .
The legislation also would toughen rules for testing children ’s products and take steps to give more muscle to the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which was criticized last year for its feeble handling of a flood of goods from China deemed hazardous to children .
Even flat - earthers like Rep. Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) , the ranking member of the committee that first passed the ban , were in favor of it .
“ [ Our ] children ’s toys will be tested in the laboratory before they are tested by our children on the living room floors of America , ” Barton said , in a prepared statement .
Racism / Homophobia / Anti-semitism
Ron Paul spoke against giving a congressional gold medal to Rosa Parks because he does n't want to spend $ 30 k of taxpayer money [ 16 ] .
However , Mr. Paul :
1. Ignored the fact that the medal would be paid for by the US Mint Public Enterprise Fund , which is not funded by taxes but by proceeds from producing coinage . [ 17 ]
2 . Cosponsored a bill that created coins for the Boy Scouts , and directed a surcharge back to the BSA . [ 18 ]
3 . Introduced a bill that would give every soldier active during the cold war a medal -- estimated by the DOD to cost $ 240 million -- and passing the cost directly to the taxpayer . [ 19 ]
Ron Paul has published leaflets under his own name in the past that demonize blacks , jews and gays . [ 20 ]
Abortion
Ron Paul supporters are fond of suggesting his voting record does not reflect his religious principals and he keeps those two ideals separate .
This is not the case :
Ron Paul had this to say on the abortion issue :
Abortion on demand is the ultimate State tyranny ; the State simply declares that certain classes of human beings are not persons , and therefore not entitled to the protection of the law .
The State protects the " right " of some people to kill others , just as the courts protected the " property rights " of slave masters in their slaves .
Moreover , by this method the State achieves a goal common to all totalitarian regimes : it sets us against each other , so that our energies are spent in the struggle between State - created classes , rather than in freeing all individuals from the State .
Unlike Nazi Germany , which forcibly sent millions to the gas chambers ( as well as forcing abortion and sterilization upon many more ) , the new regime has enlisted the assistance of millions of people to act as its agents in carrying out a program of mass murder . [ 21 ]
In 2005 , Ron Paul said , " Once we accepted the federalization of abortion law under the 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision , we lost the ability to apply local community standards to ethical issues . " [ 22 ]
Ron Paul authored H.R. 1094 , a bill that declares that " human life shall be deemed to exist from conception , " a standard Christian Right viewpoint . [ 23 ]
This was after he waffled and suggested that " states rights " should determine abortion laws .
He talked of libertarian ideals and then undermined this " freedom " by trying to pass a law declaring a fetus as human on a Federal level , thereby taking away states rights on the issue .
Stem Cell Research
Ron Paul has been consistent in his desire to defund and prohibit stem cell research .
He voted against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 [ 24 ] as well as other similar legislation .
Ron Paul : his agenda in his own words
Many claim Ron Paul just sits on the sidelines and throws rocks .
All he wants to do is end a whole bunch of stuff .
He uses the " States Rights " excuse to end everything the government has accomplished in the last century .
Most of these citations are straight from Ron Paul :

Ron Paul 's world
What would a society look like that followed Ron Paul 's vision ?
Ron Paul 's vision of America is a twisted , perverted version of 18th century ideals .
There would be no monetary economy like what we 're used to , because our entire financial system relies on the Fed moving money around .
Without the Fed , no banks .
Without banks , no economy .
It 's really that simple .
You can reform the Fed ( which is a good thing ) , but you simply cannot abolish it , not without replacing it with something as powerful immediately .
Ron Paul promotes a reactive , il - conceived abandonment of the entire current financial system in favor of a " gold standard " which cannot in actuality be implemented without a complete destruction of the existing economy .
Ron Paul would undo the Civil Rights Movement through his desire to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment , basically legalizing discrimination against individuals with no protection from the federal government .
Without the 14th amendment , States have absolutely no obligation to respect any article of the Constitution .
The 14th amendment was specifically enacted to impose upon the States the obligation to protect your rights .
The 14th amendment is a favorite target of most neo-Confederates ( which include Paul ) , because they know that without it , States could go right back to owning people as slaves .
Ron Paul would eliminate the Sixteenth Amendment , but also the Seventeenth , removing direct elections from America and further marginalizing the actual people he 's supposed to be " protecting . "
Ron Paul claims he would " remove government " and " increase freedom " except , of course , where that conflicts with his own views on abortion , immigration , religion , etc .
Through his elimination of most of the federal government , he would undo years of progress we 've made with immunizations , public health , and public safety , not to mention the economic damage he would do by eliminating the Fed and returning to the gold standard .
The infrastructure of the US would crumble even further than it has , because it is utterly dependent on Federal support for its existence .
Goodbye interstates ( you think private interests would n't turn the whole nation in a spaghetti of toll roads ? ) .
Goodbye federal controls on nuclear and coal - fired power plants ( hello Fukushima ! ) .
Goodbye FBI , ATF and every other National Security agency .
Can you think of a more tempting target for terrorists ?
In short , his view of America is neither reasonable nor an option .
It 's a dystopia wrapped in a sexy layer of " savings , " " deregulation , " and " freedom . "
Underneath , Paul would gut the Constitution and return America to its " progressive " ideals of 200 years ago .
The only saving grace is that there 's likely no way he could do all the things he wants to do without a military coup .
What Can Ron Paul Actually Do As President ?
Are His Campaign Promises Realistic ?
Go onto his website and take a look at how many times it promises he , personally , ' will do ' something .
Now , take a close look at those things .
How many of them exist because of laws ?
Laws can't be changed by any president .
They take a president and a full congress to change .
So those promises , at best are maybes , right ?
Now narrow the filter .
Those things that would require a congress , how many have a snowball 's chance in hell of being passed by this current congress ?
Abolish the fed ?
Nope . Eliminate Income taxes ?
Hell no .
Eliminate whole federal agencies ?
Please .
What are the odds that the 112th congress is going to go along with any of this ?
Even a hypothetical 113th ?
Now look at your realistic handful of promises .
He can radically change the DoD , because the Commander in Chief has nearly all the power there .
He can restructure or remove personnel and effectively end Executive level agencies , but he can't de facto end them because that would require the repeal of the laws that created them , needing congressional assistance .
Then he has to insure , or well hope , since he does n't control state governments , that the states , 50 different states , magically come up with alternatives to the services , protections and regulation these agencies provided and that these likely completely disparate regulation and protection regimes somehow work when interstate commerce is concerned or problems cross state borders .
So say if Mississippi does n't give a crap if you use dioxin , what happens when it goes into the river and kills Louisiana 's wildlife or even citizens ?
Does Louisiana or its citizens sue in federal court ?
We all know how long tort suits and systems of law take to handle disputes , especially environmental ones , which require reams and reams of competing science and experts .
And this is better than an EPA ?
What 's he do to replace the thousands of decent paying jobs he just took from career professional employees ?
The Dept of Education itself is 5,000 employees , and it 's Federal Student Aid department alone oversaw $ 448 billion dollars of grants and loans .
No more FAFSA , no more easy applying for all your grants and loans , you 're on the private credit market now .
We all know how much more secure less predatory and dependable that is , right ?
And that 's before we get to the real nitty gritty , which is the actual moral and ethical stance he takes when it comes to the implications of his ideas .
Forget the political realities of needing one or two branches of government to completely agree and go along with his ideas to have any chance of them succeeding .
Let 's consider the what now seems far out scenario of a President who somehow completely repeals the Civil Rights Act , Americans with Disabilities Act , Family and Medical leave act , Title 9 , hell the whole education part of the United States Code , and basically any law that mandates how states must treat their people .
Is that really the picture you see of America when you think of a ' more perfect union ' ?
Morally , do you want to imprison women who do n't want to bear a child for 9 months ?
Forget that it might be distasteful to you , even wrong , do you want to make it a crime ?
In some places it would be tantamount to murder .
Anti-gay , disabled - unfair , all kinds of laws that we struck down and made illegal to pass would be fair game in some places , even whole states .
Ron Paul 's policies would allow us to create an America where some places might be a paradise of progressive inclusion , and others might be a fortress of repressive laws , with rights stripped all the way down to those and only those provided by the bill of rights and limited only by the constitution .
And these 50 states have to somehow remain a union , with no unifying character .
We saw how that ended once , why would we go back there , ever ?
Now the constitution is a pretty good document , but man , in my eyes , it 's the minimum we 're supposed to do for our citizens .
Knowing America 's past , seeing how many really ugly bills die in state congresses all over this nation and even how many really regressive bills die in the US congress , I shudder to think what some states would do and definitely some localities would do , given free reign from the pesky chains of civil rights laws .
Some places actually have minority issues and I bet it would n't take a but a second for states with immigration issues to have a field day with Mexican - American rights .
Sorry , the man 's full of pipe dreams that can't or wo n't happen , and as a minority , even if they could , what remains scares me .
I have something to lose in this game .
I 'm supposed to trust the states to maintain my rights ?
It took some of them until 1964 to actually insure I was even guaranteed them .
If it were n't for that federal law , I might not have them at all in a few states .
You can go there , but I 'll be damned to hell before I will .
That 's not the America I want to live in .
I do n't know why Reddit has animosity against the man , but this is why I do . [ 25 ]

Ron Paul in - a- nutshell
RP does not believe the First Amendment ( or any of the Amendments for that matter ) applies to states , and that they should be able to discriminate based on sexual preference , gender , race or religion if the local populace agrees .
( See : http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html)
RP voted against a flag burning amendment , but for a law against flag burning in Texas .
He has no problem with government restricting peoples '
Constitutional / free - speech rights , as long as it's the states and not the Feds .
( See : http://www.reasontofreedom.com/statement_on_the_flag_burning_amendment_by_us_rep_ron_paul.html)
RP 's " Bill - of - rights - only - applies - to - the - Federal - Government " - plan means all of the rights protected in the Constitution can be overriden by the states , including the right to bear arms , right to a fair trial and protections against improper search and seizure , abolition of slavery , term limits , women 's suffrage , civil rights , etc .
RP does not believe in church - state separation ( http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Ron_Paul#Ron_Paul_does_not_believe_in_separation_of_church_and_state)
RP claims he would not let his religious beliefs influence his public policy .
But he has twice introduced " The Sanctity of Life Act " which federalizes abortion as murder and says , " life begins at conception " which is clearly based on his evangelical christian ideology .
( See : http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1096:)
RP claims to be a libertarian but imposing his religious ideals upon everyone at the federal level is the antithesis of respect for individual rights .
Even his own bible does n't define life as beginning at conception .
RPs belief in " states rights " means states can restrict peoples ' civil liberties .
RP rejects the theory of evolution as being valid .
It 's bad enough any educated person would reject the overwhelming evidence , but he is a medical doctor !
( See : http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Ron_Paul#Ron_Paul:_Fundamentalist_Christian_Creationist)
RP also does not believe in global climate change and that humans have any impact on the environment .
( See : http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul537.html)
RP wants to neuter the Judicial branch of government and make religious institutions exempt from any Federal rulings , paving the way for churches to be above the government in power .
( See : http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00539:@@@L&summ2=m& )

No more student loans or grants .
No improved educational opportunities for non-rich people .
No standards for equal - educational - access enforced .
No national educational standards set .

( See : http://www.ronpaul.com/2009-05-20/ron-paul-vs-ed-schultz-end-the-department-of-education-and-the-department-of-agriculture/)
RP believes that the United Nations has a secret plan to shut down all churches and convert the world over to an occult religion .
( See video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=X554O6TwiYM
)
Paul fans will follow up on this with a huge barrage of copy - pasted stuff that does NOT contradict these facts .
Ironically , many Paul followers claim he does n't flip - flop , but he continually does , especially when it comes to going back and forth between entirely shutting down whole government departments , and then backpedaling and saying , it 's only " after more moderate things have been done " .
Depending upon who Ron Paul is talking to , his rhetoric is more or less radical , but he 's never backed off his claims of completely shutting down a huge area of government departments and services , and whenever he 's asked about how society would function , his standard response is to evade the question and spew a red herring : " Why do you hate the Constitution ?
None of these things are Constitutional " ( See : http://www.ronpaul.com/2009-05-20/ron-paul-vs-ed-schultz-end-the-department-of-education-and-the-department-of-agriculture/).

C# 4.0 - Named and Optional Parameters - Behind the Scenes Thursday , October 30 , 2008
In my previous post , I talked very briefly about both named and option parameters .
Now , I 'd like to go a little deeper into the subject to see what this looks like underneath the covers .
As before , we 'll look at the limitations as well that we faced in the previous post .
Optional Parameters
First , let 's define our class that will contain our optional parameters .
This will be a reuse of our class that we defined in the last post of the TextBox Info class .
We will define a constructor , just for example sake , with all parameters being optional .
Not that I 'd recommend that , but let 's just at least look at the possibility .
public class TextBoxInfo
{
private readonly string text ;
private readonly float size ;
private readonly float width ;
private readonly Color color ;
public TextBoxInfo(
string text = " " ,
float size = 10 .0 f ,
float width = 50 .0 f ,
Color color = new Color ( ) )
{
this . text = text ;
this .size = size ;
this . width = width ;
this .color = color ;
}
public string
Text { get { return text ; } }
public float Size { get { return size ; } }
public float Width { get { return width ; } }
public Color TextColor { get { return color ; } }
}
The real interesting part of this code will be in the how the constructor looks .
This is where we 'll be setting the default values .
Let 's look through .
NET Reflector to see the generated code for the constructor .
public TextBoxInfo(
[ Optional , DefaultParameterValue ( " " ) ] string text ,
[ Optional , DefaultParameterValue ( 10 f ) ] float size ,
[ Optional , DefaultParameterValue ( 50 f ) ] float width ,
[ Optional ] Color color )
{
this . text = text ;
this .size = size ;
this . width = width ;
this .color = color ;
}
What 's interesting to note is the use of the System .
Runtime .
InteropServices .
OptionalAttribute and the System .Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultParameterValueAttribute .
The OptionalAttribute is used to specify that the parameter is optional , and the DefaultParameterValueAttribute specifies the value should the value not be specified .
Given that our text , size and width are all primitives , we can use the DefaultParameterValueAttribute to specify the default value .
For our color parameter , since it's a complex type , its value cannot be set through optional parameters , therefore , its default value is specified by the Color default constructor .
Let 's compare that implementation to the F# implementation .
type TextBoxInfo ( ? text : string ,
? size : float ,
? width : float ,
?color : Color ) =
let text = defaultArg text " "
let size = defaultArg size 10 .
let width = defaultArg width 50 .
let color =
match color with
| None ->
Color .
Red
| Some c -> c
member x .
Text = text
member x .
FontColor = color
member x .
Width = width
member x .
Size = size
Once again , let 's turn our eyes to the constructor details of the F# implementation .
Opening up Reflector , we 'll take a look at how default values are handled via the constructor .
How does this differ from the C# implementation ?
public TextBoxInfo(
[ OptionalArgument ] Option < string > text ,
[ OptionalArgument ] Option < double > size ,
[ OptionalArgument ] Option < double > width ,
[ OptionalArgument ] Option < Color > color )
{
Program .
TextBoxInfo @ this = this ;
@ this . text@ 5 = text ;
@ this .size@ 5 = size ;
@ this . width@ 5 = width ;
@ this .color@ 5 = color ;
@ this .text@ 7 = Operators.defaultArg< string >( @ this .text@ 5 , " " ) ;
@ this .size@ 8 = Operators.defaultArg< double >( @ this .size@ 5 , 10 .0 ) ;
@ this . width@ 9 = Operators.defaultArg< double >( @ this .width@ 5 , 50 .0 ) ;
Option < Color > option = @ this .color@ 5 ;
@ this .color@ 10 = ( option == null ) ?
Color .
Red : option .
_Some1 ;
}
From the above syntax , you will notice the use of the defaultArg function which sets the value of our member values on those which are simple types .
For more complex situations , we can then use pattern matching to define the default value of our color value .
This is a nice implementation as it allows me to initialize complex types in a rather controlled way as well as the simple types .
One more example I want to look at is the indexed properties and what they look like .
Let 's take an example of a wrapper for the much maligned DataRow object .
I 'll add values for the column name , and optionally the DataRowVersion enum .
The code to wrap should look much like this :
public object this [ string column , DataRowVersion version = DataRowVersion .
Current ]
{
get
{
return this .row [ column , version ] ;
}
}
Popping this open in Reflector once again shows us that the DefaultParameterValueAttribute is set to the DataRowVersion .
Current value , which in this case is 0x200 .
As enums are n't strictly typed as they are in Java , the C# compiler can then turn the enum value into a primitive .
public object get_Item (
string column ,
[ Optional , DefaultParameterValue ( 0x200 ) ] DataRowVersion version )
{
return this .row [ column , version ] ;
}
Having looked this over , let 's move onto the named parameters implementation .
Named Parameters
Named parameters gives us the option of specifying the parameters by name , rather than by absolute position .
This is quite handy when dealing with a method signature with many parameters , and especially ones not needed .
You simply need to look at the managed Microsoft Office Libraries for any further proof of that .
But , you do n't always have to use named parameters when there are optional parameters .
Instead , you can use them pretty much any time you like .
Let 's take our above TextBox Info class and create three instances , and each one will set a different combination of parameters .
static void Main ( string [ ] args )
{
var t1 = new TextBoxInfo (
text : " Hello World " ,
size : 12 .0 f ) ;
var t2 = new TextBoxInfo (
size : 10 .0 f ,
width : 45 .0 f ) ;
var t3 = new TextBoxInfo (
text : " Hi there " ,
width : 50 .0 f ) ;
Console.WriteLine ( t1. Width ) ;
Console.WriteLine( t2.Text ) ;
Console. WriteLine( t3.Size ) ;
}
What I 'm writing out is the default values for each of the parameters I did n't set .
Popping up Reflector once again , let 's look at the generated code .
private static void Main ( string [ ] args )
{
string CS $ 0 $ 0000 = " Hello World " ;
float CS $ 0 $ 0001 = 12 f ;
TextBoxInfo t1 = new TextBoxInfo( CS$ 0 $ 0000 , CS$ 0 $ 0001 , 50 f ) ;
CS$ 0 $ 0001 = 10 f ;
float CS $ 0 $ 0002 = 45 f ;
TextBoxInfo t2 = new TextBoxInfo ( " " , CS $ 0 $ 0001 , CS$ 0 $ 0002 ) ;
CS$ 0 $ 0000 = " Hi there " ;
CS$ 0 $ 0001 = 50 f ;
TextBoxInfo t3 = new TextBoxInfo( CS$ 0 $ 0000 , 10 f , CS$ 0 $ 0001 ) ;
Console.WriteLine ( t1. Width ) ;
Console.WriteLine( t2.Text ) ;
Console. WriteLine( t3.Size ) ;
}
What the compiler is doing behind the scenes is creating inline instances of our named parameters and feeding it to the constructor .
As you will notice , it 's feeding the named instances as well as putting in the default value that we specified in the method signature .
Nothing really special about it .
Very interesting to see how some of these challenges are handled underneath the covers .
Wrapping it Up
As you can see , named and optional parameters can be very handy to use , whether in some connected fashion or not .
We can use these in combination to deal with other languages and libraries in a rather flexible fashion .
It 's about time C# 4.0 caught up in this regard .
I have a wish list continued for C# 5.0 which still includes syntactic sugar for allowing for mixins , discriminated unions , tuples , pattern matching , immutable types , and so on .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - Secretive North Korea said on Monday it would all but seal its border with the South a week before heading into talks with its neighbor and other regional powers that are pressing it to give up nuclear weapons .

The tension on the divided Korean peninsula has been escalating since conservative South Korean President Lee Myung - bak took office in February promising to invest heavily in the impoverished North on condition it moves to end development of an atomic arsenal .
The border closure was the first step “ to be taken in connection with the ever more undisguised anti-DPRK ( North Korea ) confrontational racket of the south Korean puppet authorities , ” North Korea ’s KCNA news agency said .
But the latest move appeared more saber - rattling than substance as the North will continue to let in some South Koreans to manage an industrial zone just across the border , its one significant economic relationship with the South .
“( The North ) never said it would halt production or expel staff related to the production process .
So even in the worst case of operating with only half of the staff , we think there wo n’t be any problem in production , ” said Lee Eun-suk , an official at Shinwon Corp , which has clothing factories at Kaesong .
The increasingly angry rhetoric follows an end to South Korean largesse to the North since Lee came to power .
Lee made clear during the weekend he would not back down in the face of threats by the North , which accuses him of trying to reignite war between the Koreas and warned last month it was ready to reduce its wealthy neighbor to rubble .
South Korea demanded the North call off the move , saying it would be a serious blow to their fledgling economic ties and a serious setback for their already difficult relationship .
INTERNATIONAL TALKS
Years of on - off negotiations between the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States are stumbling over demands the North allow verification of steps it has taken to disarm .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said on Monday sampling at North Korea ’s nuclear facilities was part of an agreement between the United States and North Korea that Washington expected to be finalized at the December 8 . international meeting .
“ It is part of the agreement , and we hope and would expect , that the verification protocol would be formalized ... at the next heads of delegation meeting , ” McCormack told reporters .
“ Regardless of which form it may be in , it is an agreement , that does n’t change it , ” he added .
McCormack also spoke disapprovingly of North Korea ’s move to cut off contacts with the South .
“ We ’ve always encouraged direct discussions and direct interaction between the North and South .
The North can only benefit from greater contact with the rest of the world , including South Korea , ” he said .
In a 2005 deal , North Korea agreed to stop trying to develop nuclear weapons , in exchange for massive aid and a chance to end its international isolation .
But the negotiations have hit repeated stalemates and analysts say the nearer the international community gets to demanding complete nuclear disarmament the more difficult the negotiations will become .

LEVERAGE
The North tested a nuclear device two years ago but it has never been clear how successful it was or whether Pyongyang has the capacity to launch a nuclear attack .
Some analysts says North Korean leader Kim Jong - il will never give up the only real leverage his destitute country has to win concessions from the outside world without threatening his tight grip on power .
But there has been speculation in recent months Kim may have suffered serious illness , although officials in the region say he appears to still be in control .
North Korea denies the 66 - year - old leader is ailing .
North Korea warned nearly two weeks ago it would end traffic across the heavily armed border with its wealthy neighbor from December 1 , but this is the first time it has given details of what it would do .
It will also suspend all tours to its border city of Kaesong , near the Kaesong industrial park run by South Korea , and halt rail traffic across the border .
While about 200 tourists a day visit Kaesong city , the rail link reopened after 50 years last year has been largely a symbolic gesture and carries almost no cargo .

Yeah , it is n’t a hack .
It is n’t even a build article .

San Antonio Generating Gas from Sewage
September 11th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
San Antonio , Texas is making use of its 140,000 tons of sewage generated each year to capture methane gas .
The city ’s utility board of trustees approved a contract this week to sell 900,000 cubic feet of natural gas derived from the sewage each day to Ameresco , a Massachusetts energy services company .
Though methane is a potent greenhouse gas , it has a variety of uses .
The substance can be used for fuel in gas turbines or steam boilers , and it is also used as vehicle fuel in the form of compressed natural gas .
Additionally , NASA is researching methane as a potential rocket fuel .
According to Steve Claus , the chief operating officer of the water system , San Antonio ’s sewage generates 1.5 million cubic feet of gas each day — enough to fill seven commercial blimps or 1,250 tanker trucks .
The facilities needed for the project will be ready in about two years .
San Antonio will get $ 250,000 a year for the methane — a sum that I hope will go towards more renewable energy efforts in the area .

In response to a question about Colin Powell ’s endorsement , John McCain says he ’s proud five former Secretaries of State have endorsed him .
Then he forgets the name of the fifth one …
Anyone can forget a name .
And this guy ’s under an amount of physical fatigue and emotional stress that would challenge men half his age .
( As much as I believe that McCain ’s age is showing , this point is worth remembering . )
But if you watch the video , after he lists off the four names again to jog his memory and then just is n’t able to remember the fifth , he lets out a heavy sigh and with what I ’d describe as a resigned smile , says “ and one other . ”
Not sure what to say but that it seemed emblematic of the moment .
This spring , disaster loomed in the global food market .
Precipitous increases in the prices of staples like rice ( up more than a hundred and fifty per cent in a few months ) and maize provoked food riots , toppled governments , and threatened the lives of tens of millions .
But the bursting of the commodity bubble eased those pressures , and food prices , while still high , have come well off the astronomical levels they hit in April .
For Americans , the drop in commodity prices has put a few more bucks in people ’s pockets ; in much of the developing world , it may have saved many from actually starving .
So did the global financial crisis solve the global food crisis ?
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
Temporarily , perhaps .
But the recent price drop does n’t provide any long - term respite from the threat of food shortages or future price spikes .
Nor has it reassured anyone about the health of the global agricultural system , which the crisis revealed as dangerously unstable .
Four decades after the Green Revolution , and after waves of market reforms intended to transform agricultural production , we ’re still having a hard time insuring that people simply get enough to eat , and we seem to be more vulnerable to supply shocks than ever .
It was n’t supposed to be this way .
Over the past two decades , countries around the world have moved away from their focus on “ food security ” and handed market forces a greater role in shaping agricultural policy .
Before the nineteen - eighties , developing countries had so - called “ agricultural marketing boards , ” which would buy commodities from farmers at fixed prices ( prices high enough to keep farmers farming ) , and then store them in strategic reserves that could be used in the event of bad harvests or soaring import prices .
But in the eighties and nineties , often as part of structural - adjustment programs imposed by the I.M.F. or the World Bank , many marketing boards were eliminated or cut back , and grain reserves , deemed inefficient and unnecessary , were sold off .
In the same way , structural - adjustment programs often did away with government investment in and subsidies to agriculture — most notably , subsidies for things like fertilizers and high - yield seeds .
The logic behind these reforms was simple : the market would allocate resources more efficiently than government , leading to greater productivity .
Farmers , instead of growing subsidized maize and wheat at high cost , could concentrate on cash crops , like cashews and chocolate , and use the money they made to buy staple foods .
If a country could n’t compete in the global economy , production would migrate to countries that could .
It was also assumed that , once governments stepped out of the way , private investment would flood into agriculture , boosting performance .
And international aid seemed a more efficient way of relieving food crises than relying on countries to maintain surpluses and food - security programs , which are wasteful and costly .
This “ marketization ” of agriculture has not , to be sure , been fully carried through .
Subsidies are still endemic in rich countries and poor , while developing countries often place tariffs on imported food , which benefit their farmers but drive up prices for consumers .
And in extreme circumstances countries restrict exports , hoarding food for their own citizens .
Nonetheless , we clearly have a leaner , more market - friendly agricultural system than before .
It looks , in fact , a bit like global manufacturing , with low inventories ( wheat stocks are at their lowest since 1977 ) , concentrated production ( three countries provide ninety per cent of corn exports , and five countries provide eighty per cent of rice exports ) , and fewer redundancies .
Governments have a much smaller role , and public spending on agriculture has been cut sharply .
The problem is that , while this system is undeniably more efficient , it ’s also much more fragile .
Bad weather in just a few countries can wreak havoc across the entire system .
When prices spike as they did this spring ( for reasons that now seem not entirely obvious ) , the result is food shortages and malnutrition in poorer countries , since they are far more dependent on imports and have few food reserves to draw on .
And , while higher prices and market reforms were supposed to bring a boom in agricultural productivity , global crop yields actually rose less between 1990 and 2007 than they did in the previous twenty years , in part because in many developing countries private - sector agricultural investment never materialized , while the cutbacks in government spending left them with feeble infrastructures .
These changes did not cause the rising prices of the past couple of years , but they have made them more damaging .
The old emphasis on food security was undoubtedly costly , and often wasteful .
But the redundancies it created also had tremendous value when things went wrong .
And one sure thing about a system as complex as agriculture is that things will go wrong , often with devastating consequences .
If the just - in - time system for producing cars runs into a hitch and the supply of cars shrinks for a while , people can easily adapt .
When the same happens with food , people go hungry or even starve .
That does n’t mean that we need to embrace price controls or collective farms , and there are sensible market reforms , like doing away with import tariffs , that would make developing - country consumers better off .
But a few weeks ago Bill Clinton , no enemy of market reform , got it right when he said that we should help countries achieve “ maximum agricultural self - sufficiency . ”
Instead of a more efficient system , we should be trying to build a more reliable one .

ShamWow has a pretty amazing commercial , I actually got excited the first time I saw it
Just in case you have n't seen the commercial , watch it here , it 's hilarious .
After seeing the commercial about five times , I decided I 'd order them and try them out and see if they lived up to the hype .
So I created my own ShamWow review .
I 've had good success with some as seen on TV products in the past , but before it even arrived , I assumed the worse for ShamwWow .
When it arrived , however , I was very surprised at the quality .
When I first received my super - towels , the first thing I wanted to do was reenact the commercial and soak up a bunch of water from a bowl .
Things look a lot nicer on TV with camera angles and video editing , but my little test worked surprisingly well .
The little towel actually soaked up a ton of water .
The next thing I tried was soaking up soda from the carpet .
I didnâ€™t , of course , the carpet in my living room , just in case it didnâ€™t work , but I tried it on a scrap piece of carpet I had sitting in the garage .
It was fantastic , the ShamWow pulled up the cola before it had a chance to stain the carpet .
If I catch the spill soon enough , I bet I 'll never have a stained carpet again .
The ShamWow was extremely absorbent , but I also wanted to see how durable they were .
I have washed a few of the towels in my washing machine twice and they still seem to hold up really well .
I didnâ€™t pay any attention to the ShamWow guy and his 10 - year warranty until I saw that they might actually last that long .
Having a ShamWow towel in my kitchen has saved me a bunch of money on paper towels .
It also cut down on the amount of garbage I throw out .
Which I love since it 's so good for the environment .
ShamWows really do work well and , as dorky as it is , I honestly said " wow " the first time I used one my ShamWow towels .
Do not order ShamWow from TV because you can find them cheaper online .
You can order ShamWow online

We all know about the Confederate states leaving the Union .
But that was far from the only secessionist movement in American history .
Here are some rebellious regions you wo n't find in too many history books .
1. The Kingdom of Beaver Island
Beaver Island , a small island in Lake Michigan , became the home of Mormon leader James Strang and his followers — called Strangites — in 1848 .
Two years later , Strang declared himself king of the church — complete with crown , scepter , robe , and a harem of 15 wives .
However , most of the island 's inhabitants were his followers , so he essentially became King of Beaver Island .
The power got to his head , and he began forcing his rule onto the non-believers , causing some violence between the two factions .
In 1856 , the USS Michigan pulled into the harbor and invited Strang aboard .
As he was walking towards the ship , he was shot in the back by disgruntled followers , who then ran up the gangplank and escaped .
Adding to the mysterious circumstances , the assassins were set ashore on nearby Mackinac Island and never charged for their crime .
Shortly after the assassination , angry mobs from surrounding islands eventually forced the Strangites from their homes , thus ending the short - lived Kingdom of Beaver Island .
2. The State of Superior
Concern over a perceived lack of interest from the Michigan state government , the people of the Upper Peninsula ( U.P. ) , affectionately known as " Yoopers , "  have been trying to secede and form the State of Superior since as far back as 1897 .
The movement gained momentum after 1957 when a bridge connecting the U.P. region to Lower Michigan made it easier for southern " Trolls "  ( people who live " below the bridge "  ) and Yoopers to mingle .
This animosity continued into the mid-1980s , when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the state for a secession request .
However , the number was shy of the 36,000 required , and the request subsequently denied .
The secessionist drive lives on today , as numerous grassroots organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent U.P.
Until that day comes , though , the Yoopers and Trolls will just have to try to get along .
3. The Great Republic of Rough and Ready
Rough and Ready , California , was a mining town founded in 1849 by the Rough and Ready Company of Wisconsin .
As the town 's population rapidly exploded to 3,000 , lawlessness was on the rise — and the U.S. government was not much help squelching the rampant crime .
Additionally , a new federal tax on mining operations added fuel to the region 's civil unrest .
Seeing little support from Washington , on April 7 , 1850 , the townspeople voted to secede from the Union .
But just three months later , as the Fourth of July approached , The Great Republic of Rough and Ready wanted to have a celebration ( which seems odd considering they were no longer , technically , Americans ) .
When nearby Nevada City would n't sell liquor to " foreign miners , "  it was decided that maybe America was n't so bad after all .
The townspeople voted themselves back into the Union on the very same day and the party went off as planned .
4. The Conch Republic
In the early - 1980s , the U.S. Border Patrol set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the Florida Keys in an effort to stop illegal drugs and immigrants .
The time to check everyone 's identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20 - mile traffic jam that turned tourists away , thus damaging the economy in the Keys .
After numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed , on April 23 , 1982 , Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the Florida Keys were seceding from the Union .
Moments later , now - Prime Minister Wardlow symbolically declared war on the U.S. by breaking a stale piece of Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform .
One minute later , Wardlow turned to the Admiral in charge of the U.S. Naval Base at Key West and surrendered , thus ending the Conch Republic 's Civil Rebellion .
He then immediately asked for $ 1 billion in federal aid to help rebuild his war - torn nation 's economy .
While officially the Republic only existed for one minute , the tongue - in - cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on .
Today you can buy Conch Republic citizen and diplomatic passports ( both of which have been used for international travel , though they are not intended to be official documents ) and even an official flag of the republic ( complete with the awesome motto , " We seceded where others failed "  ) .
The community has even minted a series of limited edition one - conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the Keys .
5 . The State of Absaroka
Feeling that the Democratic southern half of Wyoming was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state , a secessionist movement was launched by northern Republicans in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population .
This state , Absaroka — so named after the nearby mountain range — was to be made up of northern Wyoming , southeast Montana , and the western region of South Dakota .
While the secessionist movement was never very large or pursued through legal channels , that did n't stop A. R. Swickard , the street commissioner of Sheridan , WY , from appointing himself governor of the " state . " 
The movement went so far as to press Absaroka license plates and crown a Miss Absaroka beauty queen .
Absaroka could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary , King Haakon VII of Norway ( though he was officially visiting Wyoming and just happened to be in Absaroka ) .
Despite all of the hoopla , the state never came to be , and now , so many years later , the intent of the secessionist movement is in question .
Some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new state , while others say it was just a fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times .
6 . The State of Jefferson
Northern California and southern Oregon have been trying to merge since 1852 .
The attempts have been met with mixed results , though the " State of Jefferson "  movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen .
The region felt it was being ignored by their respective state legislatures , so in response the people created the " State of Jefferson Citizen 's Committee "  to explore the possibilities of secession .
The group began stopping cars on Highway 99 to hand out the state 's " Proclamation of Independence , "  a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed .
To help rally their cause , they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner 's pan with two black X's inside , representing the double - cross they felt the Oregon and California state governments had pulled .
On December 4 , 1941 , Judge John Childs was elected governor of Jefferson in the state 's temporary capital of Yreka , CA .
The event was filmed by numerous newsreel companies who were set to air the footage during the week of December 8th .
History had other plans , as the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor the day before the big premiere .
Driven by a sense of national obligation , the Jefferson secession was put aside and never really regained momentum .
While the official movement might have died out , the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts , with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of Jefferson .
7. The McDonald Territory
Noel , Missouri , located in McDonald County in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State , has been a popular tourist destination for many years .
Therefore , when the Missouri State Highway Commission left Noel off their annual " Family Vacationland "  map in 1961 , the region was not happy pleased .
To display their dissatisfaction , McDonald County drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature , declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory .
The county went so far as to elect officials , form a territorial militia , and even printed up visas that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory .
Perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area .
While most agree that the secession was done purely for publicity , the state of Missouri was n't necessarily happy about the type of publicity it was garnering .
So in order to end this mock rebellion , the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for McDonald County , all current state employees would be fired , and all state funding would be withheld .
Needless to say , McDonald Territory surrendered and returned to being simply McDonald County , Missouri , once again .
And here 's one more secessionist movement recently covered here on the _floss :
8. Alaska
For decades , a well - organized separatist movement has campaigned to turn America 's largest state into its own nation .
The bitterness dates back to 1958 , when Alaska 's citizens were given a simple yes - or - no vote on statehood .
Many
Alaskans felt they were denied more options on the issue , prompting a land developer named Joe Vogler to organize a re-vote that would offer Alaskans four possibilities — remain a territory , become a state , take commonwealth status , or become a separate nation .
Using the vote as his platform , Vogler ran for governor in 1974 — and soon made a habit of it .
With colorful slogans such as , " I 'm an Alaskan , not an American .
I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions , "  Vogler spearheaded the Alaskan Independence Party ( AIP ) , and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote .
More surprisingly , former U.S. interior secretary Wally Hickel got elected governor on the AIP ticket in 1990 .
Unfortunately for the party , Hickel only ran on the ticket because he lost the Republican primary .
Never a supporter of the plebiscite idea , Hickel left the AIP and rejoined the Republicans in 1994 .
Today , the AIP continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide .
And in 2006 , Alaska took part in the first - ever North American Secessionist Convention , joining other groups from Vermont , Hawaii , and the South .
As for Vogler , he was murdered in 1993 — reportedly the result of an argument over a business deal .
On a brighter note , honoring his wish to never be buried in U.S. soil , Vogler was laid to rest in Canada 's Yukon Territory .

The George Costanza Candy Identification Quiz
“ Obviously you do n’t want to do something to lose votes , ” said Senator Kent Conrad , Democrat of North Dakota , who was among Senate Democrats who huddled Tuesday to discuss possible alterations in the proposal .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi was noncommital about the new Senate plan Tuesday night , but other Democrats said it might be difficult to reject given the crisis and the array of tax breaks .
“ The Senate will vote tomorrow night , and the Congress will work its will , ” Ms. Pelosi said . .
House officials spent much of Tuesday considering their own changes , including an extension of unemployment pay and a $ 1,000 tax credit for less affluent homeowners .
But those plans are not likely to advance given the Senate decision .
While the Senate left the door open slightly to other additions to the bill , such revisions would need the agreement of the full Senate , and the House proposals were likely to be blocked by Senate Republicans .
“ Opening this up all over again to other things may doom it , ” Mr. Dodd cautioned .
The Senate proposal would cost more than $ 100 billion and extend and expand many individual and business tax breaks , including tax credits for the production and use of renewable energy sources , like solar energy and wind power .
The bill would also extend the business tax credit for research and development , expand the child tax credit , protect millions of families from the alternative minimum tax and provide tax relief to victims of recent floods , tornadoes and severe storms .
Members of the House and the Senate said the bill would create tens of thousands of jobs and reduce the nations ’ dependence on foreign oil .
But the two chambers have been at odds over whether and how to offset the cost of extending the many tax breaks covered by the legislation .
The major obstacle has been Representative Hoyer of Maryland and other centrist Democrats .
October 1893
Recent news stories describing members of the Texas senate fleeing to New Mexico to avoid being counted for a quorum bring to mind traditions of “ quorum busting ” within the U.S. Senate .
The framers of the Constitution sought to prevent such behavior by providing that a minority of members may “ compel ” absent colleagues to attend .
But the Constitution leaves it up to each chamber to determine precisely how .
For its first eighty years , the ever - collegial Senate adopted no rules to enforce attendance .
It simply provided that no member may be absent without the Senate ’s permission and that the sergeant at arms could be sent to round up missing members , without actually arresting them .
As one senator explained , “ It has always been supposed that a Senator acting upon his honor would report himself when his attendance was requested . ”
In 1877 , in response to proliferating filibusters that employed tactics designed to keep the Senate from attaining the 51 percent quorum needed to conduct business , the body amended its rules to allow the sergeant at arms , upon receiving Senate orders , to arrest members .
But what happened if senators , sitting in the chamber , responded to a quorum call and then refused to vote on the legislation before them ?
During a major filibuster in October 1893 , senators demanded the yeas and nays for a vote , but then remained silent when the clerk called their names .
The presiding officer announced that the necessary majority had not voted , even though there were enough senators in the chamber to make a quorum .
When that officer again ordered the clerk to call the roll to determine if a quorum was present , a majority of members answered .
But when the roll - call on the pending measure was then taken , the filibusterers declined to vote .
In one frustrating forty - hour - long session , this tactic produced thirty - nine quorum calls , but only four votes .
Four years later , in 1897 , the Senate agreed to a procedure that basically ended this delaying game .
This prompted a return to the tactic staying away from the chamber .
Over the following decades , the Senate occasionally directed its sergeant at arms to arrest members .
But the first openly physical act of compulsion did not occur until 1988 .
On February 24 , 1988 , in an attempt to establish a quorum on a campaign finance reform bill , Capitol police carried Oregon Republican Senator Robert Packwood into the chamber feet first at 1:17 a.m .
Can Texas match that ?
Elsewhere , couples held ceremonies on beachfronts and in backyards and living rooms .
“ We kind of said Proposition 8 was like our version of getting knocked up , ” said Benjamin Pither , 28 , who married his high school sweetheart , Joseph Greaves , on Sunday at Mr. Greaves ’s parents ’ house in Santa Rosa .
“ We both liked the idea of marriage , but we wanted to do it in our own time .
But when it looked like Proposition 8 might pass , we realized that we would regret it if we did n’t take the opportunity . ”
Some couples traveled from afar to make Monday the big day .
Allison and Rose , a lesbian couple from Tampa , Fla. , said they had come to San Francisco to marry on the advice of friends who suspect that Florida will pass its own constitutional ban on Tuesday on same - sex marriage .
The couple , who said they might relocate if Florida passed its ban , did not want their last names used because of fears that they would face discrimination at home .
“ It is n’t like San Francisco , ” Rose said .
While defeat of the California ballot measure would probably quell debate — at least for a time — over allowing same - sex unions in the state , it is expected that a victory would lead to a second round of legal wrangling over the validity of the thousands of marriages performed since June , when a State Supreme Court decision legalizing same - sex marriages took effect .
California ’s attorney general , Jerry Brown , has said he believes that the marriages will remain valid , but Geoff Kors , the executive director of Equality California , a gay rights group that opposes Proposition 8 , said he expected challenges .
“ It would n’t surprise me that people trying to eliminate constitutional rights would try to annul or divorce people that are married , ” said Mr. Kors , who expressed optimism that the ballot measure would fail .
Supporters of the ban say no rights would be infringed by its passage but suggest that the California Supreme Court will “ have to deal with the mess that it made ” by allowing the marriages in the first place , said Sonja Eddings Brown , a spokeswoman for Protect Marriage , the leading group behind Proposition 8 .
But he was n’t losing because of race .
He was losing because an unpopular gun control initiative and an aggressive Republican absentee ballot program generated hundreds of thousands of Republican votes no pollster anticipated , giving Mr. Deukmejian a narrow victory .

This is not to say that race was n’t an issue ; it was in 1982 and it has been since .
But to those who keep citing the Bradley effect  not so fast .
It ’s more complicated than you think .
As we ’re on the subject , we should free Tom Bradley ’s name from an association he would have abhorred .
After all , he practiced the sort of politics whose goal was to bring people together , not to play up their differences .
He was the opposite of the “ Us vs. Them ” politics so often cited as demonstrating the Bradley effect .
I worked for Bradley in his 1973 mayoral campaign against Sam Yorty , the incumbent .
Bradley was holding his own .
But a key group , Jewish voters , was up for grabs .
One Sunday , I drove Bradley to a banquet with a Jewish group .
Walking in , I noticed many men wearing yarmulkes .
I had one in my jacket and gave it to Bradley .
He put it in his pocket .
When the event began , Yorty was called to the podium and given a yarmulke , which he put on .
Then Bradley was called up .
When offered a yarmulke , he said , “ I have my own , ” reached into his pocket , took it out and put it on .
The response ?
Laughter , applause , smiles .
It sent a message not of pandering  “ I am one of you ”  but rather , “ We are all in this together . ”

Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN's " Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull " at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays .
She delivered this commentary during the " Cutting through the Bull " segment of Wednesday night 's broadcast .
Campbell Brown says women in the public eye face a double - standard when it comes to appearance .
( CNN ) --
There 's been a lot of sniping and a lot of stories Wednesday about Gov. Sarah Palin 's clothes .
Politico.com reports that the Republican National Committee spent more than $ 150,000 on clothes , hair and make - up for Palin on the campaign trail .
Now , these are not your tax dollars .
This is money given by Republican donors to the RNC .
But the report questions whether it is legal to use campaign cash for quote " personal use . "
My issue ?
There is an incredible double - standard here , and we are ignoring a very simple reality .
Women are judged based on their appearance far , far more than men .
That is a statement of fact .
There has been plenty of talk and plenty written about Sarah Palin 's jackets , her hair and her looks .
Sound familiar ?
Watch Campbell Brown ' Cutting Through the Bull ' »
There was plenty of talk and plenty written about Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's looks , hair and pantsuits .
Compare that with the attention given to Sen. Barack Obama's $ 1,500 suits or Sen. John McCain's $ 520 Ferragamo shoes .
There is no comparison .
Women get scrutinized based on appearance far more than men .
And look , I speak from experience here .
When I wear a bad outfit on the air , I get viewer e-mail complaining about it .
A lot of e-mail .
Seriously .
When Wolf Blitzer wears a not - so - great tie , how much e-mail do you think he gets ?
My point is for women , unfortunately , appearance is part of the job .
If Wolf or Anderson Cooper shows up on the air without makeup , you think you would even notice ?
I show up without makeup ?
Trust me , you 'll notice .
This does n't just apply to TV .
All women in the public eye deal with this issue .
And it is for this reason that I think the RNC should help Palin pay for clothes , hair and makeup .
It is part of the job .
Now , you may think , that 's an awful lot of money to spend on clothes , hair and makeup .
Or you may complain , as some have , that it 's hypocritical to sell yourself as a " small - town hockey mom " when you are wearing designer clothes .
That 's fine , just do n't ignore the fact that there is a double - standard here .
iReport.com : Palin ' does n't dress like any hockey moms I know '
And personally I think in this campaign , with so much at stake , this is a peripheral issue .
I , myself , have raised plenty of questions about Sarah Palin , much to the annoyance of the McCain campaign .
But those questions have been about her qualifications and experience , never her appearance .
Let 's keep the focus on what really matters here .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .

The world 's first WALKING house designed to beat the floods
Designers have unveiled the " ultimate property " that they say will provide a solution to beating the floods - a WALKING house .
The property has been built on six hydraulic legs and was designed by art collective N55 in Copenhagen , Denmark , who worked in conjunction with engineers in Massachusetts , U.S .
The 10ft high home is solar and wind powered and can stroll at walking pace across all terrains .
Designers say it provides a solution to the problem of rising water levels as the house can simply walk away from floods .
The first prototype of the walking house which offers a unique solution to future housing needs
Like normal homes , it comes equipped with a living room , kitchen , toilet , bed and wood stove .
However , the house can walk thanks to a mainframe computer which controls the legs .
Helen Robinson of the Wysing Arts Centre said ; ' This is far more than a caravan .
It 's all about sustainable living - it can sustain a life for many years .
The computer controlled pod can move across all terrain at walking speed
' It may seem radical but it could be a solution to land use in the near future . '
The pod will take its maiden stroll around rural Cambridgeshire at the Wysing Arts Centre in Bourn later this week .
The prototype cost £ 30,000 to build , including materials and time , but the designers believe it could be constructed for a lot less .
Helen said : ' For this to be a plausible alternative it would have to come down in price .
' After all it is neither a mansion or a gimmick .
It is a recognisable alternative for people on a low income . '
The first time I got married , I let everyone down on the `til - death - do - us - part clause .
I was 20 when we were engaged , 21 when we wed .
My bride was a year younger .
We were n't quite as innocent as Juliet and her Romeo , but we had their naïve faith in the transcendent power of romance .
And then there I was standing in a county courthouse , asking a judge to discharge me from my vows .
I was 22 .
I 'm not sure her parents were n't still paying for the wedding .
I wandered some , and learned the truly awful taste of loneliness and loss .
I know to be careful in what I ask , but Lord , give me death before you make me lonely .
And then , on another summer 's day , as I made my way through the reception line at a friend 's wedding , I met a young woman .
She was a bridesmaid , intrigued no doubt by the nerve I displayed in wearing , with my seersucker suit , a truly hideous denim tie .
Maybe she just felt , as mercifully women sometimes do , that somebody had to take this puppy home .
We married .
This time it took .
I 'll stipulate , and she 'll tell you , it was n't easy .
There were rows and tears and worst of all , cold silences .
She 'll never forgive me , and rightly so , for some of my selfishness .
And there was a time , after our first child was born , when we lived apart for several months , ostensibly as part of a work - related separation , each wondering if we would reunite .
We stuck .
Together , in tests of sacrifice and sharing , we learned the relentless insistence of love and earned its gifts .
And if you ask me about my wife , I will tell you she saved my life .
Last week the president asked us to defend the sanctity of marriage .
I was raised in a church and taught in Christian schoolrooms that homosexual behavior is sinful .
I have kin who still worship in that congregation , in my old hometown , where my parents ' names are carved on the church wall and they rest in the nearby cemetery .
And I savor the unparalleled memories of my bride at the altar , lips red , glowing skin , lovely in white ; the way her dress twirled around her legs as we danced at the reception , the terrifyingly wonderful thrill of holding her in my arms .
In a time when so many good and lasting things are lost to a soulless modernity , can't we preserve this last tradition ?
Ca n't we keep it the way it has always been : husband and wife , bride and groom ?
` Til death do us part ?
And that 's where I stumble : ` Til death do us part .
It 's the vow that makes marriage so singular — when we stand before God , our friends and families and make that unyielding commitment to the grave .
I 've uttered those words twice , and I remember the shame of failing as much as I cherish the wisdom I gained , and the blessings I 've received , in succeeding .
Last week I spoke with Ed Gillespie , the Republican National Committee chairman , who shares my religious tradition .
He seems like a good man ; so do George Bush and John Kerry , all of whom say that marriage should be just for man and woman .
Gillespie has dear friends who are gay , but he believes we need to stop the " activists " who would force change upon us , insult our faiths and defame ceremony .
I asked him :
If his gay friends cannot marry each other , whom can they marry ?
He stammered a bit and said they are free to join in lasting " relationships . "
But the real answer , the bottom line he could not bring himself to utter , is : " no one . "
Los Angeles Unveils World 's Largest Solar Plan
November 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
San Francisco is usually designated the green capital of California , but now Los Angeles solar is trying to take the City by the Bay ’s crown with the world ’s largest solar plan .
Yesterday , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced a long - range plan to gather enough solar power to meet 10 percent of LA ’s energy needs by 2020 .
This will be a major upgrade for the city , which currently derives less than 1 percent of its energy from solar power .
The ambitious plan requires enough solar panels to produce 1,280 MW of power .
Villaraigosa ’s plan will require the use of both public and private facilities to generate power — and will cost LA residents approximately 2 dollars a month once it is completed .
The majority of the plan ’s power ( 500 MW ) will come from private facilities in the Mojave Desert , while 380 MW of power will come from small programs .
Despite the good intentions behind the solar plan , critics worry that the measure will increase the price of solar energy .
However , pricing may even out with coal when a carbon tax is passed in the United States .

Henry Blake : Pierce ….
Hawkeye Pierce :
What is it ?
What ?
Blake : I would n’t try to leave camp .
Hawkeye : Wha — I ’m under arrest ?
Blake : I did n’t say that .
You ’re restricted .
Hawkeye :
That means I ’m under arrest .
Blake :
Not at all , you ’re only restricted up to the point where , er — where , er — you ’re under arrest .
Hawkeye : Henry , what ’s happened to you ?
Did you sneak off behind our backs and enlist ?
You ’re regular Army now !
Blake :
Sit down Pierce , that ’s an order !
Hawkeye :
You ’re forcing me to stand .
Blake : Please .
Hawkeye :
That ’s an order I can take .
A key exchange between Lt. Col. Henry Blake and B.F. " Hawkeye " Pierce , from the M* A * S*H episode " For the Good of the Outfit . "
Government , as we must never forget , is force .
And as Simone Weil so memorably observed , force is that mysterious influence " that turns anybody who is subjected to it into a thing .
Exercised to the limit , it turns man into a thing in the most literal sense : it makes a corpse out of him . "
Every government function , no matter how mundane or apparently harmless , carries with it the implied ( and often overt ) use of lethal force against those who do not submit .
Stefan Molyneux perceptively describes this as the principle of the " Gun in the room " :
Whenever anybody refers to the supposed virtue of a given government undertaking , Molyneux sagely observes , the central question is not whether the end is desirable , but rather " whether I am allowed to disagree with you without getting shot . "
Not every government functionary carries a gun and a license to kill other human beings .
But every government functionary collaborates closely with those who are thus equipped to compel the rest of us to submit .
The people in question are readily identifiable by the blue , brown , or black clothing they wear , which is usually accessorized with a conspicuous piece of chintzy costume jewelry called a " badge . "
At some point or another , it becomes obvious to everyone save those hopelessly in the thrall of official propaganda that the central purpose of law enforcement bodies is not to protect private property * , but rather to extract revenue for the State .
Granted , police agencies are advertised as a way of defending private property from the depredations of private criminals , and many individual police officers have carried out that function with courage and compassion .
But that is not the central institutional purpose of such entities ; it is an ancillary function that provides some limited benefits to society .
Besides , as Albert Jay Nock observed , government is n’t interested in punishing or preventing crime , but rather in establishing and preserving a criminal monopoly .
The order of priorities that government law enforcement today can be appreciated in this contrast :
Under existing judicial precedents , a police officer cannot be held criminally or civilly liable for failing to come to the aid of an individual citizen whose person and property are under criminal attack .
However , police agencies across the country routinely discipline police officers who fail to fill their quota of traffic citations .
This may at first glance seem to be a spurious comparison .
But consider it in light of the principle of opportunity cost as applied to the time budget of the typical patrol officer :
Should he organize his time in such a way that he can be available to help a victim of violent crime , or in the best way to take advantage of " hot spots " for traffic violators , thereby making his quota and enhancing his prospects for lucrative overtime ?
A given officer can be in only one place at a given time , after all , and each hour spent trolling for inattentive drivers represents an hour taken away from the task of " serving and protecting " the local population .
Here in Payette , Idaho ( population circa 7,000 ) , the local police force has not one or two but no fewer than three undercover , unmarked cars ( recognizable from some angles by the antenna cluster at the back ) that apparently circulate through the town in search of traffic violations .
One of them can be seen every morning making circuits through a local " hot spot " :
It ’s a section of a business route branching off I -95 where the speed limit suddenly dips from 35 MPH to 25 MPH for several blocks .
This kind of ticketing - by - quota — the existence of which is indisputable , the anguished denials from police officials to the contrary notwithstanding — is n’t " law enforcement " ; it ’s revenue enhancement .
And it ’s increasingly common as the economic implosion accelerates and governments at the municipal and county levels are starved for tax revenue .
" When I first started in this job 30 years ago , police work was never about revenue enhancement , " observes Michael Reaves , a police chief in Utica , Michigan .
" But if you ’re a chief now , you have to look at whether your department produces revenues .
That ’s just the reality nowadays . "
The Detroit News article containing Reaves ’ lament was entitled " Traffic fines help fill city coffers : Officials increasingly target drivers to bolster budgets . "
The piece , the first in a two - part expos , reported that " Court and police records from 2002 — 2007 [ show that ] many Metro Detroit police departments have drastically increased the number of moving violations issued in what some people say is an effort to offset budget shortfalls caused by the sluggish economy . "
One former Detroit - area police officer summarizes : " A portion of the tickets our officers write helps pay their salaries , but the rest is profit for the city .
 Profit ’ may not be the right word to use in government , but that ’s pretty much what it is . "
No , " profit " — a term describing material gain honorably earned through mutually beneficial commerce — is not the correct word .
" Plunder " is .
Detroit and its environs are in the throes of a severe and deepening depression , and suffering a predictable increase in property crimes and violent assaults .
And yet , as the perspicuous Karen DeCoster ( herself a Detroit native ) points out , " the cops do nothing to prevent the scores of home robberies , car thefts , and assorted property crimes because they are too busy sitting in ‘ hot spots ’ that are good for catching the more dangerous types , like speeders and drivers who do n’t come to a complete stop at a stop sign in an empty intersection . "
That ’s opportunity cost at work .
And this underscores , once again , the true priorities that define police " work " : Revenue collection for the government ber alles , protection for the governed … sometimes .
The embodiment of the Detroit - area police plunderbund is Officer David Kanapsky , the champion pen-slinger for the Warren Police Department .
During 2007 , the Warren PD issued 54,100 traffic tickets — an increase of 20 percent over the previous year ’s total of 44,809 .
Kanapsky , a physically unimpressive wad of aging cholesterol who could n’t chase down a robber or wrestle an assailant to the ground without risking an immediate coronary infarct , wrote ten percent of Warren ’s citations during 2007 .
Most of them were issued at Kanapsky ’s favorite fishing hole , an intersection with a stop sign at which some drivers would make a " rolling stop . "
But then again , it does n’t really matter whether drivers come to a full stop , since Kanapsky — by virtue of the costume he wears to what he calls " work " — enjoys the benefit of the doubt when tickets are contested in court .
And since Kanapsky is paid ( note carefully : not " earns , " but " is paid " ) overtime simply for appearing in court , he actually has a perverse incentive for issuing citations he knows will be challenged .
Last year he was given $ 21,562 in overtime simply for dragging his tax - engorged corpus into court to wheeze out his allegations before a judge .
Each of those contested tickets was a case of Kanapsky ’s word against that of his victim — the word of a self - interested tax - feeder against that of a productive citizen .
Naturally , the judge invariably takes the side of his comrade in the tax - feeding class .
So Kanapsky is let free to grow another subsidized chin and prey on other innocent people ; meanwhile , those who dared object to Kanapsky ’s predations are out the price of a ticket and the valuable time spent in the useless , infuriating , self - abasing attempt to contest it in court .
Any citizen is free to pursue that disagreement further , at his own time and expense , in the same system that depends on the support of armed predators like Kanapsky .
However , if that citizen simply shrugs his shoulders and says , in effect , " You ’ve proven nothing , and I have no intention of surrendering my legitimately earned money on the word of a self - interested thug , " he ’ll eventually learn that he can’t persist in his disagreement without getting shot .
It ’s important to recognize that many police officers are nauseated by the use to which they are put by the governments that hired them .
“ The people we count on to support us and help us when we ’re on the road are the ones who end up paying the bills , and they ’re ticked off about it , " observes Trenton , Michigan Police Sgt. Richard Lyons .
“ We might was well just go door - to - door and tell people , ‘ Slide us $ 100 now , since your 16 - year - old is going to end up paying us anyway when he starts driving . ’
You ca n’t blame people for getting upset .
No politician wants to be the one to raise taxes , but if the community needs more money they should go ahead and raise taxes .
At least that ’s more honorable than chasing down cars for doing five miles over the speed limit . ”
Of course , no politician wants to raise taxes overtly , and with property values and retail earnings sharply declining , property and sales taxes are being choked off .
This is why police nation - wide are increasingly being deployed as armed revenue farmers — and why the already lengthy lines outside your local traffic court get longer every week .
Roadside police holdups are n’t the only creative means of illicit revenue extraction being employed by local governments ; " code enforcement " citations are likewise proliferating , often in the name of maintaining property values amid the housing collapse .
Given the dimensions of the housing bust , this is a bit like swimming against the tidal pull of Charybdis .
But the intent here , once again , is not to aid homeowners , but rather to contrive new opportunities for revenue collection .
This brings us to the case of Ian Bernard ( also known as " Ian Freeman " ) of Keene , New Hampshire .
Last summer , Freeman received a citation — delivered , as it turns out , by a retired police officer who is " working " part - time as an ordinance officer , while drawing a tax - provided pension — for allowing the occupants of a rental property he owns to store a couch in its front yard .
Mr. Freeman , recall , owns the rental property .
No respectable person complained about the couch ; the source of the complaint was another city official .
Quite properly perceiving this to be a matter of property rights , Freeman refused to pay the citation .
In early November Bernard wound up in District Court before a judge antagonistic to Mr. Bernard ’s beliefs , which are well - known in Keene .
In the mistaken belief that he would make a point of some kind , the judge arranged for a little demonstration during Freeman ’s hearing : Knowing that Freeman and other local freedom activists reject the stilted formality of court hearings , the judge summoned several Bailiffs to the courtroom and instructed them to be ready to arrest Freeman or any of his associates who failed to display the expected deference by standing when the judge sashayed into the room , and sitting promptly when instructed to .
Like Hawkeye Pierce , Freeman and his friends live by the axiom that someone who " orders " them to sit down is forcing them to stand , and vice - versa .
This is an entirely commendable thing .
So it was that the judge ordered that Freeman be arrested for contempt for standing a barely perceptible fraction of a second longer than the judge thought proper .
A special closed trial was then held , at which Freeman received a sentence of 93 days in jail — three days refusing to pay the original fine , and a total of 90 days for contempt .
Once again :
This individual , who did nothing to harm anybody , will spend more than three months in jail for asserting control over his own legally acquired property , and refusing to offer slavish obedience to some fellow with a Liberace complex .
It could have been worse .
Oh , my , yes :
In a time when armed tax harvesters consider it their right and duty to subject people to electroshock torture at the first sign of resistance , it can always get much worse .
Just two days ago ( Wednesday , November 19 ) , Houston resident Marvin Driver , the father of Green Bay Packers receiver Donald Driver , was reportedly beaten bloody and unconscious by a pair of Houston ’s Finest who had arrested him because of outstanding traffic tickets .
Marvin Driver , 56 , was " unresponsive " when taken to jail .
Shuttled to a local hospital , he was treated for a cerebral hemorrhage resulting from blunt force trauma .
Left speechless by the assault , Driver scribbled some details about the assault .
He was arrested outside his mother ’s home ; his brother Winston , who witnessed the arrest , says that one of the officers threatened him , ordering him to get back in the house .
As the police drove away , Winston called 911 .
The next thing the family knew , Marvin was in the hospital .
He claims to have been dragged behind a gas station and beaten by the police , who also tried to shove something down his throat .
At one point , Marvin recalled , one of the assailants tauntingly told him he was " going to see Jesus . "
Mr. Driver ’s injuries — which included abdominal bruises from being kneed to the stomach — were consistent with his story .
While it was clear that Driver came to serious harm while in police custody , the department ’s initial reaction was that it could n’t account for or comment about Driver ’s condition until after a lengthy inquiry .
However , the force quickly reassigned three officers — Bacilio Guzman , Gilberto Cruz and M. Marin — believed to have been involved in the assault .
Officers Cruz and Guzman both became sworn police officers within the last 18 months .
Mr. Driver has said that the beating he endured was less painful to him than the fact that he had known one of the assailants in the neighborhood before he grew up to be a police officer .
They had been on friendly terms until one of them was given the assignment to collect revenue for the government , and the power to turn his erstwhile friends into corpses .

Amy Chozick reports on the presidential race from Oxford , Mississippi .
Barack Obama got some praise for his debate performance from someone who knows a thing or two about debating the Democratic nominee : his former rival Hillary Clinton .

( CNN ) -- A Warren Township , Ohio , man faces charges of felonious assault after authorities say he fired his rifle at two teens who were attempting to deface his McCain presidential campaign yard sign .
Police say the man 's sign is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs .
Kenneth Rowles , 50 , pleaded not guilty to the charge Monday , according to CNN affiliate WBNS .
Bail was set at $ 10,000 .
Rowles told police he was sitting on his porch Saturday when a tan SUV pulled up and a black youth jumped out and ran toward his house , screaming , " This is for Obama . "
He said another male was hanging out of the passenger window screaming the same thing .
Rowles said he went inside , got his rifle and fired three shots to scare the youths away , according to a Warren Township police report .
He told officers he believes that the men " were the same two that have been destroying his McCain sign . "
Just hours before the shooting , Rowles called police and said that a car had stopped in front of his house and that a black male " ran up and said something about Obama , " according to the report , and " damaged his sign again . "
One of the youths , 17 - year - old Kyree Flowers , was shot in the arm , according to a police report .
He and the second youth , Patrick Wise Jr. , 16 , told police they were in the car attempting to leave when Rowles fired at them .
" Kyree stated that he witnessed the homeowner trying to shoot Patrick but he was having trouble chambering a round , " the police report said .
The teens admitted that they had defaced the McCain sign several times , Warren Township police Lt. Don Bishop told CNN .
Rowles ' is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs , he said .
Bishop said the teenagers probably will not be charged -- and are unlikely to damage campaign signs again , as the incident scared them .
Warren Township is in Trumbull County not far from Cleveland , Ohio .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama
Whatever the Iraq war was about , we were assured , it definitely was n't about oil .
Tony Blair called the idea a " conspiracy theory " .
It was about democracy and dictatorship , weapons of mass destruction and human rights , anything but oil .
Donald Rumsfeld , then US defence secretary , insisted the conflict had " literally nothing to do with oil " .
When Alan Greenspan , former chairman of the US Federal Reserve , wrote last autumn , " Everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil , " he was treated as if he were some senile old gent who 'd embarrassingly lost the plot .
That argument is going to be a good deal harder to make from next week , when four of the western world 's largest oil corporations are due to sign contracts for the renewed exploitation of Iraq 's vast reserves .
Initially , these are to be two - year deals to boost production in Iraq 's largest oilfields .
But not only did the four energy giants - BP , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Total - write their own contracts with the Iraqi government , an unheard - of practice : they have also reportedly secured rights of first refusal on the far more lucrative 30 - year production contracts expected once a new US - sponsored oil law is passed , allowing a wholesale western takeover .
Big Oil is back with a vengeance .
It 's a similar story when it comes to the future of the US occupation itself .
The last thing on anyone 's mind , we were told when the tanks rolled in , was permanent US control , let alone the recolonisation of Iraq .
This was about the Iraqis finally getting a chance to run their own affairs in freedom .
But five years on , George Bush and Dick Cheney are putting the screws on their Green Zone government to sign a secret deal for indefinite military occupation , which would effectively reduce Iraq to a long - term vassal state .
In April , I was leaked a draft copy of this " strategic framework agreement " , intended to replace the existing UN mandate at the end of the year .
Details of the document , which came from a source at the heart of the Iraqi government , were published in the Guardian - including indefinite authorisation for the US to " conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security " .
Since then , much more has emerged about the accompanying " status of forces agreement " the US administration wants to impose : including more than 50 US military bases , full control of Iraqi airspace , legal immunity for US military and private security firms , and the right to conduct armed operations throughout the country without consulting the Iraqi government .
This goes far beyond other such agreements the US has around the world and would shackle Iraq with a permanent puppet status .
Not surprisingly , it has led to uproar in the country and opposition in the US , where congress will be denied a vote on the arrangement because the administration has chosen not to call it a treaty .
But it also evokes powerful memories in Iraq , which has been down this road before .
After Britain invaded and occupied Iraq during the first world war , it imposed a strikingly similar treaty on its puppet government in 1930 in preparation for the country 's nominal independence .
Just as in George Bush 's version , Britain awarded itself military bases , the right to conduct military operations , and legal immunity for its forces - though the proposed new US powers and restrictions on Iraqi sovereignty go even further than in the pre-war colonial treaty .
To add to this sense of imperial revival , the four oil companies now preparing to return in triumph to Iraq were the original partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company , which Britain gave a free hand in the 1920s to dine off Iraq 's wealth in a famously exploitative deal .
The Anglo - Iraqi treaty and those bitterly unjust oil concessions dominated Iraqi politics for decades , feeding riots , uprisings and coups until the monarchy was overthrown , the tables turned on the oil companies and the British were finally sent packing by the radical nationalist General Qasim in 1958 .
The 50th anniversary of the 1958 revolution appropriately falls next month .
But Bush and Cheney seem increasingly determined to force through both their security agreement and the stalled law for the privatisation of Iraq 's oil industry before the US election .
The signs are that , despite intense Iraqi opposition , a combination of strong - arm tactics , bribery and some watering down of the most extreme US demands may yet secure the full imperial package .
When Bush contradicted Iraqi prime minister Nouri al - Maliki earlier this month on the occupation deal and predicted : " If I were a betting man , we 'll reach an agreement with the Iraqis , " he sounded as if he knew what he was talking about - rather as he did when he explained a couple of weeks ago that he was " confident " Gordon Brown would not after all be cutting British troop numbers in Basra according to any fixed timetable .
Meanwhile , Iraq 's foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , is suddenly sounding similarly confident about " progress " on the oil law because " the Americans are very keen " .
Perhaps they are all coming to believe the Bush administration propaganda that the surge has succeeded and Iraq is starting to " fix itself " in time for the US election , as the Economist 's cover story put it last week .
Much is still being made of the decline in US casualties and resistance attacks to 2004 levels , even though the factors behind that drop are widely acknowledged to be contingent and precarious .
Given the carnage of the past few days alone - including seven US soldiers killed since the weekend and a Baghdad car bomb that butchered 65 people - as well as this week 's withering US Government Accountability Office report on the administration 's claims of " progress " in Iraq , any other view would seem perverse .
What is certain is that , if Bush 's blueprint for indefinite foreign rule in Iraq and the takeover of its oil is forced down the throats of the Iraqi people , resistance and bloodshed will increase .
Of course , it 's true that the US and Britain did n't invade Iraq only for its oil .
It was a projection of American power in the world 's most strategically sensitive region , with oil at its heart , which has brought catastrophe to Iraq and great danger to the Middle East and the wider world .
That 's why the struggle to restore Iraq 's independence matters far beyond its borders - it is a global necessity .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The Securities and Exchange Commission ban on short selling of financial stocks will be lifted just before midnight on Wednesday .
That means investors can put new bearish bets on shares of financial - services companies starting Thursday .
The SEC said earlier this week that the ban would expire three trading days after the $ 700 billion government bailout became law .
President George Bush signed the legislation into law on Friday , after the House of Representatives voted for the plan earlier in the day .
We love Firefox for its extensibility , but sometimes we run into an extension or two that dons the " Experimental " label on the Firefox add - ons site .
We prefer highlighting extensions once they 've been approved by Mozilla — both so we know they 've been vetted and so we can save you the effort of registering with Mozilla to install something — so we generally pass them by .
When enough of them pile up in our watch list , we highlight them in one big post ( see our two previous posts ) in an effort to give the extensions the extra push of popularity that can expedite the approval process .
So without further ado , read on for a closer look at seven awesome Firefox extensions we 're into .

FireStatus

FireStatus lets you send simultaneous updates to multiple social networks — namely Twitter , Facebook , and FriendFeed .
That 's not a bad start , but it goes the extra mile by also displaying your friends ' updates through notification pop-ups ( uses Growl in OS X ) .
It also integrates with the most popular URL shrinking site , TinyURL .

Tabgroups - Plus allows you to organize your Firefox tabs in even more tabs .
An update to previously mentioned Tab Groups , Tabgroups - Plus does the same drag and drop organization of tabs within user - defined parent tabs , but this version supports Firefox 3 where the old version did not .
GCal Popup

GCal Popup opens Google Calendar in an overlay over any web page , giving you quick access to your agenda without leaving the page you 're already visiting .
To toggle the calendar , simply click the Google Calendar icon in the corner of your status bar . [ via ]
Noise

Noise adds user - defined sounds to browser events in Firefox .
For example , you can set a sound to play every time you click a link , open a new tab , start a download , and so on .
To be honest , the last thing we think Firefox needs is the irritating click - click that IE conditioned us with at one point , but sounds can come in handy when used properly — for example , to give you an audio heads - up that your download has completed .

Fasterfox Lite

Fasterfox Lite is the exact same extension as the popular Fasterfox extension with one small difference :
It removes the controversial link prefetching built into Fasterfox .
Prefetching automated retrieves pages linked to on the current page so that they 'll load more quickly if and when you do click them , but it 's generally considered poor form because it wastes server bandwidth and adds to the server load .
Fasterfox Lite does everything else Fasterfox does , and incidentally , it supports Firefox while Fasterfox does not . [ via ]
Open in Browser

Open in Browser adds an option to the Firefox download / save / open menu that allows you to redirect the download to open the file directly in Firefox .
If you 've ever clicked on an image or plain text script , for example , that forced a download when you just wanted to check it out in Firefox , Open in Browser lets you open it back in Firefox where you wanted it to begin with .

Two influential Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged Facebook to take stronger action against misinformation , voter suppression and incitements to violence ahead of the 2020 election .
In a letter sent to the company on Sunday , U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal and David Cicilline accused Facebook of failing to enforce its own rules when it comes to false claims about the election , and not doing enough to stop right - wing militias and white supremacist groups from using the platform to organize potentially violent events .
“ With the election less than 50 days away , the lack of concerted action by Facebook to address this threat to our democracy is a grave concern , ” the two lawmakers wrote .

Advertisement Thousands of Colombians have taken part in violent protests in several cities to demand the return of money invested in disreputable financial schemes .
Police used batons and tear gas to control angry investors and curfews were declared in several cities .
In Popayan in the south - western department of Cauca , 2,000 depositors stormed an investment firm 's offices .
In Pereira , in Risaralda , police caught two men hurrying out the back door of a scheme 's office with suitcases of cash .
They offered one of the cases to the police to let them go .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says they are now in custody and that is the safest place for them , as conned investors have threatened to lynch them .
Many savers have lost everything
It is not clear how much money overall may have been scammed but for many individuals it was most of their life savings .
" Everybody was full of hope for December , for the holidays .
The people thought their lives would change , " one man who said he had lost the equivalent of $ 1,500 told AFP in Popoyan .
Hundreds gathered outside a company called DRFE in the town of Armenia , among them Luis Alberto Sierra who told Caracol TV he had lost some $ 17,000 .
" I mortgaged my house , invested all my savings , " he said .
Marta Aristizabal in Cali told Caracol TV she had lost around 30 m pesos ( $ 13,000 ) .
" It 's so uncertain , we 've heard the company 's bankrupt , we do n't know what 's happened . "
' Witchcraft '
Angry investors in several regions ransacked DRFE offices and clashed with police sent to restore order .
In the city of Pasto , in the department of Narino , local television showed depositors looting local businesses .
Colombia 's vice - president told investors nothing was free in this world In Popayan , police fired tear gas to disperse people trying to break into the investment company 's office to recover their money .
The people behind a pyramid scheme in Santander de Quilichao disappeared , leaving a note stuck to the doors taunting the investors for having been duped .
It said : " Now for being stupid and believing in witchcraft you will have to work much harder to recoup the money you gave us . "
The office of another pyramid scheme had a greetings card stuck on the door which read : " We wish you a sad Christmas and a shameful New Year . "
Investigations into such schemes have been under way for several months but Colombian President Alvaro Uribe called for intensified action against companies suspected of defrauding people .
He has also urged Congress to pass stiffer laws to increase the penalties for investment scams .
Vice - President Francisco Santos warned people to avoid pyramid schemes .
" When someone promises to double your money in six months they are trying to trick you , " he said .
" Nothing is free in this world and that is not going to change . "
A number of bogus companies have vanished in recent months after promising depositors interest rates as high as 150 % .
Our correspondent says some of the schemes have actually paid out money to investors to launder drug profits .
Pyramid investment schemes are said to be often more popular than regular savings accounts in Colombian banks , which charge high fees .

Tax preparation from home , though it provides income seasonally , is a great way to earn extra money to cover your bills or make a descent living if it is done full time .
On average , home based tax preparers earns about $ 1,700.00 per month preparing returns for 19 to 20 persons .
Some can earn up to $ 5,600.00 per month during the tax period .
What makes the earnings even more enticing is that being a tax preparer from home requires little initial expenditure and it is easy to start and operate .
Even though a home based tax preparation business is relatively easy to operate , there are a number of things that should be considered if you would like to be a home based tax preparer .
You should consider , training and certification , the basic equipment necessary to operate , service rates / fees , promotion and customer care .
Training and Certification :
Nothing is worse than service providers who have no idea how to provide the service they offer .
Training and certification is key if you are going to run a successful home based tax preparation service .
If you are a CPA or have worked as an Accountant , this business should be easier for you , however , for those who have no accounting experience or education , you should seek to complete a training course surrounding taxation .
The IRS offers training courses in return for your volunteer service on their tax help line .
Companies like H & R Block and Jackson Hewitt also offers affordable tax courses .
The advantage of doing a tax course is not only that you will have the required skill to file returns but prospective clients will be more willing to use your services .
The basic equipment necessary to operate :
You will require a computer , a taxation software and internet access .
In the past , taxation was done manually and therefore was more likely to be inaccurate and time consuming .
With technology however , returns can be done quickly and more accurately .
Along with accuracy and the speed at which returns can be done , most software ensures that all the required information is included in the return , returns and other information can be easily stored for future reference , returns look more professional and you can file returns online using the tax software .
There are many tax software 's available on the market , but the software that most home based tax preparers use is Turbo Tax .
If you plan to complete manual returns , then you should consider downloading the required forms from the IRS website .
The forms you may need are as follows , 1040 and 1040 EZ , schedules and supplemental forms , as well as the 1040 , 1040 EZ , Schedules and supplemental forms .
You should also ensure that you have a good supply of stationary like , Pocket folders , Labels , Paper , Paper clips , Staples etc .
Service Rates / Fees :
The fee structure you choose should be equivalent to what the market offers .
Overpricing services is one of the most prevalent mistakes that home based tax preparers make .
They offer rates that people are just not willing to pay , especially when you consider that tax software is readily available and pretty easy to use if a client decides to do their own taxes .
Your best bet is to research the market to see what the average charge out rate is and ensure that your rates are at the market rate or below it .
In general , starting home based tax preparers charge $ 90 per return .
The more experienced tax preparers may earn up to $ 120 per return .
We should note however that the charge out rate is not always fixed and is highly dependent on the complexity of the returns , the availability of information to do the returns and the cooperation of the client .
Promotion and Advertising :
Home based tax preparers usually find it difficult to get the necessary number of clients to make their service viable .
A number of measures can be taken to increase your client base and are as follows :
Seek clients within your family first .
Most home based tax preparers start by doing returns for members of their family ;
You can also approach close friends with your service , who , can in turn spread the word to their friends ;
Charging rates below the market value can also be a good means of promoting your service .
Some charge up to half of the average rate in order to steal clients from their competitors ;
Social networking is also a good way to increase your customer base .
Since you have approached family and friends already , you should try to meet new people and at the same time , tactfully introduce your service to your new acquaintances ;
Some have advertised on websites or have set up their own sites and have advertised with google ;
You can also advertise your service on Craigslist or your local newspapers ; and
You can advertise on Bulletin boards , hand out fliers and business cards or distribute brochures which gives details of your service .
Customer Care :
be dependable and have a track record of filing returns in a timely manner ;
always be courteous ;
be available for queries ;
provide copies of returns that are professionally done , neat and without inaccuracies ; and
be responsive to the needs of the client .

As with any business , customer care is critical to you keeping the customer base happy and committed to your service .
To encourage good relations with your clients you must :
Simple actions like placing flags where clients most sign their returns , returning calls as quickly as possible and providing a professional folder with the delivery of the copy of the clients returns , can positively impact the relationship between yourself and your client .
The Persistence of Cupcakes
It 's the trend that wo n't die , but where are Seattle 's most heavenly specimens ?
Even the stand looks fucking delicious .
Kelly O
Cupcakes are , perhaps , the perfect dessert .
They can be a simple , everyday treat baked from a boxed cake mix in less than 30 minutes , or an elegant piece of edible art , suitable for a grand occasion .
If you want chocolate , get a chocolate cupcake !
Feeling fruity ?
Opt for a lemon cupcake !
Want a little bit of both ?
Have two cupcakes !
There 's a cupcake out there for every mood , and I 've tried them all .
Sometime after 1996 , thanks to Magnolia Bakery in New York , cupcakes started sweeping the nation .
The single - serving - size no - fork - necessary cake was resurrected from its second - grade birthday - party grave and got camera time on Sex in the City , SNL , and Martha Stewart — and the trend 's looking pretty permanent now .
( The sole local cupcake flop was New York Cupcake in Westlake Center , a chain with just - okay cupcakes that still has a franchise in Bellevue . )
Seattle alone has dozens of places where you can fill a cupcake - shaped void .
The local chain Cupcake Royale — with locations in Madrona , Ballard , and West Seattle ( 1101 34 Ave , 709-4497 ; 2052 NW Market St , 782-9557 ; 4556 California Ave SW , 932-2971 ) —has been around since 2003 .
Others have hopped on board , too : Trophy Cupcakes in Wallingford ( 1815 N 45th St , 632-7020 ) and Sugar Rush Bakery in West Seattle ( 4541 California Ave SW , 937-1495 ) .
And well - established local bakeries like Macrina ( 2408 First Ave , 448-4032 ; 615 W McGraw St , 283-5900 ; and new in Sodo 1943 First Ave S , 623-0919 ) and Dahlia Bakery ( 2001 Fourth Ave , 441-4540 ) have made it a point to keep their shelves stocked with cupcakes among their other trademark breads , cakes , and cookies .
With the city 's baked - goods landscape still awash with cupcake options , it was about time we found out who makes the best cupcake in Seattle .
Armed with nothing but a love for sugar and an empty stomach , I sampled the work of Cupcake Royale , Sugar Rush , Trophy , Macrina , and ( to represent the high end of grocery stores ) Whole Foods .
First , to keep an even playing field , I tried one " control " cupcake from each location — a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting .
Cupcake Royale 's butter - based vanilla frosting is , as an assistant taster put it , " dynamite . "
Unlike all the rest , who keep their vanilla white , CR's is dyed a light pink and is exactly sugary enough , yet smooth .
Unfortunately , the chocolate cake on which it sits is not as exquisite — it was so dry it crumbled to pieces when the paper was peeled away .
Cupcake fail .
But Sugar Rush 's control cupcake fared much better .
Their vanilla frosting is creamy and thick , and boy do they pipe a lot of it on each cupcake ( maybe a little too much ) .
But the denser , heavier texture was a nice counterpoint to the light , moist cake .
Sugar Rush 's cake was n't without flaw , though — there was n't enough chocolate oomph .
That honor goes to Trophy and Macrina .
Both bakeries had fantastic chocolate cake — dense , flavorful , and stick - to - your - mouth moist .
And Trophy had the ideal frosting to go with it ( Macrina 's thin layer of frosting seemed to have a tinge of maple in it , and it left a weird , thick layer on the tongue ) .
The lighter , whipped frosting piped on top of Trophy 's cupcake was delicately flavored , yet it was n't so light that it got lost when mixed with the rich and deep chocolate cake .
After that , Whole Foods really just could n't compete — the cream cheese–based frosting was way too thick and sticky , and even with a layer of chocolate ganache sealing the cake away from harmful air , the cake was stale .
Sigh .
There 's nothing worse than old cupcakes .
But we can't crown the best cupcake based on the plain ol ' chocolate - vanilla combo , oh no .
The best cupcake has to have flair and flavor .
The best cupcake has to be as pretty and fun to eat as it is tasty .
While Cupcake Royale cupcakes are , in fact , pretty , and they do have that crispy " crown " of a top that makes them fun eating , they are , in truth , an everyday cupcake .
They 're yummy and thoughtful , but there 's nothing at all indulgent about them .
I could eat three of them and not feel a thing .
Trophy amps up the indulgence factor by piling on lots of tasty frosting and offering a variety of unique flavors ( rotating every day of the week and every season ) , but I 'm never overwhelmed when I walk into their cute Wallingford cafe .
The cupcakes on display are almost too perfect , lacking the charm of being baked by hand .
Sugar Rush , though , is wonderfully overwhelming .
Their pastry case is full of dozens of different kinds of cupcakes — chocolate , vanilla , lemon , red velvet , coconut , mocha , cappuccino , strawberry , mint , and even a vegan option or two .
They have cupcakes filled with raspberry jam and lemon curd , they have cupcakes the size of a fist and cupcakes the size of a thimble .
And each cupcake is obviously treated with great care .
Some have small icing flowers piped on top of mounds of coconut , some have petals of frosting , sitting pretty like a rose , some have sprinkles settled in deep crevices of chocolate frosting — each cupcake is its own piece of art , and not so uniform that it appears a robot made it .
So congratulations , Sugar Rush , you make the best cupcake in Seattle .
But there are no losers here .
Even Whole Foods hit one out of the park with their peanut - butter - and - jelly - sandwich cupcake ( whipped peanut butter frosting ?
Yes , please ) .
So the real winner ?
Me. ' Cause I just got to eat a lot of cupcakes .
If you ’re thinking about which hybrid vehicle to purchase , now that gas prices have dictated that you replace your Hummer , consider a vehicle that will not only eliminate high spending at the gas pump , but also your time spent in traffic .
Would n’t you rather fly above the endless traffic jams in your very own ethanol - fueled flying car ?
I know I would .
Science fiction , right ?
Guess again .
Welcome to Moller Int. , a small company nestled in the unassuming city of Davis , CA , where they are making this science fantasy into cold hard reality via the M400 Skycar , a ' volantor ' sky vehicle .
Volantor refers to the capability of a vertical takeoff and landing as well as its quick and agile flight .
Dr. Paul Moller , company founder , Chairman of the Board and also the company ’s President and Chief Executive Officer has , needless to say , invested his entire being into his vision .
With a masters degree in Engineering and a Ph.D. in Aerodynamics , Moller ’s dream , since his first helicopter designs at the age of 15 , has been to create viable flight vehicles for the general public .
His realization of that dream became the Skycar .

Moller Int. currently has two working models of volantor aircraft .
The M400 Skycar resembles a small sports car jet , bright red and glossy with a pointed nose , two sets of fans ( which rotate for liftoff ) and a Plexiglas cockpit , which seats four people .
Moller imagines that it would be the best for people with regular trips over 50 miles , and would be much faster due to its ability to cruise between 200 miles / hour at sea level and up to 400 miles / hour at 25,000 ft .
“ It ’s the kind of vehicle that would change the way you get around , ” declares Moller .

The other model at Moller Int. is the M200X Neuera , formerly the Jetson , which most closely resembles a two person UFO .
Its round shape , blue color and domed cockpit are reminiscent of the popular cartoon The Jetsons .
Its usability ranges from farming to military , to shipping usages to border patrol .
Moller envisions it competing with modern all terrain vehicles and as such its uses are endless .
As fast as the average car , it can cruise easily at 75 miles / hour with top speeds near 100 miles / hour .

The M400 Skycar and the M200X Neuera are capable of vertical liftoff , landing , hovering and cruising with the success of two key elements : its engine and its stability system .
The Skycar has an engine capable of generating a huge amount of power in a very small space .
“ You would describe it as brute force , ” explains Moller .
“ That ’s why this particular class of aircraft is called powered - lift aircraft .
Rather than going down a runway and generating lift on the wings , you have to literally generate the force [ yourself ] .
If you want to go forward , you have to throw something out the back end .
What we throw is air .
” He likens his craft to hummingbirds ; inherently graceful , nimble and known for their speed .
Capable of hovering as well as flying , a hummingbird requires an immense amount of energy , eating two and a half times its weight in food just to be able to maintain flight .
Hummingbirds are small and , as they hover , they push air down with their wings to generate the power to hold them airborne .
“ That was the tricky part of our business , ” says Moller , “ How to generate that large amount of power in a very small package .
If the engine weighs a lot , you are just going to sit on the ground . ”
Moller ’s advanced engine , the Rotapower engine , can generate 2 horsepower for every pound of its weight .
“ That ’s an absolutely new accomplishment , ” says Moller .
Hummingbirds create lift by forcing air downward with their wings .
By doing so , they are able to hover .

Moller ’s technology , “ as sophisticated as the system used to land a man on the moon , ” is not just for astronauts .
The second key component of the Skycar is its artificial stabilization system , which allows all of us who are n’t Neil Armstrong to pilot the vehicle .
The stability system is a network which collects information such as change in velocity , acceleration and position every few milliseconds and integrates them , telling the engine how to adjust its speed to maintain the craft ’s stability .
The advantage that these key elements give Moller ’s volantor crafts is undeniable .
The stability system allows for the average person to pilot the craft without the need for a pilot ’s license ( at least from a skill level ) .
This enables the vehicles to be available for the general public .
Also , the improved engine provides a slew of advances over the common automobile .
The Rotapower engine , which Moller hails as the “ most significant mechanical invention of the 20th century , ” allows for a safer , more powerful , quieter and cleaner engine .
“ The beauty of the engine is that its round , so I can hide it , ” says Moller .
This is important because it forgoes the need for gear boxes found in regular aircraft and which are vulnerable to breakdown and malfunction .
According to Moller , 40 percent of all helicopter crashes are due to powertrain failure , a risk he ’s eliminated with the usage of his rotary engine .
Another advantage is the fuel that powers the Skycar and Neuera .
Ethanol , besides burning cleaner than gasoline , is much safer as well .
“ If you have an accident , the last thing you want have in that engine is gasoline , explains Moller .
“ It ’s extremely volatile , one spark and it ’s all over for you . ”
Ethanol is able to be mixed with water and , while it burns within the engine , wo n’t ignite outside of it .
If in the case of a crash , or a fuel spill , the risk of fire or explosion is negated by using the ethanol - water mixture .
The M200X Neuera is currently in limited production for 2009 while the Skycar is 3 years away .
Moller estimates that the Neuera will sell for under $ 100,000 and could get under $ 50,000 with increased volume .
The Skycar , however , will sell for above $ 100,000 dollars but is well worth the dough if having a cherry red volantor sky vehicle is your thing - and you know it is .
So before you shell out over a hundred thousand dollars on that new Maserati with its advanced aerodynamic engineering , only to be stuck in traffic with Yugos anyway , consider being where aerodynamics really count : in the sky .

I do n’t understand all the dominoes in the financial crisis .
In situations like this , it ’s helpful to step away and look at general principles : never mind the pieces , what ’s the “ gravity ” that makes them fall ?
And fall so hard ?
Leverage .
Leverage is debt used for investment purposes , and is extremely important .
Why ?
Debt , when invested , multiplies return ( profits and losses )
Leverage is a multiplier , a super - power .
Super - strength is great when times are good , and horrific when you accidentally “ bite your tongue ” ( it ’s super - strength , not invulnerability ) .
Concepts like leverage are casually mentioned , but let ’s see why the dominoes fall .
Get Rich Quick
I ’ve got a great investment plan for you .
Ready ?
Step 1 : Withdraw all your money
Step 2 : Go to Las Vegas
Step 3 : Bet it all on red in roulette ( Get it right and double your money — get it wrong and lose it all )
It ’s perfect !
We ’ll double our money in one step .
Sure , there ’s a “ chance ” that things go wrong .
But even then it ’s no so bad — we ’ll be at zero , like the day we were born .
Presumably naked and crying as well .
Double My Money ?
But I Want More !
The plan sounds interesting , but there ’s a problem — what if I only have \ $ 100 ?
Doubling to \$ 200 is nice , but not life - changing .
A few wild thoughts later , and we ’re onto a better idea : let ’s borrow money !
The plan becomes exciting :
Take our \$ 100 and borrow \ $ 1,000,000 from friends , families , banks , and unsavory characters .
( How ?
Well , show different people our \ $ 100 and ask to borrow another \ $ 100 , with our original cash as collateral ) .
Go to Vegas
Bet the \ $ 1 M dollars on black !
I mean , red !
What happens now ?
If we win : we get \ $ 2 M , pay back our \ $ 1 M loan , and are sitting pretty with our profit of \ $ 1M .
And if we lose ?
Uh oh .
Now we ’re worse than naked : we ’ve lost our shirts and everyone else ’s too !
Because we took debt , our worst case scenario is no longer going broke — it ’s going negative .
Notice how the loan changed the outcomes — neither wild riches nor debtor ’s prison were possible without the loan .
The Risk Multiplier
What just happened ?
Debt multiplies our risk and reward .
The good times get great , and the bad times become awful .
In our example , we went from winning or losing \$ 100 to winning or losing \ $ 1M — a 10,000 x difference in profit and loss !
This effect from investing debt is called “ leverage ” .
Why ?
I suppose it ’s because a lever lets you move one end a tiny bit ( one inch ) and have the other side move a large amount ( 1 foot ) .
It ’s also called a leverage or gearing ratio — move the big gear one cycle and move the small gear many cycles .
My inner geek cringes , since the sides of a lever move in opposite directions ( one side up , one side down ) and same with the gears ( one side clockwise , the other counter - clockwise ) .
Remember that with financial leverage , both sides move the same way .
I imagine leverage as a game of follow - the - leader : I push my money in one direction ( making a bet ) , and the huge pile of money I borrowed does the same .
Use whatever analogy works for you — the key is if your money wiggles up or down , the borrowed money does the same .
The Risk and Benefit of Leverage
Why does leverage work ?
At its heart , you are borrowing someone ’s assets and reaping the benefits .
It ’s like borrowing a cow and selling the milk !
What a great idea !
It ’s great until the cow runs off .
Now you ’re stuck — you owe a cow and do n’t have one to return .
The risk of leverage is investing that debt and losing what you borrowed , which can wipe out any profits .
Let ’s try a more realistic example then roulette : investing in a house .
Suppose you have 10 k and borrow 90 k , to purchase a \ $ 100 k house .
You have a leverage ratio of 10:1 — for every 10 dollars of the asset , you ’ve put in 1 dollar of equity ( your own money ) .
If house prices rise by 10 % , how much did you make ?
At first blush we ’d say 10 % , which is true — but you made 10 % on the entire 100k !
The house is now worth 110k , and after paying your 90 k debt you ’re left with 20 k .
That 10 % growth became 100 % profit on your initial investment !
leverage ratio = asset / equity
return = leverage ratio * percent change
Again , with 10 x leverage , 10 % growth becomes 100 % return on our initial equity .
From our analogy , we were in “ control ” of 10 dollars for every 1 we put in .
So , we gained 10 x the profit .
Now what about the reverse — when the house falls 10 % to 90k ?
Well , we can sell the house for 90 k , pay off our loan ( 90 k ) and are left with … zero !
Similarly , a 10 % dip in prices becomes a 100 % loss of equity — we ’re wiped out !
We get 10 x the loss when prices go south .
And if the house price falls 20 % ( impossible ! improbable !
unlikely ! ) , we suffer a 200 % loss — we ’ve lost our initial 10 k and owe 10 k beyond that ( sell the house for 80 k , but the loan is still 90k ) .
Hopefully the magnifying effect of borrowed money is becoming clear .
You lose your equity when the investment drops 1 / leverage ratio — in this case , 1/10 or 10 % .
With a 25 x leverage ratio , the investment only needs to drop 4 % in order to be wiped out .
One way to think about it : you ’re paying for losses out of your own pocket , not the borrowed money ( you always have to pay it back ) .
Your pocket is only 1 dollar of the 10 , so once you lose it ( 1 dollar out of 10 , or 10 % ) you are wiped out .
Any more , and you ’re in debt .
Real - world Examples
Leverage appears all over finance , but sometimes in disguise .
Let ’s take a look :
Getting a mortgage :
As we saw , borrowing money to buy a house is a form of leverage .
With 5 % down ( a 20 x gearing ratio ) , your house only needs to drop by 5 % to lose money .
With 0 % down , your house has to drop … wait for it … any amount for you to lose !
And after your house is worth less than your mortgage , there ’s little incentive to pay it off ( better to go bankrupt , depending on the debt ) .
Lending money for a mortgage : Even banks are levered .
When they offer money , where do you think they get it ?
From deposits !
They borrow your deposits to loan it out to other people .
If they have 10 k of deposits they might loan out 100 k ( there ’s some magic that happens here , how banks loan more money than they have ; that ’s for another time ) .
If they loaned money for a house , and the house drops 10 % in value and the debtor does n’t pay , the bank has lost all if its deposits .
Offering mortgage insurance : Insurance companies might have 10 k worth of cash , and offer 100 k worth of insurance coverage to banks ( C’mon , did you really think the insurance company had enough to pay off everyone ’s claims ? ) .
Of course they do n’t expect everyone to file a claim , but if even 10 % of people do , they are wiped out .
There is n’t an explicit loan , but the insurance company has created an obligation to pay ( called the insurance leverage ratio ) .
See the set up ?
When prices are rising :
Owners are making a lot of money ( they leveraged the house )
Banks are making a lot of money ( they leveraged their loans , and earn a lot of interest on the borrowed money )
Insurance companies are making a lot of money ( they ’re offer more coverage , which means more premiums )
If the music stops and house prices fall , problems arise :
Borrowers lose equity — a 5 % drop when 20 x levered means the borrower is wiped out .
Any more and the loan is worth more than the house .
Banks lose loans — if 5 % of loans go bad , the banks have to pay for the lost value themselves .
Insurance companies lose money — if 5 % of claims are called in , when the insurance company is 20 x levered , it means the company has lost all of its assets !
For 20 x leverage , a 5 % drop would wipe you out to zero equity .
Any more and you ’re going negative — you ’re at zero equity and still owe money !
The Lessons
I do n’t understand the crisis , but I ’m getting a grasp on leverage : it ’s the gravity that pulls down the dominoes .
In fact , it can multiply the dominoes as they fall !
Here are the key points :
Leverage multiplies profits and losses :
You can make a “ regular ” investment swing as wildly as you like by borrowing money .
You can make a “ regular ” investment swing as wildly as you like by borrowing money .
Return = leverage ratio * percent change :
A meager 10 x gearing ratio can double your money with a 10 % gain , or wipe you out with a 10 % loss .
By the end of a crisis , some banks increased their leverage ratio to 30:1 — if prices fell even 3 % they would be wiped out !

By the end of a crisis , some banks increased their leverage ratio to 30:1 — if prices fell even 3 % they would be wiped out !
Leverage appears everywhere : Companies have debt / equity ratios ( how levered they are ) and stock portfolios have beta ( riskiness beyond the market average , which is increased by debt ) .
Whenever you see debt or investment , look to see if it ’s leveraged in some way .
Leverage make the boom times better and the busts harsher .
The financial crisis has many other effects in play ( such as the liquidity crisis , which makes it difficult to sell the assets you have to pay off your debts ) , but let ’s take one idea at a time .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered a “ chemical Equator ” that divides the polluted air of the Northern Hemisphere from the largely uncontaminated atmosphere of the Southern Hemisphere .
Researchers from Britain ’s University of York found evidence for an atmospheric chemical line about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) wide in cloudless skies in the Western Pacific , with levels of carbon monoxide four times higher on the northern side .
The discovery will provide clues to help scientists model simulations of the movement of pollutants in the atmosphere more accurately , and to assess the impact of pollution on climate , the researchers said in a statement in Singapore on Tuesday .
Previously , scientists believed that a cloudy Pacific region where the trade winds meet formed a barrier between the Northern Hemisphere and the clearer air of the Southern Hemisphere .
“ Powerful storms may act as pumps , lifting highly polluted air from the surface to high in the atmosphere where pollutants will remain longer and may have a global influence , ” said Dr Jacqueline Hamilton , of the University of York .
Real News Network report , November 28 , 2008 : The media and the Venezuelan elections -- US media covers Chavez victory and calls it a defeat Audio : Federico Fuentes on speaks to Latin Radical about election outcomes November 28 , 2008

Statement by the Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network
November 25 , 2008 --
The results of the elections for local mayors and state governors held in Venezuela on November 23 underlined the continuing mass support for the Bolivarian revolution led by President Hugo Chavez .
In a clear vote of confidence in the project to build socialism of the 21st century in Venezuela , the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) -- formed just six months ago with Chavez as its president -- won 17 of the 22 states in which governors were elected .
The United States - backed right - wing opposition won five states with a total of about 4 million votes , compared to the 5.5 million votes for the PSUV candidates .
The elections were also a victory for democracy in Venezuela .
The voter turn - out was the highest ever in regional elections , with 65.45 % of those eligible casting their vote ( compared to 45 % in the last regional elections in 2004 ) .
Despite some opposition leaders threatening not to recognise the results if voting hours were extended , polling centres were kept open until 10.30 pm in some places to ensure that everyone waiting in the long queues was able to vote , and international observers report that it was a completely free and fair ballot .
Jim McIlroy , a participant in the Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network brigade currently in Venezuela who observed the voting at polling booths in Caracas , said : “ There was a festive atmosphere at the booths , but it was also highly politicised : the people were taking their democratic right to vote very seriously .
“ The computerised voting sytem is far more advanced than that used in Australia , and its ability to guarantee the accuracy of the whole process clearly has the confidence of the people . ”
After the close of polls , Chavez congratulated the Venezuelan people for participating in the elections in a “ civic and joyful ” manner , saying that the process ratified Venezuelan democracy , but not the “ democracy of before ” , which “ belonged to the elites ” .
Red : PSUV win ; Blue : oppositon win ;
White : no election ; Arrows : gain for the opposition ( AFP )
Overall , the November 23 vote for the PSUV – for the revolution and socialism -- increased by about 1.3 million on the pro-revolution vote in the constitutional reforms referendum last December .
In contrast , the anti-revolution opposition ’s comparative vote declined by about 300,000 .
As well , the Chavez suporters won back three states ( Aragua , Guarico and Sucre ) in which the incumbent governors had , over the last 18 months , defected to the opposition .
However , the sharp polarisation of Venezuelan society and the hard struggle still facing the poor majority to defend the gains of the revolution and realise their dream of a new socialist Venezuela is evident in the fact that the opposition , which won only two states in 2004 ( oil - rich Zulia and Nueva Esparta ) , this time won three more from Chavez supporters ( Miranda , Tachira , Carabobo ) .
The opposition also won the position of mayor of Greater Caracas and now controls four of Caracas ’s five municipalities , although the largest and poorest municipality , Libertador , was re-won by the pro-revolution candidate .
Already in control of 95 % of the media in Venezuela , the right wing will without a doubt use these victories to escalate their ongoing campaign to overthrow Chavez , and undermine the Bolivarian revolution .
As was exposed just a month before the regional elections , they will stop at nothing to halt the revolutionary process , including another military coup and the assassination of Chavez .
Capitalist media around the world , including in Australia , are supporting their campaign to discredit and destabilise Venezuela ’s revolutionary government .
An AFP report by Sophie Nicholson , for example , which was uncritically regurgitated in the Melbourne Age newspaper on November 24 , pedalled blatant lies about the regional elections .
“ Mr Chavez ” , it stated , “ has threatened to imprison opponents , or even send tanks onto the streets , if his party loses in the populous northwestern state of Carabobo ” .
In fact , Chavez said that the government would mobilise the military if there were destablisation attempts around the elections : a scenario that was not out of the question given the opposition ’s constant public calls in national media for the violent overthrow of Chavez and his government .
The Melbourne Age article also claimed that “ about 300 candidates , mainly from the opposition , have been prevented from running in the elections ” .
In fact , those barred from contesting were not mostly opposition candidates , and all were disqualified after investigations found them guilty of corruption .
Demolishing these and the numerous other efforts to paint him as some sort of “ dictator ” , Chavez immediately acknowledged the opposition ’s victory in Carabobo , and the other four states .
In doing so , however , he urged the opposition to behave democratically : “ I hope you devote yourself to understand the people , govern with transparency , honesty and respect for the national government and the institutions of those states and municipalities .
If you do so , you will deserve our acknowledgement ; if you do not , the Constitution of the Republic will be imposed on you . ”
Of the 17 governorships won by the PSUV , eight were won with at least 60 % of the vote and most of the others were won with a more than 10 % margin on the closest rival .
In the local municipalty elections , which were held at the same time , the average vote for Chavista candidates was even stronger .
Despite the many difficulties and contradictions confronting the revolution , it is clear that the great majority of Venezuelans want the process of transferring resources and power to the poor majority to continue .
Chavez summed it up when he said that these election results ratify that “ the path is the construction of socialism , and we have to deepen it ” .

Yesterday the Republican Party of Montana announced that it was abandoning its plans to challenge the voting eligibility of at least 6,000 residents of that state - mostly in democratic strongholds - who had filed change - of - address cards with the U.S. Postal Service .
In a letter sent to election officials in seven counties , state GOP executive director Jacob Eaton withdrew the party 's challenges and said they would be issuing no more .
Several hundred letters requesting that individuals confirm their correct addresses had already gone out from overworked election offices before the GOP withdrew its challenge .
" My intent was to ensure that voters are properly registered and that Montanans would have the utmost faith in the integrity of our elections process , " Eaton wrote in the letter to election officials .
" Nevertheless , because of the unintended consequences that have been reported , I will not file any other elector challenges . "
Following a story about the challenges that appeared in The Missoulian on October 2 , the " unintended consequences " of the GOP challenge included chaos at election boards , condemnation from voting rights groups , protests within Montana , and a lawsuit filed by the Montana Democratic Party on behalf of two challenged voters .
In the Montana Standard , Lieutenant Governor John Bohlinger , a Republican , called the challenge " an utter disgrace , " and said he was " appalled by the leadership of [ his ] political party . "
The developments in Montana came just a few weeks after reports of the Michigan GOP 's plans to challenge the eligibility of voters whose names appeared on foreclosure lists .
Met with similar public outrage and accusations of voter caging , the Michigan GOP recanted those plans as well , according to the Michigan Messenger .
" We are pleased to hear that the Montana GOP has decided to withdraw the challenges , " James said today .
" And we are encouraged that these kinds of partisan caging operations - which have been used in previous years to disenfranchise thousands of eligible voters - are being met this election cycle with the media scrutiny and public outrage they deserve . "

SRINAGAR , India ( Reuters ) - India and Pakistan will open a historic trade link across divided Kashmir for the first time in six decades on Tuesday , a step aimed at reducing tensions between the two nuclear powers .

The decision , taken only last month , to allow limited trade across the military frontline in Kashmir symbolizes attempts to solve the dispute by creating “ soft borders ” allowing the free movement of goods and people .
But the history of war and mistrust means progress is likely to remain slow and intermittent .
A bus service between divided Kashmir , launched with much fanfare in 2005 , has floundered in a sea of bureaucracy .
Lorries will roll on both sides of the 170 - km ( 110 - mile ) Himalayan mountain highway which was the region ’s vital and only surface link with the rest of the world before the partition of subcontinent in 1947 .
For the time being , trade will take place just once a week , with a limited list of goods allowed .
Kashmiri handicrafts and apples will be exported from the Indian side , although it is unclear if carpets and shawls will be allowed across .
It will be the first time vehicles will be allowed across the ceasefire line and the newly constructed Aman Setu or Peace Bridge since the 1948 war , with the lorries expected to drive a few kilometers inside rival territory and unload .
Kashmir ’s governor N.N. Vohra said the opening of a trade route would be an “ important milestone ” in India - Pakistan relations .

India has moved slowly on opening up the borders , believing that they could boost separatist militant attacks on Indian forces from bases in Pakistan .
TERRITORIAL ISSUE
The South Asian neighbors who claim Kashmir in full but rule in parts have fought two wars over the region and were on the verge of a third in 2002 before pulling back from the brink .
The opening is the latest in tentative peace moves that have done little to resolve the central territorial issue .
But it does go toward meeting one of the demands of separatist groups , who have been leading months of anti-India protests , some of the biggest in years .
“ The trade between two Kashmirs is a good beginning .
Our ultimate aim is the line of control between two parts is removed , ” said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , chief of Kashmir ’s separatist alliance , the All Parties Hurriyat ( Freedom ) Conference .
Seven protesters were shot dead by Indian security forces in August when they marched to the border demanding the opening of the road to the Pakistani side .
At least 42 people have been killed by government forces and at least 1,000 wounded in the protests that followed .
The road also makes business sense .
It is all - weather and shorter than the other main trade route supplying Kashmir , a road to India that snakes through to the Hindu- majority Jammu region and is often blocked by snow in winter .
A bus service connecting Srinagar , Indian Kashmir ’s summer capital , and Muzaffarabad , capital of Pakistani Kashmir , was launched in 2005 , one of many confidence - building measures undertaken since the two sides began a peace process in 2004 .
But due to elaborate security checks , suffocating bureaucracy and mistrust , only 9,000 passengers from the divided region traveled across the ceasefire line since a “ peace bus ” was launched four years ago .

It ’s no secret that most men think about sex .
Whether it ’s having it , wanting it , or reminiscing about it , your mind often drifts into fantasy land when it comes to nature ’s most pleasurable activity .
But how many of us put in the time and effort to set the stage to live out these fantasies ?
If you ’re anything like me , you ’ve probably spent some time throughout your life focusing on keeping your body in peak shape , whether it ’s eating healthier , exercising , staying away from the toxins that affect your body .
And while staying active and a good diet are great for your sex life , how much do you really focus on your sexual health and sexual functioning specifically ?
Most men would answer not so much .
Before becoming a sexologist , I rarely thought about it .
We often take for granted a precious aspect of ourselves until it disappears or becomes inconsistent .
Then there ’s panic , self - doubt , anxiety , blows to self - esteem , our confidence dips , and inferiority sets in .
As a sex educator and sex therapist , I ’ve seen this pattern develop with far too many men when there ’s a shift in their sexual health and functioning .
What can we do about it ?
1. Introduction
The truth is , human bodies are forever changing and that includes their sexual expressions .
We need to begin to have real conversations and acknowledge that over time , we slowly move away from our 18 - year - old sexual functionality and our bodies change .
Everyone will experience it — at different times and in different ways — and you will too .
Eventually , your erection will become less consistent , maybe disappear .
Your sex drive will change , often slowing down throughout the lifespan .
Your ejaculation , once shooting through the walls to no more than a dribble .
Your semen will lessen over time , going from teaspoons to drops or no fluid .
Your refractory period after ejaculation , minutes in between erections can become days or more as you age .
Your body will change in many ways .
While some may view these changes as negative , aging will also change you for the better .
You ’ll be more mature than your 18 - year old self .
You ’ll be smarter , wiser , a better communicator , with a higher emotional IQ , you ’ll treat women with more admiration and respect , and you ’ll have more compassion and acceptance for people .
The sooner you begin accepting this and not dwelling on certain changes , the sooner you can begin to make the most of who you are in the moment .
The penis represents the majority of many men ’s sexual identities and dominates how they see themselves as sexual beings .
While there is more to sex than intercourse , erections , and penises , having an erection is a physically and psychologically pleasant experience , and it ’s not hard to see why men focus on them ( and particularly their absence , should they disappear . )
But besides praying , crossing your fingers , and hoping , what can you do to keep your sexual functioning in good sexual health ?
One of the answers is Kegel exercises .
For far too long , we ’ve associated Kegel exercises exclusively with women , particularly women doing them after pregnancy — for vaginal tightening or to combat post - pregnancy urinary incontinence — but rarely do we look at the benefits for men .
It ’s not surprising men have n’t even heard of Kegel exercises for their sexual health benefits , let alone started doing them .
Unfortunately , many cultures exclude sexual health information from young men ’s educations .
1. Discovering Kegel Exercises
Kegel exercises were discovered in 1948 by Dr. Arnold Kegel .
That ’s right — they ’ve been around nearly three - quarters of a century , and we ’re still trying to get the word out .
To do a Kegel is rather easy — and you ’ve probably done similar muscle contractions thousands of times without giving them much thought .
Each time you ejaculate , the orgasmic contractions squeeze and work your pelvic floor muscles ( PFMs ) .
Each time you squeeze out the last few drops after urinating , you also contract the same muscle group that Kegel exercises target .
To do a Kegel exercise , pretend as if you were stopping the flow of urine .
That same squeeze , the contract and release of the muscles that would stop the urine flow , is strengthening your PFMs .
Something less discussed by educators and doctors is the importance of also doing anal Kegel exercises .
Because the sphincter is comprised of muscle and intertwined with surrounding pelvic floor muscles , the anus can be contracted to strengthen the muscles around it as well .
2. Pelvic Floor Muscles ( PFMs )
Kegel exercises work specific muscle groups in the pelvic floor area to help strengthen and tone this region for improved medical and sexual health purposes .
There is a great deal of muscle and tissue in this area , as the PFMs act as an interwoven web within the pelvic regions and support the pelvic organs such as the uterus ( in women ) , the bladder , and the intestines .
Over time , these PFMs can stretch , become weaker , and lose tone — hence the need for Kegel exercises .
Within the PFMs , there are right and left levator ani muscles that comprise the bulk of the PFMs ; the pubococcygeus muscles , the puborectalis muscles , and the iliococcygeus muscles .
When you hear sex educators discuss the “ PC ” muscles being strengthened with Kegel exercises , they are referring to the main levator ani muscle , the pubococcygeus ( PC ) .
The PC muscle stretches front to back from your pelvic region through your internal genitalia , including your prostate , anus , and urethra , and ends in the coccyx region near your tailbone area .
All of these muscles form an interconnected web known as the pelvic floor muscles , running through your pelvis , and you need to keep them strong and toned in order to retain your sexual functionality as you age .
3. Penis
How does is the penis involved with Kegel exercises and stronger PFMs ?
Remember those interweaving muscles in the pelvic floor ?
Some of them actually connect to the base and root of the penis .
It makes sense ; your penis needs to attach to something — why not some muscles and ligaments ?
The penile bulb ( near the base ) has muscles called the bulbocavernosus and the ischiocavernosus that serve as bridge muscles attached to both the penis and PFMs .
When doing Kegel exercises , a man will feel his penis “ jump ” and slightly raise .
It ’s more visible with an erect penis than a flaccid penis , and you will see and / or feel a slight , upward movement .
The internal penis has three main cylindrical chambers , the corpus spongiosum and 2 larger chambers called the corpus cavernosum .
These chambers have muscle , tissue and blood vessels .
When erection is stimulated , these chambers ( mostly the 2 corpus cavernosum ) fill with blood to produce tumescence , the fancy word for erection or engorgement of the penis with blood .
As you ’ll see , Kegel exercises and blood flow to your erection go hand in hand .
2. Medical Impact of Kegel Exercises
1. Urinary Incontinence
There are a number of medical issues that benefit from Kegel exercises .
Urinary incontinence is an issue that people experience where their sphincter muscles associated with the bladder and urinary tract are weakened , allowing for urine to be expelled .
The incontinence is often noticed when people get up from a seated position , laugh , cough , or workout .
Sometimes leakage occurs after urination , which is called dribbling .
Kegels can help build stronger PFMs , which can increase the tone and strength of these muscles to help with involuntary urine leakage .
2. Anal Incontinence
What ’s good for the front door is also good for the backdoor .
Kegel exercises can also provide benefits for bowel urgency , incontinence , and leakage from your anus and rectum .
The PFMs that surround your backdoor area can also be strengthened to improve tone and strength in the anal sphincter and surrounding muscles to provide us with improved ability to manage incontinence .
In addition , anal Kegel exercises can be very helpful for people who engage in receptive receptive anal play to help create stronger sphincter muscles for better tone .
3. An Overactive Bladder
Have you ever had the feeling of needing to use the restroom immediately or often ?
An overactive bladder is associated with an urgent and / or frequent desire to urinate .
It ’s often triggered by a conditioned response , such as entering a bathroom or hearing running water .
Essentially , the muscles around the bladder contract , triggering a squeezing effect that creates the desire to want to urinate .
Because strong PFMs help us have better muscular control , Kegel exercises can help an individual inhibit the involuntary contractions and manage overactive bladder symptoms .
4. A Healthy Prostate
Strong PFMs have a positive effect on pelvic and urinary health .
It is believed that the prostate can also benefit from Kegel exercises as the circulatory benefits may have a positive effect on prostate enlargement symptoms and prostate health .
3. Sexual Concerns
Most people work out for a specific purpose ; to stay in shape , to look good , to feel more confident , health reasons .
Your sexual health should be no different , which can include your mental , emotional and physical health — as well as your attitudes about sexuality .
These all impact your sexual health .
When it comes to your physical sexual health , it ’s no secret that cardiovascular and muscle training is helpful for circulation and stamina benefits .
So exercises like jogging , hiking , weightlifting , and swimming can all be one of the many ways you stay in good sexual shape .
In addition , Kegel exercises are a fantastic exercise to incorporate vascular strength training to the pelvic areas that are often neglected .
Many of us experience sexual concerns .
It ’s a normative part of our sexual experience .
Almost all people at one time or another experience changes in their libido , erection , erogenous zones , orgasmic potential , ejaculatory experience , sensitivity levels , and desire .
But while Kegel exercises may not be the answer to all of your challenges in the bedroom , they can help you stay in better physical sexual health to improve , manage , or delay sexual concerns .
1. Performance Anxiety
Most sexologists will agree that the majority of people ’s sexual concerns have a psychological component .
The way you feel , your discomforts , and judgments about yourself can deeply impact your feelings of safety and security when it comes to becoming sexual and intimate .
Many people have fears , insecurities , body image struggles , low levels of confidence , mental health difficulties , and a host of other thoughts and feelings that may be present when they ’re getting sexual .
Performance anxiety is the culmination of biopsychosocial sexual distress .
Biologically , stress and anxiety creates cortisol and adrenaline , neither of which is helpful for penile circulation .
Psychologically , you may experience nervousness and worry associated with unrealistic or rigid expectations , as well as the fear of recreating negative experiences that have been painful or disheartening .
Socially , you may be struggling with concerns about your partner ’s reactions or judgments , which can feel shameful and embarrassing .
In addition , your performance anxiety can be associated with external stressors , from occupational anxiety and family difficulties , to partner and relationship troubles .
How do Kegel exercises help with performance anxiety ?
As a sex therapist , I have witnessed many clients gradually shift their mindset when working towards change .
Doing the work can help you feel like you ’re changing and exercises that have been shown to be helpful for sexual health often inspires , empowers and instills the seeds of confidence you need .
Take , for example , a person trying to lose weight for medical reasons by doing a daily walk .
That one walk , in itself , may not alleviate or manage the medical condition , but may help a person feel better about themselves , add to motivation , create a positive mindset , and be a step in the right direction .
Kegels alone cannot remedy deep - seated psychological anxieties or relational issues , but doing Kegel exercises can help you feel like you are working towards positive changes and improvements , can be mentally empowering , and can help you feel as though you are addressing your sexual concerns with a multifaceted approach .
2. Erectile Difficulties
One of the most difficult sexual concerns men deal with is the changes in their erectile functioning .
The DSM - 5 defines ED as a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain an erection with an accompanying distress and interpersonal difficulty .
While many men self - diagnose ED , we have to also be honest and realistic with our bodies and nature taking its course .
Many men create a barometer of virility in their youth and teen years , which then serves as a baseline for comparison of their erectile expectations throughout the lifespan .
You ’re really being unfair to yourself if you ’re expecting your penis to behave like it did when you were 18 .
Where an 18 - year - old man can curl 100 pounds , 20 years later he might be lucky if he could roll that 100 - pound bar a few feet .
Yet men tend not to feel the same anxiety , distress , or feelings of mourning the lost functionality of my biceps .
It ’s the changes with aging .
But with erections , many men hold their penises to an entirely different standard , unfortunately .
The truth is , erections typically become less reliable and more inconsistent as you age , and for a variety of reasons .
While each person is different , according to The Massachusetts Male Aging Study , about 40 % of men between 40 and 50 years old experience erection challenges , and this percentage rises about 10 % each subsequent decade .
Have realistic expectations about your erections .
Over time , your hardness will become less hard .
The speed at which you get erect will diminish .
The time you can remain hard will likely change , and sometimes your penis will decide it would rather be stubborn and not get hard , and other times your erection will tease you by making an appearance , then disappearing like a rabbit in a magician ’s hat .
It ’s nature and a part of life .
Some of the things you can do to manage these changes is to learn not to rely solely on erection , and embrace and incorporate foreplay , massage , your hands , sex toys , your mouth , kink , and other sensual and sexual experiences into your sexual scripts .
In addition , you can eat healthy and nutritionally , exercise regularly , work on your mental and emotional regulation , and of course , incorporate Kegel exercises .
Unfortunately , most of us add to our erectile difficulties with our lifestyles .
How many of the following are you currently doing , or have you done in the past ?
1 ) Smoking cigarettes , 2 ) Experiencing poor sleep quality , 3 ) Feeling high amounts of stress or anxiety , 4 ) Consuming large amounts of alcohol or doing drugs , 5 ) Avoiding regular workouts , 6 ) Spending significant amounts of time sitting every day , and 7 ) Eating poorly ?
These routines and lifestyles can affect your erections and possibly lead to medical issues — such as high blood pressure , poor circulation , nerve damage , hypertension , obesity , and diabetes — which can also result in the need for medications that can further inhibit erectile functionality .
Sometimes , the medical issues may arise with little lifestyle contribution , like neurological issues , hormone or endocrine changes , Peyronie ’s disease , or physical injuries to the brain , pelvis , penis , or spine .
Also , it ’s possible your mental health can be affected by those same lifestyle choices and medical issues — things like anxiety , mood changes , and depression struggles to name a few .
As well , psychotropic medications can impact your sexual functioning , including erections .
As valuable as Kegels may be , it ’s highly unlikely these exercises can overcome medical issues described .
However , changing your lifestyles and including Kegel exercises can be very beneficial in improving and maintaining your physical sexual health and erectile capacity .
Why ?
Kegels can improve circulatory functionality in the pelvic regions and penis for better circulation , which can be helpful maintenance against ED .
Blood flow is vital to getting an erection and the oxygenation of tissue and muscles , which helps keep surrounding muscles and tissue in peak shape and improves penile rigidity .
Pelvic floor muscle training can help with trapping blood inside the penis , thus helping to keep your erection .
Kegels can also strengthen the muscles and ligaments around your genitalia and pelvic floor to improve your erectile angle .
So yes , stronger erections can be experienced with doing Kegel exercises consistently .
3. Premature Ejaculation ( PE )
Premature ejaculation is the persistent or recurrent ejaculation before a person desires it where there is minimal sexual stimulation when it leads to distress or interpersonal difficulty .
People who experience premature ejaculation seem to experience it early on and it often continues throughout their lives .
Most studies find that about 30 % to 33 % of men identify having this difficulty , and the percentages remain in that range across ages .
If you ’re wondering how many minutes or seconds worth of sex counts as premature , focusing on the stopwatch is n’t how PE is characterized .
There ’s no “ right ” amount of time to last before ejaculating — it ’s more of a subjective determination that includes individual and partnered experience .
Many men want to last longer to emulate the long sex sessions they may see in porn , or believe that ’s what their partners want .
The only way to truly understand the situation would be to have an honest conversation with your partner .
Kegel exercises can be used to help prevent premature ejaculation when incorporated with the start / stop and squeeze methods , as well as with ejaculatory peaking or edging exercises .
When using these techniques , one can contract the pelvic floor muscles when nearing climax and ejaculatory inevitability .
Doing a long Kegel exercise at this point of no return helps inhibit ejaculation .
The benefits of the start / stop and squeeze methods are that they can help individuals become more aware of their penile , orgasmic , and ejaculatory sensory experience , help individuals learn to manage higher states of arousal and sensation , and elongate the plateau stage between desire , arousal and orgasm .
4. Ejaculation & Orgasm
Having weaker pelvic floor muscles may equate to less powerful orgasms and ejaculation .
Many men will notice later in life that their ejaculations went from a missile to a dribble .
Also , men may long for the days when the rhythmic contractions of orgasm felt like an earthquake .
Much of this can be attributed to aging and lack of pelvic floor muscle strength and tone .
Kegel exercises are associated with more intense orgasms and ejaculatory power because stronger muscles create more force during the emission and expulsion of semen .
In short , if you strengthen your PFMs , your ejaculatory trajectory will likely improve and the contractions you feel will likely feel stronger .
5. Male Multiple Orgasm
Strong pelvic floor muscles through Kegel exercises can also be used as part of the training to separate orgasm and ejaculation , allowing for male multiple orgasms .
Your body can learn to experience the rhythmic muscular contractions of orgasm without expelling semen through ejaculation .
The Kegel exercise is used to contract the pelvic floor muscles when ejaculation approaches , to allow orgasm to be experienced but ejaculation to be held back .
The benefits of male multiple orgasm is you wo n’t experience the after - effects of ejaculation , most notably loss or erection and a refractory period .
Learning this technique can take some training and time , but beneficial if longer sexual interactions is desired .
An excellent book to explore this is called The Multi-Orgasmic Man by Mantak Chia .
4. Workout Regimens
Now that you ’ve discovered the benefits and learned how to do a Kegel exercise , the next step is creating your own workout regimen and doing them consistently .
Here ’s a simple and effective version which you can adjust accordingly .
PFMs benefit from rest after workouts just like any other muscle .
Because the number one issue with doing Kegel exercises consistently is remembering to do them , try this easy regimen .
Do your Kegels in summer and winter ( rest in spring and fall ) .
Do them Monday , Wednesday , and Friday ( three times per week ) .
Each day , work out your PFMs in the morning , afternoon , and evening ( three times per day ) .
Each workout per day , do three sets of 20 repetitions for a total of 60 reps .
For your repetitions of 20 , try doing standard Kegel squeezes and hold / squeeze for three seconds on the fifth , 10th , 15th , and 20th repetition .
During the evening sets , focus on your anal Kegels with repetitions .
Essentially , you ’ll be doing 60 reps in the morning , 60 reps in the afternoon , and 60 reps at night , for three days per week for 12 weeks .
Then rest for 12 weeks .
Once you master your standard Kegel exercises , you can add resistance ( think weight training for increased strength and tone ) , such as a small hand towel that can be placed at the base of the erect penis and moved outward towards the tip when more weight is desired .
For advanced training , use a larger , heavier towel .
If you ’re a rebel and want to make up your own regimen , you should .
Some people create their own Kegel exercises routine ; to the beat of their favorite music , after they use the restroom , or during TV commercials .
There are also training modules you can purchase to help you with your workouts .
A male Kegel exercise product called Private Gym incorporates an exercise training CD that can be used to guide users , provides penile weights for resistance training , and an informative book called Male Pelvic Fitness by Andrew Siegel , M.D.
The book expands on the principles discussed in this article and includes additional information on pelvic fitness as well as the benefits of Pilates , core exercises , and stretches that support good pelvic health .
RELATED : Everything You Need To Know About Masturbation ( But Were Afraid To Ask )
There ’s no reason for you to not incorporate Kegel exercises into your life .
You have nothing to lose and everything to gain .
They ’re easy , they can be done anywhere , and they have numerous benefits for everyone .
So get them into your routine , be consistent , and your body with thank you in the long run .

The execution of juveniles is banned under an international convention
Human rights campaigners have welcomed an announcement by Iran that appears to end the execution of juveniles .
Iran is believed to be the country that executes the largest number of juvenile offenders - defined as those aged under 18 - in the world .
At least six youths have been executed in Iran this year alone .
The development came in the form of a directive announced by Iran 's deputy prosecutor general , Hossein Zebhi , broadcast by the state news agency .
He said that judges had been instructed to no longer impose the death penalty on juveniles .
But it is not clear yet precisely what legal force it has or whether a new law must go through parliament .
A lawyer who represents 25 juveniles under threat of execution said he had heard no word yet of the new directive .
Blood money
Some of his clients have been on death row for years , as negotiations continue over whether victims ' families will accept blood money - cash to avoid execution .
Iran is one of last remaining countries in the world that imposes the death penalty on juveniles aged under 18 at the time of the crime .
Human Rights campaigners say the practice is explicitly banned by the International Convention on the Rights of the Child , which Iran has signed and ratified .
In a statement , London - based human rights group Amnesty International said it welcomed the announcement .
This is it : the world 's fastest supercomputer .
Roadrunner took over the top spot in June and was able to fend off a stiff challenge from the Cray system at Oak Ridge .
In addition to being the world 's fastest , it 's one of the most energy - efficient supercomputers on the Top 500 list , requiring fewer than half the kilowatts used by the world 's second - fastest supercomputer .
Using x86 processors in conjunction with the same chips used by the Playstation 3 , Roadrunner ensures the safety and reliability of the nation 's nuclear weapons stockpile and is also used for research in astronomy , energy , the human genome and climate change .
Solar Energy Comes to the DOE Headquarters
One of the largest solar power systems in Washington , D.C. was inaugurated atop the Department of Energy ’s ( DOE ) Forrestal Building today ( 9-9-08 ) .
Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman , shown here , energized the system for the first time , saying :
“ The significance of this solar array is both practical and symbolic–it improves the way the Department consumes energy and it is a symbol of America ’s commitment to using the best available new technologies to confront the energy challenges we face today and will face tomorrow , ”
The system is expected to generate up to 205 MW hours of electricity a year , providing up to eight percent of the Forrestal complex ’s energy during peak hours , the equivalent to the energy used in 17 residential homes in a single year .
The system is about 40 to 50 percent the size of a typical residential PV system .
President Bush issued an Executive Order in 2007 , calling on all federal agencies to reduce energy intensity by 30 percent .
Bodman , in his remarks during the ceremony said ,
“ I determined that the Department of Energy should , and would , lead by example .
that we would be the first in the federal government to meet or exceed the efficiency , renewable energy , water , transportation and green building requiremens the President outlined . ”
He went on to say ,
“ Our goal is to attain a U.S. Green Building Council ’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , or LEED , gold rating for all DOE new construction and major renovation projects .
Moreover , we plan to meet or exceed the Energy Policy act requirement of having 7.5 percent of DOE ’S electricity provided by renewable energy by 2013 . ”
The Forrestal Building , owned by the DOE , is one of only two federally - owned and operated office buildings in Washington , D.C. to have earned the ENERGY STAR certification .
The other is the DOE ’s headquarters building in Germantown , MD .

Let The Games Begin
It 's that time of year .
Virginia Democratic officials say someone is handing out fliers in Hampton Roads that mislead Democrats and Independents into thinking the election is Wednesday , Nov. 5 .
The election is actually on Tuesday , Nov. 4 .
The flier , which includes numerous misspelled words , appears as if it is written on official State Board of Elections stationary .
" For Immediate Release , " it states .
" Due to the larger than expected voter turnout in this year 's electorial process ( the word electoral is misspelled ) , an emergency session of the General Assembly has adopted the following emergency regulations to ease the load on local electorial precincts and ensure the a fair electorial process . "
It continues , " All Republican party supporters and independent voters supporting Republican candidates shall vote on November 4th as pecribed by law .
All Democratic party supporters and independent voters supporting Democratic candidates shall vote on November 5th as adopted by emergency regulation of the Virginia General Assembly . "
Virginia Democrats say they had to battle similar misinformation campaign from GOP supporters in 2005 and 2006 , but some Republicans suspect Democrats are actually behind the efforts in order to generate stories about potential voter suppression .
Either way , expect a lot of this over the next week .
The Bush administration is working with Congress to fill in the details of its plan to take the bad mortgage - related debt off the books of banks and financial institutions and stabilize the financial markets .
With Congress scheduled to begin its election - year recess at the end of this week , the administration has little time to pull the plan together .
While the negotiations are going on , The New York Times asked three economists to offer their thoughts about the administration ’s actions .
Steven L. Schwarcz
Professor of law and business , Duke University School of Law
The proposal by the Treasury to use government money to purchase mortgage - backed securities held by financial institutions should defuse the financial crisis , but at a cost to taxpayers that unfortunately will be much higher than if the government had acted when markets first began to collapse .
It is , however , along with Treasury ’s Sept. 7 announcement that it will purchase securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the first serious attempt by government to cure the underlying financial disease and not merely treat its symptoms .
To cure the disease , government must focus on treating the loss of confidence in the financial markets .
The American International Group , Bear Stearns , Lehman and potentially other financial institutions are in trouble , not because of problems with economic fundamentals , but because of falling prices of mortgage - backed and other securities , requiring these institutions to mark their securities down to the collapsed market prices or triggering insurance obligations on these securities .
That , in turn , has created a downward death spiral of collapsing prices .
XeLaTeXを利用したプレゼンテーション
XeTeX/XeLaTeXは、UTF -8に対応したTeX/LaTeXで、多言語対応しています。また、texファイルからdviを経ずにpdfファイルを作成します。
元々MacOS X上で開発され、OSが認識するフォントをtexのフォントとして利用できるので、多書体を容易に使うことが出来ます。MacOS X版の他、LinuxやWindows版のバイナリ・ファイルが提供されています。これらのファイルは下記のサイトから入手できます。

XeTeX/XeLaTeXは開発中で、日本語の禁則処理など未完の部分もありますが、プレゼンに使うのであればそれほど支障は無いと思います。
pTeXとXeTeXの共存について
XeTeXは日本語処理についてはpTeXほど完成度が高くないので、日本語がメインである文書を作る際はpTeX/pLaTeXを使用し、プレゼンのためにXeTeX/XeLaTeXを利用するという使い方をするのであれば、両者をインストールしなければなりません。
MacOS Xの場合には、それぞれ別のディレクトリに置かれるので、ディスクの容量を気にしなければ、全く問題はありません。
pTeX : /usr/local / bin と /usr/local/share/texmf
XeTeX : /usr / texbin と /usr / local / texlive /
それぞれを、TeXShopから使う方法については下記を参照して下さい。
このページでは、インストール済みのXeLaTeXを用いてプレゼン用pdfファイルを作成する方法を紹介します。MacOS X上のXeLaTeXとTeXShopの使用を仮定していますが、他のOSについても参考となる事項もあるでしょう。プレゼンのためのlatexファイルの作成法については、

「 LaTeXを利用したプレゼンテーション 」 を参照してください。以下では次のパッケージを使用します。
foiltex
fontspec
foiltex はプレゼン用のクラス・ファイルで、使い方は「 LaTeXを利用したプレゼンテーション」で説明しています。デフォルトのフォントを20pt等と大きくし、romanフォントとしてsans serifを使うことでプレゼンに適した見やすい出力を作成するのに適しています。
fontspec はxelatexで、フォントの指定を容易にするパッケージです。使い方については付属のドキュメントやここを参考にして下さい。また、以下のサンプルを見れば、大体の使い方は分かると思います。
元来TeXには\fontというコマンドがあり、書体と大きさを定義していた。LaTeXの普及とともにあまり使われなくなったが、LaTeXを使わない場合は、
\font\lroman=cmr12 scaled \magstep1
等とプリアンブルに記入しておいて、本文で、フォントを切り替える箇所に\lromanなどと書いていました。
fontspecはこのようなフォントの指定を簡単に出来るマクロです。
1. LaTeXファイルの作成

システムのフォント・フォルダ内のファイル 生成されるファイル dviファイル pdfファイル
foiltexを使ったカラーのプレゼンファイルの作成法は既知であるとして、フォントの指定法を中心に説明します。まずサンプルファイルを見て下さい。texファイルはUTF-8コードで書かれていることが必要です。また、色の定義のために、colordef.texを読み込んでいます。
\ documentclass [ 20 pt , landscape ] {foils}
%
\usepackage [ dvipdfm ] {graphicx}
\usepackage {color}
\usepackage[cm - default ] {fontspec}
%
\input colordef.tex
１行目の documentclass で foiltexを指定し、文書のレイアウトをランドスケープ（横置き）にしている。そのためにtexファイルでページ・レイアウトを指定しています。（この数値は好みに応じて変えてください。）
graphicx パッケージのオプションを dvipdfm としています。これ は、epsファイルを図として取り込む際に、Ghostscriptによりpdfに変換させるためです。全ての図をpdfとする場合は、
\usepackage [ xetex ] {graphicx}
とします 。
fontspec のオプション cm-default は半角英数字として使うフォントをCM系にすることを意味しています。式を多用する場合はこれを指定すると良いでしょう。
その後に、フォントの指定が来ます。
\ def\minc{\fontspec[Scale=0.95 ]
{Hiragino Mincho Pro W3}}
\ def\bmin{\fontspec[Scale=0.95 ]
{Hiragino Mincho Pro W6}}
\ def\bgoth{\fontspec[Scale=0.96 ]
{Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro W6}}

\def\chalk{\fontspec{Chalkboard}}
\def\chalkb{\fontspec{Chalkboard-Bold}}
\def\centuryb{\fontspec{CenturyGothic-Bold}}
\def\courier{\fontspec{CourierNewPSMT}}
例えば、１行目は\mincという名前に、ヒラギノ明朝Pro-W3のフォントを登録します。但し、半角英字と並べる場合に、日本語フォントが少し大きめに感じるので、大きさを95%にスケールしています。ここでフォントの色を指定したり、フォントの属性（ファイルの置かれている場所、書体など）を指定できます。
フォントの名称は、次の何れかの方法で知ることができます。
fc-listコマンド
ターミナルで 、
fc-list > fontlist.txt
と実行すると、fontlist.txtに利用できるフォントの一覧が書き込まれます。但し、UTF-8ですので、必要であればnkfでコードを変換してください。

Finderの 「 情報を見る 」 （Mac OS X 10.6 以降）
Snow Leopardから、fontspecで指定するフォント名を「ポストスクリプト名」とするとうまくフォンを探せずにMetaFontが起動されるようになった。
そこで、 「
フルネーム」にしたところ、従来と同様にtypesetできるようになった。フォントのフルネームはfc-listで見ることもできるが、Mac OSのFinderでフォントファイルの情報を見ることで分かる。
例えば、ヒラギノ明 朝Pro W3の場合 、Postscript名は 「 HiraMinPro-W3 」 であり、ファイル名は 「 ヒラギノ明 朝 Pro W3.otf」である。（/Library/Fontsフォルダにある）
一方、フルネーム は 「 Hiragino Mincho Pro W3」であり、これをfontspecで指定する。
Font Book ( MacOS X 10.5.*以前の場合)
MacOS Xの 「 アプリケーション」フォルダにあるFont Bookを起動すると、利用できるフォントとそのサンプルや情報を見ることができます。
リストからフォントを選び、 「プレビュー」メニューの「フォント情報を表示」を選ぶと下の図のように、フォント情報が見られます。
このPostScript名にあるフォントの名称を使います。
フォントを指定するには、フォントを変更したいところで上記に定義したフォント・コマンドを書きます。サンプルは次のようになっています。
\red
\minc ヒラギノ明 朝Pro-W3 \ \ [ 5 mm ]
\bmin ヒラギノ明 朝Pro-W6 \ \ [ 5 mm ]
\blue
\ goth ヒラギノ角ゴシッ クPro-W3 \ \ [ 5 mm ]

%
{\fontspec [ Scale=1 ]
{DFPLeiSho-SB} DFP隷書体 }
このサンプルをタイプセットすると、出来上がりは次のようになっています。
2. Typeset
xelatex -- output - driver= " xdvipdfmx - q - E " foo.tex
#!/bin/tcsh
set path= ( $ path /usr/ texbin /usr/local/ bin )
xelatex " $ 1 "
この行を
xelatex -- output - driver = " xdvipdfmx - q - E " " $ 1 "
とする。
pTeXとXeTeXを共存して使う場合、コマンドラインでは入力するコマンドでどちらを使うのか区別できますが、TeXShopで使う場合には、コードとタイプセットするソフトを指定しなければなりません。通常は、TeXShopの環境設定で行いますが、ファイル毎に設定をし直すのも面倒です。通常は、日本語コードを「Japanese( ShiftJIS )」に、実行ファイル（設定プロファイル）をpTeX( Shift-JIS )にしておいて、texファイルの先頭行に次の２行を書き込んでおけば、TeXShopが設定よりこれを優先して処理します。（TeXから見ればコメント行です）

You thought we were done for the year , did n't you ?
We saw Barack Obama run the McCain - Palin slime gauntlet for months , while watching him called a terrorist and a socialist on a daily basis and witnessed a bottomless pit of ads for Congressional races in which Republicans accused Democratic candidates of everything but the Kennedy assassination -- and we thought it would all be over on November 4th .
No such luck .
As you know , we still have three undecided Senate races and Georgia 's Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss is back with a lying television ad that 's kind of a first cousin to the McCain offering that claimed Obama once wanted to teach sex education to kindergartners .
Coming from the same guy who in 2002 plumbed new lows by aligning triple - amputee war hero Max Cleland with Osama bin Laden in his campaign ads , Chambliss this time is entering the campaign for the December 2nd run-off election with an ad from the NRSC that 's not about what goodhas done for Georgians but about what fabrications should make them afraid of his opponent , Jim Martin .
"
If someone solicits a child for prostitution , should n't it be a felony ? " says the narrator in the latest piece of GOP campaign garbage .
" Jim Martin does n't think so .
Martin voted against tougher penalties for people who prey on children .
" Here 's the ad : It cites in little tiny print at the bottom , HB 1221 , which passed the Georgia House of Representatives in 1988 and that Martin did indeed vote against .
But as Lyin ' Saxby well knows , Martin wasin favor of such crimes being felonies and voted for the unified House - Senate version of the bill two week later that mandated exactly that .
The original bill as passed by the Georgia House on February 1 , 1988 , had a provision added that rendered the bill unconstitutional .
Because Martin knew that passing an unconstitutional law would lead to expensive litigation , he voted against that version of the bill .
The unconstitutional provision was removed in the Senate 's rewrite and , when it returned to the House for a final vote , Martin of course voted in favor of making child solicitation a felony .
But to Chambliss , ignoring that truth on this would have been as difficult as showing some respect for a highly - decorated Vietnam Veteran like Cleland , rather than assailing his patriotism .
I'm guessing what made this even more irresistible for Chambliss and the NRSC is the fact that Martin has always fought to protect children and that instinct was galvanized when his daughter Becky was kidnapped when she was 8 years old .
His child was returned safely but the experience left a mark on how important Martin considers laws protecting children -- and now he has to deal with Republicans runningparticular kind of false ad ?
“ Georgians want someone who will work with our next president to get America ’s economy back on track , ” Martin spokesperson Kate Hansen said .
“ Instead , Saxby Chambliss is launching the same old false attacks that made him famous .
" Or sothat we can all only hope he goes down in flames on December 2nd .
If you can spare just a few more campaign dollars , Jim Martin could use some help here
· Package depends on proof Mugabe not still in control · Power over police and bank become key tests
About £ 1bn in western aid to revive Zimbabwe 's economy will hang in the balance today as western donors watch to see how a power - sharing deal to be signed by President Robert Mugabe works in practice before committing a rescue package .
Under the deal with his arch-rival Morgan Tsvangirai , Mugabe is to surrender many of his powers for the first time in 28 years .
But though the agreement , to be formally signed today , marks a huge climbdown by Mugabe , foreign donors indicated that they want to see just how much power Tsvangirai wields as the new prime minister in the coalition government .
" We want to see this government in action before we commit our support to it , " said a European diplomat in Harare .
" We need to see Mugabe is not continuing to run things .
There will be benchmarks , litmus tests of who 's really in charge . "
Donors , including Britain , the EU and the US , are broadly agreed to inject about £ 1bn in aid over a year to reverse more than a decade of economic decline that has brought inflation above 20,000,000 % , mass unemployment , empty supermarket shelves and forced about 4 million people to leave the country to find work .
Agriculture has collapsed , leaving millions without sufficient food and reducing many to one meal every other day .
Tsvangirai will be keen to see the foreign money as soon as possible in the hope of bolstering public support by swiftly moving to alleviate people 's misery .
The power - sharing agreement brokered by the South African president , Thabo Mbeki , gives the opposition a majority of one in the cabinet and places Tsvangirai in charge of the daily administration of government .
When the 31 cabinet posts are divided in the coming days , Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change is likely to win control of the finance ministry because Mugabe recognises the donors will not want to see a Zanu - PF minister in charge of their funds .
But diplomats say that their governments will be looking for other signs that Tsvangirai is in control .
One test will be if the MDC gains authority over the police and if it is able to remove the highly partisan police commissioner , Augustine Chihuri , who said he would not salute Tsvangirai if he were elected president and whose force played an active part in the bloody assault on opposition supporters during the election .
Western donors are also keen to see the governor of the central bank , Gideon Gono , sacked because of his alleged role in the plunder of the country 's hard currency reserves and fuelling inflation by furiously printing money .
Nonetheless it will be difficult for western countries to turn their back on today 's watershed agreement because they risk being accused of failing to accept an African - mediated settlement .
The evident hostility and suspicion with which Mugabe regards Tsvangirai and the expectations of western governments was evident in a column in the state - run Herald newspaper by the president 's spokesman , George Chiramba , under a pseudonym .
It called the MDC in government the " enemy within " and accused it of taking its orders from Britain and other powers .
" For a party that has always relied on government and intellect for policy incubation , [ Zanu - PF ] has to learn to govern in a new environment where the enemy is within , well embedded , " Chiramba wrote .
" The west will now have an eager listening post , right up to cabinet .
There will be lots of policy pre-emption . "
Many Zimbabweans are cautious about the political settlement .
Lining up for bread in shops with otherwise bare shelves , or queuing for the pitiful 50 p - worth of currency they are permitted to withdraw from the bank each day , people are desperate for reasons to hope .
However , men such as Arthur Mubaiwa , who was part of a very long queue for petrol yesterday , say they know Mugabe and they do not have full confidence in Tsvangirai .
Hard drives have so many features these days , it can be hard to choose .
Do you really need SSD ?
What about Thunderbolt ?
Finding the perfect combination of looks , price , and features can be tough .
Whatever your storage needs , we ’ve made a list of the top five hard drives covering a range of purposes , along with an all - round budget option .
What Do You Need a Hard Drive For ?
In the era of cloud storage , hard drives might seem a rather antiquated solution .
But plenty of people still find them very useful as a mobile way to carry their files around or for backing - up , particularly gamers , photographers , and professionals with lots of data .
They ’re much cheaper than they used to be , along with being smaller , sleeker , faster and higher capacity .
There ’s tons of extra features too , from fingerprint protection to movie streaming .
Types of Hard Drives
The two main types are traditional hard drives ( HDDs ) , or the newer Solid - state drives ( SSDs ) .
Hard drives store data on spinning platters .
These platters can spin at speeds like 5,400rpm or 7,200rpm .
SSDs do n’t have spinning platters , but more modern ‘ flash cells ’ .
These are faster and more resistant to drops , since there ’s less moving parts .
A lot of people still buy hard drives , though , as they ’re much more affordable per byte of data .
This is particularly true when you get to high capacities .
RAID drives are composed of multiple HDD drives working together , enabling SSD - like speeds as well as other options like mirroring .
Top 5 Hard Drives
1 ADATA SE800
Image Source : Amazon
PROS
Super fast SSD
Waterproof / indestructible
Small and light
CONS
Slightly fiddly USB cap
Cables are short
This is a great all - round USB 3.1 Gen2 SSD , with the option of either 512GB or 1TB of storage .
It ’s practically indestructible , with a rugged chassis and rubber ends to protect from water and dust .
It ’s got an incredible IP68 rating , which is as yet unbeaten by another SSD , and better than the more expensive Samsung T7 .
This means instead of just being water - resistant like some hard drives , it ’s actually waterproof up to a depth of five feet for a crazy 30 minutes .
You can practically swim with it .
It ’s also dust - proof , and has a MIL - STD 810G rating , meaning it can survive drops up to four feet .
Despite its durability , it manages to remain incredibly small and light , with dimensions of just 2.9 x 1.7 x 0.5 inches and weighing just 1.4oz .
It would easily fit into your pocket .
Again this is smaller and lighter than the Samsung T7 .
It ’s also one of the sleekest - looking cases around , a curved design with a nice blue or black brushed - aluminium finish .
Speeds are also very impressive , with 915 MB /s read and 900 MB /s write speeds on a CrystalDiskMark test .
ADATA advertises1 GB / sec speeds , so they were close to that .
It includes both a USB-C and USB - A cable , which is a nice touch .
It also comes with a three - year warranty , longer than the typical two .
There ’s only two minor downsides .
First , all this waterproof stuff only applies if the rubber end is intact .
You have to take the cap off to insert the USB cable , and replace it carefully to ensure it stays water - tight .
Second , the included cables are very short .
Price - wise it ’s quite reasonable for an SSD .
Fast , small , light , indestructible , and not that expensive ?
This is definitely the best all - rounder SSD right now .
2 Buffalo MiniStation Extreme NFC
Image Source : Buffalo
PROS
Unique security features
Military - grade shock protection
CONS
Some compatibility issues
Storage for the security - conscious , the Buffalo MiniStation Extreme NFC is USB 3.0 and gives you a cool 1TB of storage as well as bringing something unique to the table : NFC unlocking .
First , it has an optional Secure mode , which means all your data will be protected by 256 - bit AES Full Disk Encryption ( FDE ) .
To access it , you ’ll have to enter a password .
However , instead of a password , you can also set it up to be unlocked by an near - field communication ( NFC ) - enabled device , like a smartphone .
To unlock it , just put your phone near to the hard drive , and voila .
Only one NFC device can be used at a time .
This is all very easy to set up via the preloaded Mode Changer software .
There ’s two modes : Open and Secure .
Open means no encryption and no password or smartphone unlocking .
Be aware that changing from one to the other means you have to reformat the drive , which will delete any current data you have stored .
So best choose your mode from the start .
Secure mode also only works with Windows and Macs , rather than other things like games consoles .
It also takes pains to protect your data physically as well as electronically , by being extremely shock - and water - resistant .
Hard drives are notoriously sensitive , so this is very welcome .
It has US Military - grade shock protection , with a rugged chassis and internal bumpers to absorb shock , so it can withstand drops of 1.2m .
It ’s also got an IPX3 rating for water resistance , and an IP5X rating for dust resistance .
This means it can handle water spray up to a 60 °C angle , and is almost dust - proof .
To top it off , it also has an inbuilt USB cable that you ca n’t lose .
It ’s strong and wraps easily around the hard drive .
All this does make it bulkier than most , though .
It measures 3.5 by 5 by 0.7 inches , almost twice the size of typical drives .
It ’s still portable , but you wo n’t be able to put it in your pocket .
There were also some compatibility issues ; the software does n’t seem to work on some older Windows computers , and the NFC feature did n’t work on iPhone 6 or 6 Plus’s .
Plus , all this extra protection puts the price at a slight premium for a 1TB HDD .
But if your data is particularly precious or private , such as business data , and you ’re constantly carting it around , the Buffalo is an ideal solution .
How about speeds ?
Write speeds are around 86 MB / s plugged into a USB 3.0 port , with read speeds of 95 MB / s .
It plummets to just 30 MB /s for a USB 2.0 port , though .
There ’s also a more expensive 2TB option .
3 LaCie 2big RAID

PROS
Up to 8TB of RAID
Lightning fast speeds
CONS
Not Thunderbolt - enabled
Very expensive
Are you a creative professional needing more than 2TB ?
The USB 3.0 LaCie 2 big is designed with you in mind .
It comes in both 4TB or staggering 8 or 16TB versions , with dual - bay Seagate IronWolf Pro RAID drives .
If you get the 8TB , it ’s comprised of two separate 4TB 7,200rpm spinning drives which you can set up to act as two separate drives , mirroring drives , or one big drive .
Using the drives together will give a performance boost .
It ’s dead easy to configure this by selecting the correct mode in the LaCie app .
If that was n’t enough , they ’re even hot - swappable , meaning you can swap drives around and put new ones in easily .
With such large storage , it is n’t the most portable , and resembles two bricks sitting on top of each other with dimensions of 3.5 x 4.6 x 8.5 inches .
It ’s a hefty 6.2 pounds in weight .
Aside from the size it ’s fairly attractive , aluminium gray with plastic black front panels and a large blue status light .
The light could be a bit distracting for some .
It reached a zippy 440 MB /s read and 384MB /s write speeds in the CrystalDiskMark test
The front panels opens like a door on a hinge so you can access the drives .
Rubber feet help absorb vibration , and there ’s lots of vents at the back and bottom to aid in cooling .
Everything else is on the back , including the USB 3.1 Type - A port .
It comes with both a USB-C to USB-C cable , and USB-C to USB - A cable .
This drive uses exFAT , meaning it ’s both Windows and Mac compatible .
You also get a cool five - year warranty , and five years of Rescue Data .
The fan automatically changes speeds based on temperature , and runs nice , quiet and cool .
Unfortunately it does n’t have Thunderbolt 3 , but this helps cuts down the price of an already expensive model .
If you need even more storage , check out the similar WD My Book Duo , where you can get up to 20TB .

PROS
Mind - boggling speeds
Encryption included
Robust yet attractive
CONS
Thunderbolt only
Expensive
Heavy
This is a truly lightning - fast SSD thanks to the combination of Thunderbolt 3 and NVMe .
We ’re talking up to 2.8 GB /s read speeds and 2.3 GB / s write speeds , putting it in a whole other league than anything on this list .
On a CrystalDiskMark test , it scored 3412 MB /s read speed and 1884 MB /s write speed .
However , it ’s limited to those with Thunderbolt devices only , since this device does n’t support USB ports .
It ’s got a nice glossy pebble - shaped body with a non -slip mat at the bottom .
Though the mix of the glossy metallic top and bright red base is a bit jarring .
Dimensions are 4.7 x 2.44 x 0.77 inches , which is small and pocket - shaped .
The magnesium body makes it very durable , and it can survive drops up to 45 cm , although it ’s not waterproof .
You can opt for 500GB , 1TB or 2TB .
There ’s one USB-C port and a long 18 inch Thunderbolt cable .
You ’ve got the security too , with optional AES 256 - bit encryption and password protection .
And it comes with a three year warranty .
On the downside , although it ’s small it ’s heavy , weighing 5.3 ounces .
This is over 3 times heavier than the ADATA SE800 , another SSD .
The speeds make it perfect for 4 k video editors or photographers .
It ’s pretty pricey , especially the higher capacity models , so probably only professionals will find the speeds worth the premium .
5 WD My Passport Wireless SSD

PROS
SD card reader and power bank
Long battery life
Impressive SSD speeds
CONS
Expensive
Only 2 year warranty
No USB - C cable
If you need or just want a wireless hard drive , WD My Passport Wireless SSD is currently the best of the bunch .
You can choose from a range of capacities : 256GB , 512GB , 1TB or 2TB .
It ’s not the sleekest - looking model around , gray plastic with a centre dip ringed with orange .
It looks more like a mini-router .
It is , however , very functional .
It ’s got a non-slip grip , and is able to survive drops of up to 1 meter thanks to the optional rubber bumper , making it great for on - the - go .
It measures 0.95 by 4.97 by 4.97 inches and weighs 15.6 ounces , which is pretty good for all those extra wireless features , and still makes it roughly pocket - sized .
There ’s in - built 802.11 ac
Wi -Fi , and an SD card reader that makes it very popular with photographers .
You can quickly backup your photos on the go , then , thanks to wifi , immediately view them on your smartphone / tablet via the My Cloud app .
It ’s also got a Li-Ion battery , giving you a cool 10 hours of use .
Lights on the device indicate both battery levels and the progress of SD card transfer progress .
Not to mention , it can also be used as a power bank to charge other devices with a 1.5A of power output .
Although it ’s wireless , it does provide a cable for faster wired transfers , too .
Plug this into a USB 3.0 or higher to get those SSD speeds .
However , the cable is for USB - A sockets , so if your laptop has the newer USB -C , you ’ll need to buy an adaptor .
Top speeds were 390.1 MB/s reads and 385.5 MB /s for writes , which are pretty impressive and knock HDD speeds out the park .
However , wireless speeds were obviously hugely lower , at just 17.5 MB /s for reads and 14.8 MB /s for writes .
Setup is easy , and there ’s a ton of optional advanced features , too , controllable via an intuitive dashboard .
For example , you can stream music , movies , etc , from the drive , with a resolution of up to 4 K .
You can also enable automatic backups as soon as you plug your SD card or USB card reader in .
It ’s an expensive model , to be sure , and we ’re a bit disappointed in only a two - year warranty at this price .
But bear in mind you ’re getting SSD speeds , an SD card reader , and an inbuilt power bank .
If this is out of your price range and you do n’t need all these features , try the Seagate Wireless Plus instead .
Best Budget Hard Drives
WD My Passport

PROS
Affordable
Packs up to 5TB in 2.5 inches
Encryption
CONS
Mac version more expensive
This is a very affordable , high - quality 1 to 5TB model packed into just 2.5 inches .
5TB is extremely high capacity for a portable drive , but you can also downgrade to 1 , 2 , or 4TB , which is just as great in value .
Dimensions are just 4.2x3x0.75 inches for the 5TB , which is extremely slim considering the capacity , and will still easily fit in a pocket .
Lower storage variants are even slimmer at 0.44 inches .
It ’s extremely attractive to boot , with a diagonal partially rippled surface and great blue , red , or black finish .
It comes with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port , a Micro - USB Type - B connector , and a cable .
The software is well above its class , including optional AES - 256 hardware encryption , along with password protection .
Excellent for such a cheap 5 TB model .
You can also forgo entering your password on computers you use regularly , a very handy feature .
There ’s a ton of other features with the software , too .
For example , you can download data from cloud or social media accounts , and automatically backup to Dropbox as well .
It ’s also not bad on speeds for a HDD , scoring 131MB /s read and 126MB /s write on the CrystalDiskMark test .
As a bonus , you get an above - average three year warranty in case anything goes wrong .
The only downside is for Mac users , where there ’s no 1TB version , plus you have to pay extra for a specific Mac version .
Not great .
It does come with an extra USB-C to Micro - B cable , though .
But if you do n’t want to pay extra , you can always reformat the Windows version to the HFS + file system .
( The Windows version comes with the NTFS file system ) .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) -- Alaska 's Personnel Board concluded Monday that Gov. Sarah Palin did not violate ethics law by trying to get her ex-brother - in - law fired from the state police , contradicting an earlier investigation 's findings .
" There is no probable cause to believe that the governor , or any other state official , violated the Alaska Executive Ethics
Act in connection with these matters , " Timothy Petumenos , the Anchorage lawyer hired to conduct the investigation , wrote in his final report .
The announcement comes a day before Palin and Republican presidential nominee John McCain face voters in Tuesday 's presidential election .
Allegations that Palin fired Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan in July because he refused to fire her sister 's ex-husband , Mike Wooten , have dogged her since before she became the GOP 's vice presidential nominee in August .
An earlier investigation launched by the state Legislature concluded Palin violated state ethics law by trying to get Wooten fired .
The law bars public officials from pursuing personal interest through official action .
That first inquiry -- led by legislative investigator Stephen Branchflower -- also concluded that Palin 's firing of Monegan likely stemmed in part from his refusal to fire Wooten , but that Palin 's firing of Monegan was within her authority as governor .
Despite the conclusions of Branchflower 's October 10 report , Palin declared that she had been " cleared of any legal wrongdoing " in the matter .
Her attorney , Thomas Van Flein , argued the Branchflower report had wrongly interpreted state ethics law .
Though the governor originally agreed to cooperate with the Legislature 's inquiry , she tried to stop the investigation once she became McCain 's running mate -- and campaign aides attacked the investigation as a partisan circus that was being manipulated by supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Instead , Palin asked the Personnel Board -- an executive branch agency whose members were appointed by her predecessor -- to handle the investigation , arguing it was the proper legal venue .
In a brief statement after Monday 's decision by the Personnel Board , Van Flein said Palin was pleased with Monday 's report .
" The governor is grateful that this investigation has provided a fair and impartial review of this matter and upholds the governor 's ability to take measures when necessary to ensure that Alaskans have the best possible team working to serve them , " Van Flein said .
Petumenos said he had been " working until midnight and beyond " to complete the report before the election and had hoped to deliver it to the Personnel Board last week .
" The Alaska Personnel Board has determined in this case , because there was already in some respect the sanction of public approbation and many conclusions and opinions reached with respect to this matter , that it was critical the report be issued now and in a timely fashion , " Petumenos said .
But he said he faced no " artificial deadlines " and disputed any suggestion that he was trying to affect Tuesday 's election with the report .
" If you think this was done to favor the governor politically , it would have been much more favorable for her to have received this days before now , " Petumenos said .
Petumenos said Branchflower had done a good job of collecting facts for the legislative inquiry .
But Petumenos said Branchflower did not have access to all the evidence that he did and that Branchflower 's legal analysis was " completely wrong . "
Petumenos questioned Palin and her husband , Todd Palin , on October 24 about Monegan 's removal from the commissioner 's post , which oversees the Alaska State Troopers .
Monegan told the earlier investigation that complaints about Wooten were the " central theme " of his 17 - month tenure .
Wooten had already received a five - day suspension in 2006 for using a Taser on his 11 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity , " illegally shooting a moose on his wife 's permit and driving his patrol car with an open beer -- complaints raised during his acrimonious divorce with Palin 's sister .
Monegan 's deputy , John Glass , told Branchflower that he warned Todd Palin that disciplinary action already had been taken against the trooper and that the governor risked " some extreme amount of discomfort and embarrassment " if she pushed the issue .
In August , Palin disclosed that members of her administration contacted Department of Public Safety officials about two dozen times about Wooten -- including one top aide whose call to a state police lieutenant had been recorded .
But Petumenos found little evidence that Palin knew of those contacts herself , and he said e-mails and interviews with the governor 's advisers corroborated Palin 's contention that Monegan was fired over budget disputes .
He also found that Alaska 's ethics laws are aimed at preventing officials from seeking financial advantage from their positions -- another break with Branchflower , who found Palin had violated state law by using her office to settle a family score .

Here 's looking into Gmail 's new features and what they promise .
New Gadgets
This week , Google opened Gmail to further user modification by allowing users to integrate Google Gadgets in Gmail 's left - hand navigation bar .
The company has provided two sample Gadgets -- Google Docs and Calendar ( modular mini applications ) .
While one provides a simple way to see your Google Calendar agenda and get an alert when you in a meeting , the other shows recently opened Google Docs files and lets you search across all of your documents right from within Gmail .
Emoticans
Emoticons have been available on Google Chat for quite some time , but this month they made their appearance on Gmail
Gmail Mobile version 2.0
Google has introduced Version 2.0 of Gmail for Mobile for J2ME - supported devices such as the Nokia N95 , as well as BlackBerry phones .
Google Goggles
For late night party drunkers Google has come up with a free email service that will check if users are really sure of want they are sending in the late night Friday email .
Canned Responses
These will allow Gmail users to save a reply they are writing as a `canned response ' and then quickly select one of these responses while replying to a future e-mail .
Canned Response feature is ideal for those tired of copying and pasting the same reply every time someone emails with a common question .
Contact manager
Google has also made a few changes to the contact manger in Gmail .
As a part of this change , Google has moved previously auto - added contacts back into Suggested Contacts .
Only contacts that a user has edited , imported or added to a group will remain in My Contacts .
Advanced IMAP controls
Advanced IMAP controls let users further streamline their Gmail IMAP experience .
Users can choose which labels to sync in IMAP .
This is useful if one finds mail client choking on Gmail / All Mail folder .
The IMAP protocol allows messages to be marked for deletion , a state where a message is still present in the folder but slated to be deleted the next time the folder is deleted .

Investigation into the “ Stolen Vote ” Proves Vote Count was Wrong
This is a story that has vastly been under reported .
As I first wrote about last September here , Democrats were accused of “ stealing ” a vote and defeated a bill with a few shenanigans .
The vote passed and Republicans cried foul .
This bill provides taxpayer funded benefits for illegal aliens .
It has been a year since this incident but the investigation is over and the final tally of the vote was wrong .
Democrats stole the vote after all .
The true tally of the vote could not be determined but one thing that we know for sure is that Democrats have shown us that they are not above skirting the rules to push their agenda .
Here is some reaction to the ruling :
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said in a statement that the outcome is “ another black eye for this Democrat - led Congress . ” Rep. Mike Pence ( Ind. ) , the ranking Republican on the committee , said the vote “ will forever be a black mark on the 110th Congress . ”
They are wrong however because nobody even knows that this happened .
Those that do just do n’t care .
The newest onslaught by President Bush against the American taxpayer is monumental in its enormity - and 700 Billion is only an estimate , on the low side I 'm sure .
As we witness this latest attack on the average American , it 's important to know " why " - this attack is occurring and what we can do to stop it .
Bush removed the face of democracy and replaced it with that of fascism when he demanded that American taxpayers foot the bill for the wealthy who have wrecked havoc upon our economy .
It insulted every true American alive to know that Bush wants to bail out the perpetrators of this economic crisis rather than the victims -- proof positive that Bush has no compassion or any bridge that would lead him to identify with the Average American .
We have a President that has disengaged himself from the American people whose policy is made by Cheney and the key corporations that exert the most influence over the White House .
This last ( maybe - ) act against the people can be defeated , much as we did when S1959 was temporarily shelved .
In that instance , Americans came together and it was one of the largest outpouring of public disenfranchisement Congress had seen for ages .
There was already a press blackout on the matter , and the Bill was quietly shelved .
" The people " - won a huge victory , but back then , we had more time .
As it pertains to Bush 's historic Bail - out , we only have days , and the outrage needs to be felt as it was when they attempted to pass S - 1959 , the Thought Crime Prevention Bill .
It 's vital for all of us to understand how important defeating this Bill , with its current language , is as we attempt to outlast Bush and hold on to as many civil liberties we can before he causes further harm to our nation , if and when he departs the White House in shame .
The rich and powerful have exhibited greed beyond comprehension , and they are looking for Bush to bail them out at taxpayer expense .
This is unacceptable to any freedom - loving taxpayer .
It 's a blatant case of taxation without representation - and the long - term effects to our economy and " Middle - America " - have n't even been calculated - so none of us are aware of how this bail - out will affect future generations .
I believe that the support of the corporations and the wealthy have been instrumental in forestalling any efforts to impeach this President .
However , if he he is handed a resounding defeat , and the " Elitists " - of this and other nations lose billions of dollars , their support of Bush will evaporate faster than you can say " evil - doers " - with a straight face .
This is a chance to vote for freedom instead of fascism and let our Congress know , in no uncertain terms , that " enough is enough . " -
Billions of dollars have evaporated in Iraq because we have allowed the insane to run the asylum .
This is another example of Prescott Bush 's dreams coming to fruition , and Americans need to understand the history of treachery and treason that has been an integral part of the Bush Family history and legacy .
Read :
The Bush Crime Family : Three Generations of Treason
It 's important to have a basic knowledge of the Bush family and why what many thought were " conspiracy theories " - are instead based on fact and substantiation , not speculation .
If you back Bush 's bail - out program , take a gooD look in the mirror ; are you backing it because it's a sound financial plan , or are you backing it because of his scare tactics .
Based on previous articles I 've published , I believe that our economy is doomed to slide into a recession / depression no matter what we do , short of impeaching Bush and Cheney .
To give the rich and powerful the protection of tax dollars while they were busy raping our economy is madness .
Today and tomorrow , and for as long as it takes we must stand - up for liberty and freedom , say no to subsidizing the rich with taxpayer money -- and make Congress understand the public has had enough .
For expediency , I 'm using a phone number list from a previous post .
We did it on S 1959 , and if enough of us participate , we may be able to influence the bail - out proceedings .
It 's our country , let 's fight for it !
William Cormier
NOTE : This is CNN 's latest on the bail - out crisis .
McCain takes hit from bailout collapse
This is an issue that is not guaranteed to pass , and right now , those Senators that are holding - tough need to hear it from the people so they know that ultimately , their vote for was the people .
See The White House Phone Directory ( May 18 , 2007 ) .
Because I figure the regular switchboard might be busy tomorrow , but if you 've got the White House phone directory , you can just work your way down until somebody picks up .
( Actually , in the spirit of CD interviewing people , it might be more interesting and fun to say " Hi ! I write for ______________.
Do you think that Libby 's commuted sentence involved obstruction of justice ?
Why or why not ? " -)
Most of the numbers in the Directory match what I 've been able to glean from open sources , so it looks authentic .

Ever since OPEC vexed Jimmy Carter into wearing a cardigan , telecommuting has been touted as a fix for what ails the US office worker — the agony and expense of commuting , the drudgery of cubicles , the shortage of family time .
Long before the advent of the Web , evangelists were confident that cordless phones and faxes had already made the office a relic .
" Working from home holds the promise of a new American dream , " Paul and Sarah Edwards gushed in their 1985 manifesto , Working From Home , in which they extolled the virtues of commuting from breakfast nook to den .
Two decades later , however , most workers still trudge to the office .
Though a third of the more than 150 million working Americans telecommute at least occasionally , most do so just a few days each month .
Only 40 percent of companies permit any sort of work - at - home arrangement , which means most insist on full - time attendance .
According to a 2006 survey by the Telework Exchange , the top fear among resisters is that they 'll lose control of their employees , whom they doubtlessly envision frittering away the hours between 9 and 5 playing Minesweeper and munching Cheetos .
Telecommuting 's foes could n't be more misguided .
When gasoline costs $ 4 a gallon , companies should n't just be doing all they can to expand telecommuting — they should be scrapping their offices entirely .
No , not turning them into toy - filled communal spaces , as advertising titan Chiat / Day infamously did in the early - '90s , but abandoning them outright .
That might sound a bit radical to those who swear by the office 's supposed benefits , like camaraderie and face - to - face collaboration .
But time and again , studies have shown that telecommuters are every bit as engaged as their cubicle - bound brethren — and happier and more productive to boot .
Last year , researchers from Penn State analyzed 46 studies of telecommuting conducted over two decades and covering almost 13,000 employees .
Their sweeping inquiry concluded that working from home has " favorable effects on perceived autonomy , work - family conflict , job satisfaction , performance , turnover intent , and stress . "
The only demonstrable drawback is a slight fraying of the relationships between telecommuters and their colleagues back at headquarters — largely because of jealousy on the part of the latter group .
That 's the first problem you solve when you kill your office .
Earlier this year , an IDC report from Asia found that 81 percent of managers believe telecommuting improves productivity , up from 61 percent in 2005 .
The increase is attributable largely to the proliferation of unified communications technologies — tools that connect mobile and remote workers .
These include products like LifeSize Express , the first hi-def videoconferencing system priced at less than $ 5,000 , as well as Web - based services like Google Docs and Glance , which let users view a remote colleague 's onscreen work in real time ( in the case of Glance , with cursor movements and all ) .
The traditional office , meanwhile , remains a black hole of interruptions , procrastination , and soul - crushing politics .
According to Gloria Mark , an informatics professor at UC Irvine , the typical office worker is interrupted or switches tasks every three minutes — hardly enough time to accomplish anything of substance .
True , there is value to getting folks together under one roof , but those gatherings need n't occur every day .
Instead of leasing traditional offices — currently averaging around $ 21.25 per square foot annually , and a quarter of that is typically either vacant or underutilized — companies could join meeting - room cooperatives , which allow firms to assemble when necessary .
Given that it costs more than $ 15,000 per year to provide an employee with 200 square feet of cubicle , the savings would be significant — so great , in fact , that companies would still come out thousands of dollars ahead after springing for workers ' broadband and VoIP expenses .
Ditching the office could also provide businesses with a leg up in the scramble to recruit and retain talent .
For starters , location would no longer limit a company 's employment pool — gifted Kansans would n't be forced to uproot their lives for opportunities in , say , California .
Also , based on the average American 's commute time , driving speed , and vehicle specs — and assuming that gas costs $ 4 per gallon — a telecommuter would save around $ 1,200 a year on fuel alone — an instant salary bump , of sorts .
Perhaps you 've been an office drone for so long that you can't imagine life without fuzzy , low - slung cubicle walls .
Well , given that the typical American house is now over 2,500 square feet — up more than 60 percent since the early ' 70s — surely you can find room to build your own cube .
Add some stale coffee and a buzzing fluorescent light and it will feel just like ... well , you know where .

LONDON , Nov. 17 ( UPI ) -- A British inventor has created the Searaser -- a device that uses the motion of waves to pump water uphill to drive hydroelectric generators .
The Times of London reported prototype testing shows the device can pump more than 160 feet of water uphill through a pipe the diameter of a saucer .
The full - size device is expected to pump water at least 650 feet .

Inventor Alvin Smith , an engineer , said he designed the device to help Britain end its reliance on fossil fuels .
He said the Searaser could also be used to pump desalinated water inland in dry countries .
The device could help Britain meet its target of getting 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources , the newspaper said .
The wave pump consists of two floats fitted to a double - acting piston .
Water is pumped as the floats are pushed together and then forced apart by the motion of the waves .
Smith said one full - size device should be able to pump enough water to keep 470 homes supplied with electricity .
Daredevil 14 - year - old becomes youngest ever national jet - ski freestyle champion
He looks as if he is clinging on for dear life .
But Jack Moule is in total control .
Leaping 6ft in the air is just one of the spectacular stunts that saw the 14 - year - old become the UK Jetski Freestyle Champion , the youngest winner of the title , beating competitors more than three times his age in both the professional and amateur classes .
He was only allowed to start riding a jetski on his own 18 months ago , but since then has perfected a string of spectacular stunts .
Teenage sensation : Jack performs one of his moves as the jet - ski completely leaves the water in a 6ft vertical jump
His signature moves include the nose stab - in which the jet ski leaps out of the water before landing nose - first vertically - and the incredible barrel - roll , where he forward loops the entire machine in mid-air .
Jack spent his summer touring the country with parents Suzan , 39 , and Ian , 46 , competing in all six rounds of the tour and beat more than 90 competitors .
Weighing in at eight - and - a - half stone and standing just 5 ' 4 " , Jack wowed judges with top - class flips , spins and rolls on his 22 stone jet - ski .
Champion : Jack Moule is the youngest ever winner of the UK Jet - Ski Freestyle National Tour at the tender age of 14
He clinched double victory at the final round in Burton - on - Trent , Staffordshire , winning the amateur competition by an amazing 41 points , and the professional class by 13 .
In the freestyle competition riders have two minutes to impress five judges with their jet - skiing skills .
They are marked on the number on quality of tricks they can fit in , and the fluency with which they link them together .
Making waves :
The teenager beat people three times his age with moves like this one during six rounds of competition
Up and over : Jack toured the country winning 117 out of 120 points in the amateur competition and 107 in the professional class
Riders are awarded 20 points for a first - place performance , 17 for second and 15 for third .
Jack swept to victory with 117 points out of a possible 120 in the amateur competition - meaning he won all rounds bar one on the tour - and 107 in the professional class .
His older fellow competitors , many of who are also trying to break into the British team , range in age from 17 to 45 .
Jack , from Markyate , Hertfordshire , has only been freestyling for 18 - months since he was deemed old enough to ride his own jet - ski .
The Jet -Ski Freestyle National Tour , billed as a stepping stone to the British championships , is the first competition he has entered .
On top : Jack about to perform a submarine manoeuvre , above , and below prepares to land after completing a 360 degree barrel roll
Jack said : ' I love jet - skiing - it 's just an absolutely brilliant sport and even the training is good fun .
' What I really want to do is go all the way and become world champion .
' Sport is all about football for most of my friends at school but I wanted to try something different and more extreme . '
Jack hopes to compete in the World Championships at Lake Havasu , in Arizona , USA , in 2010 .
Founder of the Jet - Ski Freestyle National Tour and five times British champion Keith Rimmer , 44 , thinks Jack has the potential to go all the way and become World Champion .
He said : ' He 's a lovely lad and has got the nerve and the natural talent to win big .
' I am very confident that Jack will end up as world number one , although I have warned him not to burn out too young .
' Because he 's young and he 's active he heals a lot better than us oldies if he gets hurt at all .
The youngster has only been freestyle jet - skiing for 18 months
' Jack 's had an incredible first season .
He was so far ahead in the amateur competition he did n't even need to compete in the final round to win . '
Keith , a construction training assessor , set up the Jet - Ski Freestyle National
Tour five years ago to encourage more youngsters to take up the sport , and has been delighted to see its popularity rocket .
He said : ' It 's not just a competition , it 's a community .
The camaraderie is excellent .'
Jack 's parents are both keen jet - skiers and father Ian , a car mechanic , helps fix and maintain his son's machine .
Proud Suzan , a housewife , said : ' He makes the ski look as light as a feather and he 's just such talent .
' He 's already made history as the youngest ever winner of the freestyle national tour and I think he 'll go far because he 's such a natural .
' Jet - skiing is a really fantastic hobby .
Hopefully Jack can help put it on the map and get other kids interested . '
Thanksgiving is upon us , which means more than 41 million Americans will be shoving off in planes , trains and automobiles to spend the holiday somewhere more than 50 miles from home .
But even with gas prices hovering around two bucks a gallon , there will be fewer people on the road for the first time since 2002 , the American Automobile Association says .
Air travel will be down 7.2 percent and 1.2 percent fewer people will make a road trip this year , according to the Triple A annual survey of holiday travel .
On the other hand , some 180,000 people more people are expected to hop on a train or a bus .
The modest decline in people heading out to the highway or leaving on a jet plane has less to do with gridlocked traffic and hellish airports than the economic downturn .
" The overall state of the economy continues to present real challenges for some Americans looking to travel this Thanksgiving , " Robert L. Darbelnet , AAA president and CEO , said .
" However , the desire to spend time with family , combined with significantly lower gasoline prices than earlier this year , will provide a strong impetus for many Americans to travel . "
This is the first Thanksgiving holiday season since 2002 to see a decline in holiday travel and the fourth consecutive travel holiday of the year to see a year - to - year decline in the number of people hitting the road or taking to the skies .
But what 's amazing is despite the guaranteed hassles of a Thanksgiving getaway , millions of people throw common sense to the wind and make the same arduous trek every year .
And we do it despite our common sense , knowing that the roads can be dangerous and our license plates may be photographed , located on a GPS
map and logged into a database , at least in Arizona .
Is it the awesome horsepower of a mother ’s guilt , an unconscious inability to spend two consecutive weekdays days off at home or just the purely compulsive nature of traditional culture ?
Whatever it is that jams up nearly every out - bound lane on every metropolitan freeway in America on the Wednesday afternoon before Turkey Day probably is n’t going away .
So we ’d be grateful to know how those of you making a trip this weekend will avoid the traffic comes along with Thanksgiving ?
General tips are appreciated .
But you can post actual route numbers , freeways and airport names if you got them .

The plan to rescue the US financial industry arrogates virtually unlimited money and power over the financial affairs of the state to the office of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
Paulson is a figure with a long history of intimate connections to the political and financial elite .
In 1970 , fresh from the Masters program of the Harvard Business School , Paulson entered the Nixon administration , working first as staff assistant to the assistant secretary of defense .
In 1972 - 73 , Paulson worked as office assistant to John Erlichman , assistant to the president for domestic affairs .
Erlichman was one of the key figures involved in organizing President Richard Nixon ’s notorious “ plumbers ” unit that carried out illegal covert operations against the president ’s political opponents , including espionage , blackmail , and revenge .
Ehlichman resigned in 1973 , and in 1975 he was convicted of obstruction of justice , perjury , and conspiracy , and was imprisoned for 18 months .
Utilizing his connections , Paulson went to work for Goldman Sachs in 1974 .
In a 2007 feature , the British newspaper the Guardian wrote , “ Not only was he well connected enough to get the job [ in the Nixon White House ] , but well connected enough to resign in the thick of the Watergate scandal without ever getting caught up in the fallout .
He went straight to Goldman back home in Illinois . ”
Paulson rose through the ranks of Goldman Sachs , becoming a partner in 1982 , co-head of investment banking in 1990 , chief operating officer in 1994 .
In 1998 he forced out his co-chairman Jon Corzine “ in what amounted to a coup , ” according to New York Times economics correspondent Floyd Norris , and took over the post of CEO .
Goldman Sachs is perhaps the single best - connected Wall Street firm .
Its executives routinely go in and out of top government posts .
Corzine went on to become US senator from New Jersey and is now the state ’s governor .
Corzine ’s predecessor , Stephen Friedman , served in the Bush administration as assistant to the president for economic policy and as chairman of the National Economic Council ( NEC ) .
Friedman ’s predecessor as Goldman Sachs CEO , Robert Rubin , served as chairman of the NEC and later treasury secretary under Bill Clinton .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Agence France Press , in a 2006 article on Paulson ’s appointment , “ Has Goldman Sachs Taken Over the Bush Administration ? ” noted that , in addition to Paulson , “ [t ] he president ’s chief of staff , Josh Bolten , and the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , Jeffery Reuben , are Goldman alumni . ”
“ But the flow goes both ways , ” the article continued , “ Goldman recently hired Robert Zoellick , who stepped down as the US deputy secretary of state , and Faryar Shirzad , who worked as one of Bush ’s national security advisors . ”
Prior to being selected as treasury secretary , Paulson was a major individual campaign contributor to Republican candidates , giving over $ 336,000 of his own money between 1998 and 2006 .
Since taking office , Paulson has overseen the destruction of three of Goldman Sachs ’ rivals .
In March , Paulson helped arrange the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase .
Then , a little more than a week ago , he allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse , while simultaneously organizing the absorption of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America .
This left only Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as major investment banks , both of which were converted on Sunday into bank holding companies , a move that effectively ended the existence of the investment bank as a distinct economic form .
In the months leading up to his proposed $ 700 billion bailout of the financial industry , Paulson had already used his office to dole out hundreds of billions of dollars .
After his July 2008 proposal for $ 70 billion to resolve the insolvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failed , Paulson organized the government takeover of the two mortgage - lending giants for an immediate $ 200 billion price tag , while making the government potentially liable for hundreds of billions more in bad debt .
He then organized a federal purchase of an 80 percent stake in the giant insurer American International Group ( AIG ) at a cost of $ 85 billion .
These bailouts have been designed to prevent a chain reaction collapse of the world economy , but more importantly they aimed to insulate and even reward the wealthy shareholders , like Paulson , primarily responsible for the financial collapse .
Paulson bears a considerable amount of personal responsibility for the crisis .
Paulson , according to a celebratory 2006 BusinessWeek article entitled “ Mr. Risk Goes to Washington , ” was “ one of the key architects of a more daring Wall Street , where securities firms are taking greater and greater chances in their pursuit of profits . ”
Under Paulson ’s watch , that meant “ taking on more debt : $ 100 billion in long - term debt in 2005 , compared with about $ 20 billion in 1999 .
It means placing big bets on all sorts of exotic derivatives and other securities . ”
According to the International Herald Tribune , Paulson “ was one of the first Wall Street leaders to recognize how drastically investment banks could enhance their profitability by betting with their own capital instead of acting as mere intermediaries . ”
Paulson “ stubbornly assert[ed ]
Goldman ’s right to invest in , advise on and finance deals , regardless of potential conflicts . ”
Paulson then handsomely benefited from the speculative boom .
This wealth was based on financial manipulation and did nothing to create real value in the economy .
On the contrary , the extraordinary enrichment of individuals like Paulson was the corollary to the dismantling of the real economy , the bankrupting of the government , and the impoverishment of masses the world over .
Paulson was compensated to the tune of $ 30 million in 2004 and took home $ 37 million in 2005 .
In his career at Goldman Sachs he built up a personal net worth of over $ 700 million , according to estimates .
After Paulson ’s ascension to the treasury , his colleagues at Goldman Sachs carried on the bonanza .
At the end of 2006 , Paulson ’s successor Lloyd Blankfein was handed over a $ 53.4 million year - end bonus , while 11 other Goldman Sachs executives raked in $ 150 million in year - end bonuses combined .
That year , the top investment firms Goldman Sacks , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , Lehman Brothers , and Bear Stearns handed out $ 36 billion in bonuses .
At the end of 2007 , the executives of the same firms , excepting Merrill , were handed another $ 30 billion .

You 'll fit right in being poor in Berlin 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
If you show up in Berlin strapped for cash , you 're in good company .
The German capital 's sizable student population , high unemployment rate and swelling starving artist contingent makes penny - pinching a citywide obsession .
This is , after all , the city that has not only been dubbed one of the hippest in Europe because of its raging nightlife , plethora of museums , independent art galleries and concert spaces , but it 's also known for being wracked with debt .
So much so that in 2003 , Mayor Klaus Wowereit lent it the accidental slogan : " We 're poor , but sexy . "
Getting around
The BVG , which operates the trams , subways and buses , can whisk you from east to west Berlin for the equivalent of $ 2.65 .
It 's a real bargain when you consider the lengths East Berliners once went to .
A Berlin Welcome Card provides 48 or 72 hours of unlimited travel on public transportation for $ 21 and $ 27 , respectively .
Of course if the weather 's favorable and you need to burn off the beer belly you acquired in Munich , Berlin is incredibly bicycle - friendly , with bike lanes on most major thoroughfares .
Bike rentals tend to go for about $ 15 a day throughout the city .
Plan your route with bbbike.radzeit.de/cgi-bin/bbbike.en.cgi .
Another option is the super - budget bike hire from Regenbogenfabrik , www.regenbogenfabrik.de, from about $ 6 a day .

The Hill
October 22 , 2008
Police departments in cities across the country are beefing up their ranks for Election Day , preparing for possible civil unrest and riots after the historic presidential contest .
Public safety officials said in interviews with The Hill that the election , which will end with either the nation ’s first black president or its first female vice president , demanded a stronger police presence .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Some worry that if Barack Obama loses and there is suspicion of foul play in the election , violence could ensue in cities with large black populations .
Others based the need for enhanced patrols on past riots in urban areas ( following professional sports events ) and also on Internet rumors .
Democratic strategists and advocates for black voters say they understand officers wanting to keep the peace , but caution that excessive police presence could intimidate voters .
Sen. Obama ( Ill. ) , the Democratic nominee for president , has seen his lead over rival Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) grow in recent weeks , prompting speculation that there could be a violent backlash if he loses unexpectedly .
Cities that have suffered unrest before , such as Detroit , Chicago , Oakland and Philadelphia , will have extra police deployed .
In Oakland , the police will deploy extra units trained in riot control , as well as extra traffic police , and even put SWAT teams on standby .
“ Are we anticipating it will be a riot situation ?
No .
But will we be prepared if it goes awry ?
Yes , ” said Jeff Thomason , spokesman for the Oakland Police Department .

The weirdest messiest Halloween mask I ever saw .
( CNN ) -- A British man was jailed Tuesday for raping two of his daughters and fathering nine children over 27 years , a case with echoes of Austria 's Josef Fritzl .
The two daughters were made pregnant 19 times ; there were nine births , five miscarriages and five terminations .
Seven of the children are alive but suffer genetic deformities .
The father , who cannot be named for legal reasons banning the identification of his victims and the surviving children , pleaded guilty Tuesday at Sheffield Crown Court , northern England , and was sentenced to serve 25 life sentences to run concurrently .
The judge said the minimum term the 56 - year - old rapist should serve in jail should be 19 ½ years .
South Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Simon
Torr said , " The victims of these terrible crimes have asked me to state the following : ' His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again .
The suffering he has caused will continue for many years , and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives . ' "
Speaking for the police , Torr added , " The main concern ... is for those who have been so badly affected : the victims who have suffered a terrible ordeal .
We will continue to offer them our full support to try and help them get on with their lives .
" As far as the sentence goes , we are satisfied that this offender has received the strongest possible punishment for his heinous crimes .
Now we need to ensure continuing support for those who have suffered as a result of his actions . "
The daughters first told police about their ordeal in June , but the abuse dated to 1981 .
It emerged that in 1998 one daughter rang Childline , a charity to help abused kids , and asked for assurances about being able to keep her children if she came forward .
When Childline could not make that guarantee , the daughter did nothing more to raise her plight .
Watch how the case came to light »
The UK's Press Association reported that the rapes began in 1981 with daily attacks and that for long periods , they would be raped up to three times a week , and the assaults would continue through pregnancies .
Their only reprieve came after they had just given birth or when they were ill because of the abuse .
If either daughter tried to refuse their father 's attacks , they would be punched , kicked and or held to the flames of a gas fire , burning their eyes and arms , PA reported .
Despite visiting hospitals and meeting with social workers over the 27 years of abuse , no investigation was launched into the family .
The case comes in the wake of the death of a baby , known only as Baby P , which has dominated headlines in Britain .
The baby endured horrendous torture and died despite being on the local authority 's child protection register .
In Austria this year , Josef Fritzl was arrested , accused of keeping his daughter in a basement dungeon and fathering seven children through the rapes .

Sixty - one days and counting : if your stash contains any material that is or may fall foul of the Government ’s new laws on extreme porn , then that is how long you have left to destroy it or otherwise get rid of it .
Because , courtesy of Consenting Adult Action Network ( CAAN ) , The Register can reveal today that the law is going live on 26 January 2009 .
Sections 62 to 67 of the Criminal Justice Act 2008 , passed in May of this year , make it a criminal offence punishable by up to three years in prison to possess material that is both pornographic and extreme .
" Pornographic " is defined as being produced for the purposes of sexual arousal .
" Extreme " includes acts which threaten a person ’s life , results , or is likely to result , in serious injury to a person ’s anus , breasts or genitals , involves sexual interference with a human corpse , or sex with an animal ( dead or alive ) .
In addition , the picture must be grossly offensive , disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character and " a reasonable person " would consider the action depicted to be real .
Possibly the sort of picture that can be found here ( NSFW ) .
It is staged by members of The Register ’s favourite horror burlesque group , the Satanic Sluts , and the activity in the picture is totally legal , in the sense that the participants have staged it .
There 's make - up and loads of fake blood , but unless we have missed something the girl in the foreground has not been harmed in any way .
Therefore , those involved may quite legally act out this scene .
However , as far as the new law is concerned , it is probably pornographic : it depicts real harm being carried out in a realistic way – possibly even interference with a dead person - and , if a jury decided that the scene was grossly offensive , then possessing this image would , from January , be a criminal offence for anyone but the two girls involved in it .
It could be argued that a British jury would not convict on this image , because the production values are too close to those of soft porn , whilst a similar picture with harsher lighting and grittier make - up might fall foul of the law .
However , the reality is that until this type of image is tested in a court of law , neither we nor anyone making such pictures can know .
Ironically , the law could sweep up many images and individuals whose main interest is not in the pornographic aspects of the scenes , but who are members of the growing fashion for Goth Horror – or even fans of the Satanic Sluts .
Opponents of the new law have been expecting a January launch date for some time , but despite repeated requests to the Ministry of Justice had been unable to obtain either an exact launch date or clarification of how the Police and Crown Prosecution Service would be advised to interpret the law .
Clair Lewis , Convenor for CAAN , was therefore very surprised when she rang the Ministry of Justice this week and was informed simply that the date had already been announced , and further information would be forthcoming shortly .
She said : " They made it sound as though the decision had been made public ages ago .
But we have contacts with every major group working on this issue , so if it had been announced publically , we are pretty sure we would have known .
This feels a bit like they were trying to sneak it out on the quiet . "
Miss Lewis may have a point : the final commencement date was put out ten days ago in a Statutory Instrument published on November 15 – a Saturday .
Police and the Prosecution Service do not yet appear to have had any further information on how the legislation should be applied – despite the fact that when CAAN first raised this issue , the Ministry of Justice assured us that " further information about the offence " would be provided closer to the date of implementation and that they would " seek to give a significantly longer period of notice than two weeks " .
As of today , they have just over 8 weeks - including the Christmas holiday period - to explain the new legislation to the public .
The Ministry of Justice have said , however , that guidelines for the public will be available much sooner - possibly even this week .
One minor crumb of comfort for those wondering how far they must go to comply with this law comes in a judgment issued in the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal on 3 November .
This held that where an individual no longer had control or custody of images in their possession , it would be unsafe to proceed with a prosecution – and convictions based on such evidence were quashed .
In this particular case , a number of images of child porn had been discovered on computer equipment belonging to the appellant .
However , they had been deleted a significant time prior to the defendant ’s arrest : he would have needed specialist software to access the deleted files , which he did not appear to have , and there could be no certainty that he had ever actually looked at the images .
This suggests that for non-experts , the bar for deletion of dodgy images may not after all be set impossibly high . ®

As of last Friday , the number of Nobel Laureates endorsing Barack Obama for president has risen to 76 , saying Obama will end Bush - era trashing of scientific research , integrity , and competitiveness .
In an open letter ( pdf ) , the Laureates cite the politicization of science under the Bush administration , particularly in the fields of heath and climate , saying that “ vital parts of our country ’s scientific enterprise have been damaged by stagnant or declining federal support , ” adding that through an advisory process “ distorted by political considerations ” America ’s “ once dominant position in the scientific world has been shaken and our prosperity has been placed at risk . ”
Despite John McCain ’s claim that he is the true agent of change for all that has gone wrong under George Bush , both he and his remarkably incurious and misinformed ( at best ) running mate show how they plan to continue Bush ’s appalling lack of regard for science ; combining an inexcusable ignorance of the importance of basic scientific research , with the morally bereft penchant for using science as yet another divisive wedge to promulgate their politics of intolerance , fear , and derision – aiming straight at the lowest common denominator in the body politic .
The vital role of science to address the most pressing issues of our time , from economic competitiveness to climate change , energy , and sustainability , will return under an Obama administration , say the Nobel scientists :
“ We especially applaud his emphasis during the campaign on the power of science and technology to enhance our nation ’s competitiveness .
In particular , we support the measures he plans to take – through new initiatives in education and training , expanded research funding , an unbiased process for obtaining scientific advice , and an appropriate balance of basic and applied research – to meet the nation ’s and the world ’s most urgent needs . ”
The letter stresses that the country is in urgent need of a “ visionary leader ” saying , “ We are convinced that Senator Barack Obama is such a leader , and we urge you to join us in supporting him ” .
McCain and Palin would surely continue us on the resolute path back to the Dark Ages upon which George Bush set out eight years ago .
And there is no more time to waste on such foolishness .

man baby
NAME
baby - create new process from two parents
SYNOPSIS
baby - sex [ m|f ] [ - name name ]
DESCRIPTION
baby is initiated when one parent process polls another server process
through a socket connection in the BSD version or through pipes in the
System V implementation .
baby runs at low priority for approximately
forty weeks and then terminates with a heavy system load .
Most systems
require constant monitoring when baby reaches its final stages of exe_
cution .
Older implementations of baby did not require both initiating processes
to be present at the time of completion .
In those versions the initi_
ating process which was not present was awakened and notified of the
results upon completion .
It has since been determined that the pres_
ence of both parent processes result in a generally lower system load
at completion , and thus current versions of baby expect both parent
processes to be active during the final stages .
Successful completion of baby results in the creation and naming of a
new process .
Parent processes then broadcast messages to all other
processes , local and remote , informing them of their new status .
OPTIONS
- sex define the gender of the created process
- name assign the name name to the new process
EXAMPLES
baby - sex f - name Jacqueline
completed successfully on July 9 , 1992 at 9:11 pm .
Jacqueline 's vital
statistics : 8 pounds 3 oz , 20 inches , long dark hair .
The parent pro_
cess , Kim Dunbar , is reportedly doing fine .
SEE ALSO
cigar ( 6 ) , dump ( 5 ) , cry ( 3 ) .
BUGS
Despite its complexity , baby only knows one signal , SIGCHLD , ( or SIGCLD
in the System V implementation ) , which it uses to contact the parent
processes .
One or both parent processes must then inspect the baby
process to determine the cause of the signal .
The sleep ( 1 ) command may not work as expected on either parent process
for some time afterward , as each new instance of baby sends intermit_
tent signals to the parent processes which must be handled by the par_
ents immediately .
A baby process will frequently dump core , requiring either or both par_
ent processes to clean up after it .
Despite the reams of available documentation on invoking and maintain_
ing baby , most parent processes are overwhelmed .

Pictured : Woman who ' murdered mother - to - be and cut her full - term baby alive from her womb '
A crazed American woman cut open the womb of a pregnant mother to steal her baby and later tried to claim it was her own .
Sisouvanh Synhavong , 23 , bound and gagged her victim before using a craft knife to slice open her stomach .
Araceli Camacho Gomez , who was two weeks away from giving birth , died from loss of blood after the gruesome attack .
She was also stabbed multiple times in the chest .
Accused : Sisouvanh Synhavong appears in court over the stabbing death
When police arrested Synhavong she was still clutching part of the baby 's umbilical cord .
The newborn baby boy was on the backseat of her car , and she repeatedly asked police : " Is my baby OK ? "
Police initially believed she had just given birth and took her to hospital where tests quickly showed she had not delivered a baby .
Minutes later , police found the body of her 23 - year - old victim in a park .
A search of Synhavong 's bag revealed the bloody knife used in the attack , a baby bottle and blue latex gloves covered in blood .
They also found rope similar to that used to bind the victim .
Synvahong is believed to have kidnapped the 27 - year - old mother - of - two earlier in the evening after tricking her way into her home .
Friends said Gomez met Synhavong on a bus and she offered to give her some baby clothes .
The horrific attack took place in Kennewick in Washington state .
The baby boy survived being cut from the womb but is in a critical condition in Kennewick Hospital on a life - support system .
Synhavong is expected to be charged with first degree murder and will face the death penalty if convicted .
Police said her victim , who has two children aged ten and seven , had her hands and feet bound with rope and she had also been gagged .
Court documents revealed she had suffered " massive trauma " to the stomach area .
An autopsy also revealed stab wounds to her chest .
Court documents allege that Sisouvanh Synhavong called 911 at 11.04 pm , Friday saying she was by a JC Penney store , had just given birth and that she thought the baby had died .
Paramedics responding to the call were unable to locate Synhavong , but minutes later she called 911 again and they found her in a shopping mall car park .
A “ significant amount of blood and pieces of human tissue ” were found in the back seat , court documents said .
The report also said Synhavong was holding part of the baby 's umbilical cord .
Gomez 's husband had reported her missing after she failed to return home last Friday .
The site was a mile or two from the spot where Gomez 's body was later found , but it was n't immediately clear whether Gomez was killed at the site where her body was found , or was killed elsewhere and the body dumped there .
Police believe Synvahong , who married a month ago , tricked Gomez into getting into her white 4x4 by promising to get her some baby clothes .
It 's unclear if Gomez was killed before her baby was cut from her womb or if she still was alive at the time .
Little is known about Synvahong , who is of Laotian descent , other than she does not have a criminal record .
She is being held without bail , with another court appearance scheduled on Wednesday .
Friends told local news organisations that she had claimed she was expecting .
The gruesome killing comes less than a month after an Illinois woman was jailed for life without parole for killing her pregnant friend , the unborn child and the victim ’s three children .
Tiffany Hall , 26 , admitted hitting her 23 - year - old friend repeatedly on the head with a table leg and then cutting the foetus from her womb in a bathtub in September , 2006 .
After the pregnant mother bled to death , Hall dumped her body in an empty building lot nearby in St Louis and then told police she had been sexually assaulted and given birth to a stillborn baby following the attack .
Three days later .
Hall drowned her victim's three children , aged seven , two and one , in the same bathtub where she murdered their mother .
In April , a judge in Kansas City , Missouri , sentenced another woman to death after she was found guilty of murdering an expectant mother and kidnapping the baby from her womb .
Lisa Montgomery , 39 , strangled pregnant Bobbie Jo Stinnet , 23 , to death and then cut out her foetus in 2004 .
She was found in a neighbouring state - where she had claimed the baby as her own - after an intense nationwide search .
Montgomery first contacted her victim through the internet , saying she was interested in breeding dogs .
Montgomery is only the third woman on federal death row in the US .
Eric Cravens , assistant curator at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Lakewood , Colorado , stands behind a wall of aluminum - encased ice cores .
The ice in this room , kept at – 33 degrees Fahrenheit , contains snapshots of atmospheric history dating back 440,000 years from various regions , including Antarctica and Greenland .
“ The ice core is an excellent record of the snowfall and atmosphere of a period of time , ” says Ted Scampos , a climatologist who uses data from ice cores for his work .
Dust found in the ice gives a record of what was in the air thousands of years ago , whether from volcanic eruptions or human activity , and the isotopic composition of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in the snow give a record of the temperature of the earth at the time .
Generally , more heavy isotopes mean a warmer climate .
After a core is drilled , it is dried , wrapped in plastic , and slid into an aluminum - covered tube that reflects sunlight .
The cores are then rushed to freezer containers before being shipped to California and trucked to Colorado .
There they are kept until atmospheric scientists , astrophysicists , biologists , and other researchers request samples to help answer many unknowns in the history of our planet .
Musebin wants music reviewers to cut to the chase , big - time .
Never mind that girl you made a mix for in high school .
Other music fans want to know what you think , and they want it now .
In 140 characters or less .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Musebin is a response to technology - related shifts in music criticism .
Like Twitter , it limits each album review to a single , 140 - character line .
And like Reddit , it allows users to rate those reviews up or down using Yea or Nay buttons .
The result : a fresh and compelling way to share opinions and be entertained while discovering music .
" It ’s a reaction to the wordy , wordy MP3 blogs and people craving really concise content , " explained Musebin COO Adam Varga .
" Blogs have kind of killed the editor , " added Musebin CEO Greg Galant .
" It used to be that anything that got written would be edited by people who read [ the style guide ] Strunk & White … .
Blogs came along with no limit , and anyone could write anything .
I think music reviews — which were already kind of long - winded — maybe got a little bit worse .
You ’re going to talk about some experience that happened to you in high school , and this and that .
[ We want to ] capture the essence of an album so someone knows whether or not they should listen to it . "
The democratization of music reviews allows for a far wider range ofopinion and coverage than existed when magazines likeRolling Stone held a near - monopoly on pop-music criticism .
But whenyou ’re trying to find a quickconsensus about a particular album , the sheer volume of wordy reviews make it near - impossible .
Musebin attempts to solve thatproblem .
If brevity is the soul of wit , its reviews are the funniestever written .
The other aspect of the site — the Reddit - style rating — should helpensure that the system is not gamed .
" We have a couple of PR peopletesting it out who are writing rave reviews about small bands thatmaybe do n’t deserve those rave reviews , " said Varga .
However , he added ,
" anyone has the same amount of space to say what they want to say , and the rest of the community can vote those things up and down .
If a PR
person writes something really poignant and relevant , it can rise tothe top .
If they do n’t , it can fall to the bottom . "
Fair enough .
In addition to one - liners , users can post micro-reviews extracted from traditional reviews .
" If you find a great one - line pull quote , you can take from a review in Billboard , Rolling Stone , the New York Times or some other blog , you can clip that one 140 - character - or - less quote and put it into our system with attribution , " explained Galant .
This could give outside music publications incentive to add one - liners from their own reviews as another way of attracting new readers — assuming the Musebin concept takes off .
And it ’s hard to see how it would n’t at least be moderately successful , given the solidity of its conceptual foundation , the preponderance of music opinion and our increasing jones for lightening - fast information .
Musebin is currently in private beta with around 200 users who have posted about a thousand reviews .
The first 100 Wired.com readers who e-mail this address will be given invitations to join .
SawhorseMedia plans to add Facebook integration , full - featured profile pages , the ability to subscribe to reviewers a la Twitter , and a bookmarklet that lets you add clippings from reviews anywhere on the web easily , using your browser ’s toolbar .
The company also hopes to syndicate the top-rated , user - vetted review for each album to sites like Amazon .
Here ’s a tour through the process of adding a new review to the invite - only Musebin .
The front page surfaces the best reviews as rated by the community , or you can check out the newest reviews :
Clicking the " Add a music review " link brings up a small pop-up window :
As I fill in the artist name , a panel at the bottom surfaces a list of artists that might include the one I ’m talking about .
Unfortunately , The Fall is a hard band to find in databases :
However , when I fill in the album name , the list shortens considerably , and I am able to locate the album .
If it were n’t already in the database , I would have clicked the " Add custom album art and details " link to add an image , label , genre and release date myself :
I write my 140 - character - maximum review .
Note the mechanism for adding a clip and URL from another publication .
There ’s also a little menu that lets you categorize your review .
Options include " hated , " " was n’t crazy about , " " liked " and " loved . "
I loved this album :
After I submit the review , it shows up on Musebin ’s album page .
This is the only review of The Fall ’s Levitate in its system so far :
The page for Radiohead ’s
In Rainbows provides a better demonstration of the ratings system in action :
It ’s only fitting that I should try to apply the Musebin lesson to this post , so here ’s my 140 - character take on the site :
If writing about music islike dancing about architecture , Musebin is like ranked dance photosthat explain the building at a single glance .

As Albert Einstein lay on his deathbed , he asked only for his glasses , his writing implements and his latest equations .
He knew he was dying , yet he continued his work .
In those final hours of his life , while fading in and out of consciousness , he was working on what he hoped would be his greatest work of all .
It was a project of monumental complexity .
It was a project that he hoped would unlock the mind of God .
" I want to know God 's thoughts "
" I am not interested in this phenomenon or that phenomenon , " Einstein had said earlier in his life .
" I want to know God 's thoughts – the rest are mere details . "
But as he lay there dying in Princeton Hospital he must have understood that these were secrets that God was clearly keen to hang on to .
The greatest scientist of his age died knowing that he had become isolated from the scientific community ; revered on the one hand , ridiculed for this quest on the other .
It was a journey that started 50 years earlier in Berne , Switzerland .
Then - in his early 20s - he was a young man struggling to make his mark .
His applications to universities throughout Europe had all been rejected .
In the end his father had pulled strings to get him a job as a third class clerk evaluating the latest electrical gizmos .
But in his spare time he was formulating the most extraordinary scientific ideas .
In a single year - 1905 , a year that would become known as his miracle year – he published papers that would redefine how we see our world and universe .
Time is relative
He confirmed that all matter was composed of molecules – an idea that at the time was controversial .
And most famously of all , he published the paper ' On the electrodynamics of moving bodies ' .
It contained his Theory of Special Relativity and suggested that time - something that had always thought to be unchanging and absolute – was relative .
It could speed up or slow down depending on the speed you were travelling .
From this paper would come an additional three pages , finished in September of the same year , that would contain the derivation of e=mc² , the most famous mathematical equation ever written .
Einstein was on a roll .
Ten years after his Theory of Special Relativity , he published his Theory of General Relativity – a piece of work widely acknowledged as his masterpiece .
The great 17th century scientist Sir Isaac Newton had described the force of gravity very successfully , but what caused gravity remained a mystery .
In this Theory of General Relativity , Einstein suggested that gravity was due to the bending of time and space by massive objects .
In 1919 astronomers confirmed this by measuring the bending of starlight around the sun during a solar eclipse .
The battle with quantum mechanics
In 1921 , Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize , not for his theories of relativity , but for another paper published in 1905 .
In this paper , Einstein proposed that light was not simply made up of waves , it could also be thought of as discrete , individual particles or quanta .
This discovery would revolutionise physics and chemistry , because it would become one of the foundations of a new science : quantum mechanics .
But during the 1920s the new science of quantum mechanics began to turn the tide against the way Einstein saw the world .
Young pretenders in the field of physics had begun to emerge , such as Heisenberg , Bohr and Schrödinger , who are now some of the most famous figures in science .
But at the time they were mavericks .
They saw quantum mechanics as a brand new way of interpreting everything .
A core element to their new interpretation of the world was that at a fundamental level , everything was unpredictable .
You could , for example , accurately tell the speed of a particle but not – at the same time – its position .
Or its position but not its speed .
It meant that precise predictions were impossible – the best you could hope for was a science based on probabilities .
God does not play dice
Einstein's work was underpinned by the idea that the laws of physics were an expression of the divine .
This belief led him to think that everything could be described by simple , elegant mathematics and moreover , that once you knew these laws you could describe the universe with absolute accuracy .
Einstein loathed the implications of quantum mechanics .
It was a clash of ideologies .
The conflict reached a crescendo in the late 1920s at the Solvay Conference in Belgium .
There Einstein clashed with the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr over the nature of the universe .
Einstein constantly challenged Bohr over the implications of quantum mechanics , but never budged from his belief that " God does not play dice " , meaning that nothing would be left to chance in the universe .
To which the quantum mechanics community replied : " Einstein , stop telling God what to do with his dice . "
The theory of everything
But Einstein had a trick up his sleeve .
He had already begun a piece of work that he believed would ultimately replace quantum mechanics .
It would become later known as his theory of everything – it was his attempt to extend general relativity and unite the known forces in the universe .
By completing this theory of everything Einstein hoped he would rid physics of the unpredictability at the heart of quantum mechanics and show that the world was predictable – described by beautiful , elegant mathematics .
Just the way he believed God would make the universe .
He would show that the way the quantum mechanics community interpreted the world was just plain wrong .
It was a project that he would work on for the next 30 years , until the final day of his life .
But while Einstein 's theory of everything may be considered to have been a failure , it is an idea that still fascinates and draws some of the brightest minds in physics .
Today many believe that String Theory is our best candidate for a theory of everything .
But the ultimate irony is that lurking at the heart of String Theory is the very thing that , because of his beliefs , Einstein had been unable to accept : quantum mechanics .

Vermont AG candidate says she would prosecute Bush for murder RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008
Print This Email
This A local candidate in Vermont has promised to charge and prosecute President Bush for murder if elected as that state 's attorney general .
The Associated Press reports that Charlotte Dennett , who 's running on the Progressive Party ticket to be Vermont 's Attorney General , promised to appoint a special prosecutor to bring charges holding Bush accountable for the deaths of more than 4,000 troops in Iraq .
Dennet , speaking at a press conference in Burlington this week , said she would appoint Vincent Bugliosi as a special prosecutor in the case .
A former Los Angeles County district attorney who was in charge of Charles Manson 's murder case , Bugliosi has outlined his strategy against the president in his recent book , The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder .
" Someone has to step forward , " Dennett said at a news conference with Bugliosi , according to AP .
" Someone has to say we can not put up with this lack of accountability any more . "
Bugliosi , 74 , ... said any state attorney general would have jurisdiction since Bush committed " overt acts " including the military 's recruitment of soldiers in Vermont and allegedly lying about the threat posed by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein in speeches that were aired in Vermont and elsewhere .
" No man , even the president of the United States , is above the law , " said Bugliosi .
Vermont 's state Senate adopted a resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney , earning some mockery from the White House spokeswoman , and the president has n't once visited the northeastern state , where plenty of residents loathe him .
The state 's current Attorney General , William Sorrell , tells AP he does n't think he could legally prosecute Bush , even if he wanted to .
" The reality is , in my view , that unless the crime takes place in Vermont , then I as the attorney general have no authority under Vermont law to be prosecuting the president , " Sorrell said .
Last week we brought you the story of Ken Imhoff , a Wisconsin man who , after falling in love with the Lamborghini Countach in the classic movie Cannonball Run , followed his dream by building his very own Lamborghini in his basement .
The amazing build took place over the course of ten years and was completed and dragged out of the subterranean depths only about a week prior to our story .
That very same day Ken contacted us , amazed by the response the post had garnered , to let us know " I am the guy with a Lamborghini in the basement . "
Of course we knew you needed to hear more , so over the last week we 've been working with Mr. Imhoff to put together a story that will not only do justice to his car , but to his vision and persistence .
Below is Ken 's story in his own words , along with a load of new pictures of the finished car and details of the entire extraction process .
What 's most interesting to many may be the technical details — those too await below the jump in this exclusive detailing of one of the most amazing build we 've ever seen .
The Story The time was 1985 and I was watching the movie Cannonball run .
Yeah , you know the one with Farrah Fawcett and Adrienne Barbeau ?
' That red car was a what ? '
I asked .
A Lamborghini Countach .
I was mesmerized .
I spent the next five years figuring out how I was going to build one .
The idea of buying something was out of the question — I was raised by a German perfectionist of a father who would quote , " I ca n't understand why anyone would buy something when they could make it " whenever the topic of buying something came up .
He would say , " You have the skills , just build one " .
As things were starting to heat up with the Lamborghini , I got involved with a young lady and things started moving pretty quickly .
When the topic of car finally came up , I told her ' I need to build this car and I hope it is n't going to be a problem . '
She said ' I can't see how it would .
I love you . '
I figure I would test the waters and asked her if she had two grand for a ZF transaxle .
I had a guy in CA with a Pantera ZF he wants to sell , but I was short on cash at the time .
Long story short , she lent me the money and we got married a year later just before we closed on a house with a 2 1 /2 garage .
The idea to build the car in the basement is pretty simple really .
I recalled back to my childhood again and remember my Dad 's car projects always being put on hold during the winter because we could n't afford to heat the one car garage .
Sure I could heat my garage and do the work in there , but then my cars would have to sit in the driveway .
I live in Wisconsin where winters seem to last six months out of the year , so that would be a long time with no place to put the daily drivers .
This was going to be a long project and I figured the house had an unfinished basement with plenty of room and was heated anyway , what a perfect scenario .
There would be no excuses not to work on the car right ?
Before I started off on the project , I had a neighborhood contractor take a look at it and he was confident I was n't losing my mind .
I will admit , the one thing I did n't think beforehand was how everything was going to either go down the stairs or go through a small basement window .
There were times I wondered how well those 50 year old stairs were built , but thankfully I never did have an incident .
When I started the project , my wife would read in a recliner next to me but soon that faded .
Even the dog left as soon as she did .
I should n't pick on her though , she was very supportive coming down to see the latest part I had completed or asking " Sweetheart does this look right ? "
She seemed to always say the right thing and I always was always thankful for her outside point of view .
Sometimes I would be way out there in la-la land and she would have to reel me back to reality .
She had a level way of thinking I do n't think I ever acquired .
At the beginning of the welding process I tried my hand at gas welding aluminum .
Despite putting hours of practice in In ever quite got it .
I tried everything .
Cobalt glasses , flux and welding rod , I think I tried for six weeks but could never master it .
I talked to an old timer about gas welding aluminum and all he would say was " Practice , practice , practice . "
His younger son , who was also in the family business pulled me aside and said " Buy a Tig machine and get it over with . "
The old man meanwhile mumbled something under his breath about " Always looking for the shortcut .
Whatever happened to doing it right ? "
So with that advice in mind , I bought a Miller Syncrowave 250 a week later and never looked back .
I did hear much later from the neighbors that they could tell when I was welding as it interfered with their TV antenna and picture .
I built a paint booth in the corner of the basement to prime a panel when needed .
It worked really nice with a positive pressure blower forcing the fumes out a basement window .
The neighborhood smelled like paint but my neighbors never complained , they would just move their cars to avoid the long distance overspray .
I 'm not quite sure how my wife put up with the paint smell that lingered in the house despite my best efforts .
For those wondering , I choose not to color paint down there , after the mess I made priming and the fact that it was n't all that clean to start .
It was OK for priming but painting is another thing .
The project did end up costing a lot more than I ever thought it would — projects always seem to do that .
You buy a 160MPH speedometer because that was the highest made at the time .
You do n't even get it out of the box and you see that they now make on that tops out at 180 .
Two units later I got a 200MPH ... buying parts goes on like that until you end up with shelves of stuff you do n't need and keep in mind , for a lot of this project , E - bay had not been invented yet .
Speaking of the internet , if my project had started when the internet was available , I actually think it would have cost me a lot more .
There are so many more options now right at your fingertips and I seem to have champagne tastes with beer money .
I think I have 40 K in my project without the equipment / tools I bought .
I used to save every receipt until I started getting depressed at how much I was spending .
Besides it could be held against me as spousal blackmail , so I eventually got rid of the evidence !
I remember the first time I started it .
I filled the tank with racing gas , set the timing , and hit the start button — the engine exploded with life .
Open headers in a basement , no matter how ready you are for it , will catch you off guard .
I decided to not run it too long and made sure no one was home at the time .
By the way , those carbon monoxide sensors really do work and you have to keep the windows open unless you want the sweet smell of racing gas lingering in your basement .
Actually getting the car out of the basement was pretty straight forward to be honest .
I built a skid to put the car on — a trailer without wheels you might say .
The rig is basically an angle iron frame designed to make it down into the basement to which I added 4 swivel casters to move the car to the opposite wall .
We used an excavator to dig a ramp and then cut the block of the foundation out .
We pushed the car to the opening , hooked it up to the excavator and pulled it out .
Simple .
I was like an expectant father watching it come through the wall .
I was literally shaking and running the supposed plan over and over in my head .
' Have I overlooked anything ?
Is some of the wall going to fall on my work of seventeen years ?...'
The blankets I covered it with surely would n't stop that from happening , but I worried nonetheless , an it was in the end , worry for nothing .
It went as smooth as something like this could .
The neighbors started gathering around as it emerged , waiting for me to remove the blankets .
It was like a artist unwrapping his masterpiece .
I had never seen it in the light of day either .
As the last blanket and car cover were removed I knew at that moment I had accomplished what I had dreamed about so many years ago and to see it sitting there in front of me was surreal .
The whole process took two and a half hours and there it was , my Lamborghini safely in the garage .
The next day we filled the hole in the basement with new block in no time it was good as new .
All that said , I could n't have done this alone .
A lot of people have helped me along the way .
My wife and family that helped when things got rough .
A close friend that would never let me give up even though at times I wanted to .
I owe a great deal of gratitude to those people in my life .
The end of this story really was n't about owning the car of my dreams , but the lessons I have learned , the people I have met , and the inner satisfaction knowing I built something piece by piece , each piece a new and different challenge and having it all come together .
Paraphrasing an old cliche here , ' It was n't the destination that was important , it was the journey along the way . '

Planners to consider S.F. congestion charge SAN FRANCISCO
But director of transit agency also says that charging drivers as way to reduce traffic , pollution would be a tough sell

The idea of making San Francisco the first city in the nation to combat congestion by imposing a toll on motorists who drive on the local roads is " totally doable " from an administrative standpoint , a top city transportation official deemed .
But clearing the necessary political and public opinion hurdles is another matter altogether .
Charging people more for anything is always a tough sell .
Talk about reaching deeper into people 's pockets when the economy is in the tank is even more difficult .
" We 're going to have to get buy - in , " said Jose Luis Moscovich , executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority .
It 's his agency that , with the help of a $ 1 million federal grant , has been studying the feasibility of congestion pricing in San Francisco .
The idea will inch forward Tuesday , when the authority 's directors - a group made up of the city 's 11 elected members of the Board of Supervisors - will be presented with various pricing scenarios and toll - zone locations , and an analysis of the potential benefits and disadvantages .
" Congestion pricing is totally doable in San Francisco , " Moscovich said .
" There are alternatives that can be implemented with ways to mitigate the impacts . "
For example , commercial fleets could pay discounted tolls , and low - income people , residents who live in the toll zones and drivers with certified disabilities could be exempt from paying .
Among the other looming policy decisions , if the program proceeds , is how much to charge , where and when .
The goal behind the program is to get people out of their cars , which proponents say would relieve congestion , increase traffic speed and cut carbon emissions .
Those who continue to drive would pay a toll at certain times and in specified locations .
As envisioned , the revenue would be aimed at public transit improvements and pedestrian and bike projects - initiatives to make alternatives to driving more attractive .
London and Singapore already use toll - based congestion pricing to manage traffic .
San Francisco transportation planners are looking at various scenarios , such as charging motorists at the major entry points to the city - the Bay Bridge , Golden Gate Bridge and the freeways to the south ; or charging people who drive into the Civic Center , downtown and South of Market - job centers where traffic is heaviest .
In the London program , cameras capture license plate numbers as the vehicles enter the pay areas , and the owners must settle the bill either before or on the day of travel .
The payments can be made by telephone , text message , online , mail or in person at designated stores .
San Francisco may be able to make use of the automated FasTrak system , already in use on Bay Area bridges .
Details , including possible toll prices , will be revealed Tuesday when the authority 's governing board meets .
No vote will be taken .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has embraced the concept , saying in January that " a sensible congestion - pricing plan is the single greatest step we can take to protect our environment and improve our quality of life . "
But whether he eventually goes along with what the transportation authority ends up recommending is unclear .
" The devil is in the details , " Newsom spokesman Nathan Ballard said Thursday .
Demand - based pricing to alter transportation habits already is in the works in San Francisco .
Under the SFpark program , the cost to park at a curbside meter or in a city - owned lot in certain neighborhoods will vary , in a trial project set to start next year .
When parking is plentiful , the price will go down ; when it 's scarce , the charge will go up .
Officials say this will help assure that parking is available and reduce the need for drivers to circle the block in search of a space .
While boosters herald the idea as beneficial to the environment , opponents call the driving fees a jobs killer .
" The economy is on life support and you want to add more costs to driving in the city ?
I do n't think so , " said Ken Cleaveland , director of government and public affairs for the Building Owners and Managers Association of San Francisco .
" Listen , we 're going to be grateful to have people driving to our stores and operating businesses in the city .
We do n't need any more impediments . "
Instead , he said , the city should do more to enforce the laws already on the books to keep traffic moving , such as cracking down on drivers who double park or block intersections .
In order to proceed , the plan would need local and state legislative approval , and , possibly , an administrative OK at the federal level .
City officials also are determining whether San Francisco voters would have to sign off .
Implementation could be several years away .
Enlarge By Mike Stone , Reuters Vondrell McGee scored in the first half and the Texas defense held on the second half to keep the Longhorns unbeaten .
FROM THE GRIDIRON FROM THE GRIDIRON Photo gallery : Check out images from the gridiron during the ninth week of the season Game report Oklahoma State team page Texas team page Top 25 recap Scores from around the nation USA TODAY Top 25 poll AUSTIN ( AP )  Colt McCoy made rare mistakes .
The Texas defense got pushed around and the Longhorns watched their big lead and momentum gradually disappear .
Suddenly , the No. 1 team in the country looked vulnerable .
Yet here they are , still unbeaten , and with still more tough games to play .
McCoy passed for 391 yards and two touchdowns Saturday but the Longhorns defense needed to come up with two huge stands in a 28 - 24 win over No. 8 Oklahoma State after he threw a third - quarter interception and fumbled late in the fourth .
" We 're not going to beat everybody by 50 or 60 , " Texas cornerback Ryan Palmer said .
" We showed we can dig down and fight . "
Texas led 28 - 21 when McCoy threw the interception — his first in 101 pass attempts over the last four games — and the Cowboys seemed to have stolen all the momentum with the ball near midfield .
Instead of allowing a touchdown , Texas held OSU to a field goal that cut the lead to four .
And when McCoy fumbled as he was swarmed by three defenders at the Cowboys 10 late in the fourth , Texas did n't allow the them to get past their own 30 .
Texas fans have watched McCoy play with near - perfect precision — especially while beating Oklahoma and Missouri the previous two weeks — and the turnovers seemed to stun the crowd of 98,515 .
" No one plays this game perfect , " said wide receiver Jordan Shipley , McCoy 's roommate who was also his favorite target with 15 catches for 168 yards .
Texas had a chance for a final touchdown after getting the ball back at the 30 , driving to the 1 before a busted call on fourth down gave OSU one last chance to cover 99 yards in about 30 seconds .
The Cowboys got to midfield before a desperation pass fell just short of the end zone on the final play .
" I 'm very relieved to be out of that game , " Texas defensive tackle Roy Miller said .
Texas got its third straight win over a ranked opponent and it was the toughest by far .
Texas beat Oklahoma 45 - 35 in Dallas with a big rally and used a 35 - point first half to swamp Missouri in a rout at home .
Saturday 's slugfest with Oklahoma State sets up yet another big game next Saturday night at No. 6 Texas Tech .
" Our reward is Tech won 63 - 21 ( over Kansas ) , " Longhorns coach Mack Brown said .
" We 've still got some work to do . "
Texas has won 11 in a row over Oklahoma State , including several big rallies in recent years .
This time , it was Texas hanging on at the end .
With 56 players on the roster from Texas , the Cowboys were eager for payback and a chance to get in the national title chase after their first 7 - 0 start since the 1945 team went undefeated .
" We kind of let them off the hook , " said Oklahoma State quarterback Zac Robinson , his hands still shaking after the game .
" We had them where we wanted them all game , and we were just a few plays short . "
The Cowboys ' Kendall Hunter , the Big 12's leading rusher , ran for 161 yards and a touchdown against the nation 's No. 2 rush defense .
But he also fumbled inside the 10 in the first half when Oklahoma State trailed 7 - 0 .
Tight end Brandon Pettigrew had eight catches for 83 yards .
Brown knew his team was in for a tough day when the Longhorns had to punt on their first possession and tailback Vondrell McGee was knocked into a somersault with a big hit by Orie Lemon .
" I said , ' Boys we got us a fight .
You better hang on , " ' Brown said .
McCoy , who was 38 of 45 passing , threw touchdown passes to Shipley and Quan Cosby in the first half .
The pass to Cosby , just over the outstretched fingertips of safety Jacob Lacey , put Texas up 21 - 7 late in the second quarter before OSU answered with a 9 - yard scoring pass from Zac Robinson to Bo Bowling just before halftime .
Texas went up 28 - 14 when McCoy ran 3 yards for a TD midway through the third .
The score came two plays after McCoy threw a pass that was picked off inside the 10 but the interception was nullified by a personal foul when linebacker Andre Sexton hit the quarterback in the face .
The Cowboys kept coming back .
Hunter ripped the Longhorns for huge yards and Keith Toston cut the lead to 28 - 21 with a 1 - yard run .
McCoy then made another big mistake and this time it counted .
Trying to beat a blitz , McCoy lofted a soft deep pass toward Cosby and Lacey grabbed it .
Dan Bailey 's 39 - yard field goal made it to 28 - 24 with 13 minutes to play .
Texas then used a 15 - play drive that ate up 7:31 before McCoy dropped the ball while being sacked for his second turnover .
Two quick plays moved the ball to the 31 before Texas ended the drive by sacking Robinson and dropping receiver Dez Bryant for a loss on fourth down .
Even then , it still was n't quite over .
Brown wanted to try for a touchdown instead of kicking a field goal on fourth down from the 1 with less than a minute left , but a busted play led to an incomplete pass .
" We did n't think they could beat us if we left the ball at the six - inch line , " Brown said .
" And if we score , we win . "
Of course , the Cowboys would n't go meekly .
Robinson got them to midfield , but could n't pull off a miracle .
" It took everything we had , " Shipley said , " to win this game . "

Alan Greenspan admits a “ mistake ”
October 23 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
I am just completely taken aback by this admission …
Facing a firing line of questions from Washington lawmakers , Alan Greenspan , the former Federal Reserve chairman once considered the infallible maestro of the financial system , admitted on Thursday that he “ made a mistake ” in trusting that free markets could regulate themselves without government oversight .
Wow .
Shit must be worse than we thought .
Greenspan was all about deregulation and all about the market being the answer to the ills of the world .
But what he failed to count on was the overwhelming greed .
Which seems odd , because no one gets into the market because it is fulfilling , they get in to make MONEY .
Usually at any cost .
Did n’t he see Bonfire of the Vanities or Wall Street ?
The New York Times continues :
But in a tense exchange with Representative Henry A. Waxman , the California Democrat who is chairman of the committee , Mr. Greenspan conceded a more serious flaw in his own philosophy that unfettered free markets sit at the root of a superior economy .
“ I made a mistake in presuming that the self - interests of organizations , specifically banks and others , were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms , ” Mr. Greenspan said .
Referring to his free - market ideology , Mr. Greenspan added : “ I have found a flaw .
I do n’t know how significant or permanent it is .
But I have been very distressed by that fact . ”
Mr. Waxman pressed the former
Fed chair to clarify his words .
“ In other words , you found that your view of the world , your ideology , was not right , it was not working , ” Mr. Waxman said .
“ Absolutely , precisely , ” Mr. Greenspan replied .
“ You know , that ’s precisely the reason I was shocked , because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . ”
Say what you will , at least he can admit that he was wrong .
That should count for something .
And that ’s more than can be said for Bush or McCain , both of whom are advocating more of the same .

Do I deserve to die in prison ?
Over Reliance Of Informants In Drug Law Enforcement
By Sharanda Jones , prisoner of the drug war
I 'm serving life in prison .
I 'm also a mother to a lonely little girl .
My mom , a paraplegic , raised her family of five in the small , rural town of Terrell , Texas ( population : 14 , 200 ) .
Life was difficult for my mother financially , but she loved us dearly .
In 1997 , I owned a restaurant with a friend , a Dallas police officer .
I gave up a business in Terrell to focus on the partnership in Dallas .
I worked hard , went by the rules , and paid my taxes .
I had no idea that my life was about to be turned upside down , that I would be sent to prison .
Daytime turned night when Chuck Norris volunteered to work as a police officer for the Kaufman County Sheriff Department .
While Chuck Norris was ' acting ' as a police officer , someone decided a drug sweep might cap production off .
The blacks in Kaufman County were targeted back in 1997 , and Chuck Norris kicked in the doors of the citizens of my hometown .
He handcuffed a few personally himself , too .
During the drug sweep , several people were arrested for trafficking in drugs .
As a result , people I 'd known for years were carried off to jail .
The people arrested were threatened with life sentences if they did n't cooperate .
It was an informant 's festival of who could tell on whom .
People were desperate to save themselves from mandated , harsh prison sentences .
One couple I 'd known for many years was arrested along with so many others .
Some did have small quantities of illegal drugs , others guns , and a few had cash squirreled away .
Arresting agents told them they could ' help themselves ' if they implicated others in exchange for reduced sentences .
I had nothing to do with one particular couple 's drug involvement .
But their ' cooperation ' falsely implicated more than one unsuspecting , uninvolved individual .
The couple called my home after their arrest , pleading for sympathy and needing financial help .
The government seized their properties and assets , on their way to federal prison , and the children left behind would be penniless .
They asked me to help them find some people that would buy drugs , so they could afford legal and family help .
During that call , I explained I would try to help them , but I did not know anyone drug involved .
That was a monitored phone call .
I had brought myself into a broad ' drug conspiracy , " and the dark skinned , witch - hunt raged through our community .
Law enforcement agents began to question my family , searching for any tie that might link me to illicit drug trafficking .
My business partner and friend , the Dallas police officer , was implicated in illegal drug activity , too .
It was alleged that she and I had been identified in Dallas and Houston as drug conspirators .
Sharanda Jones is featured in the documentary The War On Drugs
The police officer filed a civil suit against the government for false accusation / defamation of character , was n't charged , and remains free today .
She has been officially instructed to have no contact with me .
In the end , I was indicted , along with my mother , sister , brother , and several others for seven counts of drug distribution .
At trial , not one shred of physical evidence connected me to drug trafficking with four codefendants .
The couple who placed the monitored call testified I was not involved in their drug activities .
The jury found me guilty of one count of conspiracy .
Later , I was sentenced to life in prison .
I was found ' not guilty ' on six other counts .
Earlier , the government told my former attorney that I should n't concern myself with the threat of a life sentence .
Prosecutors said if I implicated my friend , the police officer , in drug activity , they would ' help me out ' by reducing my sentence .
I could not do that .
I struggle with the absurdity of my life sentence , and the loss of my daughter , but hope each day that , against all odds , somehow justice will prevail .
I really do not deserve to die in prison .
Chuck Norris , Real Life " Texas Ranger " Maybe they can get the attorneys on Law & Order to defend them .
For 67 people collared on crack - cocaine distribution charges in 1997 in Terrell , Texas , getting arrested must have been as surreal as it was disturbing .
That 's because karate champ - actor Chuck Norris - star of such beat - the - beejesus out of felons and foreigners movie classics as Invasion USA , Silent Rage , Forced Vengeance and the Missing in Action saga - was there to put on the cuffs .
Norris , who films his six - season - old CBS series , Walker : Texas Ranger in nearby Dallas , had been moonlighting as a reserve cop for the Terrell PD for a couple of years .
Accordingly , he did his part for the department 's narcotics sting that culminated with a raid on three so - called , ' drug rings . '
One understandably confused suspect who was overcome by the bizarre nature of having a minor celebrity arrest him asked , " Is this a movie ? "
Terrell police did n't say whether the 47 - year - old Norris got to kick the suspect in the face .
In any event , being available for Walker 's Saturday evening time slot should n't be a problem for him now .
Norris , a former U.S. Air Force karate champion , also made news earlier in 1997 when he sent a court order to some down - on - his - luck actor , trying to make him stop impersonating his Walker character in a Wisconsin car - dealership TV commercial .
The actor responded by sticking up a billboard in downtown Dallas that read , " Thanks to Chuck Norris , I am an unemployed commercial actor . "
At least it 's better than the one that reads , " Thanks to Chuck Norris I 'm a convicted drug felon who watches Walker : Texas Ranger every Saturday night in the prison rec room .

Like the flow of the Mississippi or the winds of the Sahara , the pursuit of free alcohol , free finger food , and access to power is an unstoppable force .
No puny ethics legislation shall stand in its way .
The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act , passed after the Democrats took control of Congress , limited the ways in which lawmakers can hobnob with lobbyists , corporate officials , and special interests .
But if Denver is any example , hobnobbing is a game and flexible beast , able to squirm over or around any obstacles placed in its way .
For example , there is a rule against lawmakers and their aides accepting meals from lobbyists .
That means that every time a lobbying firm throws a party here in Denver , it has to follow the “ toothpick rule . ”
Hors d’oeuvres only .
If it fits on a stick , put it on one .
This leads to odd scenes , like a woman at a party on Monday night eating a slice of pizza on a toothpick .
Hosts can play the music in the background , instead of throwing a concert , so lawmakers ca n’t be said to be accepting free music .
They can take away chairs , because a standing - only reception is apparently less ethically questionable than an event where power players can schmooze while putting their feet up .
Party throwers can distribute literature that advocates for a cause , making the event “ educational . ”
Slate reported that the Distilled Spirits Council got away with hosting a bash for lobbyists and politicians on Monday by handing out literature on the dangers of underage drinking .
And of course there is the farce known as the “ widely attended event , ” a party that can have a high - roller host and an exclusive , undisclosed guest list as long as it makes a point of inviting 25 people who are not lawmakers .
The rules may be shown the door , but you and I certainly are n’t getting in , as my video above illustrates .
Nancy Watzman of the Sunlight Foundation , a government oversight group , is trying to illustrate the ineffectiveness of current ethics restrictions by attempting to get into as many fancy receptions as she can , knowing she ’ll be rejected time and time again .
While it is not shocking that a party - crasher would get turned away at the door of a high - end party , it nicely illustrates that the infamous smoke - filled backroom is still alive and well , at least in a figurative sense , and that oversight has a long way to go .
I spent an afternoon with Nancy as she sought a lobbying firm ’s reception , Democratic top - dollar donors , and a party thrown by the CEO of a telecom company .
Not surprisingly , we ended the day without a single cucumber sandwich .

DIGG THIS
When I was a young boy , I loved collecting things .
You name it , I collected it ; antique toys , baseball cards , basketball , football , and comic books .
Of course I thought that one day these things would be of great value .
When I was a university student I was watching TV one night .
On the news there was a report about a Mickey Mantle baseball card that sold for $ 5000 — or was it $ 50,000 ?
I ca n’t remember .
I do remember , though , that I saw that report and thought , “ I have that baseball card ! ”
The next weekend I went to my parent ’s house and searched for the card and , sure enough , I still had it .
Off to the card collectors store I gleefully went .
The store - owner took one look at the card and told me that he ’d give me $ 5 for it .
What disappointment !
The problem with my card was that it was pretty beaten up .
Well , of course it was .
What good are baseball cards to a six - year - old if you ca n’t put them in your bicycle spokes and make your bike sound like it has an airplane engine in it ?
Kids are kids and even though I collected these sorts of things , I still played with them .
So all of my stuff was pretty well bashed up .
Of course , kids still collect stuff .
It ’s the stuff that adults collect that are , by far , the most curious .
Here ’s an example : Go to Amazon.com and see these Star Wars toys that sell for thousands of dollars !
Of course , these sorts of items are not for kids to play with , but for an adult who thinks they could make money investing in this sort of thing .
Who in their right mind would buy this kind of junk ?
Top it off with the fact that you have to use a credit card to buy it .
Madness .
I guess it is a painful reminder of how our society has lived on a credit - fueled economy that just has to end someday .
If I had a collection of toys , cards , or postage stamps , today , I would sell them as quickly as possible .
This stuff is going to be worthless very soon .
Get money for it while you still can .
Or , I suppose it might be nice to give this stuff to a child and let them play with it .
Toys are just that ; toys .
I reckon that the Star Wars toys that sell for thousands of dollars might be something like those toxic assets we are always hearing about .
I suppose I ’d sell a toy for $ 3000 too , if I could find someone crazy enough to buy it .
When the economy crashes , though , what will these toys be worth ?
Thankfully , the one thing that I did collect when I was a boy — that is worth anything today — was old coins .
I looked around my house for those too recently and I found them .
I showed them to my son and , when he held one , he said , “ Treasure ! ” Interesting .
He ’s never said that when he held fiat currency that we use today .
I guess kids just have a knack for seeing through things and recognizing the difference between BS and the real McCoy .
Having cash on hand seems to be a very good idea nowadays .
Funny thing about having cash readily available , is that it allows you to save money .
How ?
Well , if you have the cash on hand , then it is easier to pay with it instead of using a credit card and having to pay interest .
Or , it will save you money by allowing you to not have to run down to the ATM and pay extra service charges all the time .
The other day , when the stock market was playing roller coaster once again , I convinced my wife that we need to buy silver and gold .
We drove to one of the few stores in Tokyo that allows you to take the coins or bars home with you .
When my son saw the gold coins in the window , once again he said , “ Treasure ! ”
Now , I am greatly relieved .
I have my home stocked up with food and water ; we use cash and keep it on hand ; and we ’ve started to protect ourselves with silver and gold .
Of course I wish I had more of all the items I listed above .
How could you possibly have too much food , cash , or silver and gold ?
But procrastinating and worrying about it is not going to help .
There ’s an old saying in Japan , “ Success is always due to spending 80 % of your efforts on preparation . ”
It ’s true .
Following this rule , you can protect yourself ( even at work ) and protect those you love .
Keep cash on hand .
Stock up on food and water , and buy silver and gold .
Being prepared is a great relief .

Neo -Cons to have a harder time pushing terrorist link after harsh rebuke
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Monday , September 8 , 2008
Neo -Cons are going to have a harder time equating the Iranian threat with 9/11 as the anniversary of the attack on America nears if the latest Al - Qaeda propaganda tape is to be believed .
In a new broadcast , Al - Qaeda number two Ayman al - Zawahiri viciously attacks Tehran as “ collaborators ” with the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq .
“ The leadership in Tehran is collaborating with the Americans in their occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Zawahiri said in the extract broadcast by Al - Jazeera today , reports AFP .
“ It recognises the subservient ( to Washington ) governments of these two countries , while at the same time pledging death and destruction to any state which dares touch Iranian soil , ” added the Egyptian deputy to Al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Zawahiri ’s purported rebuke towards the Iranians is not going to sit well with supporters of John McCain , for it was the Republican nominee who attempted to blur the lines between Sunni and Shia back in March when he was corrected by Joe Lieberman after claiming Iran was training Al - Qaeda terrorists .
Speaking to reporters in Amman , the Jordanian capital , McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives “ taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back . ”
Pressed to elaborate , McCain said it was “ common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran , that ’s well known .
And it ’s unfortunate . ”
A few moments later , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , standing just behind McCain , stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate ’s ear .
McCain then said : “ I ’m sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not al - Qaeda . ”
In reality , the two are arch enemies , Iran being a Shiite theocracy and Al - Qaeda being a Sunni Muslim organization .
But that has not stopped further claims of a relationship between Tehran and Al - Qaeda , made notably by the 9/11 Commission as well as other Neo - Con talking heads .
The build - up to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 was similarly preceded by relentless claims on behalf of top Bush administration officials that Saddam Hussein was in league with Al - Qaeda .
In reality , “ Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al - Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime , refusing all requests from al - Qaeda to provide material or operational support , ” according to a CIA report released in September 2006 .
The report concluded that there were no formal links between Saddam Hussein and any Al - Qaeda leaders before the 2003 invasion .
With the anniversary of 9/11 just around the corner , we can expect Neo -Cons and Bush administration officials to continue to invoke the 9/11 victims as a pretext for propagandizing for a war with Iran – despite the fact that Al - Qaeda , the very group the U.S. government claims was responsible for 9/11 , has now publicly scorned Tehran .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
In a study conducted in Florida , researchers found that drugstores in the poorest areas charge more , on average , for four widely used prescription medications than do pharmacies in wealthier neighborhoods .

Fortunately for patients who are uninsured but able to shop around , every ZIP code does include pharmacies that charge less for these drugs , the study team found .
“ If it ’s a medication you ’re going to be on for a while it ’s probably worth making a few phone calls , ” Dr. Walid F. Gellad of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and RAND Corporation told Reuters Health .
Gellad conducted the research while at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
Florida pharmacies that fill prescriptions for Medicaid patients are required by law to post their prices for the 100 most commonly used medications on a web site , MyFloridarx.com .
Using this web site , Gellad and colleagues looked at data for November 2006 on the ulcer drug Nexium , the asthma drug Advair , the heart drug Plavix , and the antibiotic azithromycin , specifically the “ Z - Pak ” formulation .
They then categorized all of Florida ’s 627 ZIP codes into four groups based on median income .
Across the board , the researchers found , the four drugs were priced highest in the poorest ZIP codes , averaging 9 percent more than the average for the state .
Independent pharmacies charged an average of 15 percent more for each of the drugs than the statewide average , but there was little geographic variation in the prices chain drugstores charged .
Drug stores in ZIP codes with median incomes below $ 20,000 , for example , charged $ 176 for a month ’s supply of Nexium , $ 213 for Advair , $ 163 for Plavix , and $ 55 for a Z - Pak , compared to $ 160 , $ 198 , $ 149 , and $ 50 , respectively , at pharmacies in ZIP codes where median income was greater than $ 60,000 .
“ Even small increases in drug prices can dramatically affect medication adherence among the poor , ” the researchers note in their report .
While the higher costs in poorer neighborhoods were largely driven by higher prices at independent drugstores , they point out , every ZIP code also had independent pharmacies that charged about the same as did chain drug stores .
But people living in poorer areas may have a tougher time shopping around , the researchers add , given limitations in health literacy , difficulty finding transportation , and other factors .
There are options available for people without health insurance to cut down on their out - of - pocket medication costs , Gellad noted , such as programs run by the pharmaceutical industry and by individual states .
Given that other states , including New York , Michigan and Minnesota , also have online drug price databases , “ it would be interesting to see if these kinds of issues of geographic variation in price are present in those areas as well , ” Gellad said .

Photo Gallery Food Fight Muy Grande
Every year the tiny Spanish town of Buñol is the setting for Europe 's biggest food fight : Revellers fling around 150,000 kilograms of overripe tomatoes until the town 's square has been transformed into a sea of tomato juice .
Robert Burton is the former chief of neurology at the University of California at San Francisco - Mt. Zion hospital .
He recently wrote a book , On Being Certain , that explored the neuroscience behind the feeling of certainty , or why we are so convinced we ’re right even when we ’re wrong .
He and Jonah Lehrer , the editor of Mind Matters , discussed the science of certainty .
LEHRER : What first got you interested in studying the mental state of certainty ?
BURTON : A personal confession : I have always been puzzled by those who seem utterly confident in their knowledge .
Perhaps this is a constitutional defect on my part , but I seldom have the sense of knowing unequivocally that I am right .
Consequently I have looked upon those who ooze self - confidence and certainty with a combination of envy and suspicion .
At a professional level , I have long wondered why so many physicians will recommend unproven , even risky therapies simply because they " know " that these treatments work .
It is easy to be cynical and suspect the worst of motives , from greed to ignorance , but I have known many first - rate , highly concerned and seemingly well motivated physicians who , nevertheless , operate based upon gut feelings and personal beliefs even in the face of contrary scientific evidence .
After years of rumination , it gradually dawned on me that there may be an underlying biological component to such behavior .
LEHRER : In your book , you compare the " feeling of certainty " that accompanies things such as religious fundamentalism to the feeling that occurs when we have a word on the - tip - of - our - tongue .
Could you explain ?
BURTON : There are two separate aspects of a thought , namely the actual thought , and an independent involuntary assessment of the accuracy of that thought .
To get a feeling for this separation , look at the Muller - Lyer optical illusion .
Even when we consciously know and can accurately determine that these two horizontal lines are the same length , we experience the simultaneous disquieting sensation that this thought — the lines are of equal length — is not correct .
This is n't a feeling that we can easily overcome through logic and reason ; it simply happens to us .
This sensation is a manifestation of a separate category of mental activity — - unconscious calculations as to the accuracy of any given thought .
On the positive side , such feelings can vary from a modest sense of being right , such as understanding that Christmas falls on December 25 , to a profound a - ha , " Eureka " or sense of a spiritual epiphany .
William James referred to the latter — the mystical experience — as " felt knowledge , " a mental sensation that is n't a thought , but feels like a thought .
Once we realize that the brain has very powerful inbuilt involuntary mechanisms for assessing unconscious cognitive activity , it is easy to see how it can send into consciousness a message that we know something that we can't presently recall — the modest tip - of - the - tongue feeling .
At the other end of the spectrum would be the profound " feeling of knowing " that accompanies unconsciously held beliefs — a major component of the unshakeable attachment to fundamentalist beliefs — both religious and otherwise — such as belief in UFOs or false memories .
LEHRER : Why do you think that the feeling of certainty feels so good ?
BURTON : Stick brain electrodes in rat pleasure centers ( the mesolimbic dopamine system primarily located in the upper brain stem ) .
The rats continuously press the bar , to the exclusion of food and water , until they drop .
In humans the same areas are activated with cocaine , amphetamines , alcohol , nicotine and gambling — to mention just a few behaviors to which one can become easily addicted .
It is quite likely that the same reward system provides the positive feedback necessary for us to learn and to continue wanting to learn .
The pleasure of a thought is what propels us forward ; imagine trying to write a novel or engage in a long - term scientific experiment without getting such rewards .
Fortunately , the brain has provided us with a wide variety of subjective feelings of reward ranging from hunches , gut feelings , intuitions , suspicions that we are on the right track to a profound sense of certainty and utter conviction .
And yes , these feelings are qualitatively as powerful as those involved in sex and gambling .
One need only look at the self - satisfied smugness of a " know it all " to suspect that the feeling of certainty can approach the power of addiction .
LEHRER : To what extent do these mechanisms come into play during a presidential election ?
It seems like we all turn into such partisan hacks every four years , completely certain that our side is right .
BURTON : The present presidential debates and associated media commentary feel like laboratory confirmation that the involuntary feeling of certainty plays a greater role in decision - making than conscious contemplation and reason .
I suspect that retreat into absolute ideologies is accentuated during periods of confusion , lack of governmental direction , economic chaos and information overload .
At bottom , we are pattern recognizers who seek escape from ambiguity and indecision .
If a major brain function is to maintain mental homeostasis , it is understandable how stances of certainty can counteract anxiety and apprehension .
Even though I know better , I find myself somewhat reassured ( albeit temporarily ) by absolute comments such as , " the stock market always recovers , " even when I realize that this may be only wishful thinking .
Sadly , my cynical side also suspects that political advisors use this knowledge of the biology of certainty to actively manipulate public opinion .
Nuance is abandoned in favor of absolutes .
LEHRER : How can people avoid the certainty bias ?
BURTON : I do n't believe that we can avoid certainty bias , but we can mitigate its effect by becoming aware of how our mind assesses itself .
As you may know from my book , I 've taken strong exception to the popular notion that we can rely upon hunches and gut feelings as though they reflect the accuracy of a thought .
My hope is the converse ; we need to recognize that the feelings of certainty and conviction are involuntary mental sensations , not logical conclusions .
Intuitions , gut feelings and hunches are neither right nor wrong but tentative ideas that must then be submitted to empirical testing .
If such testing is n't possible ( such as in deciding whether or not to pull out of Iraq ) , then we must accept that any absolute stance is merely a personal vision , not a statement of fact .
Perhaps one of my favorite examples of how certainty is often misleading is the great mathematician Srinivasava Ramanujan .
At his death , his notebook was filled with theorems that he was certain were correct .
Some were subsequently proven correct ; others turned out to be dead wrong .
Ramanujan ’s lines of reasoning lead to correct and incorrect answers , but he could n’t tell the difference .
Only the resultant theorems were testable .
In short , please run , do not walk , to the nearest exit when you hear so - called leaders being certain of any particular policy .
Only in the absence of certainty can we have open - mindedness , mental flexibility and willingness to contemplate alternative ideas .

Update : New version of the Konami Code is located here .
Since The DaVinci Code comes out on Friday , I thought it only made sense to promote the most famous gaming code … the Konami Code .
For those of you that do n’t know , the Konami Code is :
up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A
The Konami Code was first used in Gradius and when entered correctly would give the player full powerups , but the code is most well known for Contra where upon proper entry at the title screen would give the player 30 men … that ’s why I included a shot of Contra on the screen in the comic .
I had to use the sign language versions of A and B in the comic , I hope they translated well .
[ Note : I updated the name of this comic based on the name of the posting from Joystiq.com by Ross Miller … thanks ]

A First Nations leader in British Columbia says aboriginal issues are missing from the agenda in this year 's federal election campaign .
Shawn Atleo , the B.C. regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations , said it 's frustrating to see issues like the environment and the economy dominating the election , while federal party leaders are ignoring the issues that matter to Canada 's aboriginal population .
" It 's very difficult to talk about the economy in places like B.C. without talking about title and rights issues and negotiations , " he said .
" It 's difficult to talk about health without considering that First Nations health issues are a top issue in this country . "
Atleo also pointed out that the aboriginal community is the most vulnerable to changes in the environment , whether it 's the shifting patterns of caribou herds or the devastation of fishing stocks .
" And yet nowhere have we been able to see early on in the election any mention of First Nations issues , " he said .
The Assembly of First Nations has launched a campaign , called " Vote ' 08 , Change Can't Wait , " that aims to encourage the aboriginal community to become involved in the election and raise the profile of First Nations issues .
The group has designated Sept. 29 as a national day of action for Canada 's aboriginal people to raise the profile of First Nations issues .
While the Conservative government apologized in June to former students of the residential school program , Atleo said there is still work to be done heading into the future .
" Now , we want to talk about the action that must be taken , the true reconciliation that needs to occur , " he said .
" No longer can we just be pushed aside and ignored … an apology is just a beginning so we can't allow for a campaign to go on and not raise our voice and say , ' A campaign that does not include a focus on the No. 1 social justice issue in this country needs to change , ' " Atleo said .
The first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem .
The carnage on Wall Street suggests investors have taken that step -- accepting the reality that the economy is in or headed for a recession , possibly a severe one .
The next step , which many people are loath to face , is figuring out what to do with their now sharply diminished investment dollars .
History ...

HALLOWELL , Maine � People in central Maine are speaking out against " KKK " graffiti that showed up along a popular walking and bicycling trail .
More than 150 people gathered Wednesday on the Kennebec River Rail Trail in Hallowell to speak out against the more than 20 red and black " KKK " markings � shorthand for the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group � that were found along the trail last weekend .
The protest was organized after the Center for the Prevention of Hate Violence was overwhelmed by phone calls .
Steve Wessler , director of the center , said the markings are " messages of hate and terror . "
Information from The Kennebec Journal
Great .
I go on holiday , turn my back for a few weeks , come back and what has happened ?
The banks are on fire and we 're at war with Iceland .
As I type these words ( on a Friday morning , fact fans ) , Sky News is zooming in on a screen full of red flashing numbers , apparently willing them to fall yet lower .
The problem is a lack of confidence , they keep saying , cutting away every so often to show a big plunging downward arrow or a shot of a City trader holding his head in despair .
I 'm a bit sick of that whole holding - his - head - in - despair schtick , to be honest .
It 's about time they tried something more spectacular .
Surely it 's time for a revival of that great cliche of the 1930s , the ruined City whizzkid hurling himself out of the window ?
The credit crunch high dive .
Extra points if you manage to pull a backflip on the way down , or crack your jaw on a window cleaner 's cradle somewhere around floor 35 .
The ultimate high score goes to the first one who manages to successfully update his Facebook status using an iPhone seconds before slamming into the pavement .
" Danny is plummeting to his doom . "

Is this the end of the world ?
If so , it 's a bit more boring than I 'd imagined .
So far , it 's been an invisible apocalypse .
Poke your head out the window and there 's little evidence of charred debris .
Perhaps that 's yet to come .
Like I say , I 'm writing this on Friday morning .
By the time you read it , it 'll be Monday .
Maybe we 're already bartering with coloured pebbles or fighting over water or something .
Still , there 's no point in worrying .
If we 're going to be plunged into some kind of barbaric medieval dark age , I might as well be philosophical about it , because there 's no way I 'll survive more than a month .
I 'd be hopeless at fighting over basic resources and do n't have any essential manual skills , such as the ability to hunt and skin rats .
Perhaps I can learn the lute and become a minstrel , or perform bawdy jigs in exchange for pennies .
Assuming there are any pennies .
Hey , maybe just before all currency is finally declared worthless we 'll get to experience the whole wheelbarrows - full - of - worthless - banknotes thing , like they did in Germany just before the war .
That 'd be a blast .
It all seems particularly bizarre , because just over a week ago I was in Las Vegas , as part of a US road trip I 'm writing up for the Travel section .
The casino put me up in an outrageous suite the size of a millionaire 's bachelor pad .
It had a pool table , a butler , and a shower in the lounge with a lapdancing pole in the middle of it .
The windows looked out over the Las Vegas strip ; specifically over the multimillion - dollar fountain show at the front of Bellagio .
I visited a nightclub full of pricks who danced around tossing banknotes in the air , then returned to the suite , which alongside a pool table and a butler , also came equipped with about six gigantic , wall - mounted HD plasma TVs , every single one of which was screaming bad news about the economy .
I felt like I was trapped inside a terrifying satirical sci- fi flick .
And it had to happen , obviously .
For years , money was just appearing from nowhere , or so we were told .
People bought houses and bragged about how the value kept zooming up , and up , and up .
In fact they did n't seem to be houses at all , but magic coin - shitting machines .
It was all a dream , a dream in which you bought a box and lived in it , and all the time it generated money like a cow generates farts .
Great big stinking clouds of money .
And none of it was real .
And now it 's gone .
Your house is worth less than your shoes , and your shoes are now , in turn , worth less than your mouth and your arse .
Yes , your most valuable possessions are now your mouth and your arse , and you 're going to have to use both of them in all manner of previously unthinkable ways to make ends meet , to pay for that box , the box you live in , the one you mistook for an enchanted , unstoppable cash engine .
I hope you 've got a nice kitchen .
Maybe that 'll take your mind off things .
And sell that Alessi smoothie maker while you 're about it .
You can't afford fruit any more .
It 's tap water at best from now on .
It 's good for you !
Really , it is .
All of it was a dream .
All that crap we bought , all the bottled water and Blu - Ray players and designer shoes and iPod Shuffles and patio heaters ; all the jobs we had ; all the catchphrases we memorised and the stupid things we thought .
Everything we did for the past 10 years - none of it really felt real , did it ?
Time to snap out of it .
Time to grow our own vegetables and learn hand - to - hand combat with staves .
And time , perhaps , to really start living .

My dad emailed me an editorial from Investor ’s Business Daily – whose editorial page was described by the snarky , center - left online magazine Slate as veering “ to the outer reaches of the right , making even the Journal ‘s trademark business - friendly editorial line seem moderate . ”
The article my dad sent me stated that Obama is a “ stealth socialist , ” a kind of sleeper - agent for socialism , ready to unleash the forces of Marxism when he reaches the White House .
( The same accusations flew around Bill Clinton in 1992 . )
The editorial alleges that Obama speaks in code to like - minded audiences , specifically citing the scary term , “ economic justice . ”
A friend of mine writes in his Facebook feed , “ WAKE UP EVERYONE ! HE IS A SOCIALIST ! ” including this picture of Stalin ( a Communist . )
I think he would have done better to include something like this picture .
I thought of responding to this silly idea by pointing out that Palin and Stalin have most of the same letters in much the same order .
I think he would have done better to include something like this picture .
I thought of responding to this silly idea by pointing out that Palin and Stalin have most of the same letters in much the same order .
I ’ve been having a long - running conversation with another friend – an “ independent ” voter who has been a supporter of McCain since 2000 – but who is very suspicious of the “ far left ” and “ creeping socialism . ”
He believes that while Obama is not a socialist , he will allow those “ far lefties ” to gain influence and take away America ’s freedom .
Sarah Palin , in her debate with Joe Biden , brought up the specter of socialist health care and then quoted Ronald Reagan saying that “ freedom is always just one generation away from extinction ” – a phrase he used to attack the very popular Medicare program as socialist ( as Paul Krugman pointed out in a recent column ) .
The bailout and the various other proposals and actions by the Bush administration have been described in the pages of the financial journals as “ socialism for the rich , ” and there is a great deal of justifiable concern about the amount of leverage and power the government will have in the marketplace after this crisis has passed .
Making Sense of It
All in all – there ’s a lot of talk about socialism these days – driven by a fear , especially among the financial elite , that a blowback is coming .
At the same time , after the better part of four decades of Republican rule , the Republicans need to scare people out of voting for the charismatic candidate who ’s offering to help them in this time of crisis .
And certainly this ongoing financial crisis has demonstrated to many the insufficiency of the Republican approach to regulation and governance and the limitations of the market .
( Though not to Republicans and free - market ideologues who continue to insist that the problems that have spiraled out of control in the shadow banking system were the result of too much government in the more stable , regulated banking system . )
I could easily see a populist candidate gain power today by railing against the big money elites .
But Obama is not this candidate , let alone an advocate for socialism , class warfare , or any similar ideology .
( In fact , McCain ’s rhetoric comes closer to populist demagoguery of Wall Street . )
Obama ’s economic plan is not about socialism or revolution or any such radicalism .
He ’s not that type of politician .
The goal of his Obamanomics ( if you will ) is not a socialist paradise or a European - style market socialism but a restoration of the economic justice that made 1950s and 1960s America so stable .
Unless you think Leave It To Beaver took place in a socialist nation , then Obama ’s economic plans should n’t strike you as far left .
As Andrew Sullivan pointed out while thoroughly debunking the right - wing spin that Obama is “ far left , ” Obama is to Richard Nixon ’s right on taxes , which you would never guess from the ads Senator McCain has been running .
Even the “ code words ” that the Investors Business Daily finds to be so fraught with meaning – “ economic justice ” – which they insist is just code for socialism – are from1950s era American thinkers Kelso and Adler .
They were the authors of the 1958 Capitalist Manifesto , a book which sought to figure out how to make American capitalism more just – while acknowledging that “ capitalism [ is ] the only just form of economic life . ”
Barack Obama ’s economic plan falls well within the mainstream of American economic history .
Alexander Hamilton – that first budding capitalist of a new nation – believed that government must create and maintain infrastructure , encourage industry , and maintain financial stability through central banks and financial regulation .
Henry Clay promoted ( and Abraham Lincoln supported ) what he called “ the American system ” – which included various government interventions to build up American industry .
After the Civil War , industry gained more and more power – and by the time the Panic of 1873 gave way to the Gilded Age , extreme capitalism had taken over America – with extreme concentrations of wealth and vast amounts of power concentrated in the hands of a few magnates .
McCain ’s hero , Teddy Roosevelt , believed that we needed to protect essential institutions and elements of society from extreme capitalism – and focused on environmental conservation , on breaking up monopolies and other concentrations of power , on increasing regulations and beginning government ’s role as a protector of consumer rights .
This conservatism of Teddy Roosevelt ’s resembled that of William F. Buckley – who defined conservatism as a man standing athwart history , yelling , “ Stop ! ”
As a result of Teddy Roosevelt ’s reforms , and then the turmoil of the Great Depression , World War II , Hoover , FDR , and Truman – America had reached a point of social and economic stability .
This stability of the 1950s and 1960s came at the expense of tamping down certain social and economic forces .
The social stability was torn apart by the Civil Rights movement , feminism , free love , and the later radicalisms of the late 1960s and early 1970s .
This culture war has been dominating politics since then .
The economic stability of this period was destroyed by the forces of extreme capitalism , greed , deregulation , and other economic radicalisms of the 1970s and early 1980s – as labor unions were undermined , executive compensation grew exponentially , social mobility was impeded , and economic power concentrated in a handful of large corporations .
The excesses of the social radicalism of the 1960s have been cataloged by the conservative movement – and many of the worst excesses have been reversed – while other elements have become accepted by the vast majority of Americans .
There has been no similar concentrated political effort to moderate the other radicalism that destroyed the status quo of the 1950s and 1960s America , extreme capitalism .
Just as the social radicalism of the 1960s produced great good – from the Civil Rights Movement to women ’s rights – and the mainstream opposition today accepts these progressive strides forward , so the economic radicalism introduced market forces , encouraged competition , and has elevated many people in Third World nations from abject poverty as it ’s mainstream opposition today accepts these positive effects of the market .
Obama belongs in this camp of mainstream opponents of extreme capitalism .
His agenda stems from an understanding of the middle class best encapsulated in this clip from West Wing , which though it aired ten years ago , seems eerily relevant today :
Obama ’s economic plan is a response to this wish to make things “ just a little bit easier . ”
It is an attempt to temper the forces of globalization and extreme capitalism that have wreaked havoc in our society and position us to compete in a globalized marketplace .
Like Teddy Roosevelt , he ’s attempting to protect the core values of our society from economic radicalism ; like Alexander Hamilton , Henry Clay , Abraham Lincoln , and Americans throughout history – he is proposing investments in our infrastructure and incentives for industry .
Obama ’s plan is n’t perfect – it ’s just a start .
It ’s just tinkering – which is how that sage Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes “ the best we can do ” to improve our condition .
It ’s an attempt to make things “ just a little bit easier . ”
When Obama talks about “ economic justice ” he is not referring to some obscure Communist codeword – he is calling us to remember the world of Leave It To Beaver – a world where firemen and bankers , lawyers and plumbers , could all live in the same neighborhood .
Obama does n’t pretend he can bring back this past – but he believes we must stop the forces of extreme capitalism from destroying this American ideal and that we must take pro-active steps to reduce the destabilizing effects of globalization and capitalism while protecting our core values as a society .
This is n’t socialism – this is common sense – and it has been the American system since our founding .
The radicals are those who propose we do nothing in the face of attacks on our way of life and in the face of economic calamity – the nihilists among the House Republicans and the Hooverites and those who continue to favor deregulation and oppose sensible government intervention in the markets .
The radicals are those who believe the free market will cure all ills and will heal itself .
Those who claim that Barack Obama would be the most liberal president in history must have skipped the American history classes covering the period before 1980 .
Those who claim he is a socialist are just plain wrong .

This artist 's concept shows a magnetic portal connecting Earth 's magnetic field connecting to the sun's .
The spacecraft is on hand to measure the high - energy particles and fields flowing through the portal .
Like giant , cosmic chutes between the Earth and sun , magnetic portals open up every eight minutes or so to connect our planet with its host star .
Once the portals open , loads of high - energy particles can travel the 93 million miles ( 150 million km ) through the conduit during its brief opening , space scientists say .
Called a flux transfer event , or FTE , such cosmic connections not only exist but are possibly twice as common as anyone ever imagined , according to space scientists who attended the 2008 Plasma Workshop in Huntsville , Ala. , last week .
" Ten years ago I was pretty sure they did n't exist , but now the evidence is incontrovertible , " said David Sibeck , an astrophysicist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland .
Dynamic bursts
Researchers have long known that the Earth and sun must be connected .
For instance , particles from the sun are constantly whisked away via the solar wind and often follow magnetic field lines that connect the sun 's atmosphere with terra firma .
The field lines allow particles to penetrate Earth 's magnetosphere , the magnetic bubble that surrounds our planet .
" We used to think the connection was permanent and that solar wind could trickleinto the near - Earth environment anytime the wind was active , " Sibeck said .
" We were wrong .
The connections are not steady at all .
They are often brief , bursty and very dynamic . "
Several speakers at the workshop outlined the formation of a flux transfer event .
Oneidea is that on the side of Earth facing the sun , our magnetic field presses against the sun 's magnetic field .
And about every eight minutes , the two fields briefly reconnect , forming a portal through which particles can flow .
The portal takes the form of a magnetic cylinder about as wide as Earth .
Sibeck said to think of the FTE as a giant rolling pin that lies flat along the boundary between the Earth 's and sun 's magnetic fields .
( He noted the rolling pin would have to be malleable so it could pierce through both magnetic fields while lying flat . )
" These FTEs kind of look like roller pins , and they form as little blob roller pins atthe tip of the magnetosphere facing the sun , " Sibeck told SPACE.com .
"
They can't decide which way they 're going to slide around the Earth , so they grow there into big roller pins and then they take off and sort of spirally roll along [ Earth 's magnetosphere ] like you 're pounding out dough . "
More than one FTE can form at once , he said , and they stay open for about 15 to 20 minutes .
More to learn
In order to measure such FTEs , spacecraft must not only catch them forming but also be oneither end of the magnetic structures ( either lengthwise or widthwise ) .
In fact , the European Space Agency 's fleet of four Cluster spacecraft and NASA 's five THEMIS probes have flown through and surrounded these cylinders , measuring their dimensions and sensing the particles that shoot through , Sibeck said .
While these measurements have nailed down the width of an FTE , the length is still uncertain though one measurement put it at up to five Earth radii .
One Earth radius is about 4,000 miles ( 6,400 kilometers ) .
Astrophysicist Jimmy Raeder of the University of New Hampshire used those measurements to develop computer simulations of the portals .
He found the cylindrical portals tend to form above Earth 's equator and then in December , the FTEs would roll over the North Pole .
In July , they roll over the South Pole .
Sibeck thinks the events occur twice as often as previously thought , proposing two types of flux transfer events : active and passive .
When the magnetic cylinders are active , they allow particles to flow through rather easily , forming important conduits of energy for Earth 's magnetosphere , Sibeck said .
When passive , the cylinders have more resistance to transiting particles .
The internal structure of a passive cylinder makes it tougher for particles and magnetic fields to flow through .
Sibeck has calculated the properties of passive FTEs and hopes he and his colleagues will hunt for signs of them in data collected with THEMIS and Cluster .
The space scientists at the workshop still want to figure out why the portals form every eight minutes and how magnetic fields inside the cylinders twist and coil .
MIT Energy Storage Discovery Could Lead to ‘ Unlimited ’ Solar Power
October 25th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) have discovered a new way of storing energy from sunlight that could lead to ‘ unlimited ’ solar power .
The process , loosely based on plant photosynthesis , uses solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases .
When needed , the gases can then be re-combined in a fuel cell , creating carbon - free electricity whether the sun is shining or not .
According to project leader Prof. Daniel Nocera , “ This is the nirvana of what we ’ve been talking about for years .
Solar power has always been a limited , far - off solution .
Now , we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon . “
Nocera has also explained that the process ( video ) uses natural materials , is inexpensive to conduct and is easy to set up .
“ That ’s why I know this is going to work .
It ’s so easy to implement , ” he said .
Other prominent scientists in the field have rushed to highlight the revolutionary potential of the new process .
According to James Barber , biochemistry professor at Imperial College London , this research is a ‘ giant leap ’ towards generating clean , carbon - free energy on as massive scale .
In a statement , he also said :
“ This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind .
The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production , thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . ”
No news has yet been released of a predicted timescale to commericial development or mainstream adoption .
However , Nocera has said that he ’s hopeful that within 10 years homes will no longer be powered using electricity - by - wire from a central source .
Instead , homeowners will be able to harness solar power during daylight hours and use this new energy storage method for electricity at night .

Dutch City Opens World 's First Mine Water Power Station
October 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Last week , the Dutch city of Heerlen opened the world ’s first geothermal power station that uses water heated in old coalmine shafts .
The power station works by pumping water up from 800 meters deep in the mines .
At that depth , the water reaches a temperature of 35 C ( 95 F ) .
It heats 350 homes and is pumped back into the mines after use , where it recirculates two to three times a year .
Scientists working on the project say that it will produce 55 percent fewer CO2 emissions than a coal - fired power station .
They are working on a carbon capture system for the geothermal power station — but such systems can take many years to get going .
The only major drawback to the project is that homes can only use the power station ’s heat if they are close to the mines .
But in old mining towns with lots of jobless residents , geothermal projects such as Heerlen ’s could be just the thing to get the local economy moving .

The Egyptian government says it has placed a ban on Egyptian doctors going to work in Saudi Arabia in the wake of two medics being sentenced to jail .
Rauf Amin Mohammad al - Arabi , who had worked for the royal family for 20 years , was sentenced to 15 years in jail and 1,500 lashes .
He and Shawky Abd -Rabbu were convicted of prescribing morphine to a princess - who then became a drug addict .
His wife has pleaded for leniency , saying the lashes will kill him .
The Egyptian authorities say the ban on new work permits will not affect doctors already in Saudi Arabia .
Arabi is said to have prescribed morphine to the woman after she sustained injuries in a riding accident .
It 's impossible that he will be able to handle 1,500 lashes
Fathiya Shehata Hendawi
Some reports claim the princess had already been prescribed the drugs in the US and had specified the medication she wanted , BBC Cairo correspondent Christian Fraser says .
The sister of Abd - Rabbu said her brother was coerced into making false confessions and the Saudi authorities had threatened to imprison his wife who is also working in the kingdom .
Seventy of the lashes were reportedly administered last week , with 70 next week .
The doctors had denied the allegations , but were initially sentence to 750 lashes on charges of malpractice .
They appealed but lost and the sentence was then doubled .
Arabi's wife , Fathiya Shehata Hendawi , says the sentence will kill her husband .
She has begged for leniency and is appealing to the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to save his life .
" It 's impossible that he will be able to handle 1,500 lashes .
Maybe after the ninth or 10th one he will be killed .
God forbid .
" Who benefits from this ?
Not his kids , their father is a victim of something he did not do .
He is a victim of complete injustice , " she said .
The Saudi royal family has refused to comment but a number of Egyptian newspapers blame their own government , which they say suffers an inferiority complex when it comes to dealing with the oil rich Saudis , says our correspondent .

Thought processes made visible :
An international team of scientists headed by Mazahir Hasan of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg has succeeded in optically detecting individual action potentials in the brains of living animals .
The scientists introduced fluorescent indicator proteins into the brain cells of mice via viral gene vectors : the illumination of the fluorescent proteins indicates both when and which neurons are communicating with each other .
This new method enables the observation of brain activity over a period of many months and provides new ways of identifying , for example , the early onset of dysfunction in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson’s .
The fluorescent proteins could also provide scientists with information about the ways in which normal aging processes affect nerve cell communication .
A nerve cell is a major hub for the exchange of valuable information .
The nose , eyes , ears , and other sense organs perceive our environment through various antennae known as receptors .
The numerous stimuli are then passed on to the neurons .
All of this information is collected , processed , and finally transferred to specific brain centers at these hubs - the human brain consists of almost 100 billion nerve cells .
The nerve cell uses a special means of transport for this purpose : the action potential which codes the information , thus enabling communication between the nerve cells .
Calcium as the starting gun
An action potential of this kind is an electrical excitation and arises when our nerve cells receive the information via a stimulus : the voltage across the cell membrane of the neuron changes and various ion channels open and close in a very specialized manner .
Shortly before the nerve cell forwards the information via the stimulus , calcium ions pour into the nerve cell , acting as the starting gun for the flow of data from one neuron to the next .
advertisement
In the past , action potential was measured and rendered visible using microelectrodes .
However , this method only enabled the monitoring of a limited number of cells engaged in the process of communication .
Moreover , scientists were unable to record neuronal communication in a clearly identifiable way over a longer period or in freely moving animals using this method .
Yellow and blue fluorescent proteins
This situation could be set to change .
As part of an intensive international cooperation project , Mazahir Hasan has made nerve cells , which release a single action potential , optically visible in mice .
This means that the communication of entire groups of neurons can be observed over an extended period of time .
Mazahir Hasan also attracted attention in 2004 when he demonstrated for the first time that fluorescent proteins are suitable for making activity in the brains of mice visible ( Hasan et al. , 2004 PLoS Biology 2:e163 ) .
For this new recent development , Hasan used a sensor protein called D3cpv , which was generated by Amy Palmer at the Roger Tsien Laboratory of the University of California in San Diego , as a complex of numerous interconnected protein subunits .
Two of these subunits react to the binding of calcium ions to the complex : the yellow - fluorescent protein ( YFP ) lights up and the illuminating power of cyan - fluorescent protein ( CFP ) declines - a coincidence that would later prove crucial to the success of the study .
The Max Planck scientists introduced the corresponding genetic material - that is the construction manual for this protein complex - into the genetic material of viruses .
Hasan and his team then used these viruses as a genetic " ferry " for introducing the genetic material into the brains of mice .
The protein complex was actually produced in the nerve cells of the " infected " mice and functions there as an calcium indicator : if the calcium level within a cell increases - which is the case with every action potential - the D3cpv changes form when it binds to calcium .
As a result , the two fluorescent proteins , CFP and YFP , move closer to each other and the transmission of energy between the CFP and YFP changes .
" To observe this change , we use a two - photon microscope developed by Winfried Denk " , explains Hasan .
Each individual action potential that arises due to a stimulus makes itself directly perceivable in the brain through yellow illumination and the simultaneous reduction in the emission of blue light .
The two - photon microscope pinpoints the coincidence between the two fluorescent signals very accurately and clearly reveals which nerve cells are communicating and exchanging information with each other and when .
Damian Wallace and Jason Kerr from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen were able to confirm this finding : targeted electrical recordings of neuronal activity after the triggering of stimulus showed that the colour change actually coincides with the firing of the action potentials .
Hasan ’s method sheds light on which nerve cells will talk to each other and in which time period .
However , it is only applicable if the neurons fire action potentials with a frequency of less than one hertz .
Insight into complex thought processes
The researchers were thus able to demonstrate for the first time that genetic calcium indicators provide optical proof of the perceptions of the sensory system in higher organisms .
" With this method we can understand , in greater detail , how the human brain regulates complex thought processes and , for example , how it transforms the numerous sensory impressions into long - term memories " , says Hasan .
Developments resulting from the aging of the nerve cells can also be understood better as a result - " as we now have a way of observing the neurons over longer periods of time , " concludes Hasan .
Moreover , the sensor proteins could prove very useful in helping researchers to reach a better understanding at the cellular level of neurological diseases including Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , and Huntington ’s chorea .

Neel Kashkari , the fox appointed to guard the henhouse and front the multi-trillion dollar bailout , faced angry questions from Dennis Kucinich and Rep.
Darrell Issa during a hearing today , as Issa accused him of playing a “ bait and switch ” game with taxpayers ’ money .
All the major networks carried footage of the U.S.
House subcommittee hearing this morning and aired Kashkari ’s opening statement in full .
But as soon as Kucinich and Issa were about to weigh in , the networks almost simultaneously cut the feed and moved on to a different story .
Another example of how the corporate media is owned by the same elite that runs the Federal Reserve .
Kucinich accused Paulson and Bush of circumventing Congress by completely changing the destination of where the bailout money would go and refusing to disclose what had happened to $ 2 trillion dollars of taxpayer money , adding , “ I think it ’s fairly obvious that Congress would have never passed the [ rescue plan ] had it known how Treasury would marshal the resources it was given . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Kucinich ’s battle with Kashkari went as follows , according to a Washington Post blog report .
“ I assure you the secretary is passionate about this , ” Kashkari said .
“ Passionate about what ? ” Kucinich said .
“ About helping homeowners , ” Kashkari replied .
“ Where ? ” Kucinich asked , sarcastically .
“ What country ? ” “ We are using all the tools available to ease the credit crises , ” Kashkari said .
“ Let me give you an example … ” Kucinich interrupted Kashkari and continued his harangue .
“ Maybe this is a game to some people in the administration .
They ’re on their way out of office and they can do whatever they want , ” said Kucinich who tried to launch impeachment proceedings against Bush .
“ Meanwhile , people are hoping against hope ” for help with their mortgages .
Kashkari tried to explain why the $ 700 billion was not used to buy troubled mortgages , but Kucinich would hear none of it .
Shortly after , Rep. Darrell Issa told Kashkari , “ You ’re here today because Congress is convinced you played a bait - and - switch and you ’re not doing anything to convince us otherwise , ” accusing the former Goldman Sachs executive of playing “ ring around the rosie ” with their questions .
Others slammed Kashkari for the administration ’s agenda of helping banks while abandoning consumers .
“ This administration wants to privatize Wall Street ’s gains and socialize Wall Street ’s losses , ” said Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Md .
“ Secretary Paulson ’s policy reversal breaks with Congressional intent , contradicts public assurances previously made by Treasury , and leaves the federal government without an adequate mechanism to stem a tide of home foreclosures , ” said Kucinich .
“ Thus , the only significant use by Treasury of the funds Congress authorized to address the mortgage crisis underlying the financial crisis includes , among other things , propping up a Beverly Hills banker to the stars ; subsidizing the evisceration of National City Bank and the laying - off of thousands of Clevelanders who worked there ; and indirectly funding the payment of bonuses , compensation , and dividends by financial firms that could not have afforded to make them without the TARP capital infusion , ” Kucinich continued .

A few days later , relaxing over tea at her sister ’s house , Ms. Halawi , still dressed in a black abaya , an Islamic gown , expanded on the theme of the ceremony .
Religious education now begins much earlier than it did in her parents ’ time , she explained .
Islamic schools , some run by Hezbollah , begin Koranic lessons at the age of 4 , and it is common for girls to start fasting and wearing a hijab at 8 .
In all this , the mother ’s guidance is the key .
“ This is women ’s jihad , ” Ms. Halawi said .
Camp , With a Moral Portion
From a distance , it resembles any other Boy Scout camp in the world .
Two rows of canvas tents face each other on the banks of the Litani River , the powder - blue stream that runs across southern Lebanon not far from the Israeli border .
A hand - built wooden jungle gym stands near the camp entrance , where pine trees sway in the breeze and dry , brown hills are visible in the distance .
Then , planted on sticks in the river , two huge posters bearing the faces of Ayatollah Khomeini and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , the leader of Hezbollah , come into view .
“ Since 1985 we have managed to raise a good generation , ” said Muhammad al - Akhdar , 25 , a scout leader , as he showed a visitor around the grounds .
“ We had 850 kids here this summer , ages 9 to 15 . ”
This camp is called Tyr fil Say , one of the sites in south Lebanon where the Mahdi Scouts train .
Much of what they do is similar to the activities of scouts the world over : learning to swim , to build campfires , to tie knots and to play sports .
Mr. Akhdar described some of the games the young scouts play , including one where they divide into two teams — Americans and the Resistance — and try to throw one another into the river .
The Mahdi Scouts also get visits from Hezbollah fighters , wearing camouflage and toting AK - 47s , who talk about fighting Israel .
Mr. Akhdar led a visitor around the tents , where boys had been spelling out Koranic phrases like “ the promise ” and “ the owner of time ” using stones .
There was also a meticulously arranged grave , complete with lettering and decoration .
In place of the headstone was a small photograph of Imad Mugniyah , the Hezbollah commander who was killed in February and who was widely viewed in the West as the mastermind of decades of bombings , kidnappings and hijackings .

This past weekend I had the pleasure of conducting two great interviews on the air as I was doing a broadcast of Women ’s Field Hockey and Men ’s Soccer for Stevens ’ Athletics .
The first interview was of Stevens ’ President Hal Raveché who routinely attends games and found a few minutes to talk to us about homecoming weekend and what he thought of the festivities that have occurred over the past few weeks in Empire 8 .
The second interview which turned out to be much more intriguing as former D - III soccer player and Survivor : Africa winner , Ethan Zohn , was in attendance to promote Grassroot Soccer United ( GSRU ) , his foundation which is a youth led movement to end HIV / AIDS in Africa .
It all started when he was selected to compete in Survivor the reality television show which he ended up winning and earning $ 1 Million .
Upon winning the large sum of money , he decided to use the funds to start this foundation .
Just a little more information on Ethan Zohn : On August 20 , 2008 he began his 500 - mile Dribble Campaign .
Dribbling a soccer ball out of the New England Revolution game in Foxboro , Massachusetts , Ethan Zohn will continue his journey down the East Coast with a ball at his feet the entire way .
His trip will take him through New York City , Philadelphia and other stops and exciting events all the way to Washington , D.C .
If anyone wants to help and donate , feel free to donate here .
Also , please to visit GRSU ’s website to find out more about his cause , track his daily progress on his journey from Boston to the nation ’s capital and much more .

California ’s six most senior Episcopal bishops Wednesday unanimously declared their opposition to a constitutional amendment on the statewide November ballot that would ban same - sex marriage .
The bishops argued that preserving the right of gays and lesbians to marry would enhance the “ Christian values ” of monogamy , love and commitment .
“ We believe that continued access to civil marriage for all , regardless of sexual orientation , is consistent with the best principles of our constitutional rights , ” said the Rt. Rev. J. Jon Bruno , bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles .
Bruno , flanked at a news conference by fellow clergy members and gay and straight couples , added : “ We do not believe that marriage of heterosexuals is threatened by same - sex marriage . ”

By going on the record against Proposition 8 , which would reverse the California Supreme Court ’s decision in May to legalize same - sex marriage , the bishops waded into a volatile political and religious controversy .
Gay marriage has strained the Episcopalians ’ international body , the Anglican Communion , with hundreds of bishops from Africa and elsewhere threatening to break away over attempts to change church doctrine and practice .
The issue has created theological fissures in other Protestant denominations , including Presbyterians and United Methodists , with some Methodist ministers in California pledging to perform wedding ceremonies in defiance of their national church .
Proposition 8 supporters , intent on protecting what they call a 5,000 - year - old tradition codified in the Bible , are mobilizing forces across several religious groups .

The Protect Marriage Coalition announced plans last month for 1 million Catholics , Mormons , Jews , Muslims , evangelical Christians , Sikhs and Hindus to plant 1 million “ Yes on Proposition 8 " lawn signs in their frontyards .
In addition , the coalition is sending volunteers door to door to speak with voters and planning an advertising campaign , to begin as early as the end of this month .
“ Marriage is an institution for a man and a woman , ” said Jeff Flint , the campaign ’s co-chairman .
“ The institution of marriage around which society is constructed means less when it ’s not the traditional definition . ”
But in a joint statement , issued Wednesday at the diocesan headquarters in Echo Park , the six bishops said that “ society is strengthened when two people who love each other choose to enter into marriage , engaged in a lifetime of disciplined relationship building that serves as a witness to the importance of love and commitment . ”
The statement was signed by Bruno and Bishops Marc Handley Andrus , Barry L. Beisner , Mary Gray - Reeves , Jerry A. Lamb and James R. Mathes .
( Three assistant bishops -- Chester L. Talton , Sergio Carranza and Steven Charleston -- also signed . )

The bishops concluded : “ We believe that this continued access [ to marriage ] promotes Jesus ’ ethic of love , giving and hope . ”
While the Episcopal leaders agreed on the need to preserve the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed , they disagreed over how , and if , to conduct weddings , in light of the church ’s Book of Common Prayer , which defines marriage as between a man and a woman .
According to the joint statement , some of the six bishops believe it is appropriate to allow priests to officiate at marriage ceremonies and pronounce blessings , while others want to wait to hear from the Episcopal Church ’s governing body , the General Convention .
It meets next in Anaheim in July 2009 .
( At its 2006 meeting , the General Convention passed a resolution opposing state or federal constitutional amendments that prohibit same - sex civil marriage . )
Mathes , bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of San Diego , said the Episcopal Church must alter language on same - sex marriage before priests begin officiating .
Advertisement
“ I just do n’t believe we have been authorized to do them , ” Mathes said .
“ I am not keen on unilateral action . ”
Andrus , bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California , said he encourages couples -- straight or gay -- to marry in civil ceremonies and then receive a blessing in church .
The compromise stops short of priests performing the rites of marriage for same - sex couples .
Andrus , whose diocese covers the Bay Area , said this practice allows him to honor the rights of gay and lesbian couples while keeping his diocese tethered to the Anglican fold .
“ We have recognized that we as a global body need each other , ” he said .
“ This diocese , by its faithfulness to the larger body , could serve as a catalyst for change . ”
The conflict over Proposition 8 is unfolding amid a wrenching dispute over homosexuality in the Anglican Communion , which has 80 million members worldwide .
Advertisement
Conservative bishops from Africa and other regions have balked at reform efforts by more liberal leaders , primarily from North America .
The election of an openly gay bishop , V. Gene Robinson , to the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003 intensified the conflict .
Several hundred conservative bishops and archbishops boycotted the once - a- decade Lambeth Conference of Anglicans , held in July .
A month before that meeting in England , the conservatives met in Jerusalem .
They decided to remain within the global communion but proposed a new council with the authority to create alternative provinces in places where church authorities failed , in the conservatives ’ opinion , to follow the Gospel .
Episcopal leaders in California believe that acknowledging the rights of homosexuals to marry does follow the Gospel .

“ We ’re talking about our friends , our neighbors , ” Abel Lopez , a priest with All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , said at the news conference with Bruno .
“ These are people in our own families . . . people who deserve the [ same ] rights as anyone else . ”

Solar Sunroof Recharges Car Battery and Provides Temperature Control
August 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Sunroofs are no longer just an easy route to windblown hair and a sunburn with Sunrise Solar ’s introduction of the solar sunroof .
The technology replaces the traditional glass sunroof with solar technology that generates electricity to recharge a car ’s batteries while either cooling or warming the parked car depending on the weather .
Of course , a solar - powered sun roof does not provide nearly enough energy to power an entire car .
It might be enough to keep some ventilation fans blowing , but it could n’t fully recharge a car ’s battery during a single day .
Unfortunately , Sunrise Solar ’s website provides scant detail about the inner workings of the solar sunroof .
The site does , however , give a brief introduction to the company ’s other products , which include a solar - powered cell phone charger and a solar light brick .
Asola is also working on a solar sunroof for Fisker Automotive ’s Karma , a plug - in hybrid due to be released late next year .

Bible Rules
Thou shalt not kill or take the Lord 's name in vain , yadda - yadda , we know about that , but did you know there are many more rules that Christians need to follow ?
How important are these rules ?
- Deuteronomy 28:15 :
But it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee
Do the rules still apply , applied only to the Jews or had Jesus ' covenant made them obsolete ?
No .
The rules still apply .
Jesus himself ( in hearsay of course ) says so :
- Luke 16:16 - 17 :
The law and the prophets [ were ] until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
KJV
- Matthew 5:17 - 18 :
Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
KJV
Even in the more modern , supposedly less - biased NIV , it 's made clear :
- Matthew 5:17 - 20 :
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them .
I tell you the truth , until heaven and earth disappear , not the smallest letter , not the least stroke of a pen , will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished .
Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law , you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven .
New International Version
Jesus says quite clearly , paying homage to him wo n't get you into heaven .
Only following OT laws ( will of his father ) will :
- Matthew 7:21 -23 :
“ Not everyone saying to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will .
Many will say to me in that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and expel demons in your name , and perform many powerful works in your name ? ’
And yet then I will confess to them : I never knew YOU !
Get away from me , YOU workers of lawlessness . ”
People God Does n't Like
- Proverbs 6:16 -19 :
There are six things the Lord hates , seven that are detestable to him : haughty eyes , a lying tongue , hands that shed innocent blood , a heart that devises wicked schemes , feet that are quick to rush into evil , a false witness who pours out lies , and a person who stirs up conflict in the community .
Arbitrary Rules
Likely born of goofy superstition or just a tyrannical need to control virtually every facet of gullible peoples ' lives ...
You cannot wear clothing made of more than one material , nor plant two different seeds in a field
- Leviticus 19:19 :
" ... do not plant your field with two kinds of seed .
Do not wear material woven of two kinds of material . "
You cannot have tattoos
- Leviticus 19:28 :
" Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD . "
Worship
You should not pray in public
Only hypocrites pray in public .
You should keep your prayers to yourself , in private .
- Matthew 6:5-6 :
And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men .
Verily I say unto you ,
They have their reward .
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
Public proselytizing will land you in hell !
" Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them ; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven . "
This is unambiguous ... if you go running around in public spouting off about your beliefs , you 're not welcome in heaven .
- Matthew 6:1 :
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
When you do pray , keep it short and sweet
- Matthew 6:7 :
But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
God will not forgive those who refuse to forgive others
- Matthew 6:15 :
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
God can't stand handicapped , blemished , injured or disfigured people
God can't stand the sight of crippled people .
The blind , the lame , dwarfs , people with funny noses or blemishes , with damaged testicles , or broken hands or feet , crooked backs , or who have scurvy or scabs , or who have anything superfluous must not approach the altar of God .
- Leviticus 21:17 -21 :
Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God .
For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or any thing superfluous , Or a man that is brokenfooted , or brokenhanded , Or crookbackt , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or be scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire : he hath a blemish ; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God .
Sinning
If you are a party to someone else 's sin , you might as well be dead
- Matthew 18:6 :
" If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned at the bottom of the sea . "
Regarding those who believe differently
Kill those who do n't serve Jesus
- Luke 19:27 :
But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them -- bring them here and kill them in front of me . '
Non-believers must be killed
Actually , it seems if you 're even unwilling to listen to the priest , you should be put to death .
- Deuteronomy 17:12 :
And the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
Speak unfavorably of God and you get killed
- Leviticus 24:16 :
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD , he shall surely be put to death , and all the congregation shall certainly stone him : as well the stranger , as he that is born in the land , when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord , shall be put to death .
Religious people should disassociate with non-believers
- 2 Corinthians 6:14 - 16 :
Do not be yoked together with unbelievers .
For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common ?
Or what fellowship can light have with darkness ?
What harmony is there between Christ and Belial [b ] ?
What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols ?
If you 're not a friend of Jesus , you 're an enemy
The bible promotes binary thinking , either you 're with us or you 're against us .
- Matthew 12:30 :
He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
You must not associate with greedy people , gays , adulterers , liars , or drunks
- 1 Corinthians 5:11 :
But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy , an idolater or a slanderer , a drunkard or a swindler .
With such a man do not even eat .
Health and well - being
Prayer cures all
- James 5:13 - 15 :
Is any among you afflicted ?
let him pray .
Is any merry ?
let him sing psalms .
Is any sick among you ?
let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
If you believe in God , you can speak in tongues , handle snakes and drink deadly poison without being hurt :
- Mark 16:17 - 18 :
And these signs shall follow them that believe ;
In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
What 's amusing is this is one of the Bible passages cited by the Pentecosts , Robert Tilton , Benny Hinn and other " holy rollers " who " speak in tongues " and claim to be faith healers .
How often do you see them drinking poison or handling dangerous snakes to prove their faith ?
- Luke 10:19 :
Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
Whatever you want , all you need to do is pray
- Matthew 21:22 :
" And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . "
Holidays and celebrations
Heathens put up Christmas trees , not Christians
The next time a self - righteous Christian starts talking about " keeping Christ in Christmas " , be sure to remind them of Jerimiah 10:2 , which says that those who display holiday trees are heathens ...
- Jerimiah 10:2-5 :
Thus saith the LORD , Learn not the way of the heathen , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the heathen are dismayed at them .
For the customs of the people are vain : for one cutteth a tree out of the forest , the work of the hands of the workman , with the axe .
They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
They are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they can not go .
Be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
Respect
The more people dislike , insult and persecute you , the more righteous you are and the more you get in heaven
This is what we call " The Fred Phelps " passage
- Matthew 5:11 - 12 NIV :
Blessed are you when people insult you , persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me .
Rejoice and be glad , because great is your reward in heaven , for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
Talk unfavorably to your parents and you will be put to death
- Leviticus 20:9 :
For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cursed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
Government , Politics and Authority
You must submit to the government authorities , including paying taxes
- Romans 13:1-7 :
Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which God has established .
The authorities that exist have been established by God .
Consequently , he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted , and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves .
For rulers hold no terror for those who do right , but for those who do wrong .
Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority ?
Then do what is right and he will commend you .
For he is God 's servant to do you good .
But if you do wrong , be afraid , for he does not bear the sword for nothing .
He is God 's servant , an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer .
Therefore , it is necessary to submit to the authorities , not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience .
This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God 's servants , who give their full time to governing .
Give everyone what you owe him :
If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honor , then honor .
NIV
Lawmakers in the government are to enforce biblical teachings
- Deuteronomy 17:18 -19 :
When he takes the throne of his kingdom , he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law , taken from that of the Levitical priests .
19
It is to be with him , and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees NIV
Religious workers should not have to pay taxes
- Ezra 7:24 :
You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes , tribute or duty on any of the priests , Levites , musicians , gatekeepers , temple servants or other workers at this house of God. NIV
Money and Wealth
You can not be in debt to anyone
- Romans 13:8 :
Let no debt remain outstanding , except the continuing debt to love one another , for he who loves his fellow - man has fulfilled the law .
( NIV )
When you do good deeds , do not take credit for them
- Matthew 6:2,4 :
Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men .
Verily I say unto you ,
They have their reward .
That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
Do not collect material treasures
- Matthew 6:19 - 20 :
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal
You cannot love God and money
- Matthew 6:24 :
" No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and despise the other .
You cannot serve God and wealth .
NASB
All debts must be canceled after seven years
- Deuteronomy 15:1 :
" At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts . "
Getting into heaven
We are judged by our works
- Corinthians 5:10 :
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad
We are not judged by our works , only our faith
- Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : Not of works , lest any man should boast . :

For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake .
He that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
You are not welcome in heaven if you drink , are " sexually immoral " , worship idols , are a male prostitute , steal , are greedy , drunk , slander or cheat people
- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 :

God does not like male genital problems
- Deuteronomy 23:1 :
No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the Lord .

Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
- Psalms 49:12-15 :
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not : he is like the beasts that perish .
This their way is their folly : yet their posterity approve their sayings .
Selah .
Like sheep they are laid in the grave ; death shall feed on them ; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning ; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling .
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave : for he shall receive me .
Work and the Sabbath
Work on Sunday , even pick up some sticks , and you should be stoned to death !
- Numbers 15:32-35 :
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day .
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron , and unto all the congregation .

And the LORD said unto Moses ,
The man shall be surely put to death : all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp .
- Exodus 35:2 :
Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sabbath of rest to the LORD : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death .
Not only are you not allowed to work on the sabbath , but you cannot cause anyone , servant nor animal to work
- Deuteronomy 5:14 :
the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God ; in it you shall not do any work , you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you , so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you .

Lust
Engage in a male homosexuality and you 'll be put to death
- Leviticus 20:13 :
If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable .

Even looking is an abomination .
- Matthew 5:28 :
But I say unto you ,
That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
Sleep with a woman on her period and you both shall be banished from the community
- Leviticus 20:18 :
" If a man lies with a woman during her sickness and uncovers her nakedness , he has discovered her flow , and she has uncovered the flow of her blood .
Both of them shall be cut off from her people . "
No masturbation , or even pulling out during sex
The bible god has zero tolerance for people who engage in sex outside the objective of procreation .
- Genesis 38:9-10 :
Onan knew that the offspring would not be his ; so when he went in to his brother ’s wife , he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother .
But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord ; so He took his life also .
Marriage
If your wife is not a virgin at the time of her marriage , she 's a whore and must be stoned to death
- Deuteronomy 22:13-21 :
If any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her , And give occasions of speech against her , and bring up an evil name upon her , and say , I took this woman , and when I came to her , I found her not a maid :
Then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate :
And the damsel 's father shall say unto the elders , I gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
And , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity .
And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him ;
And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel : and she shall be his wife ; he may not put her away all his days .
But if this thing be true , and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel :
Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father 's house , and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die : because she hath wrought folly in Israel , to play the whore in her father 's house : so shalt thou put evil away from among you .

- Mark 10:6-9 :
But at the beginning of creation God made them male and female .
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh . '
So they are no longer two , but one .
Therefore what God has joined together , let man not separate .
NIV

NIV

NIV
Bastard children and their decendants burn in hell
The bible makes it quite clear that children born out of wedlock cannot get into heaven , and neither can the next ten generations of their progeny .
Have you looked at your family tree ?

" A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation . "
A married man must take a year off from work

- Ephesians 5:22 - 24 :
Wives , submit to your husbands as to the Lord .
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church , his body , of which he is the Savior .
Now as the church submits to Christ , so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything .
The only legitimate reason for a divorce is if your wife was n't a virgin
Added bonus : if you marry a divorced woman who was n't a virgin , you also commit adultery .
- Matthew 5:31 :
But I say unto you ,
That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .

Personal Grooming

- Leviticus 19:19 :

http://freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/Bible_rules
Do not trim hair at the sides , sideburns or beards
- Leviticus 19:27 :
" Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard . "
Smoothliness is next to godliness , no hairy underarms or pubes
If your woman exposes herself , she should be shaved .
I guess a ' Brazillion ' is not out of the question !
- 1 Cor 11:6 :
For if a woman is not covered , let her also be shorn .
And remember , there is nothing more evil than .. stubble !

Dietary Laws
You cannot consume any type of Blood
Jehova 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because of the Bible
- Leviticus 17:10 :
And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
A fundamental doctrine of the Jehovah ’s Witnesses teaches that the Bible prohibits consumption , storage and transfusion of blood , including in cases of emergency .
This doctrine was introduced in 1945 .
In 1964 , Jehovah ’s Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for pets , from using fertilizer containing blood , and were even encouraged to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood - free .
Later that year , Jehovah ’s Witnesses doctors and nurses were instructed to withhold blood transfusions from fellow Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
No pork
- Leviticus 11:8 :
You shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their carcasses ; they are unclean to you .

- Leviticus 19:19 :
Ye shall keep my statutes .
Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed : neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee .

- Genesis 9:3 :
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
Women 's Rights ( or lack - thereof )
Woman was created to serve man

For the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
Women are not allowed to speak in church
- I Corinthians 14:34-35 :
Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .

Women must dress modestly and discreetly , with plain hair and no fancy jewelry
- 1 Timothly 2:9 :
Likewise , I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing , modestly and discreetly , not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments .

- Leviticus 27:1-7 :
" And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation .
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old , even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary .
And if it be a female , then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels .
And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
And if it be from a month old even unto five years old , then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver , and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver .
And if it be from sixty years old and above ; if it be a male , then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels , and for the female ten shekels . "
Women are considered property
- Exodus 20:17 :
" Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour 's wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour 's . "
Women are twice as unclean as men
- Leviticus 12:1-5 :
And the Lord spake unto Moses , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be unclean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean ...
But if she bear a maid child , then she shall be unclean two weeks ...
Family Values , Obedience , Submission & Control
Want to be Jesus ' disciple ?
Hate yourself and your family .
- Luke 14:26 :
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father , mother , wife , children , brothers , and sisters , as well as his own life , he can't be my disciple .
It 's OK to sell your daughter into slavery
- Exodus 21:7 :
If a man sells his daughter as a female slave , she is not to go free as the male slaves do NASB
Resist God and be damned
Christians have cited numerous bible references to justify various types of conquest and control over others .
If you " resisteth " God 's messengers , you get what you deserve :
- Romans 13:2 :
" Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation . "
God says take what you want from heathens
Ask God and he 'll give you whatever you want from the " heathens " - God says it 's your inheritance :
- Psalms 2:8 :
" Ask of me , and I shall give thee , the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession . "
God does n't care if you 're a slave : Being " born again " does not release the shackles of slavery to man
- 1 Corinthians 7:21 - 24 :
Were you a slave when you were called ?
Do n't let it trouble you — although if you can gain your freedom , do so .
For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord 's freedman ; similarly , he who was a free man when he was called is Christ 's slave .
You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of men .
Brothers , each man , as responsible to God , should remain in the situation God called him to .
NIV
Common sense
The bible is not open to interpretation
- 2 Peter 1:20 - 21 :
Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake [ as they were ] moved by the Holy Ghost .
KJV
You should not think
God does not want you to think , because if you use your brain , you might realize not everything is in absolutes : good / evil , black / white .
Anything other than yes / no is evil .
- Matthew 5:36 -37 :
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
Abandon Childish Ways
Interestingly enough , it could be argued the bible refutes its own arbitrary authority in many ways , including this passage :
- 1 Corinthians 13:11 :
When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child .
When I became a man , I put childish ways behind me .
Prophesy
Jesus will return during the lives of the prophets :
Jesus makes it quite clear ..
he will return during the lives of the writers of the Gospels :
- Matthew 24:34 :
Verily I say unto you ,
This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
- Luke 21:32 :
Verily I say unto you ,
This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
Jesus will return and anyone who offends him will be burned alive
- Matthew 13:41 - 42 :
The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
You are not allowed to consult with psychics
- Leviticus 19:31 :
Do not turn to mediums or spiritists ; do not seek them out to be defiled by them .
I am the Lord your God .
- Leviticus 20:6 :
As for the person who turns to mediums and to spiritists , to play the harlot after them , I will also set My face against that person and will cut him off from among his people .
Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked John McCain if he regretted helping the deregulation of Wall Street back in 1999 and McCain said no because it helped grow our economy to where it is today .
Yes , that 's his story and he 's sticking to it .
It helped out economy so much that President Paulson is asking for 700 billion dollars with no strings attached to save McCain 's economy that is a step away from turning into another great Depression .
Is he kidding me ?
We have another Enron type scandal on our hands in the financial markets only this scandal is on Super steroids .
Paul Krugman shares a few thoughts with on us ...

Pelley :
In 1999 you were one of the senators who helped pass deregulation of Wall Street .
Do you regret that now ?
McCain :
No , I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy .
McCain has been an advocate of deregulation most of his career , but Thursday he endorsed the biggest bailout in history - a plan for the government to take on the bad debts of financial institutions .
" We 're gonna take over these bad loans .
We 're gonna take over these bad - these bonds and we 're gonna keep you alive .
And we 're gonna have the taxpayer help you out .
But when the time comes and the economy recovers then anything that 's gained back is gonna go to the taxpayers first .
I 'm not saying this is n't gonna be messy .
And I 'm not saying it is n't gonna be expensive .
But we have to stop the bleeding , " the senator said .
Pelley : But why would you let the Wall Street executives ...
McCain : I 'm not .
Pelley : ... sail away on their yachts and leave this on the American taxpayer ?
McCain :
Well , it 's not the greedy Wall Street people that I worry about , although I am , like most Americans , frankly , enraged .
It 's basically a Ponzi scheme , as you know , that sooner or later was gonna collapse .
And I 'd like to get that money back from them .
But we 've gotta fix the average citizen who 's the innocent bystander that is in danger of losing their pensions , their 401 ( k ) 's , their IRAs .
Their very life savings are at risk here .
He does n't worry about the greedy Wall Street people .
They had nothing to do with it in McCain 's mind .
They did it because it was raining one day and they got a little bored .

Three Great Social Contractarians : Hobbes , Locke , and … Blackbeard ?
A Guest Post
Peter Leeson , the BB&T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at George Mason University and author of the forthcoming book “ The Invisible Hook : The Hidden Economics of Pirates , ” blogged here earlier this week about U.F.O. ’s and dominoes .
This is his final post .
We ’ve all heard the idea of the social contract before .
This is the notion of government as the product of a grand , unanimous agreement between society ’s members that brings political authority into existence .
In school , we read the great social contract theorists : Thomas Hobbes , John Locke , and Jean - Jacques Rousseau .
And then we ’re told that none of it ’s really true .
No society literally created its government through a genuine social contract , conventional wisdom goes .
That would require every member of society to voluntarily agree to such a contract ’s terms and to express consent explicitly through their signatures .
Even America ’s founding , which involved a written “ agreement ” of sorts , fails this test .
Only a few members of American society actually signed the Constitution , and some disagreed with it but were stuck with its terms nonetheless .
The social contract might be an important analytical device for evaluating government ’s legitimacy .
But , taken literally anyway , it ’s a myth .
The social contract may be mythical when it comes to societies of honest individuals .
But recent research suggests it ’s very real when it comes to some societies of rogues .
Eighteenth - century pirate society had a genuine social contract at its foundation , a unanimous social agreement that created the pirates ’ constitutional democracy .
Pirates ’ floating societies were forged without government to create government and used actual written contracts — “ pirate codes ” — to do so .
Pirates were n’t the only rogue societies to forge their “ governments ” via literal social contracts .
David Skarbek shows that a contemporary California - based prison gang , La Nuestra Familia , has similar social contract foundations , and a recent discovery suggests the Mafia may have a social contract at its base as well .
Could murderers and thieves be more familiar with Hobbes , Locke , and Rousseau than honest citizens ?
Probably not .
But criminal societies emerge with very different purposes than regular ones ; these differences may account for why Blackbeard ’s “ government ” was a more faithful representation of a true social contract than the U.S. government is .
Rogue societies ’ criminality puts social harmony at a premium .
Since any disgruntled member of a criminal society could turn on his comrades and inform authorities of their skullduggery , leading to their capture and punishment , it ’s critical to make sure everyone is happy .
This means ensuring everyone is pleased to live under society ’s rules and is satisfied with the people who administer those rules .
A social contract , which secures citizens ’ unanimous agreement to political rules at the outset and enshrines this agreement in writing , helps to secure such harmony .
In contrast , societies formed without criminal intent do n’t confront this problem .
In “ regular ” societies , a disgruntled citizen can’t bring down the rest of us by tattling to outside authorities .
Here , then , securing every citizen ’s agreement to political authority through universal social agreement is less critical .
Of course , there are other important factors that influence criminal vs. “ regular ” societies ’ reliance on genuine social contracts .
But the difference between their criminality appears to be an important one .
And , as my forthcoming book The Invisible Hook : The Hidden Economics of Pirates discusses , criminality , perhaps unexpectedly , seems to favor governments based on true social agreement .
What can criminal consent teach us about American government ?
A few things , actually .
First , society works best where the need for policemen is least .
Precisely because in self - regulating societies individuals regulate themselves , these societies can afford more freedom and the benefits that come with it .
But self regulation is only possible where most citizens agree with the rules that govern them .
The key , then , is to increase the extent of social agreement underlying the rules that govern society .
There are two ways to do this .
The first way is to try and build greater agreement over the existing range of issues we decide socially ( i.e. , in the public sphere ) .
That seems unlikely , though , if for no other reason than Americans are as diverse in their beliefs and preferences as they come .
The second way is to be more modest about the range of issues we seek social consensus on in the first place .
Most of us agree that murder , for instance , should be prohibited .
Making this decision through the political process is unlikely to undermine social agreement .
But there ’s much greater variation in Americans ’ thinking about , say , what schools should teach fifth graders about sex , whether trans - fats pose an unreasonable risk to one ’s health , and whether Andres Serrano produces provocative art or sacrilegious smut .
By depoliticizing decisions — making more of them private choices instead of public ones — we can strengthen the consensual basis of American government , and hopefully enhance social agreement over the rules we have .
The neoconservative author of an anti-Barack Obama book was detained and ordered out of Kenya on Tuesday night for not having a proper work permit , said Kenyan officials .
Jerome Corsi , who wrote " Obama Nation : Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality , " had planned to launch his far - right tract in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Tuesday .
However , immigration officials intercepted him as he arrived at a luxury hotel where the launch event was due to take place .
This is the second time Dr. Corsi has been involved in an effort to question the credentials of the Democratic presidential candidate .
The episode also underscores the depth of support for Senator Obama in Kenya .
His book has angered many ordinary Kenyans who view Obama – the son of a Kenyan goat herder who grew up to become a government economist – as a hero .
It questions Obama 's fitness to hold office , rakes over his family history , and explores alleged links with the Kenyan prime minister , Raila Odinga .
" We are going to leave for London tonight , " said Corsi 's assistant , Tim Bueler , on Tuesday afternoon .
" Our passports and visas are in order but it seems the Kenyan authorities have lost our arrival cards , which we filled in on the plane coming here , " he said .
" So we will leave while they complete their investigations , but have been told we can return . "
As well as launching his book , Corsi planned to visit Obama 's half - brother George , who was recently found to be living in squalid conditions in a Nairobi slum .
Corsi , who wrote " Unfit for Command " in 2004 as part of an attempt to malign John Kerry 's Vietnam record , said he had a check for $ 1,000 to give to George .
The writer has been in Kenya since last Thursday .
But it seems the Kenyan authorities woke up to his presence on Tuesday morning when local newspapers advertised the book launch .
The Standard , a Kenyan newspaper , quoted a press release saying : " Dr. Corsi will also expose details of deep secret ties between US presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama and a section of Kenya government leaders , their connection to certain sectoral groups in Kenya and subsequent plot to be executed in Kenya should Sen Obama win the American presidency . "
Obama has ancestral roots in the Luo tribe of Western Kenya , as does Mr. Odinga .
Raila narrowly lost December 's presidential election which was marred by widespread vote rigging .
His defeat prompted widespread violence which left some 1,500 dead .
It ended only with a power - sharing deal that promoted Odinga to the new position of prime minister .
Obama is deeply popular in Kenya , where he is seen as a political hero , untainted by the corruption and sleaze that dog homegrown politicians here .
He has attracted broad support that overcomes traditional tribal divisions .
Corsi's book alleges that Obama was raised as a Muslim , a false rumor .
A Christian who attended the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , Obama 's campaign has dissected the book on their website FightTheSmears.com .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Washington Mutual Inc WM.N was downgraded to below investment - grade status by Moody 's Investors Service , after the largest U.S. savings and loan projected a $ 4.5 billion third - quarter increase in reserves for bad loans but said it has more than enough capital .
Moody ’s cut the Seattle - based thrift ’s senior unsecured debt rating two notches to “ Ba2 , ” its second - highest “ junk ” grade , from “ Baa3 , ” with a “ negative ” outlook .
It also lowered its rating for the banking unit to “ Baa3 ” from “ Baa2 . ”
“ Washington Mutual ’s access to the debt and equity markets remains severely constrained , ” Craig Emrick , a Moody ’s senior credit officer , said in an interview .
He added , though , that “ there are no significant ratings triggers from a downgrade like this , because Washington Mutual is not reliant on wholesale short - term funding . ”
Shares of the thrift rose 20 cents to $ 3.03 after - hours but gave back some gains following Moody ’s downgrade .
The shares rose 51 cents , or 22 percent , in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange , after touching an 18 - year low of $ 1.75 .
Investors are worried that Chief Executive Alan Fishman , who replaced the ousted Kerry Killinger this week , might fail to raise sufficient capital to cover mortgage losses that the thrift has said could reach $ 19 billion through 2011 .
Washington Mutual said it expected the third - quarter increase in loss reserves to decline from $ 5.9 billion in the second quarter , when its overall net loss was $ 3.33 billion .
It also said it expects net charge - offs , or loans it does not expect to be paid back , to be roughly $ 2.7 billion in the third quarter , up from the second quarter ’s $ 2.17 billion .
In a statement , the thrift called the Moody ’s downgrade “ inconsistent ” with its finances , but said it does not expect a “ material ” impact on borrowings , collateral or margin requirements , or to suspend dividends on its preferred stock .
It also said it has $ 50 billion of liquidity from “ reliable funding sources , ” and expects capital to remain “ significantly above ” regulatory minimums for “ well - capitalized ” lenders .
Fitch Ratings on Thursday cut its credit rating to “ BBB - minus , ” the same level as Standard & Poor ’s , and those agencies ’ lowest investment grades .
The thrift expects to report full results on Oct. 22 .
About $ 3.4 billion of the reserve increase is expected to come from residential mortgages .
Credit card reserves would rise by $ 600 million from the second quarter as the thrift moves securitizations back onto its balance sheet , not because credit quality is deteriorating , a spokesman said .
Fishman is a former chief operating officer of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N and chief executive of Brooklyn , New York 's Independence Community Bank Corp .
Washington Mutual said it will take a charge for losses on $ 282 million of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.
N preferred stock it owns .
It also may take a non-cash goodwill write - down to reflect the lower value of various assets .
Non-interest income is expected to be about $ 1 billion , up from $ 561 million in the second quarter , reflecting growth in deposit and retail banking fees .
Investors remain worried about the thrift ’s capital even after Washington Mutual raised $ 7 billion this year from investors led by private equity firm TPG Inc [ TPG.UL ] .
“ Unfortunately , their options have narrowed significantly , even over the past two days , ” Sean Egan , manager of the ratings desk at Egan - Jones Ratings Co , said in an interview .
He said the thrift may need to raise well over $ 10 billion .
TPG spokesman Owen Blicksilver declined to comment .
Earlier this week , Washington Mutual said its main regulator , the Office of Thrift Supervision , had stepped up its oversight into how the thrift manages risk .
OTS spokesman William Ruberry said the agency is monitoring the situation .
Separately , in a regulatory filing , Washington Mutual said it awarded Fishman a $ 1 million annual salary , a $ 7.5 million signing bonus , stock options and restricted stock , as well as eligibility for performance - based bonuses and incentives .

Exit Tax for U.S. Expatriates Becomes Law
New rules impose tax on expatriates and withholding requirements on trustees
Giving up a U.S. passport can carry a steep price tag .
A new law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by the President will subject certain individuals , who expatriate or give up their green cards , to immediate tax on the inherent gain on all of their worldwide assets and a tax on future gifts or bequests made to a U.S. citizen or resident .
As more and more people vote with their feet , the U.S. Congress repeatedly threatened to enact legislation aimed at U.S. citizens who expatriate .
Congress finally made good on those threats by unanimously passing the Heroes Earning Assistance and Relief Tax ( HEART )
Act ( the ‘ Act ' ) , which provides tax relief for active duty military personnel and reservists .
The new tax regime applies to certain individuals who relinquish their US citizenship and certain long - term U.S. residents ( i.e. , green card holders ) who terminate their U.S. residence ( hereafter referred to as ‘ expatriates ' ) .
The so - called ‘ mark - to - market ' tax will apply to the net unrealized gain on the expatriate 's worldwide assets as if such property were sold ( the ‘ deemed sale ' ) for its fair market value on the day before the expatriation date .
Any net gain on this deemed sale in excess of US $ 600,000 will be taxable .
In addition , trustees of non-grantor trusts must withhold and pay over to the IRS 30 percent of the portion of any distribution ( whether direct or indirect ) that would have been taxable to the expatriate had he not expatriated .
Failure to withhold the tax could subject the trustee to direct liability for the unpaid U.S. tax .
The Act became law on 18 June , 2008 .
Individuals Covered
The Act applies to any expatriate if that individual ( i ) has a net worth of US $ 2 million or more ; ( ii ) has an average net U.S. income tax liability of greater than US $ 139,000 for the five year period prior to expatriation ; or ( iii ) fails to certify that he has complied with all U.S. federal tax obligations for the preceding five years ( the ‘ covered expatriate ' ) .
The Act contains two exceptions , which are broader than those contained in current law .
An individual is not a ‘ covered expatriate ' if he certifies compliance with US federal tax obligations as specified in item ( iii ) above , and : ( i ) he was at birth a citizen of the U.S. and another country , provided that ( a ) as of the expatriation he continues to be a citizen of , and a tax resident of , such other country , and ( b ) he has been a resident of the U.S. for no more than 10 of the 15 taxable years ending with the taxable year of expatriation ; or ( ii ) he relinquished U.S. citizenship before reaching the age of 18 ½ , provided that he was a resident of the U.S. for not more than 10 taxable years before relinquishment .
In General
The Act consists of three key elements :
1 . The mark - to - market tax on the covered expatriate 's worldwide assets ;
2 . A tax on certain gifts and bequests made by the covered expatriate to any US person ; and
3 . A repeal of the current so - called 10 - year shadow period for covered expatriates .
The Mark - to - Market Tax
As noted above , the mark - to - market tax will apply to the net unrealized gain on the covered expatriate 's worldwide assets as if such property were sold for its fair market value on the day before the expatriation date to the extent that the net gain exceeds US $ 600,000 .
However , the mark - to - market tax will not apply to ( i ) certain deferred compensation items ; ( ii ) certain specified tax deferred accounts ; or ( iii ) any interest in a nongrantor trust .
A. Deferred Compensation Items
Under the Act , certain deferred compensation items will be subject to the mark - to - market tax .
For purposes of this calculation , the covered expatriate is deemed to receive the present value of his accrued benefit on the day before the expatriation date .
No early distribution excise tax applies by virtue of this treatment , and appropriate adjustments must be made to subsequent distributions from the plan to reflect such treatment .
Other qualifying deferred compensation items will not be subject to the mark - to - market tax ; however , the payor must deduct and withhold a tax of 30 percent from any taxable payment to a covered expatriate .
A taxable payment is subject to withholding to the extent it would be included in the gross income of the covered expatriate if such person were a U.S. citizen or resident .
B. Specified Tax Deferred Accounts
Under the Act , the mark - to - market tax will apply to certain specified tax deferred accounts .
In the case of any interest in a specified account held by a covered expatriate on the day before the expatriation date , the expatriate is deemed to receive a distribution of his entire interest in the account on that date .
Appropriate adjustments are made for subsequent distributions to take into account this treatment .
Such deemed distributions are not subject to additional tax .
C. Interests in Non-Grantor Trusts
The Act makes a distinction between grantor trusts and non-grantor trusts .
A grantor trust is ignored as a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes .
The ‘ owner ' of a grantor trust must include in computing his personal tax liability the items of income , deduction and credit that are attributable to the trust .
Therefore , in the case of the portion of any trust for which the covered expatriate is treated as the owner under the grantor trust provisions , the assets held by that portion of the trust are subject to the mark - to - market tax .
The mark - to - market tax does not generally apply to non-grantor trusts .
Rather , in the case of any direct or indirect distribution from the trust to a covered expatriate , the trustee must deduct and withhold an amount equal to 30 percent of the distribution portion that would be includable in the gross income of the covered expatriate if he were subject to U.S. income tax .
The covered expatriate waives any right to claim a reduction in withholding under any treaty with the U.S.
The Act does not explain how the withholding will be enforced against a non-U.S. trustee of a trust .
In addition , if the non-grantor trust distributes appreciated property to a covered expatriate , the trust recognizes gain as if the property were sold to the expatriate at its fair market value .
If a non-grantor trust becomes a grantor trust of which the covered expatriate is treated as the owner , such conversion is treated as a distribution to the covered expatriate and will trigger the 30 percent withholding tax .
Conversely , if a grantor trust becomes a non-grantor trust after the individual expatriates , it appears that the mark - to - market tax will apply to assets in the grantor trust , and the 30 percent withholding requirement will not apply to the trust once it becomes a non-grantor trust .
This is an important point because the grantor 's expatriation commonly converts grantor trusts into non-grantor trusts .
Tax on Gifts and Bequests to U.S. Citizens or Residents
The Act taxes certain ‘ covered gifts or bequests ' received by a U.S. citizen or resident .
The tax , which is assessed at the highest marginal estate or gift tax rate at the time of the gift or bequest , applies only to the extent that the covered gift or bequest exceeds $ 12,000 during any calendar year .
The tax is reduced by the amount of any gift or estate tax paid to a foreign country with respect to such covered gift or bequest .
No allowance appears to exist for the $ 1 million exemption from U.S. gift tax or the $ 2 million exemption from U.S. estate tax normally granted to U.S. persons .
Gifts or bequests made to a U.S. spouse or a qualified charity are not subject to the tax .
In the case of a covered gift or bequest made to a U.S. trust , the tax applies as if the trust were a U.S. citizen , and the trust is required to pay the tax .
In the case of a covered gift or bequest made to a foreign trust , the tax applies to any distribution , whether from income or corpus , made from such trust to a recipient that is a U.S. citizen or resident in the same manner as if such distribution were a covered gift or bequest .
Repeal of 10 - Year Shadow Period
Current law subjects expatriates to a so - called 10 - year shadow period , which results in a covered expatriate being taxed as a U.S. citizen in any of the 10 years following expatriation in which the expatriate spends 30 days in more in the U.S.
In addition , current law taxes expatriates on all U.S. source income and gain during the shadow period .
Under the Act , individuals who expatriate on or after the date of enactment will not be subject to the shadow period but will instead be subject to the mark - to - market tax and the tax on gifts and bequests to U.S. citizens and residents .
Effective date
The Act will be effective as of the date of enactment and will therefore not apply to those individuals who expatriate prior to its enactment .
Enactment occurs upon the signature of the President or 10 days after the Act is presented to the President if he does not veto it .
The White House has not issued an official position on the Act , but given the veto - proof margin by which the Act passed in both houses of Congress and the Act 's emphasis on active duty members of the military , most commentators believe that enactment is imminent .
Conclusion
In light of the Act , individuals who are considering expatriation should consider the substantial new tax burdens that this action will generate .
Those persons who expatriate after the enactment date and who are considering making gifts or bequests to U.S. persons in the future should also review their planning .
In addition , trustees should very carefully consider whether trust beneficiaries are covered expatriates before making any distribution without withholding U.S. tax .
Trustees who fail to become familiar with the new rules do so at their peril .
For purposes of the Act , an individual is treated as having relinquished his citizenship on the earliest of four possible dates : ( i ) the date on which he renounces his U.S. nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the U.S. ; ( ii ) the date on which he furnishes to the U.S. Department of State a signed statement of voluntary relinquishment of U.S. nationality confirming the performance of an expatriating act ; ( iii ) the date on which the U.S. Department of State issues a certificate of loss of nationality ; or ( iv ) the date on which a U.S. court cancels a naturalized citizen 's certificate of naturalization .
The term ‘ long - term resident ' means any individual ( other than a U.S. citizen ) who is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. in at least eight taxable years during the period of 15 taxable years ending with the taxable years during which he ceases to be a lawful permanent resident or commences to be treated as a resident of a foreign country .
The definition of ‘ non - grantor trust ' includes both U.S. and non-U.S. non-grantor trusts .
An individual may elect to defer payment of the tax imposed on the deemed sale of property until the return is due for the taxable year in which he disposes of such property , but interest will apply for the period during which the tax is deferred .
This irrevocable election is made on a property - by - property basis and requires the individual to provide adequate security with respect to such property and a waiver of treaty rights that would preclude the assessment or collection of the tax .
Under certain circumstances , the mark - to - market tax may arguably apply to non-grantor trusts ( i.e. , where the non-grantor trust holds shares in a passive foreign investment company ) .
Defined as any property acquired ( i ) by gift directly or indirectly from an individual who was a covered expatriate at the time of such acquisition ; or ( ii ) directly or indirectly by reason of the death of an individual who was a covered expatriate .
The definition excludes ( i ) any property shown as a taxable gift on a timely filed gift tax return by the covered expatriate , and ( ii ) any property included in the gross estate of the covered expatriate for U.S. estate tax purposes and shown on a timely filed estate tax return of the estate of the covered expatriate .

Jerry Yang , after a tumultuous reign as the chief executive officer of Yahoo ( s YHOO ) , the company he co-founded with David Filo , announced today that he is stepping down from the top slot .
The news was first reported by Kara Swisher and later confirmed by Yahoo in a press release .
He is going to make way for someone else , but will stay on the board of Yahoo and will be known as Chief Yahoo .
More important , however , is the question of what Yahoo needs to do in order for Jerry to hang on to the title of Chief Yahoo !
Yang ’s decision to move on is n’t a surprise – it was clear from his talk at a recent industry conference that he was tired and perhaps a little out of his depth .
His choice to head the company that was looking down a deep abyss a while back was an ineffectual one , and a total and absolute failure on the part of Yahoo ’s board of directors .
In June 2008 , I wrote about the systematic rot inside the company .
What has n’t been discussed is that the company is n’t really facing up to the fact that its layers of management have resulted in a state of masterful inactivity , masked perhaps as a culture of consensus .
This starts at the top – from the company ’s board and senior management down to VP level where people are prone to organizing and attending twenty meetings before deciding the fate of a project .
Some senior managers including the ones who are deserting the company are skillful players in this game of hiding ennui behind grandiose plans and a great future that never happens .
Yang was never able to address these core issues .
He is n’t the inspirational tyrant ( like Steve Jobs ) who can save the company he co-founded .
And because he ’s a nice guy , he has failed to make the hard decisions needed in order to save the company .
Even as an inspirational leader , he could n’t bring a sense of single purpose to the company , which at times reminds me of the last days of the great Mughal empire .
With Yang gone , and the company actively seeking his replacement , the big question is what should Yahoo do next and whom should they hire to replace him ?
Kara Swisher has a lot of names on her short list , though I do n’t think any one of them will prove to be Yahoo ’s knight in shining armor .
( You can play the Next Yahoo CEO game and leave your suggestions in the comments . )
Regardless of the company ’s final choice , here is what Yahoo should n’t do :
Not Hire from within , for the current senior management has proven too ineffectual and shares the blame for Yahoo ’s current misfortunes .
Hire from within , for the current senior management has proven too ineffectual and shares the blame for Yahoo ’s current misfortunes .
Sell out to Microsoft at today ’s prices .
( $ 20 a share would be something the company should seriously consider . )
Merge with AOL , for that would be like tying together two bricks with a spider web and hoping that they will float .
What it should do :
Look outside for someone with spark .
Replace the current senior team with executives .
Refocus
Yahoo on the very qualities that made it great – building technology products for the common people .
Focus its energies on Yahoo News , Yahoo Sports , My Yahoo , Yahoo Mail , Flickr , Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Search , as well as Yahoo ’s e-commerce platform .
Keep building on its Mobile offerings , for this is one area where its independence can help it win friends amongst operators who are worried about Google ( s goog ) , Microsoft ( s msft ) and Apple ( s aapl ) .
Yahoo ’s ad - serving platform needs to become more real - time , with a drastic improvement in customer service .
These are tough choices for Yahoo , but these are also desperate times .
And while it might sound crazy , it is time for Yahoo to start entertaining the idea of going private — at today ’s stock price that should cost about $ 15 billion , though it might take more than that to get the deal done .
Technology - oriented guys like Roger McNamee could be good private investors because they would ensure that the dollars - and - cents approach does n’t stall Yahoo ’s innovation engine .
Hopefully they will bring on a no- nonsense , [ HP CEO ]
Mark Hurd - style executive who can stabilize and revive the company by making it leaner , simpler and have it focus on its core competencies .
For PE investors , there is also comfort in the fact that Yahoo can at anytime sell its Asian holdings for a ton of cash .
They might be able to find some takers for their European properties as well .
Instead ,
Yahoo could take its roughly $ 6.36 billion in cash and focus solely on its core U.S. businesses , purging anything that is n’t core .
This would mean job cuts for thousands of people , but unfortunately Yahoo does n’t have much choice :
It is either that or slow , lingering , painful irrelevance .
Much as we laughed at the Peanut Butter manifesto when it was leaked to the media , the fact is that it still remains a blueprint for saving Yahoo .
All someone has to do is read it .
Update : Just after I hit publish , I got a note from UBS Investment Research ’s Internet analyst Ben Schachter , who writes ….
We expect the Board will ultimately opt for an external candidate as Decker would likely not be considered a significant enough change by investors .
The news may also indicate the Board will push for a more meaningful restructuring of YHOO .
Finally , the news will clearly reignite speculation around a potential deal w/ MSFT ( for a search - only deal or full acquisition ) as well as potential other M&A activity .
…. We still believe MSFT will eventually own YHOO .
Jerry moving out of the CEO role may accelerate this .
YHOO is a key strategic asset in the online space and given the scarcity of key players of size , we see value here not reflected in the stock ’s current valuation .
She wo n't release any medical records , and has a good chance of becoming president without ever giving a real press conference in a campaign .
Mark Salter , the literary giant most responsible for creating the McCain myth , thinks I 'm out of my " fucking mind " to ponder the story Palin has told about her fifth pregnancy .
Well , on the out of your " fucking mind " question , I wo n't get into a contest with the team that picked Sarah Palin .
But , if you have a few minutes , and think the judgment of a possible future president is worth considering , check out what no one disputes .
And make up your own mind .

Has Gordon Brown , the British prime minister , saved the world financial system ?
O.K. , the question is premature  we still do n’t know the exact shape of the planned financial rescues in Europe or for that matter the United States , let alone whether they ’ll really work .
What we do know , however , is that Mr. Brown and Alistair Darling , the chancellor of the Exchequer ( equivalent to our Treasury secretary ) , have defined the character of the worldwide rescue effort , with other wealthy nations playing catch - up .
This is an unexpected turn of events .
The British government is , after all , very much a junior partner when it comes to world economic affairs .
It ’s true that London is one of the world ’s great financial centers , but the British economy is far smaller than the U.S. economy , and the Bank of England does n’t have anything like the influence either of the Federal Reserve or of the European Central Bank .
So you do n’t expect to see Britain playing a leadership role .
But the Brown government has shown itself willing to think clearly about the financial crisis , and act quickly on its conclusions .
And this combination of clarity and decisiveness has n’t been matched by any other Western government , least of all our own .
What is the nature of the crisis ?
The details can be insanely complex , but the basics are fairly simple .
The bursting of the housing bubble has led to large losses for anyone who bought assets backed by mortgage payments ; these losses have left many financial institutions with too much debt and too little capital to provide the credit the economy needs ; troubled financial institutions have tried to meet their debts and increase their capital by selling assets , but this has driven asset prices down , reducing their capital even further .
Today , Bill Clinton was campaigning for Barack Obama in Florida .
During his speech , he mentioned a “ post turtle ” .
Not all of us are from Arkansas and may not know what a post turtle is .
Here ’s an explanation .
While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75 - year old Texas rancher whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle , the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man .
Eventually the topic got around to Sarah Palin and her bid to be a heartbeat away from being President .
The old rancher said , “ Well , ya know , Palin is a post turtle . ”
Not being familiar with the term , the doctor asked him what a post turtle was .
The old rancher said , “ When you ’re driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top , it ’s a post turtle . ”
The old rancher saw a puzzled look on the doctor ’s face , so he continued to explain .
“ You know she did n’t get up there by herself , she does n’t belong up there , she does n’t know what to do while she is up there , and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put her up there to begin with . ”

A woman campaigning for John McCain in Pittsburgh claims she was mugged by a knife - wielding man who then “ carved the letter ‘ B ’ into her face ” after spotting a McCain bumper sticker on her car , police said yesterday .
Ashley Todd , 20 , a Texas native , told police she was using a Citizens Bank ATM at about 8:55 p.m.
Wednesday when a man rushed up , put a 4 - to - 5 - inch knife to her throat and demanded money .
UPDATE : Attack ‘ Victim ’ Changes Her Story
She said she gave him $ 60 , and “ she remembers moving away from [ him ] , ” said police spokeswoman Diane Richard .
“ Then , she said , he noticed a McCain bumper sticker on her car and became very angry .
“ [ She ] reported he punched her in the back of the head , knocking her to the ground , and continued to punch and kick while threatening to teach her a lesson for being a McCain supporter . ”
Richard said the victim said the attacker called her “ a lot of names and stated that ‘ You are going to be a Barack supporter ’ , ” pinning her hands down while carving the letter B on her face “ using what she believed to be a very dull knife . ”
Pennsylvania has been a key battleground state , where McCain and Barack Obama have both been campaigning hard .
The attack lasted 5 - 10 minutes , after which the suspect fled .
Todd said she drove to a friend ’s house , cops said .
That friend called police .
When an officer offered her medical attention , Todd said she ’d go to the hospital the next day , Richard said .
Cops are treating the alleged attack with skepticism , unnamed law - enforcement sources told TMZ.com .
A source told The Post that cops were considering administering a lie - detector test .
Richard would only say the investigation was continuing .
Todd , who was being re-interviewed last night , remained inside the stationhouse early today .
“ We ca n’t substantiate that it was politically motivated , ” Richard said early today .
She said police are trying to retrieve surveillance tape from the area .
After the attack , Todd posted this message on a GOP college blog : “ Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and prayers – I ’m phonebanking , so let ’s all work together and get John McCain elected . ”
It also appears she was using Twitter – a social - messaging Internet application for wireless devices – around the time of the reported attack .
In one post , she wrote , “ Stubbornly searching for a Bank of America to avoid ATM fees , ” she said .
Shortly after , she wrote , “ Pretty sure I ’m on the wrong side of Pittsburgh . ”
McCain ’s campaign said he and Sarah Palin spoke to Todd ’s family yesterday .
Obama ’s campaign released a statement , saying , “ Our thoughts and prayers are with the young woman for her to make a speedy recovery , and we hope that the person who perpetrated this crime is swiftly apprehended and brought to justice . ”
Ethan Eilon , executive director of the College Republican National Committee , the group Todd was volunteering with , said he ’d spoken to her several times over the day .
“ She ’s recovering .
Obviously , she ’s had a pretty rough 24 hours , ” he said .

COMPLETE ELECTION 2008 COVERAGE
PALIN REVERSES COURSE ON BRIDGE CLAIM ….
Every day for two weeks voters have been told that Sarah Palin opposed the infamous Bridge to Nowhere and turned down federal funds to build it .
It was the most notable claim in Palin ’s very first speech as the VP candidate .
She ’s repeated it ad nauseum , as has John McCain and a slew of campaign surrogates and sycophants .
And yesterday , Palin decided to walk the claim back a bit .
ABC ’s Charlie Gibson , to his credit , broached the subject , explained the timeline , and noted that Palin was for the bridge before she was against it .
As Gibson put it , “ [ Y ] ou turned against it after Congress had basically pulled the plug on it ; after it became apparent that the state was going to have to pay for it , not the Congress ; and after it became a national embarrassment to the state of Alaska . ”
Palin explained , “ I was for infrastructure being built in the state .
And it ’s not inappropriate for a mayor or for a governor to request and to work with their Congress and their congressmen , their congresswomen , to plug into the federal budget along with every other state a share of the federal budget for infrastructure . ”
You know what ?
That ’s absolutely true .
If a governor wants to go to Congress , hat in hand , and ask for pork - barrel infrastructure earmarks , that ’s fine .
But here ’s the thing : Palin has spent the last two weeks insisting the exact opposite of the truth .
It ’s not “ inappropriate ” for Palin to ask for infrastructure money ; it ’s inappropriate to lie about it .
And as a practical matter , that ’s what we ’re left with —
Palin reluctantly acknowledging to a national television audience that her single favorite talking point is demonstrably false .
The anecdote that she used to help introduce herself to the nation was a lie .
The concession leads to two fairly straightforward questions .
First , will Palin apologize for having misled voters ?
And second , are there consequences for a candidate seeking national office who gets caught in this big a lie ?
Post Script : Speaking of earmarks , Gibson also inquired about Palin ’s support for millions of dollars in earmarks to study the genetics of harbor seals and the mating habits of crabs .
The governor explained that those earmark requests came through “ our research divisions and fish and game and our wildlife departments and our universities . ”
Well , sure , no one thought Palin thought them up on her own .
But is n’t this the defense that every official seeking pork - barrel earmarks makes ?
A public consultation on new nuclear power stations which was run by a company linked to the Prime Minister 's personal pollster has been criticised for breaching industry guidelines .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Environmentalists and opposition MPs denounced the exercise as " fixed " after the Market Research Standards Board said some material given to focus groups was " inaccurately or misleadingly presented " .
The Conservatives accused ministers of " gerrymandering " and attack - ed them for employing Opinion Leader to run the project , a consultancy linked to Gordon Brown 's personal pollster Deborah Mattinson .
Opinion Leader runs the Government 's citizens ' juries and was awarded almost £ 1 m of Treasury contracts when he was Chancellor .
Ms Mattinson stood down as the company 's joint chairman last year to work for Labour but remains a senior figure in its parent company .
The Market Research Standards Board said : " Information was inaccurately or misleadingly presented , or was imbalanced , which gave rise to a material risk of respondents being led towards a particular answer . "
Greenpeace denounced the consul - tation as " a sham and an insult to the people who took part " claiming it would leave the Government 's plans in disarray .
Examples included focus groups being given material colouring nuclear and renewable power green , with blue for coal oil and gas .
Opinion Leader argued that the standards board was not competent to judge its methods and insisted Ms Mattinson played no part .
The ruling was the second time the Government 's attempts to consult the public on new nuclear power stations faced criticism .
The first consultation in 2006 had to be repeated after it was condemned by the High Court .
Greg Clark , the shadow energy minister , said : " These revelations call into question for a second time the way the Government is managing its nuclear policy .
The standards watchdog for market research has decided that supposedly independent research was biased to give the answer the Government wanted . "
Steve Webb , the Liberal Democrat energy spokesman , added : " This ruling shows that the Government is n't even competent enough to rig its own consultation .
It was hardly a secret that ministers had made their decision before their first consultation on new nuclear power . "
Downing Street insisted the ruling would have no bearing on Britain 's nuclear power programme .
The Prime Minister 's official spokesman said : " The outcome of the consultation stands , whatever the view of the Market Research Standards Board . "
Viki Cooke , chief executive of Opinion Leader , said : " We do not accept the MRS ruling , which we believe to be incorrect .
We do not believe that the MRS – a market research trade body – is competent to assess these new forms of deliberative engagement .
" Opinion Leader is not anybody 's pet pollster .
It does absolutely no political work whatsoever . "
According to a Zogby / Inter - American Dialogue poll released Thursday , more than three - quarters of likely voters polled said America 's drug war is a failure .
That is a sharp contrast with current US and state drug policies .
The poll also found significant differences between US policy in the hemisphere and what respondents would like to see .
On drug policy , 76 % believe the US war on drugs is failing .
That included the vast majority of Democrats ( 86 % ) and independents ( 81 % ) and even a majority of Republicans ( 61 % ) .
Among Barack Obama supporters , 89 % agreed , and among John McCain supporters 61 % agreed .
While it is not clear that a belief that the war on drugs is failing suggests support for drug reform -- it could include those who believe it is failing because we have not tried hard enough -- it does suggest an emerging consensus that the current path is the wrong one .
When asked what was the best way to confront drug use and the international drug trade , respondents were split .
Some 27 % of likely voters said legalizing some drugs was the best approach ( Obama supporters 34 % , McCain supporters 20 % ) ; 25 % said stopping drugs at the border ( Obama supporters 12 % , McCain supporters 39 % ) ; 19 % said reducing demand through treatment and education ; and 13 % said crop eradication in source countries was the best approach .
The poll was by no means limited to drug policy .
On other hemispheric issues , it found that 60 % believe the US should revise its policies toward Cuba , 67 % support a path to citizenship for tax - paying undocumented immigrants who learn English , 46 % believe the US should seek to improve ties with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ( 10 % want to completely break relations ) , 54 % believe the US should lower tariffs on Brazilian ethanol , and 42 % believe the North American Free Trade Agreement should be revised .
" The poll results indicate that American public opinion is far more open and flexible on issues of importance for US relations with Latin America than current policy would suggest , " noted Peter Hakim , the President of the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington think tank that collaborated with Zogby International on the poll .
" It also suggests , however , that public opinion may not be all that relevant in decisions regarding policy issues of greatest concern to Latin America -- that these may be largely determined by smaller groups with intense sentiments about the issues , " he said in a press release accompanying the poll results .
" While there are significant differences between Obama and McCain supporters on most issues , the poll suggests that the general public agrees on ethanol tariffs , temporary workers , and the failure of the drug war -- these are important issues in hemispheric relations that the next US president will have an opportunity to deal with , " Hakim added .
It ai n’t Elizabeth Hasselback ( or whatever her name is ) appearing with Sarah Palin , but in my corner of the universe this is news .
The dams are breaking .
Scott McClellan , the former White House press secretary who sharply criticized President Bush in his memoir last spring , told CNN Thursday he ’s voting for Barack Obama .
“ From the very beginning I have said I am going to support the candidate that has the best chance for changing the way Washington works and getting things done and I will be voting for Barack Obama and clapping , ” McClellan told new CNN Host D.L. Hughley .
All of these big -name Republican endorsements have got to hurt .
They add to a sense of inevitability , and of despair .
It makes it harder to get volunteers for McCain ’s campaign , and even harder to drum up any last - minute donors – after 40 % of your life savings gets wiped out on the stock market , do you really want to invest in another sure loser ?
This is all very bad .
And thus very good .
Comment ANTs
Software , otherwise known simply as ANTs ( which actually stands for Asynchronous Non-preemptive Tasks ) , is little known , yet it is a public company that has been around since the 80s .
It started life working on parallel supercomputers but then faded into dormancy for the best part of a decade .
It then re-emerged in 1999 as a project to implement its MPP ( massively parallel processing ) expertise within the database field .
As a result the ANTs Data Server ( ADS ) was launched last November .
There are a number of interesting things to say about ADS .
The first is that it contradicts almost everything that I used to write about databases back in the 90s .
Then , we regularly used to castigate the likes of Sybase for being late in implementing row - level locking , which we regarded as being essential for OLTP ( on - line transaction processing ) environments .
Well , ADS not only does not implement row - level locking it promises a lock - free environment altogether .
There are a number of facilities that allow this .
First , it allows simultaneous updates to a row , provided that different fields are being updated .
Secondly , it treats separate updates to the same field ( say , adding three stock and deducting two ) as arithmetic operations where these are commutative ( that is , where operations can be performed in any sequence and produce mathematically consistent results ) .
It is only when neither of these conditions applies that the software has to resort to traditional means : serialising the process of update based on user - defined priorities .
The second interesting thing about ADS is that ANTs claims that it typically runs five to 15 times faster than standard relational databases .
The fact that it offers a lock - free environment is one reason for this .
Another is that it uses a process called " preparation by compilation " which effectively means that SQL is compiled into binary code and then held in memory , where it can be ( re -) executed as required .
A third reason for its performance advantage is that ADS treats memory as its main area for processing .
However , unlike in - memory databases such as TimesTen ( now part of Oracle ) ADS overflows to disk where necessary .
Finally , a fourth reason is that ADS creates multiple threads when it is started but it never closes them - keeping them open and re-assigning them as needed , thus saving the overhead of starting up threads .
The third interesting thing about ADS is that its superior performance does not seem to have compromised scalability .
For example , Nextel , one of its customers , is processing 10 million transactions per day using ADS .
The fourth interesting thing about ADS is that as standard it comes with support for Oracle schemas , stored procedures ( PL / SQL ) , triggers and so on .
In principle , you can take an Oracle database with all of its logic and implement it , without change , on ADS .
What 's more , this facility is not limited to Oracle but also applies to Sybase and SQL Server with support for Transact - SQL and T - SQL .
In the next two releases , due before Christmas , this support will be extended to other well - known databases .
The last sentence may raise some eyebrows : two releases before Christmas !
ANTs makes a big play of its combined R&D and QA capabilities .
It has 500 + servers in its data centre and all new code is checked in and quality tested hourly .
Typically , it claims to do 3,000 hours of automated QA testing every day , across all supported platforms ( 11 of them ) - so that 's why it reckons to be able to turn out new releases so quickly .
Finally , there is one more interesting thing about ADS : it is less expensive than any of the products it is aiming to replace .
In fact , the company is not solely aiming at the replacement market but it is also addressing the high performance OLTP market in its own right , as well as the SMB sector .
In this last case , its entry - level pricing is $ 1,995 per server per year for a maximum of 2 CPUs ( which may be dual core ) including , where appropriate , some migration services .
To conclude , ANTs may still be a strange name for a database company but it has a product that it is certainly worth watching .
